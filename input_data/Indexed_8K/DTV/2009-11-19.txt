Waiver of Restrictions
 
(i)            The Board may, in its sole discretion, waive the restrictions set forth in Section 4.9(b) with respect to a particular Transfer of shares of Equity Stock or a particular Non-Transfer Event in the event of an inadvertent violation of the provisions thereof by any Person, so long as such waiver is conditioned upon such Person promptly disposing (and such Person does in fact promptly dispose) of a sufficient number of shares of Equity Stock such that any such violation ceases to exist.
 
(ii)           Notwithstanding Section 4.9(b), any transfer of shares of Equity Stock by the Corporation to any Person, or by any Person to the Corporation, shall not constitute a Transfer or a Non-Transfer Event that is subject to the terms of Section 4.9(b).
 
(d)   If the Corporation, or its designees, shall at any time determine in good faith that a Transfer has taken place that triggers the automatic transfer provisions of Section 4.9(b) above or that a Person intends to acquire or has attempted to acquire, directly or indirectly, any shares of Equity Stock, which, if completed, would trigger the automatic transfer provisions of Section 4.9(b) above, the Corporation shall, and shall cause its agents to, take such action as it deems advisable to refuse to give effect to or to prevent such Transfer or acquisition, including, but not limited to, refusing to give effect to such Transfer on the stock transfer books of the Corporation or instituting proceedings to enjoin such Transfer or acquisition, but the failure to take any such action shall not affect the automatic transfer to a Trust in accordance with Section 4.9(f) below.
Remedies for Breach.
 
(e)   Any Person who acquires or attempts to acquire shares of Equity Stock, which, if such acquisition were completed, would trigger the automatic transfer provisions of Section 4.9(b) above, or any Person who owned shares of Equity Stock that were transferred to a Trust pursuant to Section 4.9(f) below, shall immediately give written notice to the Corporation of such event and shall provide to the Corporation such other information as the Corporation may request in order to determine the effect, if any, of such Transfer or Non-Transfer Event on the tax-free status of the Split-Off. In the event that a Person determines that Equity Stock has been acquired, and such acquisition would trigger the automatic transfer provisions of Section 4.9(b) above, such Person shall immediately give written notice to the Corporation of such acquisition and shall provide to the Corporation such other information as the Corporation may request in order to determine the effect, if any, of such acquisition on the tax-free status of the Split-Off.
Notice of Restricted Transfer.
 
(f)   Upon the DIRECTV Effective Time, the Corporation shall create, or cause to be created, a Trust, and the audit committee of the Board shall designate a Trustee. Upon any purported Transfer or Non-Transfer Event that results in the transfer of Excess Shares to a Trust pursuant to Section 4.9(b) above, (i) the Corporation shall name a Beneficiary of the Trust and (ii) such Excess Shares, which shall have been automatically transferred to such Trust pursuant to Section 4.9(b) above, shall be held for the exclusive benefit of the Beneficiary. Any transfer of Excess Shares to a Trust shall be effective as of the close of trading on the Trading Day prior to the date of the purported Transfer or Non-Transfer Event that results in the transfer to the Trust. In addition, if a trustee of a trust holds SplitCo Excess Shares immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time as a result of the provisions of Article IV, Section C.2. of the SplitCo Restated Certificate of Incorporation (such trust, the ""), the Equity Stock issued in connection with the Splitco Merger in respect of the SplitCo Excess Shares will be deemed Excess Shares subject to the provisions of this Section 4.9 (including, for the avoidance of doubt and without limitation, Section 4.9(b)). In the case of Excess Shares held by the trustee of the SplitCo Trust, references herein to "Prohibited Owner", "Trust", "Trustee" and "Beneficiary" will have the meanings assigned to such terms in the SplitCo Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

The Trust shall distribute to the Prohibited Owner the amounts received with respect to the Excess Shares attributable to such Prohibited Owner upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up; provided, however, that the Prohibited Owner shall not be entitled to receive amounts in excess of, (I) in the case of a purported Transfer in which the Prohibited Owner gave value for shares of Equity Stock (or SplitCo Equity Stock) and which Transfer resulted in the transfer of such shares of Equity Stock (or SplitCo Equity Stock) to a Trust, the product of (x) the price per share, if any, such Prohibited Owner paid for such shares of Equity Stock (or SplitCo Equity Stock) and (y) the number of such shares of such class or series of Equity Stock (or SplitCo Equity Stock) which were transferred to the Trust, and (II) in the case of a Non-Transfer Event or purported Transfer in which the Prohibited Owner did not give value for such shares (e.g., if the shares were received through a gift or devise), and which Non-Transfer Event or purported Transfer, as the case may be, resulted in the transfer of the shares to the Trust, the product of (i) the price per share equal to the Market Price of such class or series of Equity Stock (or SplitCo Equity Stock) on the date of such Non-Transfer Event or purported Transfer and (ii) the number of shares of such class or series of Equity Stock (or SplitCo Equity Stock) which were transferred to the Trust.

Restrictions on Transfer; Sale of Excess Shares
 
(i)            As soon as practicable after the Trustee acquires Excess Shares and complies with the last sentence of this Section 4.9(j)(i), but in an orderly fashion so as not to materially adversely affect the trading price of Equity Stock, the Trustee shall designate one or more Persons as Permitted Transferees and sell to such Permitted Transferees any Excess Shares held by the Trustee; provided, however, that (x) any Permitted Transferee so designated purchases for cash (whether in a public or private sale) the Excess Shares and (y) a Person may be designated as a Permitted Transferee only to the extent such Person may acquire the Excess Shares without violating any of the restrictions set forth in Section 4.9(b) above and without such acquisition resulting in the transfer of such shares to a Trust pursuant to Section 4.9(f) above. Subject to the foregoing, the Trustee shall have the exclusive and absolute right to designate Permitted Transferees of any and all Excess Shares. Prior to any Transfer by the Trustee of any Excess Shares to a Permitted Transferee, the Trustee shall give not less than five Trading Days prior written notice to the Corporation of such intended Transfer and the Corporation must have waived in writing its purchase rights under Section 4.9(l) below if such intended Transfer would occur during the 30-day period referred to therein.
 
(ii)           Upon the designation by the Trustee of a Permitted Transferee in accordance with the provisions of this Section 4.9(j), the Trustee shall cause to be Transferred to the Permitted Transferee Excess Shares acquired by the Trustee and subject to the provisions of this Section 4.9. The Trustee shall (x) cause to be recorded on the
 
stock transfer books of the Corporation that the Permitted Transferee is the holder of record of such number of shares of Equity Stock, and (y) distribute to the Beneficiary any and all amounts held with respect to such shares of Equity Stock after making payment to the Prohibited Owner pursuant to Section 4.9(k) below.
 
(iii)          If the Transfer of Excess Shares to a purported Permitted Transferee would or does violate any of the transfer restrictions set forth in Section 4.9(b) above, such Transfer shall be void as to that number of Excess Shares that causes the violation of any such restriction when such shares are Transferred and the purported Permitted Transferee shall be deemed to be a Prohibited Owner and shall acquire no rights in such Equity Stock. Such shares of Equity Stock shall be automatically transferred to the Trust from which they were originally Transferred. Such transfer to the Trust shall be effective as of the close of trading on the Trading Day prior to the date of the Transfer to the purported Permitted Transferee and the provisions of this Section 4.9 shall apply to such shares, including, without limitation, the provisions of Sections 4.9(j) through 4.9(l) with respect to any future transfer of such shares by the Trust.
ab initio
 
(k)   Any Prohibited Owner shall be entitled (following the sale of Excess Shares to a Permitted Transferee in accordance with Section 4.9(j) above or following the acceptance of the offer to purchase such shares in accordance with Section 4.9(l) below) to receive from the Trustee following the sale or other disposition of such Excess Shares the lesser of (a)(i) in the case of a purported Transfer in which the Prohibited Owner gave value for shares of Equity Stock (or SplitCo Equity Stock) and which Transfer resulted in the transfer to a Trust of Excess Shares (or SplitCo Excess Shares), the product of (x) the price per share, if any, such Prohibited Owner paid for the shares of such class or series of Equity Stock (or SplitCo Equity Stock) that were transferred to the Trust and (y) the number of such shares of such class or series of Equity Stock (or SplitCo Equity Stock) that were transferred to the Trust and (ii) in the case of a Non-Transfer Event or purported Transfer in which the Prohibited Owner did not give value for such shares (e.g., if the shares were received through a gift or devise) and which Non-Transfer Event or purported Transfer, as the case may be, resulted in the transfer to a Trust of Excess Shares (or SplitCo Excess Shares), the product of (x) the price per share equal to the Market Price of such class or series of Equity Stock (or SplitCo Equity Stock) on the date of such Non-Transfer Event or purported Transfer and (y) the number of such shares of such class or series of Equity Stock (or SplitCo Equity Stock) that were transferred to the Trust, provided, that if the Trustee disposes of less than all of the Excess Shares attributable to the Prohibited Owner in a single disposition, the amount determined pursuant to this clause (a) shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such partial disposition, or (b) the proceeds received by the Trustee from the sale or other disposition of such Excess Shares (net of any commissions and other expenses of sale) in accordance with Section 4.9(j) above or Section 4.9(l) below. Any amounts received by the Trustee in respect of such Excess Shares which are in excess of such amounts to be paid to the Prohibited Owner pursuant to this Section 4.9(k) shall be distributed to the Beneficiary. The Trustee and the Trust shall not be liable for, and each Beneficiary and Prohibited Owner shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived, any claim by a Beneficiary or Prohibited Owner arising out of the disposition of Excess Shares, except for claims arising out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of, or any failure to make payments in accordance with this Section 4.9(k) by, such Trustee.
Payments to Prohibited Owner.
 
(l)   Excess Shares shall be deemed to have been offered for sale to the Corporation, or its designee, at a price per share equal to the price per share of the class or series of Equity Stock (or SplitCo Equity Stock) paid by the Prohibited Owner in the purported Transfer that resulted in the transfer of such Excess Shares (or SplitCo Excess Shares) to the Trust (or, in the case of a Non-Transfer Event or Transfer in which the Prohibited Owner did not give value for the shares (e.g., if the shares were received through a gift or devise), the Market Price of the class or series of Equity Stock (or SplitCo Equity Stock) on the date of such Non-Transfer Event or purported Transfer in which the Prohibited Owner did not give value for the shares); provided, that, if Excess Shares are held in a Trust pursuant to the fourth sentence of Section 4.9(f) hereof, then the price per share or Market Price, as applicable, of the applicable series of SplitCo Equity Stock shall be adjusted to reflect the Splitco Exchange Ratio (as defined in the Merger Agreement). The Corporation shall have the right to accept such offer for a period of 30 days following the later of (x) the date of the Non-Transfer Event or purported Transfer which results in the transfer of Excess Shares (or SplitCo Excess Shares) to a Trust or (y) the date the Board first determines that a Non-Transfer Event or Transfer resulting in Excess Shares (or SplitCo Excess Shares) has occurred, if the Corporation does not receive a notice of such Non-Transfer Event or Transfer pursuant to Section 4.9(e).

The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such person's conduct was unlawful.
 
Section 2.
  Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings by or in the Right of the Corporation.
 
Subject to Section 3 of this Article VIII, the Corporation shall indemnify, to the full extent that it shall have power under applicable law to do so and in a manner permitted by such law, any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was a Director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was a Director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
 
Section 3.
  Authorization of Indemnification.
 
Any indemnification under this Article VIII (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the
Director or officer is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Sections 1 or 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made, with respect to a person who is a Director or officer at the time of such determination, (i) by a majority vote of the Directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (ii) by a committee of such Directors designated by a majority vote of such Directors, even though less than a quorum, or (iii) if there are no such Directors, or if such Directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion or (iv) by the stockholders. Such determination shall be made, with respect to former Directors and officers, by any person or persons having the authority to act on the matter on behalf of the Corporation. To the extent, however, that a present or former Director or officer of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding described above, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the specific case.
 
Section 4.
  Indemnification by a Court.
 
Notwithstanding any contrary determination in the specific case under Section 3 of this Article VIII, and notwithstanding the absence of any determination thereunder, any Director or officer may apply to the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware for indemnification to the extent otherwise permissible under Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VIII. The basis of such indemnification by a court shall be a determination by such court that indemnification of the Director or officer is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standards of conduct set forth in Section 1 or 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be. Neither a contrary determination in the specific case under Section 3 of this Article VIII nor the absence of any determination thereunder shall be a defense to such application or create a presumption that the Director or officer seeking indemnification has not met any applicable standard of conduct. Notice of any application for indemnification pursuant to this Section 4 shall be given to the Corporation promptly upon the filing of such application. If successful, in whole or in part, the Director or officer seeking indemnification shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such application to the fullest extent permitted by law.
 
Section 5.
  Expenses Payable in Advance.

Section 6.
  Non-exclusivity of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses.
 
The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this Article VIII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under the Certificate of Incorporation, any By-Law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as to action in such person's official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, it being the policy of the Corporation that indemnification of the persons specified in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VIII, and advancement of expenses of the persons specified in Section 5 of this Article VIII, shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by law. The provisions of this Article VIII shall not be deemed to preclude the indemnification of any person who is not specified in Section 1 or 2 of this Article VIII or the advancement of expenses of any person who is not specified in Section 5 of this Article VIII, but whom the Corporation has the power to or obligation to indemnify under the provisions of the DGCL, or otherwise.
Section 7.
  Insurance.
 
The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a Director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was a Director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a Director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person's status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power or the obligation to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this Article VIII.
 
Section 8.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
EL SEGUNDO, Calif., Nov. 19, 2009 DIRECTV today announced
the successful completion of the previously announced transactions involving the combination of  DIRECTV Group and  Liberty Entertainment, Inc. (LEI), a company split-off from Liberty Media Corporation. The transactions were completed following
a special meeting of stockholders of The DIRECTV Group held today
.
 
Special Meeting
 
The stockholders of DIRECTV Group approved both of the proposals up for vote at the special meeting.  Those proposals related to the approval of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (dated May 3, 2009) as amended, by and among Liberty, LEI, DIRECTV Group, DIRECTV and certain subsidiaries of DIRECTV and the approval of the Voting and Right of First Refusal Agreement (dated as of May 3, 2009) as amended, by and among DIRECTV Group, LEI, DIRECTV, John C. Malone (the Chairman of DIRECTV Group and Liberty), his wife and certain trusts for the benefit of their children.  The final voting results were approximately 90% for adoption of the Merger Agreement and approximately 89% for approval of the Malone Agreement.
 
The proposals were also approved by an overwhelming majority of the stockholders excluding shares of DIRECTV Group owned by Liberty and its subsidiaries, the Malones and officers and directors of Liberty.  Liberty Media held a special meeting of stockholders earlier in the day and also received the necessary approvals for the transactions.
 
Description of the Transactions
 
In the transactions, Liberty executed a split-off that resulted in the redemption of 90% of the outstanding shares of both series of its Liberty Entertainment common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of two series of common stock of LEI. The Merger Agreement provided for two mergers that resulted in DIRECTV Group and LEI becoming wholly-owned subsidiaries of DIRECTV. In the DIRECTV merger, DIRECTV Group common stockholders (other than direct or indirect subsidiaries of LEI) received one share of DIRECTV Class A common stock for each share of common stock of DIRECTV Group that they owned. In the LEI merger, holders of outstanding shares of LEI Series A common stock and LEI Series B common stock (other than LEI or DIRECTV) received a number of shares of DIRECTV Class A common stock equal to the LEI exchange ratio for each share of LEI common stock that they owned. The LEI exchange ratio was equal to 1.11130 shares of DIRECTV common stock for each share of LEI common stock.
 
Immediately prior to the mergers, the Malones, pursuant to the Malone Agreement, exchanged each of their shares of LEI Series B common stock for a number of shares of DIRECTV Class B common stock equal to the number of shares of LEI Series B common stock they owned multiplied by the LEI exchange ratio.  The Malones are the only holders of DIRECTV Class B common stock and their votes are subject to limitations imposed by the Malone Agreement.  DIRECTV Class B common stock has fifteen votes per share and certain limited consent rights and will not be publicly traded, and DIRECTV Class A common stock has one vote per share and is listed on the NASDAQ National Market System under the symbol "DTV" and will begin trading on Friday, November 20, 2009.
 
As a result of the merger transactions, there will be approximately 910 million shares of DIRECTV Class A common stock (NASDAQ: DTV) outstanding when trading begins and approximately 22 million shares of DIRECTV Class B common stock, all of which is held by the Malones and will not be listed.  In addition, stock options and SARs relating to Liberty Entertainment common stock were converted into stock options and SARs relating to DIRECTV's Class A common stock.
As previously disclosed in the proxy statement and prospectus sent to stockholders in connection with the stockholder vote on the Liberty transactions and other public filings, as a result of completing the Liberty transactions, the Company has assumed, on a consolidated basis, approximately $2 billion of indebtedness to Bank of America through its acquisition of Greenlady II, LLC, a subsidiary of LEI, and also has assumed rights and obligations connected with the related equity collar securing the debt.  The Company has requested that Bank of America unwind the equity collar, pursuant to agreed upon market practices. The indebtedness will be repaid prior to its maturity in various stages in conjunction with the unwind.  The Company will also be responsible for certain costs due to the early unwind of the various tranches of the equity collar, the amounts of which will vary depending on the Company's stock price during the unwind and other market factors.
 
Based on DTV's closing share price of $31.04 on November 18, 2009, and other preliminary estimates of fair value of the assets and liabilities of LEI (including the fair value on that date of the equity collar and the stock based awards), the Company estimates that it will record an expense of approximately $400 million for the premium to LEI stockholders and costs of the transactions.  This is an estimate and the actual charges will be disclosed in the Company's filing on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2009.  Adjustments to the fair values of certain of the stock based awards and the equity collar, as long as these instruments remain outstanding, will be recorded in non-operating earnings in the consolidated statements of operations of the Company each reporting period.  The Company expects that the process of unwinding the equity collar and the determination of amounts payable to Bank of America will be completed in the fourth quarter of this year, depending on market factors and other relevant considerations.
 
As a result of the decision by the Company to repay the debt and to unwind the equity collar, the Company does not intend to implement a new share repurchase program at this time.  Any decision to implement a share repurchase program will be made based upon progress made in unwinding the equity collar and other relevant market conditions.

Exhibit 99.2
The rights of stockholders of a corporation are governed by the laws of the state in which the corporation is incorporated, as well as the certificate (or articles) of incorporation and by-laws of the corporation. DIRECTV Group and DIRECTV are both organized under the laws of the state of Delaware, and therefore differences in the rights of holders of DIRECTV Group common stock and DIRECTV common stock arise from their respective certificates of incorporation and by-laws. After the DIRECTV Group merger is completed, the rights of DIRECTV Group stockholders who become DIRECTV stockholders will be governed by DIRECTV' amended and restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws and the DGCL.
 
The following summarizes certain material differences between the rights of DIRECTV Group stockholders and DIRECTV stockholders immediately following completion of the mergers. This section does not include a complete description of all differences among the rights of these stockholders, nor does it include a complete description of the specific rights of these stockholders or of Delaware corporate law.

  DIRECTV Group has the authority to issue 4,084,000,000 shares of capital stock, consisting of (i) 3,000,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, and 275,000,000 shares of Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share, (ii) 800,000,000 shares of excess stock, par value $0.01 per share, and (iii) 9,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, issuable in series.

  DIRECTV Group has not adopted a rights plan.
 
DIRECTV.
  DIRECTV currently does not intend to adopt a rights plan prior to the effective time of the mergers. Under the DGCL, a corporation may create and issue rights entitling the holders of the rights to purchase from the corporation shares of any class or series of capital stock, subject to any provisions in its certificate of incorporation.
 
Preemptive Rights
 
DIRECTV Group.
  DIRECTV Group's amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide holders of common stock with preemptive rights.
 
DIRECTV.
  Same as DIRECTV Group.
 
Stockholder Voting
 
DIRECTV Group.
 
General.
  Subject to the rights of any outstanding series of preferred stock to vote as a separate class, each share of DIRECTV Group common stock is entitled to one vote per share on all matters submitted to the stockholders. Generally, corporate actions taken by vote of DIRECTV Group's stockholders are authorized upon receiving the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the stockholders' meeting on the subject matter unless otherwise required by law. The election of directors is determined by a plurality vote, and thus the nominees receiving the highest number of votes cast by DIRECTV Group stockholders will be elected to DIRECTV Group's board of directors.
Quorum.
  A majority of the shares entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, constitutes a quorum at a stockholders' meeting.
 
Cumulative Voting.
  Holders of DIRECTV Group common stock do not have cumulative voting rights.
 
Class Voting.
  Under the DGCL, voting by classes is only required for amendments to the certificate of incorporation that would increase or decrease the aggregate number of authorized shares of such class (unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise), increase or decrease the par value of the shares of such class, or alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the shares of such class so as to affect them adversely. No other specific class voting right is provided under the amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated by-laws of DIRECTV Group.
 
DIRECTV.
 
General.
  Each share of the Class A common stock will be entitled to one vote per share on all matters submitted to the stockholders, each share of the Class B common stock will be entitled to 15 votes per share on all matters submitted to the stockholders, and each share of the Class C common stock will be non-voting, except as, and only to the extent, required by applicable law. If a vote or consent of the holders of Class C common stock should at any time be required under Delaware law, the holders of Class C common stock will be entitled to 1/100th of a vote for each share of Class C common stock held. Generally, corporate actions taken by vote of DIRECTV stockholders will be authorized upon receiving the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by all DIRECTV stockholders present at the meeting, in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote on such action voting as one class unless otherwise required by law. The election of directors will be determined by a plurality vote, and thus the nominees receiving the highest number of votes cast by DIRECTV stockholders will be elected to DIRECTV' board of directors.
 
Quorum.
  In general, a majority of the outstanding shares, represented in person or by proxy, at a stockholders' meeting duly called will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.
 
Cumulative Voting.
  Holders of DIRECTV common stock will not have cumulative voting rights.
 
Class Voting.
  Subject to the below, the Class A common stock, Class B common stock and the Preferred Stock (but only to the extent such series of Preferred Stock is designated a voting security) will vote their respective shares together as one class. Except as required by applicable law, holders of DIRECTV common stock will not be entitled to vote on any amendment to the certificate of incorporation that relates solely to the Preferred Stock if the holders of outstanding shares of Preferred Stock are entitled to vote thereon. Under the DGCL, voting by classes is required for amendments to the certificate of incorporation that would increase or decrease the aggregate number of authorized shares of such class (unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise), increase or decrease the par value of the shares of such class, or alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the shares of such class so as to affect them adversely. Under the terms of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of DIRECTV, the number of authorized shares of any preferred stock or any class of DIRECTV common stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the authorized number of shares then outstanding or then issuable pursuant to any convertible securities of DIRECTV) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the outstanding stock of DIRECTV irrespective of the class vote requirements of the DGCL. The Class B common stock will be entitled to a class vote in the event of certain share distributions (including distributions of convertible securities of DIRECTV) including a share distribution that would not provide the holders of the Class B common stock the same relative voting power of the Class B common stock versus the other classes of DIRECTV common stock and in the event of certain charter amendments.
 
Pursuant to the terms the Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise, Settlement and Release, entered into on October 16, 2009 by DIRECTV and Liberty (the Stipulation of Settlement''), the Class A common stock will be entitled to a class vote in the event that DIRECTV proposes to engage in a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of its assets in which the effectiveness of such a transaction
would (i) require the approval of the holders of the common stock of DIRECTV and (ii) result in the holders of Class A common stock receiving consideration per share different in form or amount than that to be received by holders of Class B common stock. In such instance, the approval by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock, voting as a separate class, will be required. Such separate voting right shall, however, cease to be of any force or effect and will be automatically repealed upon the earliest to occur of: (i) Mr. Malone's death, (ii) the time at which the Malones, in the aggregate, do not own shares of DIRECTV Class B common stock representing at least 10% of the combined voting power of DIRECTV Class A common stock and DIRECTV Class B common stock and (iii) the Approval Deadline, if final court approval of the Stipulation of Settlement is not obtained as of such date.
 
No other specific class voting rights will be provided under the amended and restated certificate of incorporation or by-laws of DIRECTV.
 
Action by Written Consent
 
DIRECTV Group.
  The amended and restated certificate of incorporation of DIRECTV Group provides that stockholder actions can be taken by written consent by the holders of stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.
 
DIRECTV.
  The amended and restated certificate of incorporation of DIRECTV will, subject to the rights of any series of preferred stock, prohibit stockholder actions taken by written consent; provided that holders of Class B common stock will be entitled to take action by written consent but solely in instances where the consent of the Class B common stockholders, as a class, is required.
 
Notice of Stockholders' Meeting
 
DIRECTV Group.
  DIRECTV Group's amended and restated by-laws provide that, unless otherwise required by applicable law, written notice of the time, place and purposes of a meeting of stockholders must be delivered not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting, by mail postage prepaid, to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting.

Record Date
 
DIRECTV Group.
  DIRECTV Group's amended and restated by-laws provide that for the purpose of determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in any other lawful action, the board of directors may fix a record date which shall not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day of the meeting, and for determining the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or for any other purpose, the record date shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board adopts a resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting, provided that the board may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
 
DIRECTV.
  Same as DIRECTV Group.
 
Inspection of Stockholder Lists
 
DIRECTV Group.

Ability to Call Special Meetings of Stockholders
 
DIRECTV Group.
  Special meetings of the stockholders may be called at any time by (a) the board pursuant to a resolution approved by a majority of the board, (b) the chairman or a vice chairman or (c) any stockholder who beneficially owns 10% or more of DIRECTV Group's voting securities then outstanding. Only such business as is stated in the notice of meeting may be acted upon at a special meeting.
 
DIRECTV.
  Except as otherwise required by law and subject to the rights of the holders of any outstanding series of preferred stock, special meetings of stockholders of DIRECTV may be called only by or at the direction of the board, and may not be called by any other person or persons. Pursuant to the terms of the Stipulation of Settlement, the holders of 10% or more of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock will be permitted to cause the board of directors of DIRECTV to call and hold a special meeting of stockholders; provided, that in the event that the Stipulation of Settlement does not receive final court approval by the Approval Deadline, such by-law provision will become null and void.

In addition, the sections of DIRECTV Group's amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to excess stock, independent directors, related party transactions, and amendments to the certificate of incorporation, may not be amended without (x) the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the directors, including at least a majority of independent directors on the board, and (y) the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares entitled to vote generally on matters requiring approval of stockholders.

Prior to the first annual meeting of the stockholders of DIRECTV Group occurring after July 29, 2009 any amendment made by the board of directors with respect to the following by-law provisions requires the affirmative vote of not less than 80% of the directors then serving on the board (with any fractional number being rounded up to the next whole number):

Pursuant to the terms of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws of DIRECTV, and in connection with the Stipulation of Settlement, certain by-law provisions of DIRECTV that provide that a majority of the board of directors of DIRECTV be Qualifying Directors and that at least 50% of the audit committee, compensation committee and any special transaction committee established by the board of directors be comprised of Qualifying Directors, cannot be amended without either (i) the approval of the board of directors of DIRECTV (which must include the unanimous approval of the Qualifying Directors then serving on the board of directors of DIRECTV) or (ii) the approval of the holders
of a majority of the outstanding DIRECTV Class A common stock (other than shares held by the Malones); provided, however that no such amendment by the board of directors pursuant to the preceding clause (i) may be made prior to the third anniversary of the mergers. The preceding sentence, however, shall cease to be of any force or effect and will be automatically repealed upon the earliest to occur of (i) Mr. Malone's death, (ii) the time at which the Malones, in the aggregate, do not own shares of DIRECTV Class B common stock representing at least 10% of the combined voting power of DIRECTV Class A common stock and DIRECTV Class B common stock and (iii) the Approval Deadline, if final court approval of the Stipulation of Settlement is not obtained as of such date.
 
Size and Classification of the Board of Directors
 
DIRECTV Group.
  Currently, DIRECTV Group has ten directors. DIRECTV Group's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws provide that the board of directors will consist of a number of directors fixed from time to time by the DIRECTV Group board of directors, but may not be less than eleven, and thus there currently is one vacancy on the DIRECTV Group board. The amended and restated certificate of incorporation of DIRECTV Group provides for a classified board, consisting of three classes with each class consisting of, as nearly as possible, one-third of the total number of directors.
 
DIRECTV.
  DIRECTV' amended and restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws provide that the board of directors will consist of a number of directors fixed from time to time by the DIRECTV board of directors, but will initially be eleven. Any increase to the number of directors of DIRECTV in excess of twelve directors that would become effective prior to the first annual meeting of the stockholders occurring after the effective time of the mergers requires the affirmative vote of not less than 80% of the directors then serving on the board (with any fractional number being rounded up to the next whole number).
 
The directors of DIRECTV shall initially be of one class and shall have a term which expires at the first annual meeting of stockholders after the effective time of the mergers. Commencing with the first annual meeting after the effective time of the mergers, the amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides for a classified board of directors in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, consisting of three classes with each class consisting of, as nearly as possible, one-third of the total number of directors. Whenever holders of any series of preferred stock have the right to elect directors, such directors so elected shall not be divided into classes unless expressly provided by such terms.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Stipulation of Settlement, the by-laws of DIRECTV will require that a majority of the board of directors be "Qualifying Directors" (as defined in DIRECTV's amended and restated by-laws) and that at least fifty percent (50%) of each of the audit committee, compensation committee and any special transaction committee established by the board of directors be comprised of "Qualifying Directors". Such requirements cannot be amended without either (i) the approval of the board of directors of DIRECTV (which must include the unanimous approval of the Qualifying Directors then serving on the board of directors of DIRECTV) or (ii) the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding DIRECTV Class A common stock (other than shares held by the Malones); provided, however that no such amendment by the board of directors pursuant to the preceding clause (i) may be made prior to the third anniversary of the mergers. The preceding two sentences, however, shall cease to be of any force or effect and will be automatically repealed upon the earliest to occur of: (i) Mr. Malone's death, (ii) the time at which the Malones, in the aggregate, do not own shares of DIRECTV Class B common stock representing at least 10% of the combined voting power of DIRECTV Class A common stock and DIRECTV Class B common stock  and (iii) the Approval Deadline, if final court approval of the Stipulation of Settlement is not obtained as of such date.
 
Stockholder Nominations of Directors
 
DIRECTV Group.
  Under the amended and restated by-laws of DIRECTV Group, in order for a stockholder to nominate persons for election as directors of DIRECTV Group, a nomination must be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the secretary of DIRECTV Group. To be timely, a stockholder's
 
notice shall be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of DIRECTV Group not later than the close of business on the 120th day nor earlier than the close of business on the 150th day prior to the first anniversary of the date the corporation first mailed its proxy materials for the preceding year's annual meeting of stockholders.

(3)           with respect to each nominee for election or reelection to the board, a completed and signed questionnaire and representation and agreement as specified in Article 1, Section 2 of the by-laws relating to the existence and disclosure of any voting commitments of the nominee; and

In addition, nominations of persons for election to the board may be made at any annual meeting of stockholders, or at any special meeting of stockholders called for the purpose of electing directors, (i) by or at the direction of the board or (ii) by any stockholder of record who is a stockholder of record at the time of the giving of notice provided for above and entitled to vote at the meeting.
 
Removal of Directors
 
DIRECTV Group.
  The restated certificate of incorporation of DIRECTV Group provides that except as otherwise provided relating to the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock, no director may be removed from office without cause and without the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the combined voting power of the then outstanding shares of the corporation entitled to vote for the election of directors, voting together as a single class.
 
DIRECTV.
  Same as DIRECTV Group; provided, that prior to the first annual meeting of DIRECTV after the effective time of the mergers, directors of DIRECTV may be removed with or without cause.
 
Vacancies on the Board of Directors
 
DIRECTV Group.
  Except as otherwise provided relating to the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock, any vacancies on the board resulting from death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office or other cause between meetings of stockholders will be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of all of the directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, or a duly appointed committee of the Board, but in any event not by the stockholders. Directors so chosen will hold office until such director's successor shall have been duly elected and qualified or until his earlier death, resignation, disqualification or removal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the affirmative vote of not less than 80% of the number of directors then serving on the board, with any fractional number being rounded up to the next whole number, shall be required to fill the vacancy in the office of President and Chief Executive Officer created by the resignation of Mr. Carey (and without regard to the appointment of Mr. Hunter as interim Chief Executive Officer).
 
DIRECTV.
 Same as DIRECTV Group.
 
Limitation of Personal Liability of Directors
 
DIRECTV Group.
  A director will not be personally liable to DIRECTV Group or any of its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability: (i) for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to DIRECTV Group or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law, (iii) for any unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock purchase or redemption resulting in personal liability to the directors under Section 174 of the DGCL or (iv) for any transaction from which the directors derived an improper personal benefit.
DIRECTV.
  To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, no director of DIRECTV will be personally liable to DIRECTV or its stockholders for monetary Damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. "Damages" will, to the extent permitted by law, include without limitation, any judgment, fine, amount paid in settlement, penalty, punitive damages, excise or other tax assessed with respect to an employee benefit plan, or expense of any nature (including, without limitation, counsel fees and disbursements).
 
Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses of Directors and Officers
 
DIRECTV Group.
  DIRECTV Group shall indemnify its directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by law, provided that DIRECTV Group shall not be obligated to indemnify any director or officer in connection with a proceeding initiated by such person unless such proceeding was authorized or consented to by the board of directors. The right to indemnification conferred above includes the right to be paid by DIRECTV Group the expenses incurred in defending or otherwise participating in any proceedings in advance of its final disposition. DIRECTV Group may, to the extent authorized by the board of directors, provide rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to employees and agents of the corporation similar to those conferred to directors and officers of DIRECTV Group.
 
DIRECTV.
  DIRECTV shall indemnify any person, by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of DIRECTV, or is or was serving at the request of DIRECTV as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the DIRECTV, and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person's conduct was unlawful.
 
Any indemnification (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct, which shall be determined (i) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (ii) by a committee of such directors designated by a majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (iii) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion or (iv) by the stockholders; provided, however, DIRECTV shall not be obligated to indemnify any director or officer in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or consented to by the board of DIRECTV. Expenses incurred by a director or officer in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding to which such director or officer is made or threatened to be made a party by reason of the fact he or she is or was a director or officer of DIRECTV, or is or was a director or officer of DIRECTV serving at the request of DIRECTV as a director or officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, shall be paid by DIRECTV in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking, if required by applicable law, by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by DIRECTV.
 
Transactions Involving Officers or Directors
 
DIRECTV Group.
  Related Party Transactions between DIRECTV Group and certain parties shall be subject to approval by the audit committee of the board of directors. "Related Party Transaction" means any transaction or series of transactions between the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries on the one hand, and another party or parties on the other hand, in such amounts and related to such matters that the audit committee determines could be considered an interested transaction between the company or its subsidiaries and such other party or parties.
DIRECTV.
  None, assuming that final court approval of the Stipulation of Settlement is obtained by the Approval Deadline. However, if final court approval of the Stipulation of Settlement is not obtained by the Approval Deadline, the DIRECTV' amended and restated certificate of incorporation shall explicitly acknowledge that (i) non-employee officers and directors of DIRECTV may serve as directors, officers, employees and agents of other corporations or entities that engage in the same, similar or related lines of business as DIRECTV, or have interests in the same areas of business opportunity as DIRECTV, or which engage in material business transactions with DIRECTV and (ii) such non-employee directors and officers, to the fullest extent permitted by law, will have no duty or obligation to refer any potential business opportunity to DIRECTV, or refrain from referring any such potential business opportunity to such other corporation or entity, and DIRECTV will not have any right, interest or expectancy in respect of such potential business opportunity and renounces any interest or expectancy therein; provided however, with respect to both (i) and (ii) above, if the non-employee director or officer of DIRECTV is expressly offered the potential business opportunity solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of DIRECTV or any subsidiary of DIRECTV, and the potential business opportunity is related to a line of business in which DIRECTV is directly engaged, then the foregoing limitations of DIRECTV' rights shall not apply in respect of such potential business opportunity.
 
Appointment and Removal of Officers
 
DIRECTV Group.
  The officers of DIRECTV Group shall be elected by the board of directors and shall be a Chairman of the Board (who must be a Director), a President (who shall also be the Chief Executive Officer), a Secretary and a Treasurer. Any officer elected by the board of directors may be removed at any time by the board with or without cause. Only the board may fill any vacancy occurring in any office of the corporation.
 
DIRECTV.
  The officers of DIRECTV shall be elected by the board and shall be a Chairman of the board (who must be a director), a President, a Secretary and a Treasurer. Any officer elected by the board of directors may be removed at any time by the board with or without cause. Only the board may fill any vacancy occurring in any office of the corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the affirmative vote of not less than 80% of the number of directors then serving on the board, with any fractional number being rounded up to the next whole number, shall be required to fill the vacancy in the office of President and Chief Executive Officer of DIRECTV created by the resignation of Mr. Chase Carey (and without regard to the appointment of Mr. Larry D. Hunter as interim Chief Executive Officer).
 
Anti-Takeover Provisions
 
DIRECTV Group.
  DIRECTV Group has "opted-out" of the Delaware business combination statute.
 
DIRECTV.
  DIRECTV has not adopted any provision in its amended and restated certificate of incorporation to "opt-out" of the Delaware business combination statute. Section 203 of the DGCL, subject to certain exceptions, generally prohibits public corporations from engaging in certain business transactions, including mergers, with a holder of 15% or more of the corporation's stock, referred to as the interested stockholder, for a period of three years after the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. The Malones, but not their transferees, will be grandfathered under the statute and thus will not be subject to its restrictions.
 
Dividends
 
DIRECTV Group.
  Subject to the preferential and other dividend rights of any outstanding series of preferred stock, holders of common stock shall be entitled to such dividends and other distributions in cash, stock or property of DIRECTV Group as may be declared by the board of directors from time to time out of assets or funds of DIRECTV Group legally available.
 
DIRECTV.
  Subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any outstanding series of preferred stock, dividends may be declared and paid on the DIRECTV common stock out of the assets of DIRECTV that are by law available therefor at such times and in such amounts as the board in its discretion shall determine. All holders of outstanding shares of DIRECTV common stock shall be entitled to share equally, share for share, in such dividends, whether payable in cash, in property or in shares of stock of DIRECTV.
 
Merger Consideration
 
DIRECTV Group.
  None.
 
DIRECTV.
  Holders of DIRECTV Class B common stock are entitled to receive per share consideration in any business combination that is not less than the per share consideration received by the holders of DIRECTV Class A common stock in such business combination.
 
Excess Shares
 
DIRECTV Group.
  Excess share provisions are no longer applicable.
 
DIRECTV.
  The DIRECTV amended and restated certificate of incorporation will contain restrictions on the transfer of DIRECTV common stock during the first year after completion of the Split-Off. These provisions are designed to protect DIRECTV and its stockholders from, among other things, liability for potential adverse effects under Section 355(e) of the Code that could result from certain changes in ownership of shares of DIRECTV common stock in light of DIRECTV participating in the mergers.
 
The excess share provision of the DIRECTV amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that, subject to certain exceptions, during the period beginning on the effective date of the Split-Off and ending one year and one day from such date (the "restriction period"), no person may acquire, actually or constructively by virtue of certain of the attribution and aggregation provisions of the Code and Treasury Regulations, any shares of DIRECTV common stock to the extent such acquisition would (i) cause such person to own, actually or constructively, 10% or more of any class of DIRECTV common stock (a "10% shareholder") or, if such person actively participates in management of DIRECTV, 5% or more of any class of DIRECTV common stock (a "controlling shareholder") or (ii) increase the amount of DIRECTV stock treated as owned by a 10% shareholder or controlling shareholder. In addition, the excess share provisions will provide that during such restriction period, certain "prohibited persons" may not acquire actually or constructively by virtue of certain of the attribution and aggregation provisions of the Code and Treasury Regulations any shares of DIRECTV common stock if such acquisition would not be protected by the so called "public trading" safe harbor contained in the Treasury Regulations under Section 355(e) of the Code. For these purposes, a prohibited person is any person that had an agreement, understanding, arrangement, or engaged in substantial negotiations regarding an acquisition of stock of DIRECTV, Liberty, LEI or DIRECTV Group during the two-year period preceding the Split-Off, and persons who would be aggregated with, or from whom ownership of such stock would be attributed to, such person under Section 355(e) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations. Acquisitions of DIRECTV common stock described in this paragraph are referred to as "prohibited acquisitions." If a prohibited person enters into an agreement, understanding or arrangement, or engaged in substantial negotiations regarding a prohibited acquisition prior to the day after the first anniversary of the Split-Off and such prohibited person prior to the Split-Off entered into an agreement, understanding or arrangement, or engaged in substantial negotiations regarding the prohibited acquisition (or a similar acquisition within the meaning of the Treasury Regulations under Section 355(e) of the Code), the restriction period will be extended with respect to such prohibited person until the later of the first day after the second anniversary of the Split-Off or six months and one day after the date that the prohibited acquisition was consummated or terminated.
 
The excess share provisions were included in the DIRECTV amended and restated certificate of incorporation in order to induce DIRECTV Group to enter into the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.
Any purported prohibited acquisition occurring during the first year after completion of the Split-Off will be null and void to the intended holder. The stock will be treated in accordance with the excess share provisions of the DIRECTV amended and restated certificate of incorporation. At the closing of the mergers, DIRECTV will create a trust for the exclusive benefit of a charitable beneficiary. The trustee of the trust will be designated by the audit committee of DIRECTV' board of directors and will not be affiliated with DIRECTV or the intended holder. Excess shares will be transferred to the trustee of the trust for the exclusive benefit of the charitable beneficiary until such time as the excess shares are transferred to a person whose ownership will not violate the restrictions on ownership. While the excess shares are held in trust, dividend and distributions on the shares will be paid to the trust for the benefit of the charitable beneficiary. The trustee will have the right to vote the excess shares (one vote per share for DIRECTV Class A common stock and 15 votes per share for DIRECTV Class B common stock). If the excess shares have already been voted by the intended owner, the trustee shall have the discretion to rescind and recast any such vote unless DIRECTV will have already taken irreversible corporate action based on such vote.
 
The excess shares will be sold by the trustee for cash to a transferee whose ownership would not violate the restrictions described above. The intended holder who purported to acquire the shares in violation of the restrictions described above will receive proceeds from the sale of the excess shares equal to the lesser of:
 
                 
the price paid by the intended holder for the excess shares, or, if no consideration was paid, the fair market value on the day of the event causing the excess shares to be held in trust; and
 
                 
the net proceeds received by the trustee from the sale or other disposition of the excess shares held in trust.
 
Any proceeds in excess of the amount payable to the intended holder will be paid to the charitable beneficiary.
 
In addition, the excess shares held in trust are subject to purchase by DIRECTV for a 30-day period at a purchase price equal to the price paid by the intended holder for the excess shares, or, if no consideration was paid, the fair market value on the day of the event causing the excess shares to be held in trust.
 
The intended holder of excess shares will cease to be entitled to distributions (other than liquidating distributions up to an amount equal to the amount the holder would have received upon a repurchase by DIRECTV, as described above), voting rights or any other benefits with respect to the excess shares except the right to payment on the transfer of the excess shares as described above. Any dividend or distribution paid to an intended holder on excess shares must be repaid to DIRECTV upon demand, and DIRECTV will pay any such amounts to the trust for the benefit of the charitable beneficiary. However, if DIRECTV distributes stock in connection with a stock dividend, stock split, reclassification or recapitalization, the excess share provisions will continue to apply, with appropriate adjustments, to both the excess shares with respect to which the distribution was made as well as the stock that was distributed.
 
Except as described below, these excess shares provisions will not apply to acquisitions of stock from DIRECTV or in connection with the mergers. In addition, the excess share provisions will not apply to certain shares held by the Malones.
 
These ownership restrictions may not be waived by the DIRECTV board of directors except in the event of an inadvertent violation of the provisions. Any waiver must be conditioned upon the intended holder promptly disposing of a sufficient number of shares that cures the violation.
 
The LEI restated certificate of incorporation will also contain similar excess share provisions. The DIRECTV amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that if at the time of the mergers LEI excess shares are outstanding, then the DIRECTV common stock received in exchange for LEI excess shares in the LEI merger will be deemed to be excess shares subject to the excess share provision of the DIRECTV amended and restated certificate of incorporation. With certain necessary conforming adjustments, such excess shares will generally be treated similar to that described above with respect to excess shares transferred to a trust in connection with a prohibited acquisition.
 
All certificates representing DIRECTV common stock will bear a legend referring to the restrictions described above.
 
The ownership provisions described above could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of DIRECTV during the first year after the completion of the transactions. That could deter potential acquirors from making an offer to stockholders of DIRECTV and limit any opportunity to realize premiums over prevailing market prices for DIRECTV common stock in connection therewith.
