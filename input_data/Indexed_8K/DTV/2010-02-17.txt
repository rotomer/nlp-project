ITEM 5.02.  Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
Compensation Grants and Awards
On February 10, 2010, the Compensation Committee of the Board (the Compensation Committee) approved compensation for certain of the elected officers of the Company.
Chief Executive Officer
In November 2009, the Company issued a press release announcing that the appointment of Michael D. White as President and Chief Executive Officer effective January 1, 2010 and his election as a Director effective immediately.  The primary terms of Mr. Whites employment were documented in a term sheet filed as to Form 8-K of The DIRECTV Group, Inc. filed on November 19, 2009.  These terms were later incorporated into an employment agreement between the Company and Mr. White effective as of January 1, 2010 (the Employment Agreement), a copy of which was filed as to Form 8-K of DIRECTV filed on January 7, 2010.  Please refer to the Employment Agreement for more information regarding Mr. Whites compensation.  Because Mr. Whites compensation arrangements for 2010 have been previously disclosed, references hereinafter to named executive officers means the named executive officers other than the Chief Executive Officer.
Exhibit 10.1
Exhibit 10.1
Other Named Executive Officers
At the February 10, 2010 meeting, the Compensation Committee approved compensation for the named executive officers as follows:
 
 
 
 
Bonus Award
In establishing the cash bonus payment to each executive officer, the Compensation Committee first determined and certified, pursuant to the terms of the Bonus Plan, that the performance target for 2009 was satisfied, so that the Company could have paid the maximum bonus under the Bonus Plan of two times base salary for each named executive officer.  The Compensation Committee exercised its discretion in establishing the amounts of individual bonus awards for each executive officer with each final bonus for 2009 being less than the maximum.  The Compensation Committee took into consideration, among other things, each individuals performance, the financial and operating performance of the Company, including customer satisfaction, and stock price performance in 2009.
Restricted Stock Unit Awards
With respect to the performance goals for RSUs granted in 2007 to named executive officers, the Compensation Committee determined the results for the three performance factors: (i) annual cash flow growth before interest and taxes, or CFBIT; (ii) annual growth in operating profit before depreciation and amortization or OPBDA, and (iii) annual revenue growth.  The Company performance for 2009 was above threshold and below target amounts for each performance factor.  After applying the applicable weighting factor to the three performance factors, overall average performance for 2009 was below target (64%).  This amount was averaged with overall performance in 2008 which exceeded target (144%) and the overall average performance for 2007 which also exceeded target (107%).  The final 2007-2009 adjustment factor was slightly above target at 105%.  This 105% performance factor was multiplied by the number of 2007-2009 RSUs granted to each named executive officer to determine the number of RSUs that would be converted one-for-one into shares of DIRECTV Class A common stock and issued to each officer.
With respect to the performance goals for RSUs granted in 2008 to the named executive officers, the Compensation Committee determined, for the second year of the 2008-2010 three-year performance period, the results of the three performance factors, which are the same as the performance factors for the 2007 RSU awards described above.  Overall average performance for 2009 was below target (64%) and will be averaged with the overall average performance for 2008 which was above target (144%) and for 2010 to determine the final 2008-2010 adjustment factor.  In each case, to determine the final adjustment factor, the Compensation Committee has reserved discretion to reduce payments or otherwise adjust downward restricted stock unit awards in accordance with the 2004 Stock Plan, and in no event may the final adjustment factor for the entire performance period exceed 125%. 
With respect to the performance goals for RSUs granted in 2009 to the named executive officers, the Compensation Committee determined, for the first year of the 2009-2011 three-year performance period, the results of the three performance factors:  (i) CFBIT, (ii) annual earnings per share growth, and (iii) annual revenue growth.  Overall average performance for 2009 was below target (82.7%) and will be averaged with the overall average performance for 2010 and 2011 to determine the final 2009-2011 adjustment factor.  In each case, to determine the final adjustment factor, the Compensation Committee has reserved discretion to reduce payments or otherwise adjust downward restricted stock unit awards in accordance with the 2004 Stock Plan, and in no event may the final adjustment factor for the entire performance period exceed 125%. 
The Compensation Committee established performance goals under the 2004 Stock Plan for the RSUs awarded to named executive officers for 2010, with the following performance factors: (i) CFBIT, (ii) annual growth in earnings per share, and (iii) annual revenue growth over the three-year period from January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2012.  A copy of the summary terms and conditions for the 2010 RSU grants is attached to this report as .  The Compensation Committee also established the performance target for determination of the maximum amount payable to any executive officer in calendar year 2010 under the Bonus Plan, which is to be based on CFBIT.  A copy of the summary terms and conditions for the 2010 Bonus is attached to this report as .
