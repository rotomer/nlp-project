ITEM 8.01.
Other Events.
 
 
As previously reported, Globo Comunicaes e Participaes S.A., or Globo, which owns approximately 26% of Sky Brazil, was granted the right, pursuant to an Exchange Rights Agreement dated as of October 8, 2004 among Globo, The News Corporation Limited and The DIRECTV Group, Inc. (the Exchange Agreement), until January 2014, to require DIRECTV to purchase all or a portion (but not less than half) of Globos shares in Sky Brazil. In a letter dated June 1, 2010, Globo provided notice to DIRECTV of the exercise of its right to exchange 178,830,000 shares (the Exchange Shares) representing approximately 19% of the ownership interests in Sky Brazil and approximately 73% of Globos interest in Sky Brazil.
 
As a result of Globos request, the fair value of Sky Brazil shares will be determined by mutual agreement or by outside valuation experts according to a process specified in the Exchange Agreement. DIRECTV may pay Globo either in DIRECTV common stock (at the weighted average price based on 20 consecutive trading days ending on the fifth trading day prior to the closing), in cash in local currency, or in a combination of the two, at DIRECTVs discretion.  If DIRECTV determines to pay Globo all or part of the consideration in DIRECTV common stock, DIRECTV may provide Globo written notice that the consideration will instead consist solely of cash if such notice is provided on or prior to the second business day prior to the reasonably anticipated closing date for the exchange. DIRECTV must register the shares within 27 0 days from the later of the closing or the date of DIRECTVs receipt of notice of exercise of the demand rights provided in a registration rights agreement between the parties.
 
After completion of this transaction, which we expect to occur during the second half of 2010, DIRECTV and its subsidiaries will beneficially own approximately 93% of Sky Brazil and Globo will own the remaining 7%.  In accordance with the Exchange Agreement, until January 2014, Globo will have the right to exchange all (but not less than all) of its remaining equity interests in Sky Brazil consistent with the procedure summarized above.
The foregoing description of the Exchange Agreement is only a summary, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Exchange Agreement which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.  Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning provided in the Exchange Agreement.
