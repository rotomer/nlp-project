Compensation Grants and Awards
Chief Executive Officer
Michael D. White, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, entered into an employment contract with the Company effective January 1, 2010 (the Employment Agreement), a copy of which was filed as Exhibit 10.1 to Form 8-K of DIRECTV with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 7, 2010.  Mr. White was awarded a long-term equity incentive grant pursuant to the terms of his Employment Agreement in 2010 and does not participate in the RSU grants described below for the other named executive officers.  Consequently, references hereinafter to named executive officers means the named executive officers other than the Chief Executive Officer, or CEO.
Named Executive Officers
At the February 10, 2011 meeting, the Compensation Committee approved compensation as follows:
 
 
 
 
Bonus Award
In establishing the cash bonus payment to the CEO and each named executive officer, the Compensation Committee first determined and certified, pursuant to the terms of the Bonus Plan, that the performance target for 2010 was satisfied, so that the Company could have paid the maximum bonus under the Bonus Plan of five times base salary for the CEO and each named executive officer.  The Compensation Committee exercised its discretion in establishing the amounts of individual bonus awards for the CEO and each named executive officer with each final bonus for 2010 being less than the maximum.  The Compensation Committee took into consideration, among other things, each individuals performance, the financial and operating performance of the Company, including customer satisfaction, and stock price performance in 2010.
Restricted Stock Unit Awards
With respect to the performance goals for RSUs granted in 2008 to named executive officers, the Compensation Committee determined the results for the three performance factors: (i) annual cash flow growth before interest and taxes, or CFBIT; (ii) annual growth in operating profit before depreciation and amortization or OPBDA, and (iii) annual revenue growth for the final year of the 2008-2010 three-year performance period.  The Company performance for 2010 was above threshold and below maximum amounts for each performance factor.  After applying the applicable weighting factor to the three performance factors, overall average performance for 2010 was above target (109.7%).  This amount was averaged with overall performance in 2009 which was below target (64%) and the overall performance in 2008 which exceeded target (144%).  The final 2008-2010 adjustment factor was above target at 105.9%, which is less than the maximum permitted of 125%.  This 105.9% performance factor was multiplied by the number of 2008-2010 RSUs granted to each named executive officer to determine the number of RSUs that would be converted one-for-one into shares of DIRECTV Class A common stock and issued to each officer.
With respect to the performance goals for RSUs granted in 2009 to the named executive officers, the Compensation Committee determined, for the second year of the 2009-2011 three-year performance period, the results of the three performance factors:  (i) CFBIT, (ii) annual earnings per share growth, and (iii) annual revenue growth.  Overall average performance for 2010 was above target (165.2%), and will be averaged with the overall performance for 2009 which was below target (82.7%) and with the overall average performance for 2011 to determine the final 2009-2011 adjustment factor.  In each case, to determine the final adjustment factor, the Compensation Committee has reserved discretion to reduce payments or otherwise adjust downward restricted stock unit awards in accordance with the 2004 Stock Plan, and i n no event may the final adjustment factor for the entire performance period exceed 125%. 
With respect to the performance goals for RSUs granted in 2010 to the named executive officers, the Compensation Committee determined, for the first year of the 2010-2012 three-year performance period, the results of the three performance factors:  (i) CFBIT, (ii) annual earnings per share growth, and (iii) annual revenue growth.  Overall average performance for 2010 was above target (150%) and will be averaged with the overall average performance for 2011 and 2012 to determine the final 2010-2012 adjustment factor.  In each case, to determine the final adjustment factor, the Compensation Committee has reserved discretion to reduce payments or otherwise adjust downward restricted stock unit awards in accordance with the 2004 Stock Plan, and in no event may the final adjustment factor for the entire performanc e period exceed 125%. 
The Compensation Committee established performance goals under the DIRECTV 2010 Stock Plan for the RSUs awarded to named executive officers for 2011, with the following performance factors: (i) CFBIT, (ii) annual growth in earnings per share, and (iii) annual revenue growth over the three-year period from January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2013.  A copy of the summary terms and conditions for the 2011 performance RSU grants is attached to this report as .  The Compensation Committee also established the performance target for determination of the maximum amount payable to any executive officer in calendar year 2011 under the Bonus Plan, which is to be based on CFBIT.  A copy of the summary terms and conditions for the 2011 Bonus is attached to this report as .
