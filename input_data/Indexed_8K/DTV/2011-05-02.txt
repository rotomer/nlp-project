Item 5.07.                      Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
 
The Annual Meeting of the stockholders of DIRECTV was held on April 28, 2011.  As of March 14, 2011, the record date for the Annual Meeting, there were 787,188,776 shares outstanding.

At the meeting, the stockholders voted on following items:  
 
1.           To elect nominees to the Board of Directors for the term as described in the proxy statement of DIRECTV.
 
The following nominees were elected as Class III directors by the votes indicated below.  As noted in the proxy statement, because the proposal to declassify the Board of Directors was approved by the stockholders (see number 4 below), the nominees were elected for a term that will expire on the date of the 2012 annual meeting of stockholders.
 
2.           To ratify the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as independent registered public accounting firm for DIRECTV for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2011.

3.           To amend the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of DIRECTV to make certain changes to the capital stock of the Company including deletion of certain provisions regarding the Class B common stock and excess stock, reduction of authorized Class B shares from 30,000,000 to 3,000,000, elimination of the Class C common stock, and deletion of rights to call special meetings granted to certain stockholders under circumstances that are no longer applicable.
 
This proposal was approved by the votes indicated below.  There were no broker non-votes on this proposal.

6.           To amend the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of DIRECTV to permit a special meeting of stockholders to be called by 25% or more of the stockholders in certain circumstances.
 
This proposal was approved by the votes indicated below.

This proposal was approved by the votes indicated below.
 
 
9.           Advisory vote on the frequency of holding an advisory vote on compensation of our named executive officers.
 
The advisory vote on the frequency of future advisory votes on compensation of our named executive officers resulted in every One Year receiving the largest number of stockholder votes as indicated by the voting totals below.
 
Based on these voting results, DIRECTV will hold an advisory vote on the compensation of its named executive officers every year until the next stockholder vote on the frequency of stockholder votes on the compensation of our named executive officers. A stockholder vote on the frequency of stockholder votes on the compensation of named executive officers is required to be held at least once every six years.
Each of proposals 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 was passed with a vote in favor by the requisite majority of shares outstanding as of the record date.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
