ITEM 1.01.     Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On November 14, 2011, DIRECTV provided a guarantee of all the outstanding Senior Notes of DIRECTV Holdings LLC and DIRECTV Financing Co., Inc. (collectively, the Issuers).
 
 
The outstanding Senior Notes consist of the 4.750% Senior Notes due 2014 (CUSIP 25459HAL9), 3.550% Senior Notes due 2015 (CUSIP 25459HAN5 and 25459HAM7), 3.125% Senior Notes due 2016 (CUSIP 25459HAV7), 7.625% Senior Notes due 2016 (CUSIP 25459HAE5 and 25459HAG0), 3.500% Senior Notes due 2016 (CUSIP 25459HAY1), 5.875% Senior Notes due 2019 (CUSIP 25459HAU9), 5.200% Senior Notes due 2020 (CUSIP 25459HAT2, 25459HAR6 and U25398AH8), 4.600% Senior Notes due 2021 (CUSIP 25459HAW5), 5.000% Senior Notes due 2021 (CUSIP 25459HBA2), 6.350% Senior Notes due 2040 (CUSIP 25459HAQ8), 6.000% Senior Notes due 2040 (CUSIP 25459HAX3) and 6.375% Senior Notes due 2041 (CUSIP 25459HAZ8) (collectively, the Senior Notes).
 
 
DIRECTV, the indirect 100% parent company of Issuers, entered into a series of Supplemental Indentures on November 14, 2011 with the Issuers, the existing subsidiary guarantors and the Trustee thereunder, The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., for the Issuers outstanding Senior Notes.  On the terms set forth in the Supplemental Indentures, copies of which are filed herewith as Exhibits 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5. and are incorporated herein by reference, DIRECTV has agreed to fully guarantee (the Guarantees), jointly and severally with the existing guarantors, the Senior Notes.  As a result of the Guarantees and subject to the terms of the Supplemental Indentures, holders of the Senior Notes will obtain the benefit of DIRECTVs interests in the assets and related earnings of DIRECTVs operations that are not held through DIRECTV Holdings LLC and its subsidiaries. Those operations are primarily DIRECTVs direct-to-home digital television services throughout Latin America which are held by DIRECTV Latin America Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries and DIRECTV Sports Networks LLC and its subsidiaries which are comprised primarily of three regional sports television networks based in Seattle, Washington, Denver, Colorado and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  However, the subsidiaries that own and operate the DIRECTV Latin America and DIRECTV Sports Networks operating segments have not agreed to guarantee the Senior Notes. 
 
A copy of the press release related to such announcement dated November 15, 2011 is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
ITEM 2.03.     Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
On November 14, 2011, DIRECTV entered into a series of Supplemental Indentures with the Issuers, the existing subsidiary guarantors and the Trustee, for the Issuers outstanding Senior Notes.  The Supplemental Indentures amend certain provisions in the underlying indentures to provide for DIRECTVs Guarantees of the Senior Notes.  The principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes as of the date hereof is $13.5 billion.  The Guarantees are unsecured senior obligations of DIRECTV and rank equally in right of payment with all of DIRECTVs existing and future senior debt and rank senior in right of  payment to all of DIRECTVs future subordinated debt, if any.    The Guarantees are effectively subordinated to all existing and future secured obligations, if any, of DIRECTV to the extent of the value of the assets securing the obligations.  The Guarantees provide that DIRECTV unconditionally guarantees that the principal and interest on the Notes will be paid in full when due and that the obligations of the Issuers to the holders of the outstanding Senior Notes will be performed. DIRECTV will not be subject to the covenants contained in each indenture and the Guarantees of DIRECTV will terminate and be released on the terms set forth in each Supplemental Indenture.  The maximum amount of future payments that DIRECTV may be required to make on the outstanding Senior Notes is equal to the principal amount outstanding and the interest thereon as of the date(s) such payments are due to the holders.
ITEM 3.03.     Material Modification to Rights of Security Holders.
See Item 1.01 which is incorporated herein by reference.
The foregoing description of the Supplemental Indentures and the Guarantees does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Supplemental Indentures, which are filed as Exhibits 4.1-4.5 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Investor Relations:
DIRECTV Holdings LLC and DIRECTV Financing Co., Inc. announced today that DIRECTV, a Delaware corporation (NASDAQ: DTV) has agreed to guarantee all of their outstanding Senior Notes.
EL SEGUNDO, Calif., Nov. 15, 2011  (BUSINESS WIRE) 
The outstanding Senior Notes consist of the 4.750% Senior Notes due 2014 (CUSIP 25459HAL9), 3.550% Senior Notes due 2015 (CUSIP 25459HAN5 and 25459HAM7), 3.125% Senior Notes due 2016 (CUSIP 25459HAV7), 7.625% Senior Notes due 2016 (CUSIP 25459HAE5 and 25459HAG0), 3.500% Senior Notes due 2016 (CUSIP 25459HAY1), 5.875% Senior Notes due 2019 (CUSIP 25459HAU9), 5.200% Senior Notes due 2020 (CUSIP 25459HAT2, 25459HAR6 and U25398AH8), 4.600% Senior Notes due 2021 (CUSIP 25459HAW5), 5.000% Senior Notes due 2021 (CUSIP 25459HBA2), 6.350% Senior Notes due 2040 (CUSIP 25459HAQ8), 6.000% Senior Notes due 2040 (CUSIP 25459HAX3) and 6.375% Senior Notes due 2041 (CUSIP 25459HAZ8).
DIRECTV, the indirect 100% parent company of DIRECTV Holdings LLC and DIRECTV Financing Co., Inc. (collectively, the Issuers) entered into a series of Supplemental Indentures with the Issuers, the existing subsidiary guarantors and the Trustee thereunder, The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (the Trustee), for the Issuers outstanding Senior Notes, copies of which will be filed with the SEC on Form 8-K.  On the terms set forth in the Supplemental Indentures, DIRECTV has agreed to fully guarantee (the Guarantees), jointly and severally with the existing guarantors, the Senior Notes.  As a result of the Guarantees, holders of the Senior Notes will obtain the benefit of DIRECTVs interests in the assets and related earnings of DIRECTVs operations that are not held through DIRECTV Holdings LLC and its subsidiaries. Those operations are primarily DIRECTVs direct-to-home digital television services throughout Latin America which are held by DIRECTV Latin America Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries and DIRECTV Sports Networks LLC and its subsidiaries which are comprised primarily of three regional sports television networks based in Seattle, Washington, Denver, Colorado and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  However, the subsidiaries that own and operate the DIRECTV Latin America and DIRECTV Sports Networks operating segments will not guarantee the Senior Notes.  The Issuers believe that adding the Guarantees will be beneficial by having bond investors focus on the entire consolidated DIRECTV group, including the DIRECTV Latin America and DIRECTV Sports Networks operating segments, which may reduce the Issuers future cost of capital.
Currently, DIRECTV and the Issuers are separate registrants with the SEC and file separate Forms 10-Q and 10-K and other reports with the SEC.  With the addition of the DIRECTV Guarantees, if DIRECTV includes a condensed consolidating financial information footnote in its financial statements in accordance with Rule 3-10(d) of Regulation S-X, the Issuers will no longer be required to file such reports separately under the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. Therefore, the Guarantees reduce the administrative burden and eliminate costs associated with preparation of these separate reports. In lieu of filing separate SEC reports of the Issuers, we will provide holders of the Senior Notes with DIRECTVs SEC reports, including DIRECTVs consolidated financial statements with a condensed consolidating financial information footnote, and the Issuers consolidated financial statements.

These forward-looking statements generally can be identified by use of statements that include phrases such as "believe," "expect," "estimate," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "project" or other similar words or phrases. Similarly, statements that describe our objectives, plans or goals also are forward-looking statements. All of these forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or from those expressed or implied by the relevant forward-looking statement. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: increased competition; increasing programming costs and our ability to renew programming contracts under favorable terms; increased subscriber churn or subscriber upgrade and retention costs; potential material increase in subscriber acquisition costs; general economic conditions; risks associated with doing business internationally, which for DIRECTV Latin America include political and economic instability and foreign currency exchange rate volatility and controls; pace of technological development; potential intellectual property infringement; loss of key personnel; satellite construction or launch delays; satellite launch and operational risks; loss of a satellite; theft of satellite programming signals; governmental and regulatory action; ability to maintain licenses and regulatory approvals; significant debt; indemnification obligations; reliance on network and information systems; and the outcome of legal proceedings. We may face other risks described from time to time in periodic reports filed by us with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
