Item 3.02                      Unregistered Sale of Equity Securities.
On August 27, 2012, as further described below, each issued and outstanding share of Class A Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Class A Common Stock), and Class B Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Class B Common Stock) was reclassified (the Reclassification) on a one-for-one basis into a single class of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Common Stock).  The Reclassification was exempt from registration pursuant to Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
Please see the disclosure set forth under Item 3.03 Material Modification to Rights of Security Holders, which is incorporated by reference into this Item 3.02.
Item 3.03                      Material Modification to Rights of Security Holders.
On May 3, 2012, at an annual meeting of shareholders of DIRECTV (the Company), the shareholders of the Company approved, among other things, the Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which amends the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to (i) effect the Reclassification, (ii) eliminate all references to Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock and (iii) eliminate provisions related specifically to the designation and attributes of Class B Common Stock.  The Company had retained the ability to issue shares of Class B Common Stock because of litigation that arose out of the transaction with Liberty Media Corporation in 2009, but because a final settlement has ended that litigation, it is no longer necessary to retain the ability to issue shares of Class B Common Stock.
The Company filed the Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation on August 27, 2012 with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.  The Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation became effective on August 27, 2012 (the Effective Time).
At the Effective Time, each share of the Companys issued and outstanding Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock automatically was reclassified as, and became one share of, a new single class of Common Stock that has the same voting powers, preferences, rights and qualifications, limitations and restrictions as the prior Class A Common Stock.  The Reclassification had the following effects, among others, on the holders of Class A Common Stock:
.  Prior to the Reclassification, holders of shares of Class B Common Stock were entitled to 15 votes per share on any matters subject to a stockholder vote, and holders of shares of Class A Common Stock were entitled to cast one vote per share.  As a result of the Reclassification, all shareholders have only one vote per share on all matters subject to a stockholder vote.
Voting Power
.  The Reclassification had no impact on the economic interest of holders of Class A Common Stock, including with regard to dividends, liquidation rights and redemption.
Economic Interests
.  As part of the Reclassification, the Company increased the number of authorized shares of Common Stock from 3,947,000,000 to 3,950,000,000.
Capitalization
.  Shares of Common Stock may be sold in the same manner as shares of Class A Common Stock were previously sold.
Resale of Common Stock
.  Upon the Reclassification, outstanding options and restricted stock units denominated in shares of Class A Common Stock issued under any of the Companys equity incentive
Equity Incentive Plans
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
plans remained unchanged, except that they now represent the right to receive shares of the new single class of Common Stock rather than the prior Class A Common Stock.
The foregoing description of the Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1.  The Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation is incorporated herein by reference.
The Common Stock will trade on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol DTV.  The CUSIP number for the Common Stock is 25490A309.
Item 5.03                      Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or By-laws; Change in Fiscal Year.
Please see the disclosure set forth above under Item 3.03 Material Modification to Rights of Security Holders, which is incorporated by reference into this Item 5.03.
In connection with the filing of the Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the By-laws of the Company were amended and restated to eliminate obsolete provisions relating to the prior dual-class common stock structure.
A copy of the Amended and Restated By-laws is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.2 and is incorporated herein by reference.  The foregoing description of the Restated By-laws is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Restated By-laws.

If a Special Meeting Request is made that complies with this Section 1(b) and all other applicable Sections of these By-Laws, the Board may (in lieu of the Secretary calling the special meeting requested in such Special Meeting Request) present an identical or substantially similar item (a Similar Item) for stockholder approval at any other meeting of stockholders that is held within 120 days after the Corporation receives such Special Meeting Request. A Special Meeting Request must be delivered by hand or by mail by registered U.S. mail or courier service, postage prepaid, to the attention of the Secretary of the Corporation during regular business hours.
 
(3)           A Special Meeting Request shall only be valid if it is signed and dated by each of the Requisite Holders or its duly authorized agent and include: (i) a statement of the specific purpose(s) of the special meeting, the matter(s) proposed to be acted on at the special meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the special meeting; (ii) the text of any proposed amendment to the By-Laws to be considered at the special meeting; (iii) the name and address, as they appear on the Corporations books, of each stockholder of record signing such request, the date of each such stockholders signature and the name and address of any beneficial owner on whose behalf such request is made; (iv) the class or series and number of shares of the capital stock of the Corporation that are owned of record or beneficially by each such stockholder and any such beneficial owner and documentary evidence of such record or beneficial ownership; (v) any material interest of each stockholder or any such beneficial owner in the business proposed to be conducted at the special meeting; (vi) a representation that the stockholders and such beneficial owners submitting the Special Meeting Request intend to appear in person or by proxy at the special meeting to present the proposal(s) or business to be brought before the special meeting; (vii) if any stockholder submitting the Special Meeting Request intends to solicit proxies with respect to the stockholders proposal(s) or business to be presented at the special meeting, a representation to that effect; (viii) all information relating to each stockholder signing the Special Meeting Request that must be disclosed in solicitations for proxies for election of

directors in an election contest (even if an election contest is not involved), or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation l4A under the Exchange Act; and (ix) if the purpose of the special meeting includes the election of one or more Directors, all the information such stockholder or stockholders would be required to include in a notice delivered to the Corporation pursuant to Section 1(a)(2) of Article I.
 
(4)           In addition, a Special Meeting Request shall not be valid if: (i) the Special Meeting Request relates to an item of business that is not a proper subject for stockholder action under applicable law; (ii) the Special Meeting Request is received by the Corporation during the period commencing 90 days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the immediately preceding annual meeting and ending on the date of the next annual meeting; (iii) an identical or substantially similar item (a Similar Item) was presented at any meeting of stockholders held within 120 days prior to receipt by the Corporation of such Special Meeting Request (and, for purposes of this clause (iii), the election of Directors shall be deemed a Similar Item with respect to all items of business involving the election or removal of Directors); (iv) a Similar Item is included in the Corporations notice as an item of business to be brought before a stockholder meeting that has been called but not yet held; or (v) such Special Meeting Request was made in a manner that involved a violation of Regulation l4A under the Exchange Act or other applicable law. Stockholders may revoke a Special Meeting Request by written revocation delivered to the Corporation at any time prior to the special meeting; provided, however, the Board shall have the discretion to determine whether or not to proceed with the special meeting.
 
(5)           If none of the stockholders who submitted the Special Meeting Request for a special meeting of stockholders appears or sends a qualified representative to present the proposal(s) or business submitted by the stockholders for consideration at the special meeting, the Corporation need not present such proposal(s) or business for a vote at such meeting.
 
(6)           The foregoing notwithstanding, unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, whenever the holders of any one or more outstanding series of preferred stock shall have the right, voting separately by class or by series, as applicable, to elect Directors at any Annual Meeting or special meeting of stockholders, the calling of special meetings of the holders of such class or series shall be governed by the terms of the applicable resolution or resolutions of the Board establishing such series of preferred stock pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation.
 
(c)           In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of a special meeting or the announcement thereof commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholders notice as described above in Section 1(b) of Article I.

tendered resignation.

Should the Board determine that it would have accepted the resignation of the nominee if it had been provided as required by the provisions hereof, then the term of the nominee shall be deemed to expire on the day that is 120 days following certification of the shareholder vote and the Board will publicly disclose its decision and rationale, within 120 days following certification of the stockholder vote.
 
If each member of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee fails to receive the required vote in favor of his or her election in the same election, then those independent Directors who did receive the required vote shall consider the resignation offers and recommend to the Board whether to accept them.

Subject to Section 3 of this Article VIII, the Corporation shall indemnify, to the full extent that it shall have power under applicable law to do so and in a manner permitted by such law, any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that such person is or was a Director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was a Director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such persons conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person (i) did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and (ii) with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such persons conduct was unlawful.
 
Section 2.
Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings by or in the Right of the Corporation.
 
Subject to Section 3 of this Article VIII, the Corporation shall indemnify, to the full extent that it shall have power under applicable law to do so and in a manner permitted by such law, any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was a Director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was a Director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.

Section 3.
Authorization of Indemnification.
 
Any indemnification under this Article VIII (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the Director or officer is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Sections 1 or 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made, with respect to a person who is a Director or officer at the time of such determination, (i) by a majority vote of the Directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (ii) by a committee of such Directors designated by a majority vote of such Directors, even though less than a quorum, or (iii) if there are no such Directors, or if such Directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion or (iv) by the stockholders. Such determination shall be made, with respect to former Directors and officers, by any person or persons having the authority to act on the matter on behalf of the Corporation. To the extent, however, that a present or former Director or officer of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding described above, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the specific case.
 
Section 4.
Indemnification by a Court.
 
Notwithstanding any contrary determination in the specific case under Section 3 of this Article VIII, and notwithstanding the absence of any determination thereunder, any Director or officer may apply to the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware for indemnification to the extent otherwise permissible under Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VIII. The basis of such indemnification by a court shall be a determination by such court that indemnification of the Director or officer is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standards of conduct set forth in Section 1 or 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be. Neither a contrary determination in the specific case under Section 3 of this Article VIII nor the absence of any determination thereunder shall be a defense to such application or create a presumption that the Director or officer seeking indemnification has not met any applicable standard of conduct. Notice of any application for indemnification pursuant to this Section 4 shall be given to the Corporation promptly upon the filing of such application. If successful, in whole or in part, the Director or officer seeking indemnification shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such application to the fullest extent permitted by law.
 
Section 5.
Expenses Payable in Advance.
 
Expenses incurred by a Director or officer in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding to which such Director or officer is made or threatened to be made a party by reason of the fact he or she is or was a Director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was a Director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking, if required by applicable law, by or on behalf of such Director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article VIII.
 
Section 6.
Non-exclusivity of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses.
 
The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this Article VIII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under the Certificate of Incorporation, any By-Law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as to action in such persons official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, it being the policy of the Corporation that indemnification of the persons specified in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VIII, and advancement of expenses of the persons specified in Section 5 of this Article VIII, shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by law. The provisions of this Article VIII shall not be deemed to preclude the indemnification of any person who is not specified in Section 1 or 2 of this Article VIII or the advancement of expenses of any person who is not specified in Section 5 of this Article VIII, but whom the Corporation has the power to or obligation to indemnify under the provisions of the DGCL, or otherwise.
