Among other things, the Indenture provides that the Notes are redeemable in whole or in part at the option of the Issuers at a redemption price equal to the greater of the principal amount of the Notes and a "make whole" price equal to the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal of and interest on the Notes to be redeemed (excluding accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date and subject to the right of holders on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) discounted from their scheduled date of payment to the redemption date on an annual basis (ACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA)) using a discount rate equal to the Comparable Government Bond Rate (as defined in the First Supplemental Indenture) plus 35 basis points.
 
The Issuers will, subject to certain exceptions and limitations set forth in the Notes, pay additional amounts on the Notes as are necessary in order that the net payment by the Issuers or a paying agent of the principal of and interest on the Notes to a holder who is not a United States person, after withholding or deduction for any present or future tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed by the United States or a taxing authority in the United States will not be less than the amount provided in the Notes to be then due and payable.
 
The Indenture contains customary covenants, including restrictions on the ability of Holdings or any of its subsidiaries to create liens and on the ability of Holdings and certain Guarantors to consolidate, merge or convey or transfer substantially all of their assets.  The indenture also contains customary events of default and provides that any Guarantor may be automatically released from its obligations under the terms specified in the Indenture.
In connection with the offering of the Notes, Holdings entered into cross-currency swaps to effectively convert its 750 million aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate British pound sterling denominated debt, including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to fixed-rate U.S. dollar denominated debt.
 
The net proceeds from this offering were approximately 736 million (approximately $1,185 million), after expenses and underwriting commissions.  The Issuers intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, which may include a distribution to the Issuers' parent which it may use to fund its share repurchase plan or for other corporate purposes. Interest accrues on the Notes from September 14, 2012 and interest will be paid annually in cash in arrears on September 14 of each year commencing on September 14, 2013.  The press release announcing the closing is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated by reference herein.

(i)            any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Preliminary Prospectus, any other Time of Sale Information, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto;
 
(ii)           the omission or alleged omission to state, in the Preliminary Prospectus, any other Time of Sale Information, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; or
 
(iii)          any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, not misleading,
 
and will reimburse, as incurred, the Underwriters and each such controlling person, agent or affiliate for any legal or other expenses incurred by the Underwriters or such controlling person, agent or affiliate in connection with investigating, defending against or appearing as a third-party witness in connection with any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , the Issuers will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, or liability arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, any other Time of Sale Information, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto in reliance upon and in conformity with written information concerning the Underwriters furnished to the Issuers by the Underwriters through the Representatives specifically for use therein.  The indemnity provided for in this Section 9 will be in addition to any liability that any Issuer may otherwise have to the indemnified parties.  Nothing in this Section 9(a) shall be deemed to impose on the Underwriters any informational delivery obligations in addition to those arising under applicable law.
provided
however
 
(b)           Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Issuers, their directors, their officers and each person, if any, who controls any Issuer within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which any Issuer or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Preliminary Prospectus, any other Time of Sale Information, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto or (ii) the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated in the Preliminary Prospectus, any other Time of Sale Information, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information concerning such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter specifically for use therein; and subject to the limitation set forth immediately preceding this clause, will reimburse, as incurred, any legal or other expenses incurred by any Issuer or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating or
defending against or appearing as a third party witness in connection with any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action in respect thereof. The indemnity provided for in this Section 9 will be in addition to any liability that the Underwriters may otherwise have to the indemnified parties.
(c)           Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 10 of notice of the commencement of any action for which such indemnified party is entitled to indemnification under this Section 9, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 9, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof in writing; but the omission to so notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from any liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) above.  In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; , , that if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have been advised by counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party or (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after receipt by the indemnifying party of notice of the institution of such action, then, in each such case, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties and such indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to defend such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. After notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof and approval by such indemnified party of counsel appointed to defend such action, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 9 for any legal or other expenses, other than reasonable costs of investigation, subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof, unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that in connection with such action the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to local counsel) in any one action or separate but substantially similar actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, designated by the Representatives in the case of paragraph (a) of this Section 9 or the relevant Issuer(s) in the case of paragraph (b) of this Section 9, representing the indemnified parties under such paragraph (a) or paragraph (b), as the case may be, who are parties to such action or actions) or (ii) the indemnifying party has authorized in writing the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party.  All fees and expenses reimbursed pursuant to this paragraph (c) shall be reimbursed as they are incurred.  After such notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party, the indemnifying party will not be liable for the costs and expenses of any settlement of such action effected by such indemnified party without the prior written consent of the indemnifying party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), unless such indemnified party waived in writing its rights under this Section 9, in which case the indemnified party may effect such a settlement without such consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no indemnifying party shall be liable under this Section 9 for any settlement of any claim or action effected without its prior written consent.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement or compromise of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party, or indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such party, unless such settlement does not include any statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
provided
however
 
(d)           In circumstances in which the indemnity agreement provided for in the preceding paragraphs of this Section 9 is unavailable to, or insufficient to hold harmless, an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), each indemnifying party, in order to provide for just and equitable contribution, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by
 
such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect (i) the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other from the offering of the Notes or (ii) if the allocation provided by the foregoing clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements or omissions or alleged statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof).  The relative benefits received by the Issuers on the one hand and any Underwriter on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter.  The relative fault of the parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Issuers, on the one hand, or such Underwriter, on the other, the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission or alleged statement or omission, and any other equitable considerations appropriate in the circumstances.  The Issuers and the Underwriters agree that it would not be equitable if the amount of such contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph (d).  Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph (d), no Underwriter shall be obligated to make contributions hereunder that in the aggregate exceed the total discounts, commissions and other compensation received by such Underwriter under this Agreement, less the aggregate amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of the untrue or alleged untrue statements or the omissions or alleged omissions to state a material fact, and no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  For purposes of this paragraph (d), each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Underwriters, and each director of any Issuer, each officer of any Issuer and each person, if any, who controls any Issuer within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Issuer.  The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9(d) are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations and not joint.

In any case where notice to Holders
 
is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders. Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.

Section 113.
                            
Legal Holidays
.
 
In any case where any Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date, Repayment Date or Stated Maturity of any Security, or any date on which a Holder has the right to convert such Holder's Security, shall not be a Business Day at any Place of Payment, then (notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture or of the Securities (other than a provision of any Security which specifically states that such provision shall apply in lieu of this Section 113)) payment of principal and premium, if any, or interest, or the Redemption Price or conversion of such Security, need not be made at such Place of Payment on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day at such Place of Payment with the same force and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date or Repayment Date, or at the Stated Maturity, or on such conversion date.  In the case, however, of Securities of a series bearing interest at a floating rate based on the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR), if any Interest Payment Date (other than the Redemption Date, Repayment Date or Stated Maturity) would otherwise be a date that is not a Business Day, then the Interest Payment Date shall be postponed to the following date which is a Business Day, unless that Business Day falls in the next succeeding calendar month, in which case the Interest Payment Date will be the immediately preceding Business Day.

Each Holder of Securities by accepting a Security waives and releases all such liability.  The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issuance of any Security.

Any interest on any Security of any series which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Issuers, at their election in each case, as provided in clause (1) or (2) below:

Holder of Securities of such series in the manner set forth in Section 106, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (2).
 
(2)

Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the same trust and that each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such Trustee; and upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates; but, on request of the Issuers or any successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates.
 
Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Issuers shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in the first or second preceding paragraph, as the case may be.

In case any Securities shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by merger, conversion, consolidation or sale to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Securities; and in case at that time any Securities shall not have been authenticated, any successor to the Trustee may authenticate such Securities either in the name of any predecessor hereunder or in the name of the successor to the Trustee; and in all such cases such certificates shall have the full force which it is anywhere in the Securities or in this Indenture that the certificate of the Trustee shall have.

Guarantee.
 
Except as otherwise set forth in a Board Resolution, Officers' Certificate or supplemental indenture establishing a series of Securities and subject to the provisions of this Article XV, each Guarantor (together with any successor to such Guarantor pursuant to any merger or consolidation, unless such Guarantor's Guarantee is released in accordance with Section 1504 hereof), jointly and severally, hereby unconditionally guarantees to each Holder of a Security authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, irrespective of the validity and enforceability of this Indenture, the Securities or the Obligations of the Issuers hereunder or thereunder, that
 
(1)
                                
the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Securities will be promptly paid in full when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, redemption or otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal of and interest on the Securities, if any, if lawful, and all other obligations of the Issuers to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder will be promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof; and
 
(2)
                                
in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Securities or any of such other obligations, that the same will be promptly paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise.  Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed or any performance so guaranteed for whatever reason, each of the Guarantors, jointly and severally, will be obligated to pay the same immediately.
 
Each of the Guarantors, jointly and severally, hereby agrees that its obligations hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Securities or this Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder of the Securities with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the Issuers, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor.
 
Each of the Guarantors, jointly and severally, hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the
 
Issuers, any right to require a proceeding first against the Issuers, protest, notice (except that the Trustee shall provide at least ten days' prior written notice to the Issuers on behalf of the Guarantors before taking any action for which the Communications Act and/or the FCC rules require such notice and which right to notice is not waivable by any Guarantor) and all demands whatsoever and covenant that this Guarantee will not be discharged except by complete performance of the Obligations guaranteed hereby.  If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Issuers or any Guarantor, or any Custodian, Trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to either the Issuers or any Guarantor, any amount paid by either to the Trustee or such Holder, this Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and effect.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any Guarantee would constitute or result in a violation of any applicable fraudulent conveyance or similar law of any relevant jurisdiction, the liability of the applicable Guarantor under its Guarantee shall be reduced to the maximum amount permissible under such fraudulent conveyance or similar law.
 
The Guarantors hereby agree as among themselves that each Guarantor that makes a payment or distribution under a Guarantee shall be entitled to a contribution from each other Guarantor hereunder based on the net assets of each other Guarantor.  The preceding sentence shall in no way affect the rights of the Holders of Securities to the benefits hereof, the Securities or the Guarantees.

Such successor corporation thereupon may cause to be signed any or all of the Guarantees to be issuable hereunder by such Guarantor and delivered to the Trustee.  All the Guarantees so issued shall in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit under this Indenture as the Guarantees theretofore and thereafter issued in

In addition, a Guarantor shall be released and relieved of its obligations under its Guarantee if (1) such Guarantor is dissolved or liquidated in accordance with the provisions hereof; (2) in the case of any Guarantor other than the Parent Guarantor, such Guarantor no longer guarantees or is otherwise obligated under the Senior Revolving Credit Facility or any of the Existing Notes; (3) in the case of the Parent Guarantor's Guarantee only, the Company ceases for any reason to be a "wholly owned subsidiary" (as such term is defined in Rule 1-02(aa) of Regulation S-X promulgated by the Commission) of the Parent Guarantor; or (4) with respect to a series of Securities, the Issuers effectively discharge their obligations or defease all Securities of such series in compliance with the terms of Section 401 or Article 13 hereof.  Upon delivery by the Company to the Trustee of an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such sale or other disposition was made by the Company in accordance with the provisions hereof, if applicable, the Trustee shall execute any documents pursuant to written direction of the Company in order to evidence the release of any such Guarantor from its obligations under its Guarantee.

Section 2.1.
                                
Designation and Principal Amount
.There is hereby authorized and established a series of Securities under the Indenture, designated as the "4.375% Senior Notes due 2029," which is initially limited in aggregate principal amount to 750,000,000 (except upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for, or in lieu of, other Notes pursuant to Section 304, 305, 306, 906 or 1107 of the Indenture and except for any Securities which, pursuant to Section 303 of the Indenture, are deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered).

Section 2.3.
                                
Further Issues
.  The Company may at any time and from time to time, without the consent of the Holders of any series of the Notes, issue additional Notes of any series.  Any such additional Notes shall have the same ranking, interest rate, maturity date and other terms as the relevant series of the Notes.  Any such additional notes of a series, together with the Notes of the relevant series herein provided for, shall constitute a single series of Securities under the Indenture.
 
Section 2.4.

Sterling
provided
 
that the then current market practice in respect of the redenomination into euro of internationally offered securities is different from the provisions specified herein, such provision will be deemed to be amended so as to comply with such market practice and the Company will promptly notify the Trustee and Paying Agent of such deemed amendment.  The Company will give 30 days' notice of the redenomination date to the Paying Agent, the Trustee and Euroclear/Clearstream.
 
If Sterling or, in the event the Notes are redenominated in euro, euro is unavailable to the Company due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the Company's control (other than due to the circumstances described in the preceding paragraph), then all payments in respect of the Note will be made in U.S. dollars until Sterling or euro, as the case may be, is again available to the Company. The amount payable on any date in Sterling or, in the event the Notes are redenominated in euro, euro will be converted to U.S. dollars on the basis of the then most recently available market exchange rate for Sterling or euro, as the case may be. Any payment in respect of the Note so made in U.S. dollars will not constitute an event of default under the Indenture. Neither the Trustee nor the Paying Agent shall be responsible for obtaining exchange rates, effecting conversions or otherwise handling redenominations.
 
For purposes of these Notes, the Place of Payment shall be the City of London.

The Notes of this series are not entitled to the benefit of any sinking fund.
 
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness of the Notes of this series or certain restrictive covenants and Events of Default with respect to such Notes, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture.

Interest on the Notes shall be computed on the basis of the actual number of days in the period for which interest is being calculated and the actual number of days from and including the date from which interest begins to accrue for the period (or September 14, 2012 if no interest has been paid on the Notes), to but excluding the next scheduled Interest Payment Date.

Principal and interest payments in respect of the Notes will be payable in Sterling.  If the United Kingdom adopts euro, in lieu of Sterling, as its lawful currency, the Notes will be redenominated in euro on a date determined by the Company, with a principal amount for each Note equal to the principal amount of that Note in Sterling, converted into euro at the rate established by the applicable law; provided that, if the Company determines that the then current market practice in respect of the redenomination into euro of internationally offered securities is different from the provisions specified above, such provisions will be deemed to be amended so as to comply with such market practice and the Company will promptly notify the Trustee and the Paying Agent of such deemed amendment.  The Company will give 30 days' notice of the redenomination date to the Paying Agent, the Trustee, and Euroclear/Clearstream.
 
If Sterling or, in the event the Notes are redenominated in euro, euro is unavailable to the Company due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the Company's control (other than due to the circumstances described in the preceding paragraph), then all payments in respect of the Note will be made in U.S. dollars until Sterling or euro, as the case may be, is again available to the Company.  The amount payable on any date in Sterling or, in the event the Notes are redenominated in euro, euro will be converted to U.S. dollars on the basis of the then most recently available market exchange rate for Sterling or euro, as the case may be.  Any payment in respect of the Note so made in U.S. dollars will not constitute an event of default under the Indenture.
