Within 30 days following the day of Closing, Purchaser will provide Sellers with a list (the "") of such Hired Employees who did not actively report to work for the Purchaser on the Employee Transition Date. With respect to any Hired Employees who are not scheduled to report to work on the first Business Day following the day of Closing because of (i) an absence under the applicable personal paid time or similar policy, or (ii) a work schedule that did not identify such day as a work day for such Hired Employee, the first day such Hired Employee is scheduled to return to work shall be used for preparation of the Absentee List instead of the Employee Transition Date.

Purchaser agrees to employ the Hired Employees on terms that are in the aggregate, during the initial 12 months of employment from the Employee Transition Date (a) generally as favorable as such Employees' current employment terms with respect to salary, benefits, bonuses, base hours and vacation and (b) no less favorable than those afforded to similarly situated employees of Purchaser and its Affiliates (with credit for any prior payments toward benefit deductibles based upon satisfactory documentation provided by the employee). Purchaser will pay employees at a rate of pay that is comparable to other similarly situated employees at their place of
(d)
                                
employment. To the extent that this results in a pay reduction based upon the base salary in effect as of the Closing Date, the employee will be offered a signing bonus that is equal to lost base wages for a twelve month time frame based upon a forty hour work week.
 
The Parties agree that, with respect to all Hired Employees identified on the final Absentee List, as approved by Sellers, (i) Purchaser will notify Sellers as soon as reasonably practicable following the day on which each such Hired Employee actively reports to work for Purchaser (the "") and (ii) Purchaser will be solely responsible for and pay each such Hired Employee, from and after the Closing Date through the First Reported Day, such leave of absence payments as such Hired Employee was receiving immediately prior to the Closing Date and provide such Hired Employee with benefits as provided under , including but not limited to, medical benefits; provided, however, that if the First Reported Day for any Hired Employee does not occur within sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, Purchaser agrees to notify Sellers of this fact and each of Purchaser and Sellers agree to cooperate as reasonably appropriate if it becomes necessary for such Hired Employee to apply for long-term disability under the applicable Dynegy Benefit Plan (defined below) as a result of a pre-Closing claim giving rise to liability for long-term disability benefits under Dynegy Benefit Plans as provided in ; and provided, further, that if such Hired Employee applies for and is determined to be eligible for long-term disability benefits under the applicable Dynegy Benefit Plans, then as of the date of determination of such long-term disability (the ""), Purchaser and Sellers agree to take such action as is necessary for Sellers to provide long-term disability, medical, dental and other applicable benefits to such Hired Employee from and after the LTD Determination Date, for as long as Sellers provide such benefits under the applicable Sellers' Benefit Plans to similarly situated employees.]

IN WITNESS WHEREOF
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
CHARLOTTE, N.C.  Duke Energy today announced an agreement to acquire an approximately 825 megawatt power plant located in Rockingham County, N.C., from Dynegy for approximately $195 million.
 
The plant, which went into operation in 2000, consists of five 165 megawatt Westinghouse combustion turbine units capable of using either natural gas or oil to operate.
 
The acquisition is consistent with Duke Energy's Integrated Resource Plan, which describes the company's plan to meet customers' electricity needs over the next twenty years. Under that plan, Duke Energy recently conducted a competitive "Request for Proposals" (RFP) bidding process for peaking capacity to meet growing customer demand for electricity in North Carolina and South Carolina.
 
"We received a number of bids related to our recent RFP," said Duke Energy Carolinas President Ellen Ruff. "As we looked at the needs of our customers and our system and the cost of meeting those needs, it was clear the best overall deal was an outright purchase of the Rockingham plant.
 
"Not only will this plant provide our customers with competitively priced peaking capacity, it will also enhance the reliability of our transmission system by providing
 
 
additional voltage support," Ruff continued. "We're excited to add the Rockingham plant to our generation fleet and we look forward to working with Dynegy, the North Carolina Utilities Commission and other regulatory authorities in the coming months to complete this win-win transaction."
 
The transaction, anticipated to close by year-end, requires North Carolina Utilities Commission, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and Hart-Scott-Rodino approvals.
 
The Rockingham plant is located north of Greensboro within Duke Energy's North Carolina service area. It is a peaking power plant  used during times of high electricity demand, generally in the winter and summer months.
 
Duke Energy is a diversified energy company with a portfolio of natural gas and electric businesses, both regulated and unregulated, and an affiliated real estate company. Duke Energy supplies, delivers and processes energy for customers in the Americas. Duke Energy's Carolinas operations deliver safe, reliable and competitively priced electricity to more than 2.2 million electric customers in a 22,000 square mile service area of North Carolina and South Carolina. A diverse fuel mix of nuclear, coal-fired, hydroelectric and combustion-turbine generation provides approximately 28,000 megawatts of regulated generating capacity. Headquartered in Charlotte, N.C., Duke Energy is a Fortune 500 company traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol DUK.
