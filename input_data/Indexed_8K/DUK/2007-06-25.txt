, NO and particulate matter.  The complaints seek (1) injunctive relief to require installation of pollution control technology on various allegedly violating generating units, and (2) unspecified civil penalties in amounts of up to $27,500 per day for each violation.  A number of Duke Energy's owned and operated plants have been subject to these allegations and lawsuits.  The registrants assert that there were no CAA violations because the applicable regulations do not require permitting in cases where the projects undertaken are "routine" or otherwise do not result in a net increase in emissions.
As previously reported in the registrants' prior disclosures, in 1999-2000, the U.S. Justice Department, acting on behalf of the EPA, filed a number of complaints and notices of violation against multiple utilities across the country for alleged violations of the New Source Review (NSR) provisions of the Clean Air Act (CAA).  Generally, the government alleged that projects performed at various coal-fired units were major modifications, as defined in the CAA, and that the utilities violated the CAA when they undertook those projects without obtaining permits and installing emission controls for SO

In particular, in November 1999, the United States brought a lawsuit in the United States Federal District Court for the Southern District of Indiana against Cinergy Corp., Duke Energy Ohio, Inc., and Duke Energy Indiana, Inc. alleging various violations of the CAA for various projects at six of Cinergy's owned and co-owned generating stations in the Midwest. Additionally, the suit claims that Cinergy violated an Administrative Consent Order entered into in 1998 between the EPA and Cinergy relating to alleged violations of Ohio's State Implementation Plan (SIP) provisions governing particulate matter at Unit 1 at Duke Energy Ohio's W.C. Beckjord Station.  In addition, three northeast states and two environmental groups have intervened in the case.
In August 2005, the district court ruled that in determining whether a project was projected to increase annual emissions, it would not hold hours of operation constant.  In June 2007, the district court granted the government's motions for partial summary judgment, concluding that certain of the specified projects included in the government's claim were not "routine".  The district court also rejected Cinergy's affirmative defense that it was not given fair notice of the legal standards that apply in determining whether a project was projected to result in emissions increases and whether a project qualified for the "routine" exception to NSR.  The registrants anticipate a jury trial being set for 2008 to determine whether the projects were expected to result in a net increase in emissions.  Liability and remedy phases of the case are bifurcated, and no date for a remedy trial has been set at this point.   It is not possible to predict with certainty whether the registrants will incur any liability or to estimate the damages, if any, that the registrants might incur in connection with this matter.
