Item 1.01.  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Unit 6 will consist of one pulverized coal fired, supercritical, single-reheat boiler with Selective Catalytic NOx Reduction (SCR) system; tandem-compound, four-flow, condensing steam turbine-generator; dry flue gas desulfurization (DFGD) and fabric filter system; wet flue gas desulfurization (WFGD) system; material handling systems for fuel, limestone, gypsum and ash; and all associated appurtenances.   As part of this agreement, DE Carolinas has engaged SWNE to integrate and construct a related and previously-approved flue gas desulfurization (FGD) system on Unit 5 at the Station.   The Cliffside Unit 5 FGD is planned to be in service by mid 2010.  The total contract value with SWNE for the combined work for Unit 6 and the Unit 5 FGD is approximately $1.29 billion.  DE Carolinas has rights to terminate this agreement at any time for its convenience, subject to customary cancellation and demobilization charges in accordance with the terms of the agreement.
On July 11, 2007, Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC ("DE Carolinas") entered into an engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning services agreement with Stone & Webster National Engineering, P.C., an affiliate of The Shaw Group Inc., ("SWNE") for the construction of one new nominally-rated 800MW state-of-the-art supercritical pulverized coal unit ("Unit 6") at DE Carolina's coal-fired Cliffside Generating Station located on the border of Cleveland and Rutherford Counties in North Carolina (the "Station").  The project will provide base-load capacity to the Carolinas system with Unit 6 planned to begin commercial operation by summer of 2012.
