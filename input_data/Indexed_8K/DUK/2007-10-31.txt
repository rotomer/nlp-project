Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
Item 1.02. Termination of a Material Agreement.
 
On October 31, 2007, Duke Energy Corporation (the  "Company") entered into an amended and restated Duke Energy Corporation Executives' Savings Plan (the "ESP") and Duke Energy Corporation Directors' Savings Plan (the "DSP").  The ESP is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan that permits selected executives to defer base pay, short-term incentives awards and certain long-term incentive awards on a tax-favored basis, and receive company matching contributions to the extent such contributions could not be made under the Company's tax qualified 401(k) plan due to Internal Revenue Code limits. The DSP is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan that permits non-employee members of the Company's board of directors to defer retainers (cash and stock) and meeting fees on a tax-favored basis. In connection with the entry into the ESP and DSP, the Company also merged the legacy Cinergy Corp. nonqualified deferred compensation plans for executives and non-employee directors into the ESP and DSP, respectively, and amended the plans to reflect the restrictions on nonqualified deferred compensation plans that are contained in Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.  The ESP and DSP are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 5.02.
Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
 
On October 25, 2007, Daniel R. DiMicco and Philip R. Sharp were appointed to the Board of Directors of Duke Energy Corporation to fill two new director positions.  Their directorships will expire, along with the Company's other directors' terms, at the next annual meeting of shareholders.  There is no arrangement or understanding between Messrs. DiMicco or Sharp and any other persons or entities pursuant to which Messrs. DiMicco or Sharp was appointed as a director.  As non-employee directors of the Company, Messrs. DiMicco and Sharp will receive a pro-rated payment of the cash and stock annual retainer, will receive meeting fees in accordance with the Company's Director Compensation Program, as set forth in the Company's proxy statement filed April 4, 2007, and will be eligible to participate in the DSP.
 
Messrs. DiMicco and Sharp are subject to the Company's Stock Ownership Guidelines, which require outside directors to own at least 4,000 shares of Company common stock (or common stock equivalents).  Messrs. DiMicco and Sharp have until 2012 to meet the target level.
 
The Company issued a press release announcing the appointment of Messrs. DiMicco and Sharp to the Board of Directors on October 25, 2007.  A copy of the press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1.

General Rule
participation of all Employees who satisfy such criteria.  The Committee may at any time, in its sole discretion, change the eligibility criteria for Employees, or determine that one or more Participants will cease to be eligible to participate.
3.2           .  Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 3.1 to the contrary, any individual with respect to whom amounts have been assumed from Prior Plans as described in Section 5.1 shall automatically participate, and be a "Participant," in the Plan with respect to such amounts.

An individual's right to defer shall cease with respect to the Plan Year following the Plan Year in which he or she ceases to be eligible to participate in the Plan, although such individual shall continue to be subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Plan for as long as he or she remains a Participant.

Each eligible Participant may irrevocably elect to defer in accordance with the terms of this Plan, a percentage up to 75% (such percentage to be a multiple of 1%) of such Participant's Base Pay for the Plan Year.  Unless an earlier date is specified by the Committee, such election must be made by the Participant not later than the beginning of such Plan Year or within 30 days of a Participant initially becoming eligible to participate in the Plan (or any other plan required to be aggregated with the Plan under Section 409A of the Code) under Section 3.1.  In the event that a Participant first becomes eligible to participate in the Plan other than on the first day of a Plan Year, he or she shall have no right to defer Base Pay prior to the date that is 30 days after he or she initially becomes eligible to participate in the Plan, and his or her Deferral Election shall apply only to Base Pay earned beginning with the first payroll period that begins immediately after the date that is 30 days after he or she initially becomes eligible to participate in the Plan.  Base Pay deferred pursuant to this Section shall be credited to the Participant's Account at the time such Base Pay otherwise would be paid to the Participant.
Base Pay Deferrals
4.2           .  Each eligible Participant may irrevocably elect to defer in accordance with the terms of this Plan, a percentage up to 75% (such percentage to be a multiple of 1%) of the amount payable with respect to a Plan Year to such Participant as an award under any Incentive Plans.  Such election must be made by the Participant not later than the last day (or such earlier date as specified by the Committee) of the Plan Year immediately preceding the first day of the performance period for which such amount would otherwise be earned.  Such amounts shall be credited to the Participant's Account as of the dates that award amounts under the Incentive Plans otherwise would be paid to the Participant.
Incentive Plan Deferrals
4.3           .  Each eligible Participant may irrevocably elect to defer, in accordance with the terms of this Plan, the entire amount of any nonvested LTIP Award, subject to the following conditions:
Long-Term Incentive Plan Award Deferrals
(a)           .  Except as otherwise provided in this Section, the Deferral Election shall be made by, and shall become irrevocable as of, December 31 (or such earlier date as specified by the Committee) of the Plan Year next preceding the Plan Year for which such LTIP Award is granted.
General Rule
(b)           .   To the extent permitted by the Committee, and notwithstanding anything contained in this Section to the contrary, the Deferral Election with respect to an LTIP Award that is subject to a forfeiture condition requiring the Participant's continued services for a period of at least 12 months from the date that the Participant obtains a "legally binding right" to such compensation (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) must be made by, and shall become irrevocable as of, the thirtieth day following the date that the Participant obtains the legally binding right to such compensation, provided that the election is made at least twelve months in advance of the earliest date at which the forfeiture condition could lapse.  For this purpose, a condition will not be treated as failing to require the Participant to continue to provide services for a period of at least 12 months merely because the condition immediately lapses upon the death or disability (as defined in Section 409A of the Code) of the Participant, or upon a Change in Control (as defined in Section 409A of the Code), provided that if such death, disability, or Change in Control occurs and the condition lapses before the end of such 12-month period, the Deferral Election made under this Section 4.3(b) shall not apply to such compensation.
Compensation Subject to Vesting
(c)           .  To the extent permitted by the Company, and notwithstanding anything contained in this Section to the contrary, the Deferral Election with respect to an LTIP Award that constitutes Performance-Based Compensation must be made by, and shall become irrevocable as of, the date that is six months before the end of the applicable performance period (or such earlier date as specified by the Committee on the Deferral Election), provided that in no event may such Deferral Election be made after such LTIP Award has become "readily ascertainable" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.  In order to make a Deferral Election under this Section 4.3(c), the Participant must perform services continuously from the later of the beginning of the performance period or the date the performance criteria are established through the date a Deferral Election becomes irrevocable under this Section 4.3(c).  An election made under this Section 4.3(c) shall not apply to any portion of the Performance-Based Compensation that is actually earned by a Participant regardless of satisfaction of the performance criteria.
Performance-Based Compensation
(d)           .  Upon the date that an LTIP Award that the Participant has elected to defer otherwise would have been payable, the number of shares of stock or the cash payment that would have become so payable but for the Deferral Election shall be credited to the Duke Energy Common Stock - Stock Deferrals Subaccount.
Crediting Date
(e)           .  Dividend equivalents, to the extent deferred, shall also be deferred and credited to the Participant's Duke Energy Common Stock - Stock Deferrals Subaccount commencing on the payment date of the first cash dividend of Duke Energy Common Stock that is declared after the date on which the deferred LTIP Award vests.
Dividend Equivalents
4.4           .  Each eligible Participant may irrevocably elect to defer, in accordance with the terms of this Plan, 100% of the amounts that would otherwise become payable as dividend equivalents, with respect to an LTIP Award with respect to which the LTIP Award agreement specifically provides for the deferral of dividend equivalents.  Such election must be made by the Participant at the time the Participant elects to defer receipt of the related LTIP Award pursuant to the terms of Section 4.3.  Dividend equivalents that have been deferred pursuant to the first sentence of this Section and credited to the Participant's Account shall be credited to the Participant's Duke Energy Common Stock - Stock Deferrals Subaccount as of the dates such amounts would otherwise become payable pursuant to such LTIP Award.
Dividend Equivalents Deferrals
4.5           .  The Company maintains the RSP, pursuant to which Employees are permitted to make certain contributions with respect to which the Company makes matching contributions, based on the Employee's contribution election.  It is the Company's intention to provide matching contribution credits under this Plan where matching contributions cannot be provided under the RSP due to:  (i) the application of Section 401(a)(17) of the Code, (ii) the application of Section 402(g) of the Code or (iii) the application of Section 415 of the Code.  Accordingly, during the first 90 daysfollowing each Plan Year, but only with respect to Participants who are eligible for such contributions as described below,  the Participant's Account shall receive a credit (the "Company Matching Contribution") equal to the amount, if any, by which the lesser of the amounts in subparagraph (a) or (b) below, exceeds the amount in subparagraph (c) below; , , that no such Company Matching Contribution shall be made if it relates to compensation attributable to services performed prior to the date that the distribution option election for that contribution becomes irrevocable.  A Participant only shall be eligible for Company Matching Contributions for a Plan Year if (i) he or she was eligible to participate in the Plan during such Plan Year and (ii) was employed by the Affiliated Group as of the last day of such Plan Year.
Retirement Savings Plan - Excess Matching Contribution
provided
however
(a)           The maximum matching contribution the Participant was eligible to receive for the Plan Year under the RSP based upon the Participant's Eligible Earnings as defined in the RSP for the Plan Year, but determined without regard to the limitations of Code Section 401(a)(17) and any Base Pay deferrals and Incentive Plan deferrals pursuant to Sections 4.1 and 4.2.
(b)           The Participant's Before-Tax Eligible Deferrals and Roth Contributions under the RSP for the Plan Year plus the Participant's Base Pay deferrals and Incentive Plan deferrals credited to the Participant's Account during the Plan Year pursuant to Sections 4.1 and 4.2.
(c)           The Matching Contribution credited to the Participant's account under the RSP for the Plan Year.
4.6           .  The Company may, from time to time, in its sole discretion, direct that a special credit in such amount as the Company shall determine be made to a specified Participant's Account in order to (i) mitigate an unintended shortfall in matching contribution credit, or (ii) implement provisions of an employment agreement.  A special credit may be awarded subject to such vesting requirement as the Company shall determine (provided that upon a Change in Control, any special credit shall become vested if the affected Participant has not previously incurred a Separation from Service) and, notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, to the extent any such special credit has not become vested, it shall not be paid under the Plan.
Other Company Contributions
4.7           .  Unless otherwise specified by the Committee in accordance with procedures established from time to time, an election to defer Base Pay, Incentive Plan compensation and LTIP Awards shall apply only with respect to the compensation to which such election specifically relates, and such Deferral Election cannot be revoked.  The Committee may, in its sole discretion, cancel a Participant's Deferral Election due to an Unforeseeable Emergency or a hardship distribution pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(k)-1(d)(3).
Elections
5.1           .  As described in more detail in Appendix A, the Plan governs the terms and conditions of all or a portion of the amounts previously earned under the following plans (each a "Prior Plan"):  (i) the Duke Power Company Compensation Deferral Plan, first effective as of July 1, 1983 ("CDP"), (ii) the Panhandle Eastern Corporation Key Executive Deferred Compensation Plan as amended and restated January 1, 1996 ("KEDCP"), (iii) the Crescent Resources Incentive Deferral Plan ("CRIDP"), (iv) the Company's Supplementary Defined Contribution Plan, (v) the Company's Incentive Deferral Plan, (vi) the Cinergy Corp. 401(k) Excess Plan, (vii) the Cinergy Corp. Nonqualified Deferred Incentive Compensation Plan and (viii) the Cinergy Corp. Excess Profit Sharing Plan.  For purposes of clarity, the Plan is the successor to the Duke Energy Corporation Executive Savings Plan I and the Duke Energy Corporation Executive Savings Plan II.  Amounts that were previously payable under the Prior Plans and that have been credited to Accounts hereunder shall remain subject to the same vesting schedule and elections (including deferral and distribution elections) and beneficiary designations that were controlling under the applicable Prior Plan immediately prior to the date such amounts were credited to Accounts under the Plan until a new election is made in accordance with the terms of this Plan that by its terms supersedes the prior election.  This Plan shall recognize any amount that was properly deferred by a Participant under a Prior Plan but that had not yet been credited to his or her account thereunder as of the date the obligations under such plan were assumed by this Plan.  Each Participant's right to receive any benefit that has been transferred to this Plan shall be determined solely pursuant to the terms of this Plan.  All of the Company's obligations and Participants' rights with respect to the amounts previously payable under the Prior Plan shall automatically be extinguished and become obligations and rights under this Plan without further action as of the Effective Date.

Whether a Participant is faced with an Unforeseeable Emergency permitting a payment under this Section is to be determined based on the relevant facts and circumstances of each case, but, in any case, a payment on account of an Unforeseeable Emergency may not be made to the extent that such emergency is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation from insurance or otherwise, by liquidation of the Participant's assets, to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not cause severe financial hardship, or by cessation of deferrals under the Plan.   Payments because of an Unforeseeable Emergency must be limited to the amount reasonably necessary to satisfy the emergency need (which may include amounts necessary to pay any Federal, state, local, or foreign income taxes or penalties reasonably anticipated to result from the payment).

If a payment is delayed pursuant to this Section, then the payment must be made either (i) during the Company's first taxable year in which the Committee reasonably anticipates, or should reasonably anticipate, that if the payment is made during such year, the deduction of such payment will not be barred by application of Section 162(m) of the Code, or (ii) during the period beginning with the first business day of the seventh month following the Participant's Separation from Service (the "six month anniversary") and ending on the later of (x) the last day of the taxable year of the Company in which the six month anniversary occurs or (y) the 15th day of the third month following the six month anniversary.

For purposes of the preceding sentence, the making of a payment that would cause inclusion in gross income or the application of any penalty provision or other provision of the Code is not treated as a violation of applicable law.
Federal Securities Laws or Other Applicable Law
(c)           .  A payment may be delayed upon such other events and conditions as the Internal Revenue Service may prescribe in generally applicable guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.
Other Events and Conditions

Notwithstanding the foregoing, payment must be made no later than the latest possible date permitted under Section 409A of the Code. Moreover, notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary except Section 7.11, and to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code, a payment will be treated as made upon the date specified under the Plan if the payment is made as close as administratively practicable to the relevant payment date specified herein, and in any event within the same calendar year.

Payment to Minors and Incapacitated Persons
9.1           .  The Company's obligation to the Participant under this Plan shall be an unfunded and unsecured promise to pay.  The rights of a Participant or Beneficiary under this Plan shall be solely those of an unsecured general creditor of the Company.  The

With respect to Post-2004 Deferrals, subject to Section 7.11 hereof, the Committee may, in its sole discretion to the extent permitted in Section 409A of the Code, provide for the acceleration of the time or schedule of a payment under the Plan upon the termination of the Plan.  With respect to Pre-2005 Deferrals attributable to the Legacy Cinergy Plans, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide for the acceleration of the time or schedule of a payment under the Plan provided such payments commence no later than the earlier of a Participant's death or Separation from Service.
Right to Terminate and Amend
10.2         .  In the event of a Change in Control, the Plan shall become irrevocable and may not be amended or terminated without the written consent of each Plan Participant who may be affected in any way by such amendment or termination, either at the time of such action or at any time thereafter.  This restriction in the event of a Change in Control shall be determined by reference to the date any amendment or resolution terminating the Plan is actually signed by an authorized party rather than the date such action purports to be effective.
Change in Control
11.1         .  Except as permitted by the Plan, no right or benefit under the Plan shall be subject to anticipation, alienation, sale, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or charge.  Any attempt to anticipate, alienate, sell, assign, pledge, encumber or charge these benefits shall be void.  No right or benefit under this Plan shall in any manner be liable for or subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities, or torts of the person entitled to the benefit.  If any Participant or Beneficiary under the Plan should become bankrupt or attempt to anticipate, alienate, sell, assign, pledge, encumber or charge any right to a benefit hereunder, then the right or benefit, in the discretion of the Committee, shall cease.  In these circumstances, the Committee may hold or apply the benefit payment or payments, or any part of it, for the benefit of the Participant or his or her Beneficiary, the Participant's spouse, children, or other dependents, or any of them, in any manner and in any portion that the Committee may deem proper.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code and subject to Section 7.12, the Committee shall honor a judgment, order or decree from a state domestic relations court which requires the payment of part or all of a Participant's or Beneficiary's interest under this Plan to an "alternate payee" as defined in Section 414(p) of the Code.
No Assignment
12.1         .  The Company intends for the Plan to be "top-hat" plan for a select group of management or highly compensated employees which is exempt from substantially all of the requirements of Title I of ERISA pursuant to Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3), and 401(a)(1) of ERISA.  The Company is the Plan sponsor under Section 3(16)(B) of ERISA.
Top Hat Plan
12.2         .  The Committee is the administrator of the Plan within the meaning of Section 3(16)(A) of ERISA.  As administrator, the Committee has the authority (without limitation as to other authority) to delegate its duties to agents and to make rules and regulations that it believes are necessary or appropriate to carry out the Plan.  The Committee has the discretion as a Plan fiduciary (i) to interpret and construe the terms and provisions of the Plan (including any rules or regulations adopted under the Plan), (ii) to determine questions of eligibility to participate in the Plan and (iii) to make factual determinations in connection with any of the foregoing.  A decision of the Committee with respect to any matter pertaining to the Plan including without limitation the Employees determined to be Participants, the benefits payable, and the construction or interpretation of any provision thereof, shall be conclusive and binding upon all interested persons.
Plan Administrator
13.1         .  If a Participant has any grievance, complaint, or claim concerning any aspect of the operation or administration of the Plan, including but not limited to claims for benefits and complaints concerning the performance or administration of the phantom investment funds (collectively referred to herein as "claim" or "claims"), the Participant shall submit the claim to the Committee, which shall have the initial responsibility for deciding the claim.
Claim
13.2         .  A claim for benefits shall be considered as having been made when submitted in writing by the claimant to the Committee.  No particular form is required for the claim, but the claim must identify the name of the claimant and describe generally the benefit to which the claimant believes he or she is entitled.  The claim may be delivered personally during normal business hours or mailed to the Committee.  All such claims shall be submitted in writing and shall set forth the relief requested and the reasons the relief should be granted.  All such claims must be submitted with the "applicable limitations period."  The "applicable limitations period" shall be two years beginning on:  (i) in the case of any lump-sum payment, the date on which the payment was made, (ii) in the case of an installment payment, the date of the first in the series of payments, or (iii) for all other claims, the date on which the action complained or grieved of occurred.
Written Claim
13.3         .  The Committee shall determine whether, or to what extent, the claim may be allowed or denied under the terms of the Plan.  If the claim is wholly or partially denied, the claimant shall be so informed by written notice within 90 days after the day the claim is submitted unless special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim.  If such an extension of time for processing is required, written notice of the extension shall be furnished to the claimant prior to the termination of the initial 90-day period.  Such extension may not exceed an additional 90 days from the end of the initial 90-day period.  The extension notice shall indicate the special circumstances requiring an extension of time and the date by which the Plan expects to render the final decision.  If notice of denial of a claim (in whole or in part) is not furnished within the initial 90-day period after the claim is submitted (or, if applicable, the extended 90-day period), the claimant shall consider that his or her claim has been denied just as if he or she had received actual notice of denial.
Committee Determination
13.4         .  The notice informing the claimant that his or her claim has been wholly or partially denied shall be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and shall include:
Notice of Determination
(a)           The specific reason(s) for the denial.
(b)           Specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based.
(c)           A description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary.
(d)           Appropriate information as to the steps to be taken if the Participant or Beneficiary wishes to submit his or her claim for review.
13.5         .  If the claim is wholly or partially denied, the claimant (or his or her authorized representative) may file an appeal of the denied claim with the Committee requesting that the claim be reviewed.  The Committee shall conduct a full and fair review of each appealed claim and its denial.  Unless the Committee notifies the claimant that due to the nature of the benefit and other attendant circumstances he or she is entitled to a greater period of time within which to submit his or her request for review of a denied claim, the claimant shall have 60 days after he or she (or his or her authorized representative) receives written notice of denial of his or her claim within which such request must be submitted to the Committee.
Appeal
13.6         .  The request for review of a denied claim must be made in writing in connection with making such request, the claimant or his or her authorized representative may:
Request for Review
(a)           Review pertinent documents.
(b)           Submit issues and comments in writing.
13.7         .  The decision of the Committee regarding the appeal shall be promptly given to the claimant in writing and shall normally be given no later than 60 days following the receipt of the request for review.  However, if special circumstances (for example, if the Committee decides to hold a hearing on the appeal) require a further extension of time for processing, the decision shall be rendered as soon as possible, but no later than 120 days after receipt of the request for review.  However, if the Committee holds regularly scheduled meetings at least quarterly, a decision on review shall be made by no later than the date of the meeting which immediately follows the Plan's receipt of a request for review, unless the request is filed within 30 days preceding the date of such meeting.  In such case, a decision may be made by no later than the date of the second meeting following the Plan's receipt of the request for review.  If special circumstances (for example, if the Committee decides to hold a hearing on the appeal) require a further extension of time for processing, the decision shall be rendered as soon as possible, but no later than the third meeting following the Plan's receipt of the request for review.  If special circumstances require that the decision shall be made beyond the initial time for furnishing the decision, written notice of the extension shall be furnished to the claimant (or his or her authorized representative) prior to the commencement of the extension.  The decision on review shall be in writing and shall be furnished to the claimant or to his or her authorized representative within the appropriate time for the decision.  If a decision on review is not furnished within the appropriate time, the claim shall be deemed to have been denied on appeal.
Determination of Appeal
13.8         .  The Committee may, in its sole discretion, decide to hold a hearing if it determines that a hearing is necessary or appropriate in order to make a full and fair review of the appealed claim.
Hearing
13.9         .  The decision on review shall include specific reasons for the decision, written in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant, as well as specific references to the pertinent Plan provisions on which the decision is based.
Decision
13.10       .  A Participant must exhaust his or her rights to file a claim and to request a review of the denial of his or her claim before bringing any civil action to recover benefits due to him or her under the terms of the Plan, to enforce his or her rights under the terms of the Plan, or to clarify his or her rights to future benefits under the terms of the Plan.  No action at law or in equity to recover under this Plan shall be commenced later than one year from the date of the decision on review (or deemed denial if no decision is issued).
Exhaustion of Appeals
13.11       .  The Committee shall exercise its responsibility and authority under this claims procedure as a fiduciary and, in such capacity, shall have the discretionary authority and responsibility (a) to interpret and construe the Plan and any rules or regulations under the Plan, (b) to determine the eligibility of Employees to participate in the Plan, and the rights of Participants to receive benefits under the Plan, and (c) to make factual determinations in connection with any of the foregoing.
Committee's Authority
14.1         .  Nothing in this Plan shall be deemed to give any person the right to remain in the employ of the Affiliated Group or its affiliates or affect the right of the Affiliated group or its affiliates to terminate any Participant's employment with or without cause.
No Right to Employment
14.2         .  Any amount required to be withheld under applicable Federal, state, local or other tax laws (including any amounts required to be withheld under Section 3121(v) of the Code) shall be withheld in such manner as the Committee shall determine and any payment under the Plan shall be reduced by the amount so withheld, as well as by any other lawful withholding.
Withholding
14.3         .  This Plan shall be construed and administered in accordance with the laws of the State of North Carolina to the extent that such laws are not preempted by Federal law.
Governing Law
14.4         .  The Account of each Spectra Energy Participant maintained under the Plan immediately prior to the Distribution Date shall be transferred to the Spectra Energy Corp Executive Savings Plan and assumed by Spectra Energy Corp as of the Distribution Date (the "Assumed Amounts"). For purposes of this Plan, the term "Assumed Amounts" shall include any amounts of Base Pay or Incentive Plan awards of a Spectra Energy Participant that are earned but not yet paid as of the Distribution Date or equity awards granted to a Spectra Energy Participant under the Duke Energy Corporation 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan, that were properly deferred by the Spectra Energy Participant under the Plan but that had not yet been credited to his or her Account under the Plan as of the Distribution Date.  Each such Spectra Energy Participant shall have no further rights under the Plan immediately after his or
Transfer of Accounts
her Account is transferred to the Spectra Energy Corp Executive Savings Plan and assumed by Spectra Energy Corp in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Employee Matters Agreement by and between Duke Energy Corporation and Spectra Energy Corp (the "Employee Matters Agreement").  Capitalized terms used in this Section 14.5 that are not defined in this Plan shall have the meaning set forth in the Employee Matters Agreement.
14.5         .  It is intended that the Plan comply with the provisions of Section 409A of the Code, so as to prevent the inclusion in gross income of any amounts deferred hereunder in a taxable year that is prior to the taxable year or years in which such amounts would otherwise actually be paid or made available to Participants or Beneficiaries. This Plan shall be construed, administered, and governed in a manner that effects such intent, and the Committee shall not take any action that would be inconsistent with such intent.  Although the Committee shall use its best efforts to avoid the imposition of taxation, interest and penalties under Section 409A of the Code, the tax treatment of deferrals under this Plan is not warranted or guaranteed.  Neither the Company, the other members of the Affiliated Group, their respective directors, officers, employees and advisors, the Board, nor the Committee (nor its designee) shall be held liable for any taxes, interest, penalties or other monetary amounts owed by any Participant, Beneficiary or other taxpayer as a result of the Plan.  Any reference in this Plan to Section 409A of the Code will also include any proposed, temporary or final regulations, or any other guidance, promulgated with respect to such Section 409A of the Code by the U.S. Department of Treasury or the Internal Revenue Service.  For purposes of the Plan, the phrase "permitted by Section 409A of the Code," or words or phrases of similar import, shall mean that the event or circumstance shall only be permitted to the extent it would not cause an amount deferred or payable under the Plan to be includible in the gross income of a Participant or Beneficiary under Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code.
Compliance with Section 409A of the Code
14.6         .  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, including any provision that requires the use of a written instrument, the Committee may establish procedures for the use of electronic or other media in communications and transactions between the Plan or the Committee and Participants and Beneficiaries.  Electronic or other media may include, but are not limited to, e-mail, the Internet, intranet systems and automated telephonic response systems.
Electronic or Other Media

The purpose of the Plan is to provide deferred compensation for the Nonemployee Directors of the Board.  This amendment and restatement of the Plan is effective as of the Effective Date.

(d)           the consummation, after the Effective Date, of (A) the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or (B) a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company, which has been approved by the shareholders of the Company; or

the commencement of the period of service to which the criteria relates and (ii) the date the outcome ceases to be substantially uncertain.

An individual's right to defer shall cease with respect to the Plan Year following the Plan Year in which he or she ceases to be eligible to participate in the Plan, although such individual shall continue to be subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Plan for as long as he or she remains a Participant.  Upon the occurrence of a Participant's Separation from Service during a Plan Year, any then-outstanding deferral election shall be cancelled and no additional amount shall be deferred pursuant to such deferral election.
Eligibility
3.2           .  Any individual who on or after the Effective Date becomes a Nonemployee Director will become a Participant in the Plan upon beginning to serve as a member of the Board of Directors.  Each eligible Participant may irrevocably elect to defer in accordance with the terms of this Plan, a percentage up to 100% (such percentage to be a multiple of 1%) of such Participant's Compensation for each Plan Year.  Unless an earlier date is specified by the Committee, such election must be made by the Participant not later than the beginning of such Plan Year or within 30 days of a Participant initially becoming eligible to participate in the Plan (or any other plan required to be aggregated with the Plan under Section 409A of the Code).  In the event that a Participant first becomes eligible to participate in the Plan other than on the first day of a Plan Year, he or she shall have no right to defer Compensation prior to the date that is 30 days after he or she initially becomes eligible to participate in the Plan, and his or her deferral election shall apply only to Compensation earned beginning 30 days after he or she initially becomes eligible to participate in the Plan.  Compensation deferred shall be credited to the Participant's Account at the time such Compensation otherwise would be paid to the Participant.  Unless otherwise specified by the Committee in accordance with procedures established from time to time, an election to defer Compensation shall apply only with respect to the Compensation earned in the Plan Year following the Plan Year in which the deferral election is made, and such deferral election cannot be revoked.

Except as otherwise provided in this Section, the deferral election shall be made by, and shall become irrevocable as of, December 31 (or such earlier date as specified by the Committee) of the Plan Year next preceding the Plan Year for which such LTIP Award is granted.  In the event that a Participant first becomes eligible to participate in the Plan other than on the first day of a Plan Year but after the commencement of a performance period, he or she shall have the right to make a deferral election within 30 days after initially becoming eligible to participate but the deferral election shall only apply to that portion of the LTIP Award that is earned for such performance period equal to the total amount of the LTIP Award earned during such
General Rule
performance period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days beginning on the day immediately after the date that is 30 days after the Participant initially becomes eligible to participate and ending on the last day of the performance period, and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the performance period.
(b)           .   To the extent permitted by the Committee, and notwithstanding anything contained in this Section to the contrary, the deferral election with respect to an LTIP Award that is subject to a forfeiture condition requiring the Participant's continued services for a period of at least 12 months from the date that the Participant obtains a "legally binding right" to such compensation (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) must be made by, and shall become irrevocable as of, the thirtieth day following the date that the Participant obtains the legally binding right to such compensation, provided that the election is made at least twelve months in advance of the earliest date at which the forfeiture condition could lapse.  For this purpose, a condition will not be treated as failing to require the Participant to continue to provide services for a period of at least 12 months merely because the condition immediately lapses upon the death or disability (as defined in Section 409A of the Code) of the Participant, or upon a Change in Control (as defined in Section 409A of the Code), provided that if such death, disability, or Change in Control occurs and the condition lapses before the end of such 12-month period, the deferral election made under this Section 3.3(b) shall not apply to such compensation.
Compensation Subject to Vesting
(c)           .  To the extent permitted by the Committee, and notwithstanding anything contained in this Section to the contrary, the deferral election with respect to an LTIP Award that constitutes Performance-Based Compensation must be made by, and shall become irrevocable as of, the date that is six months before the end of the applicable performance period (or such earlier date as specified by the Committee on the deferral election), provided that in no event may such deferral election be made after such LTIP Award has become "readily ascertainable" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.  In order to make a deferral election under this Section 3.3(c), the Participant must perform services continuously from the later of the beginning of the performance period or the date the performance criteria are established through the date a deferral election becomes irrevocable under this Section 3.3(c).  An election made under this Section shall not apply to any portion of the Performance-Based Compensation that is actually earned by a Participant regardless of satisfaction of the performance criteria.
Performance-Based Compensation
(d)           .  Upon the date that an LTIP Award that the Participant has elected to defer otherwise would have been payable, the number of shares of stock or the cash payment that would have become so payable but for the deferral election shall be credited to the Duke Energy Common Stock - Stock Deferrals Subaccount.
Crediting Date
(e)           .  Dividend equivalents, to the extent deferred, shall also be deferred and credited to the Participant's Duke Energy Common Stock - Stock Deferrals Subaccount commencing on the payment date of the first cash dividend of Duke Energy Common Stock that is declared after the date on which the deferred LTIP Award vests.
Dividend Equivalents
4.1           .  As described in more detail in Appendix A, the Plan governs the terms and conditions of all or a portion of the amounts previously earned under the following plans (each a "Prior Plan"):  (i) the Cinergy Corp. Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan and (ii) LTIP Awards previously deferred through freestanding deferral agreements (and not yet distributed) by Participants who previously were on the Board of Directors of Cinergy Corp.  Amounts that were previously payable under the Prior Plans and that have been credited to Accounts hereunder shall remain subject to the same vesting schedule and elections (including deferral and distribution elections) and beneficiary designations that were controlling under the applicable Prior Plan immediately prior to the date such amounts were credited to Accounts under the Plan until a new election is made in accordance with the terms of this Plan that by its terms supersedes the prior election.  This Plan shall recognize any amount that was properly deferred by a Participant under a Prior Plan but that had not yet been credited to his or her account thereunder as of the date the obligations under such plan were assumed by this Plan.  Each Participant's right to receive any benefit that has been transferred to this Plan shall be determined solely pursuant to the terms of this Plan.  All of the Company's obligations and Participants' rights with respect to the amounts previously payable under the Prior Plan shall automatically be extinguished and become obligations and rights under this Plan without further action as of the Effective Date.
Prior Plans
4.2           .
Application of Code Section 409A to Prior Plans
(a)           .  Any "amounts deferred" in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2005 under the Plan or Prior Plan, within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, and any earnings thereon ("Pre-2005 Deferrals"), shall be governed by the terms of the Plan or Prior Plan, as applicable, as in effect on October 3, 2004, and it is intended that such amounts and any earnings thereon be exempt from the application of Section 409A of the Code.  Nothing contained herein is intended to materially enhance a benefit or right existing under the Plan or Prior Plan as of October 3, 2004 or add a new material benefit or right to such Plan or Prior Plan.
Pre-2005 Deferrals
(b)           .  Any "amounts deferred" in taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2005 under the Plan or Prior Plan, within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, and any earnings thereon ("Post-2004 Deferrals"), shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the Plan.
Post-2004 Deferrals
4.3           .  An Account shall be established and maintained with respect to each Participant.  Each Account shall reflect the amounts credited thereto pursuant to Article IV, plus or minus adjustments made in accordance with the provisions of Article IV and reduced by distributions made in accordance with Article VI.
Maintenance of Participant Accounts
4.4           .  In accordance with such rules as the Committee shall approve, Investment Options shall be available hereunder that generally correspond with each RSP investment option and such other investment options as are determined to be appropriate by the Committee.  Each Participant hereunder shall specify, in accordance with this Section and rules established by the Committee, the "investment" of his or
Phantom Investment Options Generally
her Account in one or more Investment Options hereunder.  The Participant's Account shall thereafter be automatically adjusted daily (or on such other basis as the Committee shall approve), upward or downward, in proportion to the total percentage return experienced for the respective period on amounts invested in the Investment Options.  Accounts under the Plan shall be bookkeeping accounts reflecting units of phantom Investment Options hereunder which mirror the performance that would have resulted from an actual investment in the corresponding Investment Option(s).  No amounts actually shall be invested hereunder in any Investment Option.  The Plan's investment option that corresponds to the RSP's Duke Energy Common Stock Fund shall be referred to as the "Duke Energy Common Stock Fund".
4.5           .   Amounts credited to a Participant's Account pursuant to Section 3.3 shall be held in a subaccount within such Participant's Account (the "Duke Energy Common Stock - Stock Deferrals Subaccount").  The amounts in the Duke Energy Common Stock - Stock Deferrals Subaccount shall be credited and maintained as units of a phantom investment that mirrors the performance of Duke Energy Corporation common stock (with cash dividends reinvested).  No transfers may be made into or out of the Duke Energy Common Stock - Stock Deferrals Subaccount.
Duke Energy Common Stock - Stock Deferrals Subaccount
4.6           .  Each phantom unit of Duke Energy Corporation common stock credited to the Duke Energy Common Stock - Stock Deferrals Subaccount and the Duke Energy Common Stock Fund on behalf of a Participant at the time of the spin-off of Spectra Energy Corp, whether under the Plan or a Prior Plan, was converted, as of such spin-off, into phantom units of Spectra Energy Corp common stock and phantom units of Duke Energy Corporation common stock and reallocated as described below.  The number of phantom units of Spectra Energy Corp common stock was equal to the number of shares of Spectra Energy Corp common stock to which the Participant would have been entitled on the spin-off had the phantom units of Duke Energy Corporation common stock represented actual shares of Duke Energy Corporation as of the record date of the spin-off, the resulting number of phantom units of Spectra Energy Corp common stock being rounded down to the nearest whole unit.  The resulting number of phantom units of Spectra Energy Corp common stock was automatically transferred from the Duke Energy Common Stock - Stock Deferrals Subaccount and the Duke Energy Common Stock Fund and credited to the Investment Option that invested primarily in Spectra Energy Corp common stock (the "Spectra Common Stock Fund"), effective as of the spin-off.  Each Participant is entitled to elect, pursuant to rules and procedures prescribed by the Company, to reallocate amounts deemed invested in the Spectra Common Stock Fund into any other open Investment Option.  The Spectra Common Stock Fund shall be closed to additional deferrals and to transfers from any other Investment Option.
Adjustments to Reflect Spin-Off of Spectra Energy Corp
4.7           .  If there shall occur any merger, consolidation, liquidation, issuance of rights or warrants to purchase securities, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, spin-off, split-off, stock split, reverse stock split or other distribution with respect to the shares of the Company or Spectra Energy Corp, or any similar corporate transaction or event in respect of such shares, then the Committee shall, in the manner and to the extent that it deems appropriate and equitable to the Participants and consistent with the terms of this Plan, cause a proportionate adjustment to be made in number and kind of shares deemed held under the Plan.  Moreover, in the event of any such transaction or event, the Committee, in its discretion, may provide in substitution for any or all outstanding shares under the Plan such
Adjustments to Stock Funds
alternative consideration as it, in good faith, may determine to be equitable under the circumstances.
4.8           .  The portion of a Participant's Account that, as of December 31, 2000, was maintained as a Fixed Interest Subaccount, shall be transferred, on January 1, 2001, to a special fixed interest investment option, where it shall continue to be credited with interest in the same manner and at the rates that would have been applicable under the Fixed Interest Subaccount had the Fixed Interest Subaccount continued.  On and after January 1, 2001, the Participant (or, if the Participant is dead, the Participant's beneficiary) may elect to transfer amounts from the fixed interest investment option to any open investment option, but the fixed interest investment option shall be closed to additional deferrals and to transfer from any other investment option.
Fixed Interest Subaccount
5.1           .  A Participant is 100% vested in his or her Account.
General Rule
6.1           .  Except as otherwise provided below, following Separation from Service, a Participant will receive, or will begin to receive, payment of his or her benefits under this Plan, which consist of the portion of his or her Account that is vested, as determined under Article V.  Each Participant who served on the Board of Directors on January 1, 2001, who made an irrevocable election prior to such date, and who continuously served on the Board of Directors through attainment of age 62, shall not commence to receive his or her payment of his or her benefits under the Plan until attainment of age 70 or his or her earlier death.
Commencement Date

(a)           .  With respect to Pre-2005 Deferrals, each Participant has been provided the opportunity to elect from among the distribution options specified in Section 6.3, the manner in which such Participant's Account shall be paid following Separation from Service.  A Participant may elect to change the distribution option for his or her Pre-2005 Deferrals, other than any such amounts attributable to the Legacy Cinergy Plans, to a distribution option permitted under Section 6.3 once in any 12 month period, but any such change shall become effective one year from the date on which the election form was submitted to the Committee, but only if the Participant remains on the Board of Directors throughout such one year period.  Failure to timely elect a distribution option with respect to Pre-2005 Deferrals shall result in a deemed election of five annual installments with respect to such amounts.
Pre-2005 Deferrals
(b)           .  With respect to each amount deferred under the Plan after 2007, each Participant shall, in accordance with procedures established from time to time by the Committee and no later than the last day for filing the deferral election to which such deferrals relate, be entitled to make a separate class-year election from among the distribution options specified in Section 6.4.  With respect to all amounts deferred under the Plan after 2004 and before 2008, each Participant shall, in accordance with procedures established from time to time by the Committee consistent with Section 6.6, be entitled to make a single election (which may be separate for deferrals of LTIP Award and deferrals of other Compensation) from among the distribution options specified in Section 6.4.  A Participant may not elect to change such elections.  Failure to timely elect a distribution option with respect to Post-2004 Deferrals shall result in a deemed election of payment in a single lump sum.
Post-2004 Deferrals
6.3           .  Subject to the foregoing, the following distribution options are available with respect to Pre-2005 Deferrals:

An annual installment shall be paid as promptly as administratively feasible after the cash amount and number of whole shares of Company common stock, including the cash amount for any fractional share, are to be included in the installment have been determined.
Term Payments
(c)           .  The Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, shorten or lengthen the time period over which a benefit is to be paid or to provide for periodic payment of a benefit that otherwise would be paid in lump sum or for lump sum payment of a benefit that otherwise would be paid periodically.
Discretion to Change Distribution Option
(d)           .  Notwithstanding Section 6.3(a), 6.3(b) and 6.3(c), Pre-2005 Deferrals attributable (i) to the Cinergy Corp. Directors' Deferred Compenation Plan shall be payable in a lump sum payment on the first business day of the Plan Year following the Plan Year in which the Participant has a Separation from Service and (ii) to freestanding agreements under which LTIP Awards were deferred by certain Participants who previously served on the Board of Directors of Cinergy Corp. shall be payable in a lump sum payment within 60 days following Separation from Service.

(b)          
Term Payments
.  Payment of the full amount of the Participant's Account in annual installments over a period from two to ten, or fifteen, years.  The amount to be distributed in each installment shall be determined by dividing the installments then remaining by the Account balance to obtain the cash amount and/or number of whole shares of Company common stock, including the cash amount for any fractional share, to be paid in the current installment.  Annual installments shall be paid on the first business day of the month following the month in which the Participant's Separation from Service occurs and on each applicable anniversary thereafter.
 
(c)           .  To the extent that a Participant does not designate the distribution option of an amount deferred or contributed to his or her Account, such amount (adjusted for earnings and losses) shall be distributed in a single lump sum during the 60-day period following the date on which the Participant's Separation from Service occurs.
Default Distribution Option
6.5           .  All amounts due under the Plan shall be paid in cash, except that units in the Duke Energy Common Stock Fund and the Duke Energy Common Stock - Stock Deferrals Subaccount shall be converted to whole shares of Company common stock and cash for any fractional share.  To the extent that the delivery of any shares of Company common stock to a Participant under this Plan otherwise would cause all or any portion of the Plan to be considered an "equity compensation plan" as such term is defined in Section 303A(8) of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual or any successor rule ("Listed Company Manual"), then such shares shall be paid from, and shall count against the share reserve of, a Company-sponsored "equity compensation plan" designated by the Committee that complies with the shareholder approval requirements contained in the Listed Company Manual.

With respect to Post-2004 Deferrals, a Participant designated by the Committee may, no later than a date specified by the Committee (provided that such date occurs no later than December 31, 2008 or such other date as permitted under Section 409A of the Code) elect on a form provided by the Committee to (a) change the date of payment of his or her Subaccounts or (b) change the distribution option of his or her Subaccounts to a distribution option otherwise permitted for that Subaccount under the Plan.  The Committee may also take any action that it deems necessary, in its sole discretion, to amend prior deferral elections or payment elections of a Participant, without the Participant's consent, to conform such elections to the terms of this Plan.  This Section is intended to comply with Notice 2007-86, any subsequent notice or guidance, and the applicable proposed and final Treasury Regulations issued under Section 409A of the Code and shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with such intent.
Transition Relief for Payment Elections  Post-2004 Deferrals
6.7           .  Except as otherwise provided in Sections 6.8(a), in no event may payments of Post-2004 Deferrals commence, with respect to any Participant who is a Specified Employee as of his or her Separation from Service, prior to the first business day of the seventh month following such Separation from Service (or if earlier, upon the Participant's death) if such amounts are otherwise payable pursuant to the Participant's Separation from Service.  Any amount that is postponed as a result of the prior sentence shall be accumulated through and paid on the first business day of the seventh month following such Separation from Service (or if earlier, upon the Participant's death).
Mandatory Six-Month Delay  Post-2004 Deferrals
6.8           .  To the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, accelerate the time or schedule of a payment of Post-2004 Deferrals under the Plan as provided in this Section.  The provisions of this Section are intended to comply with the exception to accelerated payments under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j) and shall be interpreted and administered accordingly.    Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Plan, the Committee may not accelerate the time or schedule of any payment or amount scheduled to be paid under the Plan within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.
Discretionary Acceleration of Payment
(a)           .   The Committee may, in its sole discretion, accelerate the time or schedule of a payment under the Plan to an individual other than the Participant as may be necessary to fulfill a domestic relations order (as defined in Section 414(p)(1)(B) of the Code).
Domestic Relations Orders
(b)           .  Subject to Section 6.7 hereof, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide for the acceleration of the time or schedule of a payment under the Plan at any time the Plan fails to meet the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. The payment may not exceed the amount required to be included in income as a result of the failure to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.
Payment Upon Income Inclusion Under Section 409A
(c)           .  Subject to Section 6.7 hereof, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide for the acceleration of the time or schedule of a payment under the Plan as satisfaction of a debt of the Participant to the Company (or any entity which would be considered to be a single employer with the Company under Section 414(b) or Section 414(c) of the Code), where such debt is incurred in the ordinary course of the service relationship between the Company (or any entity which would be considered to be a single employer with the Company under Section 414(b) or Section 414(c) of the Code) and the Participant, the entire amount of reduction in any of the taxable years of the Company (or any entity which would be considered to be a single employer with the Company under Section 414(b) or Section 414(c) of the Code) does not exceed $5,000, and the reduction is made at the same time and in the same amount as the debt otherwise would have been due and collected from the Participant.
Certain Offsets
(d)           .

Delay of Payments
 
following circumstances, provided that the Committee treats all payments to similarly situated Participants on a reasonably consistent basis:
(a)           .  A Payment may be delayed where the Committee reasonably anticipates that the making of the payment will violate federal securities laws or other applicable law; provided that the delayed payment is made at the earliest date at which the Committee reasonably anticipates that the making of the payment will not cause such violation.  For purposes of the preceding sentence, the making of a payment that would cause inclusion in gross income or the application of any penalty provision or other provision of the Code is not treated as a violation of applicable law.
Federal Securities Laws or Other Applicable Law
(b)           .  A payment may be delayed upon such other events and conditions as the Internal Revenue Service may prescribe in generally applicable guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.
Other Events and Conditions
6.10         .If calculation of the amount of the payment is not administratively practicable due to events beyond the control of the Participant (or beneficiary), the payment will be treated as made upon the date specified under the Plan if the payment is made during the first calendar year in which the calculation of the amount of the payment is administratively practicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, payment must be made no later than the latest possible date permitted under Section 409A of the Code. Moreover, notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary except Section 6.7, and to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code, a payment will be treated as made upon the date specified under the Plan if the payment is made as close as administratively practicable to the relevant payment date specified herein, and in any event within the same calendar year.
Actual Date of Payment
 
7.1           .  If a Participant dies while still having a vested Account balance under the Plan, the vested unpaid balance shall be payable to the Participant's beneficiary or beneficiaries as a death benefit.  The Company will provide each Participant with a form whereby the Participant may designate a beneficiary or beneficiaries by filing the completed form with the Company before the Participant's death.  If a deceased Participant did not designate a beneficiary, or if the designated beneficiary should predecease the Participant, the Account shall be paid to the estate of the Participant.
Designation of Beneficiary
7.2           .  If a Participant (or a beneficiary previously designated by a deceased Participant) dies before receiving all amounts payable hereunder, then the remaining amounts payable shall be paid to the specified beneficiary of such deceased person in accordance with the distribution option in effect; provided, however, that if such deceased person has failed to specify a surviving beneficiary, then all Pre-2005 Deferrals shall be paid to the deceased Participant's or beneficiary's estate in lump sum.
Form of Payment
8.1           .  The Board of Directors or its delegate may (a) terminate the Plan with respect to future Participants or future benefit accruals for current Participants; and (b) amend the Plan in any respect, at any time.  No such termination or amendment may reduce the amount of any then accrued benefit of any Participant and any attempt to do so shall be void.  Subject to Section 6.7 hereof, the Committee may, in its sole discretion to the extent permitted in Section 409A of the Code, provide for the acceleration of the time or schedule of a payment of Post-2004 Deferrals under the Plan upon the termination of the Plan.
General Rule
9.1           The Committee is the named fiduciary of the Plan and as such shall have the authority to control and manage the operation and administration of the Plan except as otherwise expressly provided in this Plan document.  The named fiduciary may designate persons other than the named fiduciary to carry out fiduciary responsibilities under the Plan.  Any such allocation or designation must be in writing and must be accepted in writing by any such other person.
9.2           The Committee is the administrator of the Plan.  As administrator, the Committee has the authority (without limitation as to other authority) to delegate its duties to agents and to make rules and regulations that it believes are necessary or appropriate to carry out the Plan.  The Committee has the discretion as a Plan fiduciary (i) to interpret and construe the terms and provisions of the Plan (including any rules or regulations adopted under the Plan), (ii) to determine questions of eligibility to participate in the Plan and (iii) to make factual determinations in connection with any of the foregoing.  A decision of the Committee with respect to any matter pertaining to the Plan including without limitation the individuals determined to be Participants, the benefits payable, and the construction or interpretation of any provision thereof, shall be conclusive and binding upon all interested persons.  No Committee member shall participate in any decision of the Committee that would directly and specifically affect the timing or amount of his or her benefits under the Plan, except to the extent that such decision applies to all Participants under the Plan.
10.1         A person with an interest in the Plan shall have the right to file a claim for benefits under the Plan and to appeal any denial of a claim for benefits.  Any request for a Plan benefit or to clarify the claimant's rights to future benefits under the terms of the Plan shall be considered to be a claim.
10.2         A claim for benefits will be considered as having been made when submitted in writing by the claimant (or by such claimant's authorized representative) to the Committee.  No particular form is required for the claim, but the written claim must identify the name of the claimant and describe generally the benefit to which the claimant believes he or she is entitled.  The claim may be delivered personally during business hours or mailed to the Committee.
10.3         The Committee will determine whether, or to what extent, the claim may be allowed or denied under the terms of the Plan.  If the claim is wholly or partially denied, the claimant shall be so informed by written notice 90 days after the day the claim is submitted unless special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim.  If such an extension of time for processing is required, written notice of the extension shall be furnished to the claimant prior to the termination of the initial 90-day period.  The extension notice shall indicate the special circumstances requiring an extension of time and the date by which the Plan expects to render the final decision.  If notice of denial of a claim (in whole or in part) is not furnished within the initial 90-day period after the claim is submitted (or, if applicable, the extended 90-day period), the claimant shall consider that his or her claim has been denied just as if he or she had received actual notice of denial.
10.4         The notice informing the claimant that his claim has been wholly or partially denied shall be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and shall include:
(a)           The specific reason(s) for the denial.
(b)           Specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based.
(c)           A description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary.
(d)           Appropriate information as to the steps to be taken if the claimant wishes to submit his or her claim for review.
10.5         If the claim is wholly or partially denied, the claimant (or his or her authorized representative) may file an appeal of the denied claim with the Committee requesting that the claim be reviewed.  The Committee shall conduct a full and fair review of each appealed claim and its denial.  Unless the Committee notifies the claimant that due to the nature of the benefit and other attendant circumstances he or she is entitled to a greater period of time within which to submit his or her request for review of a denied claim, the claimant shall have 60 days after he or she (or his or her authorized representative) receives written notice of denial of his or her claim within which such request must be submitted to the Committee.
10.6         The request for review of a denied claim must be made in writing.  In connection with making such request, the claimant or his or her authorized representative may:
(a)           Review pertinent documents.
(b)           Submit issues and comments in writing.
10.7         The decision of the Committee regarding the appeal shall be promptly given to the claimant in writing and shall normally be given no later than 60 days following the receipt of the request for review.  However, if special circumstances (for example, if the Committee decides to hold a hearing on the appeal) require a further extension of time for processing, the decision shall be rendered as soon as possible, but no later than 120 days after receipt of the request for review.  However, if the Committee holds regularly scheduled meetings at least quarterly, a decision on review shall be made by no later than the date of the meeting which immediately follows the Plan's receipt of a request for review, unless the request is filed within 30 days preceding the date of such meeting.  In such case, a decision may be made by no later than the date of the second meeting following the Plan's receipt of the request for review.  If special circumstances (for example, if the Committee decides to hold a hearing on the appeal) require a further extension of time for processing, the decision shall be rendered as soon as possible, but no later than the third meeting following the Plan's receipt of the request for review.  If special circumstances require that the decision will be made beyond the initial time for furnishing the decision, written notice of the extension shall be furnished to the claimant (or his or her authorized representative) prior to the commencement of the extension.  The decision on review shall be in writing and shall be furnished to the claimant or his or her authorized representative within the appropriate time for the decision.  If a decision on review is not furnished within the appropriate time, the claim shall be deemed to have been denied on appeal.
10.8         The Committee may, in its sole discretion, decide to hold a hearing if it determines that a hearing is necessary or appropriate in order to make a full and fair review of the appealed claim.
10.9         The decision on review shall include specific reasons for the decision, written in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant, as well as specific references to the pertinent Plan provisions on which the decision is based.
10.10       A person must exhaust his or her rights to file a claim and to request a review of the denial of his or her claim before bringing any civil action to recover benefits due to him under the terms of the Plan, to enforce his or her rights under the terms of the Plan, or to clarify his or her rights to future benefits under the terms of the Plan.
10.11       The Committee shall exercise its responsibility and authority under this claims procedure as a fiduciary and, in such capacity, shall have the discretionary authority and responsibility (1) to interpret and construe the Plan and any rules or regulations under the Plan, (2) to determine the eligibility of Nonemployee Directors to participate in the Plan, and the rights of Participants to receive benefits under the Plan, and (3) to make factual determinations in connection with any of the foregoing.
11.1         No right or interest of any person entitled to a benefit under the Plan shall be subject to voluntary or involuntary alienation, assignment, or transfer of any kind.
11.2         No right or benefit hereunder shall in any manner be liable for or subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities, or torts of the person entitled to benefits under this Plan.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code and subject to Section 6.8, the Committee shall honor a judgment, order or decree from a state domestic relations court which requires the payment of part or all of a Participant's or beneficiary's interest under this Plan to an "alternate payee" as defined in Section 414(p) of the Code.
11.3         The Company's obligations under this Plan shall be as unfunded and unsecured promise to pay.  The Company shall not be obligated under any circumstances to fund its financial obligations under this Plan.  The Company may establish a grantor trust to assist it in meeting its obligations under this Plan.  The Company shall not be obligated to establish such a trust, and if established, the Company shall not be obligated to make contributions to the trust. All payments under the Plan will be made from the general funds of the Company.
11.4         This Plan shall be construed and administered in accordance with the laws of the State of North Carolina to the extent that such laws are not preempted by Federal law.
11.5         .  The Account of each member of the Board of Directors of Spectra Energy Corp or its predecessor companies (a "Spectra Energy Participant") maintained under the Plan immediately prior to the spin-off of Spectra Energy Corp was transferred to the Spectra Energy Corp Directors' Savings Plan and assumed by Spectra Energy Corp as of the spin-off (the "Assumed Amounts").  For purposes of this Plan, the term "Assumed Amounts" shall include any amount of Compensation of a Spectra Energy Participant that is earned but not yet paid as of the spin-off and phantom stock units granted to a Spectra Energy Participant under the Duke Energy Corporation 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan, that were properly deferred by a member of the Spectra Energy Corp Board of Directors under the Plan but that had not yet been credited to his or her Account under the Plan as of the spin-off.  Each such Spectra Energy Participant shall have no further rights under the Plan immediately after his or her Account is transferred to the Spectra Energy Corp Directors' Savings Plan and assumed by Spectra Energy Corp in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Employee Matters Agreement by and between Duke Energy Corporation and Spectra Energy Corp (the "Employee Matters Agreement").  Capitalized terms used in this Section that are not defined in this Plan shall have the meaning set forth in the Employee Matters Agreement.
Transfer of Accounts
11.6         .  It is intended that the Plan comply with the provisions of Section 409A of the Code, so as to prevent the inclusion in gross income of any amounts deferred hereunder in a taxable year that is prior to the taxable year or years in which such amounts would otherwise actually be paid or made available to Participants or Beneficiaries. This Plan shall be construed, administered, and governed in a manner that effects such intent, and the Committee shall not take any action that would be inconsistent with such intent.  Although the Committee shall use its best efforts to avoid the imposition of taxation, interest and penalties under Section 409A of the Code, the tax treatment of deferrals under this Plan is not warranted or guaranteed.  Neither the Company, the other members of the Affiliated Group, their respective directors, officers, employees and advisors, the Board, nor the Committee (nor its designee) shall be held liable for any taxes, interest, penalties or other monetary amounts owed by any Participant, beneficiary or other taxpayer as a result of the Plan.  Any reference in this Plan to Section 409A of the Code will also include any proposed, temporary or final regulations, or any other guidance, promulgated with respect to such Section 409A of the Code
Compliance with Section 409A of the Code
by the U.S. Department of Treasury or the Internal Revenue Service.  For purposes of the Plan, the phrase "permitted by Section 409A of the Code," or words or phrases of similar import, shall mean that the event or circumstance shall only be permitted to the extent it would not cause an amount deferred or payable under the Plan to be includible in the gross income of a Participant or beneficiary under Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code.
11.7         .  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, including any provision that requires the use of a written instrument, the Committee may establish procedures for the use of electronic or other media in communications and transactions between the Plan or the Committee and Participants and beneficiaries.  Electronic or other media may include, but are not limited to, e-mail, the Internet, intranet systems and automated telephonic response systems.
Electronic or Other Media
