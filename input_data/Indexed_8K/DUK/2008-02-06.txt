Item 7.01.  Regulation FD Disclosure
 
As discussed on Duke Energy Corporation's (the "Company" or "Duke Energy") February 5, 2008 Fourth Quarter 2007 Earnings call, the ompany's 2008 employee incentive target of $1.27, based on ongoing diluted earnings per share, includes assumptions regarding the impact of allowance for funds used during construction ("AFUDC") and capitalized interest.  Following are Duke Energy's forecasted 2008 and actual 2007 amounts of capitalized interest (including the debt component of AFUDC) and the equity component of AFUDC:

It should be noted that capitalized interest is presented on a pre-tax basis and equity AFUDC is presented net of tax.
 
In addition, it was disclosed on the February 5, 2008 Fourth Quarter 2007 Earnings call that the 2008 employee incentive target of $1.27 is assumed to include net purchase accounting charges of approximately $5 million in 2008, compared to approximately  $110 million in 2007.  The current projection for net purchase accounting charges in 2009 is approximately $50 million.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measure
Duke Energy's management uses ongoing diluted EPS, which is a non-GAAP financial measure as it represents diluted EPS from continuing operations, adjusted for the impact of special items, as a measure to evaluate operations of the company.  Special items represent certain charges and credits, which management believes will not be recurring on a regular basis. Management believes that the presentation of ongoing diluted EPS provides useful information to investors, as it allows them to more accurately compare the company's ongoing performance across periods. Ongoing diluted EPS is also used as a basis for employee incentive bonuses.  The company's 2008 employee ongoing EPS incentive target is $1.27. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for ongoing diluted EPS is reported diluted EPS from continuing operations, which includes the impact of special items.  Due to the forward-looking nature of ongoing diluted EPS for future periods, information to reconcile such non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is not available at this time, as the company is unable to forecast special items for future periods.
