The total contract value for Shaw's scope of work on the Station is approximately $275 million.  DE Carolinas has rights to terminate the agreement with Shaw at any time at DE Carolinas' convenience, subject to customary cancellation and demobilization charges in accordance with the terms of the agreement.
