Approval of Executive Short-Term Incentive Plan
 
The shareholders of the Company approved the amended and restated Duke Energy Corporation Executive Short-Term Incentive Plan (the "Amended STI Plan") at the annual meeting of the Company's shareholders on May 8, 2008.  The Amended STI Plan amends and restates the existing Duke Energy Corporation Executive Short-Term Incentive Plan (the "Existing STI Plan") and is intended to help the Company maintain the flexibility that it needs to keep pace with its competitors and attract, motivate and retain the caliber of executive officers essential to its success by providing short-term incentive awards.  The Amended STI Plan is generally a continuation of the Existing STI Plan, with the following changes:  (i) in order to provide additional flexibility, several potential performance targets have been added to the plan, (ii) the maximum amount that can be paid to any one individual with respect to a year has been increased from $4,000,000 to $6,000,000, and (iii) various technical amendments have been made to the plan.  Only executive officers are eligible to receive awards under the Amended STI Plan.  The forgoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amended STI Plan, which was attached as Appendix A to the Company's definitive proxy statement filed on March 20, 2008 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
