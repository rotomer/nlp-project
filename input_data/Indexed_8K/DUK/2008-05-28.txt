Item 8.01.  Other Events.
 
As previously reported in the registrants' prior disclosures, in 1999-2000, the U.S. Justice Department, acting on behalf of the EPA, filed a number of complaints and notices of violation against multiple utilities across the country for alleged violations of the New Source Review (NSR) provisions of the Clean Air Act (CAA).  Generally, the government alleged that projects performed at various coal-fired units were major modifications, as defined in the CAA, and that the utilities violated the CAA when they undertook those projects without obtaining permits and installing emission controls for SO, NO and particulate matter.  The complaints seek (1) injunctive relief to require installation of pollution control technology on various allegedly violating generating units, and (2) unspecified civil penalties in amounts of up to $27,500 per day for each violation.  A number of Duke Energy's owned and operated plants have been subject to these allegations and lawsuits.  The registrants asserted that there were no CAA violations because the applicable regulations do not require permitting in cases where the projects undertaken are "routine" or otherwise were not expected to result in a net increase in emissions.

On May 22, 2008, a jury verdict was returned finding in favor of the registrants on 10 of the 14 projects being disputed.  The four projects that were ruled in favor of the government related to three units at Duke Energy Indiana, Inc.'s Wabash River station.  The remedy phase of the case related to the Wabash River units is scheduled to begin December 8, 2008.  Based on previous rulings by the judge in this case, the Wabash River units are not subject to civil penalties; and therefore, the remedy phase will address only the appropriate injunctive relief.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
