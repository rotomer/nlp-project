     Any certificate or opinion of an officer of the Corporation may be based, insofar as it relates to legal matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, counsel, unless such officer knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to the matters upon which his certificate or opinion is based are erroneous. Any such certificate or opinion of counsel may be based, insofar as it relates to factual matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, an officer or officers of the Corporation stating that the information with respect to such factual matters is in the possession of the Corporation, unless such counsel knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to such matters are erroneous.

     Whenever, subsequent to the receipt by the Trustee of any Board Resolution, Officers' Certificate, Opinion of Counsel or other document or instrument, a clerical, typographical or other inadvertent or unintentional error or omission shall be discovered therein, a new document or instrument may be substituted therefor in corrected form with the same force and effect as if originally filed in the corrected form and, irrespective of the date or dates of the actual execution and/or delivery thereof, such substitute document or instrument shall be deemed to have been executed and/or delivered as of the date or dates required with respect to the document or instrument for which it is substituted. Anything in this Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, if any such corrective document or instrument indicates that action has been taken by or at the request of the Corporation which could not have been taken had the original document or instrument not contained such error or omission, the action so taken shall not be invalidated or otherwise rendered ineffective but shall be and remain in full force and effect, except to the extent that such action was a result of willful misconduct or bad faith. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any Securities issued under the authority of such defective document or instrument shall nevertheless be the valid obligations of the Corporation entitled to the benefits of this Indenture equally and ratably with all other Outstanding Securities, except as aforesaid.
     
Section 104. Acts of Holders; Record Dates
     Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this Indenture to be given, made or taken by Holders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in person or by agent duly appointed in writing; and, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Trustee and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Corporation. Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Section 601) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Corporation, if made in the manner provided in this Section.
 
     The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof. Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority. The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved in any other manner which the Trustee deems sufficient.
     The ownership of Securities shall be proved by the Security Register.
     Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Security shall bind every future Holder of the same Security and the Holder of every Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee or the Corporation in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Security.
     The Corporation may set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities of any series entitled to give, make or take any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this Indenture to be given, made or taken by Holders of Securities of such series; provided that the Corporation may not set a record date for, and the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply with respect to, the giving or making of any notice, declaration, request or direction referred to in the next paragraph. If any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on such record date, and no other Holders, shall be entitled to take or revoke the relevant action, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided that no such action shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Corporation from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be cancelled and of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Corporation, at its own expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to be given to the Trustee in writing and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 106.
     The Trustee may set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities of any series entitled to join in the giving or making of (i) any Notice of Default, (ii) any declaration of acceleration referred to in Section 502, (iii) any request to institute proceedings referred to in Section 507(2) or (iv) any direction referred to in Section 512, in each case with respect to Securities of such series. If any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date, and no other Holders, shall be entitled to join in such notice, declaration, request or direction or to revoke the same, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided that no such action shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Trustee from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be cancelled and of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Trustee, at the Corporation's expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to be sent to the Corporation in writing and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 106.
     With respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section, the party hereto which sets such record dates may designate any day as the "Expiration Date" and from time to time may change the Expiration Date to any earlier or later day; provided that no such change shall be effective unless notice of the proposed new Expiration Date is
 
given to the other party hereto in writing, and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 106, on or prior to the existing Expiration Date. If an Expiration Date is not designated with respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section, the party hereto which set such record date shall be deemed to have initially designated the 180th day after such record date as the Expiration Date with respect thereto, subject to its right to change the Expiration Date as provided in this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Expiration Date shall be later than the 180th day after the applicable record date.
     Without limiting the foregoing, a Holder entitled hereunder to take any action hereunder with regard to any particular Security may do so with regard to all or any part of the principal amount of such Security or by one or more duly appointed agents each of which may do so pursuant to such appointment with regard to all or any part of such principal amount.
     
Section 105. Notices, Etc., to Trustee and Corporation
     Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or Act of Holders or other document provided or permitted by this Indenture to be made upon, given or furnished to, or filed with,
     (1) the Trustee by any Holder or by the Corporation shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder if made, given, furnished or filed in writing to or with the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office, Attention: Corporate Finance, or
     (2) the Corporation by the Trustee or by any Holder shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to the Corporation addressed to it at the address of its principal office specified in the first paragraph of this instrument, attention: Treasurer, or at any other address previously furnished in writing to the Trustee by the Corporation.
     
Section 106. Notice to Holders; Waiver
     Where this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of any event, such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder affected by such event, at his address as it appears in the Security Register, not later than the latest date (if any), and not earlier than the earliest date (if any), prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders. Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.
     In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such notification as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder.
     
Section 107. Conflict with Trust Indenture Act
     If any provision hereof limits, qualifies or conflicts with a provision of the Trust Indenture Act which is required under such Act to be a part of and govern this Indenture, the latter provision shall control. If any provision of this Indenture modifies or excludes any provision of the Trust Indenture Act which may be so modified or excluded, the latter provision shall be deemed to apply to this Indenture as so modified or to be excluded, as the case may be.
     
Section 108. Effect of Headings and Table of Contents

     [If applicable, insertNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation may not, prior to               , redeem any Securities of this series as contemplated by [if applicable, insertClause (2) of] the preceding paragraph as a part of, or in anticipation of, any refunding operation by the application, directly or indirectly, of moneys borrowed having an interest cost to the Corporation (calculated in accordance with generally accepted financial practice) of less than      % per annum.]

     [If the Security is subject to redemption of any kind, insertIn the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series and of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.]
     [If applicable, insertThe Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of [the entire indebtedness of this Security] [or] [certain restrictive covenants and Events of Default with respect to this Security] [, in each case] upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture.]
     [If the Security is not an Original Issue Discount Security, insertIf an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.]
     [If the Security is an Original Issue Discount Security, insertIf an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, an amount of principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. Such amount shall be equal to [insert formula for determining the amount]. Upon payment of (i) the amount of principal so declared due and payable and (ii) interest on any overdue principal, premium and interest (in each case to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable), all of the Corporation's obligations in respect of the payment of the principal of and premium and interest, if any, on the Securities of this series shall terminate.]

The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Securities of all series at the time Outstanding with respect to which a default under the Indenture shall have
 
occurred and be continuing (voting as one class), on behalf of the Holders of the Securities of all such series, to waive, with certain exceptions, such past default with respect to all such series and its consequences. The Indenture also permits the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Corporation with certain provisions of the Indenture. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
     As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series, the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Securities of this series at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of Securities of this series at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
     No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Corporation, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
     As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Corporation in any place where the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Corporation and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
     The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and of like tenor of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
     No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Corporation may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
     Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Corporation, the Trustee and any agent of the Corporation or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Corporation, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
     All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

Section 303. Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating
     The Securities shall be executed on behalf of the Corporation by its Chairman of the Board, its President, one of its Vice Presidents, its Treasurer or one of its Assistant Treasurers. The signature of any of these officers on the Securities may be manual or facsimile.
     Securities bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the Corporation shall bind the Corporation, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities or did not hold such offices at the date of such Securities.
 
     At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Corporation may deliver Securities of any series executed by the Corporation to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Securities, and the Trustee in accordance with the Company Order shall authenticate and deliver such Securities, provided, however, that in the case of Securities offered in a Periodic Offering, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver such Securities from time to time in accordance with such other procedures (including, without limitation, the receipt by the Trustee of oral or electronic instructions from the Corporation or its duly authorized agents, promptly confirmed in writing) acceptable to the Trustee as may be specified by or pursuant to a Company Order delivered to the Trustee prior to the time of the first authentication of Securities of such series. If the form or terms of the Securities of the series have been established by or pursuant to one or more Board Resolutions as permitted by Sections 201 and 301, in authenticating such Securities, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 601) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating,
     (1) if the form of such Securities has been established by or pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 201, that such form has been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
     (2) if the terms of such Securities have been, or in the case of Securities of a series offered in a Periodic Offering, will be, established by or pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 301, that such terms have been, or in the case of Securities of a series offered in a Periodic Offering, will be, established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture, subject, in the case of Securities of a series offered in a Periodic Offering, to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel; and
     (3) that such Securities, when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Corporation in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Corporation enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles.
     If such form or terms have been so established, the Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Securities if the issue of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.
     Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 301 and of the preceding paragraph, if all Securities of a series are not to be originally issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver the Officers' Certificate otherwise required pursuant to Section 301 or the Company Order and Opinion of Counsel otherwise required pursuant to such preceding paragraph at or prior to the authentication of each Security of such series if such documents are delivered at or prior to the authentication upon original issuance of the first Security of such series to be issued.
     With respect to Securities of a series offered in a Periodic Offering, the Trustee may rely, as to the authorization by the Corporation of any of such Securities, the form and terms thereof and the legality, validity, binding effect and enforceability thereof, upon the Opinion of Counsel and the other documents delivered pursuant to Sections 201 and 301 and this Section, as applicable, in connection with the first authentication of Securities of such series.
     Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.
     No Security shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee by manual signature of an authorized signatory, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Corporation, and the Corporation shall deliver such Security to the Trustee for
 
cancellation as provided in Section 309, for all purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
     
Section 304. Temporary Securities
     Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Corporation may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Securities may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities.
     If temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Corporation will cause definitive Securities of that series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities of such series, the temporary Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of such series upon surrender of the temporary Securities of such series at the office or agency of the Corporation in a Place of Payment for that series, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any series, the Corporation shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefore one or more definitive Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series and tenor.
     
Section 305. Registration; Registration of Transfer and Exchange
     The Corporation shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee a register (the register maintained in such office or in any other office or agency of the Corporation in a Place of Payment being herein sometimes referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Corporation shall provide for the registration of Securities and of transfers of Securities. The Trustee is hereby appointed "Security Registrar" for the purpose of registering Securities and transfers of Securities as herein provided.
     Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security of a series at the office or agency of the Corporation in a Place of Payment for that series, the Corporation shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount.
     At the option of the Holder, Securities of any series may be exchanged for other Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Corporation shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
     All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Corporation, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
     Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Corporation or the Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Corporation and the Security Registrar duly executed, by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
     No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Corporation may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 304, 906 or 1106 not involving any transfer.
 
     If the Securities of any series (or of any series and specified tenor) are to be redeemed, the Corporation shall not be required (A) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Securities of that series (or of that series and specified tenor, as the case may be) during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of any such Securities selected for redemption and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing, or (B) to register the transfer of or exchange any Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part.
     The provisions of Clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4) below shall apply only to Global Securities:
     (1) Each Global Security authenticated under this Indenture shall be registered in the name of the Depositary designated for such Global Security or a nominee thereof and delivered to such Depositary or a nominee thereof or custodian therefor, and each such Global Security shall constitute a single Security for all purposes of this Indenture.
     (2) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, no Global Security may be exchanged in whole or in part for Securities registered, and no transfer of a Global Security in whole or in part may be registered, in the name of any Person other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof unless (A) such Depositary has notified the Corporation that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Security and a successor Depositary has not been appointed by the Corporation within 90 days of receipt by the Corporation of such notification, (B) at any time the Depositary ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act at a time when the Depositary is required to be so registered to act as such Depositary and no successor Depositary shall have been appointed by the Corporation within 90 days after it became aware of such cessation, or (C) there shall exist such circumstances, if any, in addition to or in lieu of the foregoing as have been specified for this purpose as contemplated by Section 301. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation may at any time in its sole discretion and subject to the procedures of the Depositary determine that Securities issued in the form of a Global Security shall no longer be represented in whole or in part by such Global Security, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order therefor, shall authenticate and deliver definitive Securities in exchange in whole or in part for such Global Security.
     (3) Subject to Clause (2) above, any exchange or transfer of a Global Security for other Securities may be made in whole or in part, and all Securities issued in exchange for or upon transfer of a Global Security or any portion thereof shall be registered in such names as the Depositary for such Global Security shall direct.
     (4) Every Security authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for or in lieu of, a Global Security or any portion thereof, whether pursuant to this Section, Section 304, 306, 906 or 1106 or otherwise, shall be authenticated and delivered in the form of, and shall be, a Global Security, unless such Security is registered in the name of a Person other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof.
     
Section 306. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities
     If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, the Corporation shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
     If there shall be delivered to the Corporation and the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Corporation or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Corporation shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
     In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Corporation in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.
 
     Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Corporation may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith. Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Corporation, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series duly issued hereunder.
     The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.
     
Section 307. Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved
     Except as otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to any series of Securities, interest on any Security which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest.
     Except as otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to any series of Securities, any interest on any Security of any series which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Corporation, at its election in each case, as provided in Clause (1) or (2) below:
     (1) The Corporation may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Corporation shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security of such series and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Corporation shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this Clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Corporation of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Corporation, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be given to each Holder of Securities of such series in the manner set forth in Section 106, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following Clause (2).
     (2) The Corporation may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Securities of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange, if any, on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Corporation to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this Clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
     Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.
 
     
Section 308. Persons Deemed Owners
     Prior to due presentment of a Security for registration of transfer, the Corporation, the Trustee and any agent of the Corporation or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Security is registered as the owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and any premium and (subject to Section 307) any interest on such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security be overdue, and neither the Corporation, the Trustee nor any agent of the Corporation or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
     .
Section 309. Cancellation
     All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange or for credit against any sinking fund payment shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and shall be promptly cancelled by it. The Corporation may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Corporation may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and may deliver to the Trustee (or to any other Person for delivery to the Trustee) for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated hereunder which the Corporation has not issued and sold, and all Securities so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All cancelled Securities held by the Trustee shall be disposed of as directed by a Company Order; provided, however, that the Trustee shall not be required to destroy such cancelled Securities.
     
Section 310. Computation of Interest
     Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of any series, interest on the Securities of each series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
     
Section 311. CUSIP Numbers
     The Corporation in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers.
     
Section 401. Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture
     This Indenture shall upon Company Request cease to be of further effect (except as to any surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of Securities herein expressly provided for), and the Trustee, at the expense of the Corporation, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, when
          (1) either
     (A) all Securities theretofore authenticated and delivered (other than (i) Securities which have been destroyed, lost or stolen and which have been replaced or paid as provided in Section 306 and (ii) Securities for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Corporation and thereafter repaid to the Corporation or discharged from such trust, as provided in Section 1003) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or
 
     (B) all such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation
     (i) have become due and payable, or
     (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year, or
     (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Corporation,
and the Corporation, in the case of (i), (ii) or (iii) above, has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for the purpose (I) money in an amount, (II) Government Obligations (as defined in Section 1304) which through the scheduled payment of principal and interest in respect thereof in accordance with their terms will provide, not later than the due date of any payment, money in an amount, or (III) a combination thereof, sufficient, in the case of (II) or (III), in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay and discharge, and which shall be applied by the Trustee to pay and discharge, the entire indebtedness on such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal and any premium and interest to the date of such deposit (in the case of Securities which have become due and payable) or to the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be;
     (2) the Corporation has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the Corporation; and
     (3) the Corporation has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture have been complied with.
     Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, the obligations of the Corporation to the Trustee under Section 607, the obligations of the Corporation to any Authenticating Agent under Section 614 and, if money shall have been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to subclause (B) of Clause (1) of this Section, the obligations of the Trustee under Section 402 and the last paragraph of Section 1003 shall survive.
     
Section 402. Application of Trust Money
     Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 1003, all money deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 401 shall be held in trust and applied by it, in accordance with the provisions of the Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Corporation acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal and any premium and interest for whose payment such money has been deposited with the Trustee. Moneys held pursuant to this Section for the benefit of the Holders of Subordinated Securities shall not be subject to the subordination provisions established with respect to such Securities pursuant to Section 301(20).
     The Corporation shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the Government Obligations deposited pursuant to Section 401 or the principal and interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of Outstanding Securities.
     Anything in this Article to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Corporation from time to time upon Company Request any money or Government Obligations held by it as provided in Section 401 which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee (in case Government Obligations are held by the Trustee as provided in Section 401), are in excess of the amount thereof which would then be required to be deposited to effect the
 
satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture.
     
Section 501. Events of Default
     "Event of Default," wherever used herein with respect to Securities of any series, means any one of the following events (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body), unless it is inapplicable to a particular series or is specifically deleted or modified in the Board Resolution (or action taken pursuant thereto), Officers' Certificate or supplemental indenture under which such series of Securities is issued or has been deleted or modified in an indenture supplemental hereto:
     (1) default in the payment of any interest upon any Security of that series when it becomes due and payable, and continuance of such default for a period of 60 days; provided, however, that if the Corporation is permitted by the terms of the Securities of such series to defer the payment in question, the date on which such payment is due and payable shall be the date on which the Corporation is required to make payment following such deferral, if such deferral has been elected pursuant to the terms of the Securities; or
     (2) default in the payment of the principal of or any premium on any Security of that series at its Maturity; or
     (3) default in the making of any sinking fund payment, when and as due by the terms of a Security of that series, and continuance of such default for a period of 60 days; or
     (4) default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant of the Corporation in this Indenture (other than a covenant a default in whose performance or whose breach is elsewhere in this Section specifically dealt with or which has expressly been included in this Indenture solely for the benefit of series of Securities other than that series), and continuance of such default or breach for a period of 90 days after there has been given, by registered or certified mail, to the Corporation by the Trustee or to the Corporation and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 33% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series a written notice specifying such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder, unless the Trustee, or the Trustee and the Holders of a principal amount of Securities of such series not less than the principal amount of Securities the Holders of which gave such notice, as the case may be, shall agree in writing to an extension of such period prior to its expiration; provided, however, that the Trustee, or the Trustee and the Holders of such principal amount of Securities of such series, as the case may be, shall be deemed to have agreed to an extension of such period if corrective action is initiated by the Corporation within such period and is being diligently pursued; or
     (5) the entry by a court having jurisdiction in the premises of (A) a decree or order for relief in respect of the Corporation in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or (B) a decree or order adjudging the Corporation a bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as properly filed a petition seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition of or in respect of the Corporation under any applicable federal or state law, or appointing a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official of the Corporation or of any substantial part of its property, or ordering the winding-up or liquidation of its affairs, and the continuance of any such decree or order for relief or any such other decree or order unstayed and in effect for a period of 90 consecutive days; or
     (6) the commencement by the Corporation of a voluntary case or proceeding under any applicable
 
federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or of any other case or proceeding to be adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, or the consent by it to the entry of a decree or order for relief in respect of the Corporation in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or to the commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency case or proceeding against it, or the filing by it of a petition or answer or consent seeking reorganization or relief under any applicable federal or state law, or the consent by it to the filing of such petition or to the appointment of or taking possession by a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official of the Corporation or of any substantial part of its property, or the making by it of an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the admission by it in writing of its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, or the authorization of any such action by the Board of Directors; or
     (7) any other Event of Default provided with respect to Securities of that series.
     
Section 502. Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment
     If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 33% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series may declare the principal amount of all the Securities of that series (or, if any Securities of that series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount of such Securities as may be specified by the terms thereof) to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Corporation (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal amount (or specified amount) shall become immediately due and payable.
     At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to Securities of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Event of Default giving rise to such declaration of acceleration shall, without further act, be deemed to have been waived, and such declaration and its consequences shall, without further act, be deemed to have been rescinded and annulled, if
     (1) the Corporation has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay
     (A) all overdue interest on all Securities of that series,
     (B) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Securities of that series which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and any interest thereon at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities,
     (C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, and
     (D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel;
     and
     (2) all Events of Default with respect to Securities of that series, other than the non-payment of the principal of Securities of that series which has become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 513.
     No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
     
Section 503. Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee
     The Corporation covenants that if
 
     (1) default is made in the payment of any interest on any Security when such interest becomes due and payable and such default continues for a period of 60 days, or
     (2) default is made in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Security at the Maturity thereof,
the Corporation will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities, the whole amount then due and payable on such Securities for principal and any premium and interest and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, interest on any overdue principal and premium and on any overdue interest, at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.
     If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.
     
Section 504. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim
     In case of any judicial proceeding relative to the Corporation (or any other obligor upon the Securities), its property or its creditors, the Trustee shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise, to take any and all actions authorized under the Trust Indenture Act in order to have claims of the Holders and the Trustee allowed in any such proceeding. In particular, the Trustee shall be authorized to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 607.
     No provision of this Indenture shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding; provided, however, that the Trustee may, on behalf of the Holders, vote for the election of a trustee in bankruptcy or similar official and be a member of a creditors' or other similar committee.
     
Section 505. Trustee May Enforce Claims Without Possession of Securities
     All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Securities may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Securities or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Securities in respect of which such judgment has been recovered.
     
Section 506. Application of Money Collected
     Any money collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article shall be applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such money on account of principal or any premium or interest, upon presentation of the Securities and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:
     First: To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee under Section 607;
 
     Second: Subject to the subordination terms established pursuant to Section 301(20), if applicable, to the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid for principal of and any premium and interest on the Securities in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money has been collected, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on such Securities for principal and any premium and interest, respectively; and
     Third: To the payment of the balance, if any, to the Corporation or any other Person or Persons legally entitled thereto.
     
Section 507. Limitation on Suits
     No Holder of any Security of any series shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless
     (1) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of that series;
     (2) the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee hereunder;

     (4) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and
     (5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series;
it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other of such Holders, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all of such Holders.
     .
Section 508. Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Principal, Premium and Interest
     Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Security shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of and any premium and (subject to Section 307) interest on such Security on the respective Stated Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in the case of redemption, on the Redemption Date) and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such rights shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder.
     
Section 509. Restoration of Rights and Remedies
     If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case, subject to any determination in such proceeding, the Corporation, the Trustee and the Holders shall be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.
 
     
Section 510. Rights and Remedies Cumulative
     Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities in the last paragraph of Section 306, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.
     
Section 511. Delay or Omission Not Waiver
     No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any Securities to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein.
     Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be.
     .
Section 512. Control by Holders
     The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee, with respect to the Securities of such series; provided that
     (1) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture,
     (2) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction, and
     (3) subject to the provisions of Section 601, the Trustee shall have the right to decline to follow any such direction if the Trustee in good faith shall, by a Responsible Officer or Officers of the Trustee, determine that the proceeding so directed would involve the Trustee in personal liability.
     
Section 513. Waiver of Past Defaults
     The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of all series with respect to which any default under the Indenture shall have occurred and be continuing (voting as one class) may, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of all such series, waive such past default under the Indenture and its consequences, except a default
     (1) in the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Security of such series, or
     (2) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article Nine cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of the series affected.
Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist and be deemed not to have occurred, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured and not to have occurred, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon.
     
Section 514. Undertaking for Costs
     In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Trustee, a court may require any party litigant in such suit to file an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and may assess costs against any such party litigant, in the
 
manner and to the extent provided in the Trust Indenture Act; provided that neither this Section nor the Trust Indenture Act shall be deemed to authorize any court to require such an undertaking or to make such an assessment in any suit instituted by the Corporation or the Trustee.

     The Corporation covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Corporation (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.

Section 604. Not Responsible for Recitals or Issuance of Securities
     The recitals contained herein and in the Securities, except the Trustee's certificates of authentication, shall be taken as the statements of the Corporation, and neither the Trustee nor any Authenticating Agent assumes any responsibility for their correctness.

     (2) except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to reimburse the Trustee upon its request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee in accordance with any provision of this Indenture (including the reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements of its agents and counsel), except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may be attributable to its negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith; and

     Without limiting any rights available to the Trustee under applicable law, when the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services in connection with an Event of Default specified in Section 501(5) or Section 501(6), the expenses (including the reasonable charges and expenses of its counsel) and the compensation for the services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law.
     The provisions of this Section shall survive the termination of this Indenture.
     
Section 608. Conflicting Interests
     If the Trustee has or shall acquire a conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act, the Trustee shall either eliminate such interest or resign, to the extent and in the manner provided by, and subject to the provisions of, the Trust Indenture Act and this Indenture. To the extent permitted by such Act, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have a conflicting interest by virtue of being a trustee under this Indenture with respect to Securities of more than one series.
     
Section 609. Corporate Trustee Required; Eligibility
     There shall at all times be a Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of each series, which may be Trustee hereunder for Securities of one or more other series. Each Trustee shall be a Person that is eligible pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act to act as such and has a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. If any such Person publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of its supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section and to the extent permitted by the Trust Indenture Act, the combined capital and surplus of such Person shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect hereinafter specified in this Article.
     
Section 610. Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor
     No resignation or removal of the Trustee and no appointment of a successor Trustee pursuant to this Article shall become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 611.
     The Trustee may resign at any time with respect to the Securities of one or more series by giving written notice thereof to the Corporation. If the instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee required by Section 611
 
shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.
     The Trustee may be removed at any time with respect to the Securities of any series by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series, delivered to the Trustee and to the Corporation.
     If at any time:
     (1) the Trustee shall fail to comply with Section 608 after written request therefor by the Corporation or by any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months, or
     (2) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section 609 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Corporation or by any such Holder, or
     (3) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation,
then, in any such case, (A) the Corporation by a Board Resolution may remove the Trustee with respect to all Securities, or (B) subject to Section 514, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee with respect to all Securities and the appointment of a successor Trustee or Trustees.
     If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause, with respect to the Securities of one or more series, the Corporation, by a Board Resolution, shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with respect to the Securities of that or those series (it being understood that any such successor Trustee may be appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more or all of such series and that at any time there shall be only one Trustee with respect to the Securities of any particular series) and shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 611. If, within one year after such resignation, removal or incapability, or the occurrence of such vacancy, a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall be appointed by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series delivered to the Corporation and the retiring Trustee, the successor Trustee so appointed shall, forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 611, become the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and to that extent supersede the successor Trustee appointed by the Corporation. If no successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall have been so appointed by the Corporation or the Holders and accepted appointment in the manner required by Section 611, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security of such series for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.
     The Corporation shall give notice of each resignation and each removal of the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series and each appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series to all Holders of Securities of such series in the manner provided in Section 106. Each notice shall include the name of the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and the address of its Corporate Trust Office.
     
Section 611. Acceptance of Appointment by Successor
     In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to all Securities, every such successor Trustee so appointed shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Corporation and to the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on the request of the Corporation or the successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee and shall duly assign, transfer and
 
deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder.
     In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Corporation, the retiring Trustee and each successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto wherein each successor Trustee shall accept such appointment and which (1) shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates, (2) if the retiring Trustee is not retiring with respect to all Securities, shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series as to which the retiring Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee, and (3) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the same trust and that each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such Trustee; and upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates; but, on request of the Corporation or any successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates.
     Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Corporation shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in the first or second preceding paragraph, as the case may be.
     No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be qualified and eligible under this Article.
     
Section 612. Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business
     Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided that such corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto. In case any Securities shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Securities.
     
Section 613. Preferential Collection of Claims Against Corporation
     If and when the Trustee shall be or become a creditor of the Corporation (or any other obligor upon the Securities), the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act regarding the collection of claims against the Corporation (or any such other obligor).
     .
Section 614. Appointment of Authenticating Agent
     The Trustee may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents acceptable to the Corporation with respect to one or more series of Securities which shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such series issued upon exchange, registration of transfer or partial redemption thereof or pursuant to Section 306, and Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Securities by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference
 
shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent. Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the Corporation and shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section.
     Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency or corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be an Authenticating Agent, provided that such corporation shall be otherwise eligible under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent.
     An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Trustee and to the Corporation. The Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof to such Authenticating Agent and to the Corporation. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time such Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent which shall be acceptable to the Corporation and shall give notice of such appointment in the manner provided in Section 106 to all Holders of Securities of the series with respect to which such Authenticating Agent will serve. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent. No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section.
     The Corporation agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to time reasonable compensation for its services under this Section.
     If an appointment with respect to one or more series is made pursuant to this Section, the Securities of such series may have endorsed thereon, in addition to the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an alternative certificate of authentication in the following form:
     This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.

The Trustee may destroy any list furnished to it as provided in Section 701 upon receipt of a new list so furnished.
     The rights of Holders to communicate with other Holders with respect to their rights under this Indenture or under the Securities, and the corresponding rights and privileges of the Trustee, shall be as provided by the Trust Indenture Act.
     Every Holder of Securities, by receiving and holding the same, agrees with the Corporation and the Trustee that neither the Corporation nor the Trustee nor any agent of either of them shall be held accountable by reason of any disclosure of information as to names and addresses of Holders made pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act.

If the Corporation shall so determine, new Securities of any series so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Trustee and the Corporation, to any such supplemental indenture may be prepared and executed by the Corporation and authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in exchange for Outstanding Securities of such series.
     
Section 1001. Payment of Principal, Premium and Interest
     The Corporation covenants and agrees for the benefit of each series of Securities that it will duly and punctually pay the principal of and any premium and interest on the Securities of that series in accordance with the terms of the Securities and this Indenture.
     
Section 1002. Maintenance of Office or Agency
     The Corporation will maintain in each Place of Payment for any series of Securities an office or agency where Securities of that series may be presented or surrendered for payment, where Securities of that series may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Corporation in
 
respect of the Securities of that series and this Indenture may be served. The Corporation will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of such office or agency. If at any time the Corporation shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and the Corporation hereby appoints the Trustee as its agent to receive all such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands.
     The Corporation may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Securities of one or more series may be presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Corporation of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in each Place of Payment for Securities of any series for such purposes. The Corporation will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency.
     
Section 1003. Money for Securities Payments to Be Held in Trust
     If the Corporation shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with respect to any series of Securities, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of or any premium or interest on any of the Securities of that series, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a sum sufficient to pay the principal and any premium and interest so becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided and will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
     Whenever the Corporation shall have one or more Paying Agents for any series of Securities, it will, on or prior to each due date of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Securities of that series, deposit with a Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay such amount, such sum to be held as provided by the Trust Indenture Act, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Corporation will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
     The Corporation will cause each Paying Agent for any series of Securities other than the Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent will (1) comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act applicable to it as a Paying Agent and (2) during the continuance of any default by the Corporation (or any other obligor upon the Securities of that series) in the making of any payment in respect of the Securities of that series, upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums held in trust by such Paying Agent for payment in respect of the Securities of that series.
     The Corporation may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust hereunder by the Corporation or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Corporation or such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such money.
     Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Corporation, in trust for the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Security of any series and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal, premium or interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Corporation on Company Request, or (if then held by the Corporation) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Security shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Corporation for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Corporation as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Corporation cause to be published once, in a newspaper published in the English language, customarily published on each Business Day and of general circulation in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, New York, notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Corporation.
 
     
Section 1004. Statement by Officers as to Default.
     The Corporation will deliver to the Trustee, on or before October 15 of each calendar year or on or before such other day in each calendar year as the Corporation and the Trustee may from time to time agree upon, an Officers' Certificate, stating whether or not to the best knowledge of the signers thereof the Corporation is in default in the performance and observance of any of the terms, provisions and conditions of this Indenture (without regard to any period of grace or requirement of notice provided hereunder) and, if the Corporation shall be in default, specifying all such defaults and the nature and status thereof of which they may have knowledge.
     .
Section 1005. Waiver of Certain Covenants
     Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of such series, the Corporation may, with respect to the Securities of any series, omit in any particular instance to comply with any term, provision or condition set forth in any covenant provided pursuant to Section 301(19), 901(2) or 901(7) for the benefit of the Holders of such series if before the time for such compliance the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series shall, by Act of such Holders, either waive such compliance in such instance or generally waive compliance with such term, provision or condition, but no such waiver shall extend to or affect such term, provision or condition except to the extent so expressly waived, and, until such waiver shall become effective, the obligations of the Corporation and the duties of the Trustee in respect of any such term, provision or condition shall remain in full force and effect.
     .
Section 1006. Calculation of Original Issue Discount
     The Corporation shall file with the Trustee promptly after the end of each calendar year a written notice specifying the amount of original issue discount (including daily rates and accrual periods) accrued on Outstanding Securities as of the end of such year.
     .
Section 1101. Applicability of Article
     Securities of any series which are redeemable before their Stated Maturity shall be redeemable in accordance with their terms and (except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for such Securities) in accordance with this Article.
     .
Section 1102. Election to Redeem; Notice to Trustee
     The election of the Corporation to redeem any Securities shall be evidenced by a Board Resolution or in another manner specified as contemplated by Section 301 for such Securities. In case of any redemption at the election of the Corporation, the Corporation shall, at least 45 days prior to the Redemption Date fixed by the Corporation (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the Trustee of such Redemption Date, of the principal amount of Securities of such series to be redeemed and, if applicable, of the tenor of the Securities to be redeemed. In the case of any redemption of Securities (a) prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of such Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture, or (b) pursuant to an election of the Corporation which is subject to a condition specified in the terms of such Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture, the Corporation shall furnish the Trustee with an Officers' Certificate evidencing compliance with such restriction or condition.
     .
Section 1103. Selection by Trustee of Securities to Be Redeemed
     If less than all the Securities of any series are to be redeemed (unless all the Securities of such series and of a specified tenor are to be redeemed or unless such redemption affects only a single Security), the particular
 
Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of such series not previously called for redemption, by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the selection for redemption of a portion of the principal amount of any Security of such series; provided that the unredeemed portion of the principal amount of any Security shall be in an authorized denomination (which shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination) for such Security. If less than all the Securities of such series and of a specified tenor are to be redeemed (unless such redemption affects only a single Security), the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of such series and specified tenor not previously called for redemption in accordance with the preceding sentence.
     The Trustee shall promptly notify the Corporation in writing of the Securities selected for redemption as aforesaid and, in the case of any Securities selected for partial redemption as aforesaid, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.
     The provisions of the two preceding paragraphs shall not apply with respect to any redemption affecting only a single Security, whether such Security is to be redeemed in whole or in part. In the case of any such redemption in part, the unredeemed portion of the principal amount of the Security shall be in an authorized denomination (which shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination) for such Security.
     For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate, in the case of any Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Securities which has been or is to be redeemed.
     .
Section 1104. Notice of Redemption
     Notice of redemption shall be given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date, to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed, at his address appearing in the Security Register.
     All notices of redemption shall state:
     (1) the Redemption Date;
     (2) the Redemption Price or, if not then ascertainable, the manner of calculation thereof;
     (3) if less than all the Outstanding Securities of any series and of a specified tenor consisting of more than a single Security are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption of any such Securities, the principal amounts) of the particular Securities to be redeemed and, if less than all the Outstanding Securities of any series and of a specified tenor consisting of a single Security are to be redeemed, the principal amount of the particular Security to be redeemed;
     (4) that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest, if any, to the Redemption Date, will become due and payable upon each such Security to be redeemed and, if applicable, that interest thereon will cease to accrue on and after said date;
     (5) the place or places where each such Security is to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest, if any, unless it shall have been specified as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to such Securities that such surrender shall not be required;
     (6) that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the case; and
     (7) such other matters as the Corporation shall deem desirable or appropriate.
     Unless otherwise specified with respect to any Securities in accordance with Section 301, with respect to any redemption of Securities at the election of the Corporation, unless, upon the giving of notice of such redemption, Defeasance shall have been effected with respect to such Securities pursuant to Section 1302, such notice may state
 
that such redemption shall be conditional upon the receipt by the Trustee or the Paying Agent(s) for such Securities, on or prior to the date fixed for such redemption, of money sufficient to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on such Securities and that if such money shall not have been so received such notice shall be of no force or effect and the Corporation shall not be required to redeem such Securities. In the event that such notice of redemption contains such a condition and such money is not so received, the redemption shall not be made and within a reasonable time thereafter notice shall be given, in the manner in which the notice of redemption was given, that such money was not so received and such redemption was not required to be made, and the Trustee or Paying Agent(s) for the Securities otherwise to have been redeemed shall promptly return to the Holders thereof any of such Securities which had been surrendered for payment upon such redemption.
     Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the election of the Corporation, and any notice of non-satisfaction of redemption as aforesaid, shall be given by the Corporation or, at the Corporation's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Corporation. Subject to the preceding paragraph, any such notice of redemption shall be irrevocable.
     .
Section 1105. Securities Payable on Redemption Date
     Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, and the conditions, if any, set forth in such notice having been satisfied, the Securities or portions thereof so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein specified, and from and after such date (unless, in the case of an unconditional notice of redemption, the Corporation shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest, if any) such Securities or portions thereof, if interest-bearing, shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any such Security for redemption in accordance with said notice, such Security or portion thereof shall be paid by the Corporation at the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest, if any, to the Redemption Date; provided, however, that no such surrender shall be a condition to such payment if so specified as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to such Security, and provided further that, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date will be payable to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates according to their terms and the provisions of Section 307.
     If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal and any premium shall, until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate prescribed therefor in the Security.
     .
Section 1106. Securities Redeemed in Part
     Any Security which is to be redeemed only in part shall be surrendered at a Place of Payment therefor (with, if the Corporation or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Corporation and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing), and the Corporation shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security without service charge, a new Security or Securities of the same series and of like tenor, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder, in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Security so surrendered.
     .
Section 1201. Applicability of Article
     The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to any sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of any series except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for such Securities.
     The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of any Securities is herein
 
referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment," and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of such Securities is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment." If provided for by the terms of any Securities, the cash amount of any sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section 1202. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of Securities as provided for by the terms of such Securities.
     .
Section 1202. Satisfaction of Sinking Fund Payments with Securities
     The Corporation (1) may deliver Outstanding Securities of a series (other than any previously called for redemption) and (2) may apply as a credit Securities of a series which have been redeemed either at the election of the Corporation pursuant to the terms of such Securities or through the application of permitted optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of such Securities, in each case in satisfaction of all or any part of any sinking fund payment with respect to any Securities of such series required to be made pursuant to the terms of such Securities as and to the extent provided for by the terms of such Securities; provided that the Securities to be so credited have not been previously so credited. The Securities to be so credited shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the Redemption Price, as specified in the Securities so to be redeemed, for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly.
     .
Section 1203. Redemption of Securities for Sinking Fund
     Not less than 45 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for any Securities, the Corporation will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for such Securities pursuant to the terms of such Securities, the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by payment of cash and the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting Securities pursuant to Section 1202 and stating the basis for such credit and that such Securities have not been previously so credited and will also deliver to the Trustee any Securities to be so delivered. Not less than 30 days prior to each such sinking fund payment date, the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 1103 and cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the Corporation in the manner provided in Section 1104. Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Sections 1105 and 1106.
     .
Section 1301. Applicability of Article
     Unless, pursuant to Section 301, provision is made that either or both of (a) defeasance of any Securities or any series of Securities under Section 1302 and (b) covenant defeasance of any Securities or any series of Securities under Section 1303 shall not apply to such Securities of a series, then the provisions of either or both of Sections 1302 and Section 1303, as the case may be, together with Sections 1304 and 1305, shall be applicable to the Outstanding Securities of such series upon compliance with the conditions set forth below in this Article.
     .
Section 1302. Defeasance and Discharge
     The Corporation may cause itself to be discharged from its obligations with respect to any Securities or any series of Securities on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 1304 are satisfied (hereinafter called "Defeasance"). For this purpose, such Defeasance means that the Corporation shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by such Securities and to have satisfied all its other obligations under such Securities and this Indenture insofar as such Securities are concerned (and the Trustee, at the expense of the Corporation, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), subject to the following which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (1) the rights of Holders of such Securities to receive, solely
 
from the trust fund described in Section 1304 and as more fully set forth in such Section, payments in respect of the principal of and any premium and interest on such Securities when payments are due, (2) the Corporation's obligations with respect to such Securities under Sections 304, 305, 306, 1002 and 1003 and with respect to the Trustee under Section 607, (3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and (4) this Article. Subject to compliance with this Article, Defeasance with respect to any Securities or any series of Securities by the Corporation is permitted under this Section 1302 notwithstanding the prior exercise by the Corporation of its rights under Section 1303 with respect to such Securities. Following a Defeasance, payment of such Securities may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default.
     .
Section 1303. Covenant Defeasance
     The Corporation may cause itself to be released from its obligations under any covenants provided pursuant to Section 301(19), 901(2), 901(6) or 901(7) with respect to any Securities or any series of Securities for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities and the occurrence of any event specified in Section 501(4) (with respect to any such covenants provided pursuant to Section 301(19), 901(2), 901(6) or 901(7)) or 501(7) shall be deemed not to be or result in an Event of Default with respect to such Securities as provided in this Section, in each case on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 1304 are satisfied (hereinafter called "Covenant Defeasance"). For this purpose, such Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to such Securities, the Corporation may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such specified Section (to the extent so specified in the case of Section 501(4)), whether directly or indirectly by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such Section or by reason of any reference in any such Section to any other provision herein or in any other document, but the remainder of this Indenture and such Securities shall be unaffected thereby.
     .
Section 1304. Conditions to Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance
     The following shall be the conditions to the application of Section 1302 or Section 1303 to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be:
     (1) The Corporation shall irrevocably have deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for the purpose of making the following payments, specifically pledged as security for, and dedicated solely to, the benefit of the Holders of such Securities, (A) money in an amount, or (B) Government Obligations which through the scheduled payment of principal and interest in respect thereof in accordance with their terms will provide, not later than the due date of any payment, money in an amount, or (C) a combination thereof, sufficient, in the case of (B) or (C), in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay and discharge, and which shall be applied by the Trustee to pay and discharge, the principal of and any premium and interest on such Securities on the respective Stated Maturities or on any Redemption Date established pursuant to Clause (3) below, in accordance with the terms of this Indenture and such Securities. As used herein, "Government Obligation" means (x) any security which is (i) a direct obligation of the United States of America or the government which issued the foreign currency in which such Securities are payable, for the payment of which its full faith and credit is pledged or (ii) an obligation of a Person controlled or supervised by and acting as an agency or instrumentality of the United States of America or such government which issued the foreign currency in which such Securities are payable, the payment of which is unconditionally guaranteed as a full faith and credit obligation by the United States of America or such other government, which, in either case (i) or (ii), is not callable or redeemable at the option of the issuer thereof, and (y) any depositary receipt issued by a bank (as defined in Section 3(a)(2) of the Securities Act) as custodian with respect to any Government Obligation which is specified in clause (x) above and held by such bank for the account of the holder of such depositary receipt, or with respect to any specific payment of principal of or interest on any Government Obligation which is so specified and held, provided that (except as required by law) such custodian is not authorized to make any deduction from the amount payable to the holder of such depositary receipt from any amount received by the custodian in respect of the Government Obligation or the specific payment of principal or interest evidenced by such depositary receipt.
     (2) No event which is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default
 
with respect to such Securities or any other Securities shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such deposit or, with regard to any such event specified in Sections 501(5) and (6), at any time on or prior to the 90th day after the date of such deposit (it being understood that this condition shall not be deemed satisfied until after such 90th day).
     (3) If the Securities are to be redeemed prior to Stated Maturity (other than from mandatory sinking fund payments or analogous payments), notice of such redemption shall have been duly given pursuant to this Indenture or provision therefor satisfactory to the Trustee shall have been made.
     (4) The Corporation shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent with respect to such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance have been complied with.

     Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 1003, all money and Government Obligations (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 1304 in respect of any Securities shall be held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of such Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any such Paying Agent (including the Corporation acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Holders of such Securities, of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect of principal and any premium and interest, but money so held in trust need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. Moneys and Government Obligations (and the proceeds thereof) held pursuant to this Section for the benefit of the Holders of Subordinated Securities shall not be subject to the subordination provisions established with respect to such Securities pursuant to Section 301(20).
     The Corporation shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the Government Obligations deposited pursuant to Section 1304 or the principal and interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of Outstanding Securities.
     Anything in this Article to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Corporation from time to time upon Company Request any money or Government Obligations held by it as provided in Section 1304 with respect to any Securities which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, are in excess of the amount thereof which would then be required to be deposited to effect the Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, with respect to such Securities.
     .
Section 1401. Indenture and Securities Solely Corporate Obligations
     No recourse for the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Security, or for any claim based thereon or otherwise in respect thereof, and no recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement of the Corporation in this Indenture or in any supplemental indenture, or in any Security, or because of the creation of any indebtedness represented thereby, shall be had against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Corporation or of any successor corporation, either directly or through the Corporation or any successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise; it being expressly understood that all such liability is hereby expressly waived and released as a condition of, and as a consideration for, the execution of this Indenture and the issue of the Securities.
 
     .
Section 1501. Agreement to Subordinate
     The Corporation covenants and agrees, and each Holder of any Subordinated Security issued hereunder by his acceptance thereof, whether upon original issue or upon transfer or assignment, likewise covenants and agrees, that the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on each and all of the Subordinated Securities issued hereunder are hereby expressly subordinated, to the extent and in the manner hereinafter set forth, in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness.
     .
Section 1502. Payment on Dissolution, Liquidation or Reorganization; Default on Senior Indebtedness
     Upon any payment or distribution of assets or securities of the Corporation of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, upon any dissolution or winding up or total or partial liquidation or reorganization of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary or in bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other similar proceedings, or upon any assignment for the benefit of creditors or any other marshalling of the assets and liabilities of the Corporation or otherwise, all principal of (and premium, if any) and interest then due upon all Senior Indebtedness shall first be paid in full, or payment thereof provided for in money or money's worth, before the Holders of the Subordinated Securities or the Trustee on their behalf shall be entitled to receive any assets or securities (other than shares of stock of the Corporation as reorganized or readjusted or securities of the Corporation or any other corporation provided for by a plan of reorganization or readjustment, junior to, or the payment of which is subordinated at least to the extent provided in this Article to the payment of, all Senior Indebtedness which may at the time be outstanding or any securities issued in respect thereof under any such plan of reorganization or readjustment) in respect of the Subordinated Securities (for principal, premium or interest). Upon any such dissolution or winding up or liquidation or reorganization, any payment or distribution of assets or securities of the Corporation of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities (other than as aforesaid), to which the Holders of the Subordinated Securities or the Trustee on their behalf would be entitled, except for the provisions of this Article, shall be made by the Corporation or by any receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other person making such payment or distribution, direct to the holders of Senior Indebtedness or their representatives to the extent necessary to pay all Senior Indebtedness in full, in money or money's worth, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the holders of Senior Indebtedness. In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trustee or the Holder of any Subordinated Security shall, under the circumstances described in the two preceding sentences, have received any payment or distribution of assets or securities of the Corporation of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities (other than as aforesaid) before all Senior Indebtedness is paid in full or payment thereof provided for in money or money's worth, and if such fact shall then have been made known to the Trustee or, as the case may be, such Holder, then such payment or distribution of assets or securities of the Corporation shall be paid over or delivered forthwith to the receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other person making payment or distribution of assets or securities of the Corporation for application to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness remaining unpaid, to the extent necessary to pay all Senior Indebtedness in full, in money or money's worth, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the holders of Senior Indebtedness.
     Subject to the payment in full, in money or money's worth, of all Senior Indebtedness, the Holders of the Subordinated Securities (together with the holders of any indebtedness of the Corporation which is subordinate in right of payment to the payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness and which is not subordinate in right of payment to the Subordinated Securities) shall be subrogated to the rights of the holders of Senior Indebtedness to receive payments or distribution of assets or securities of the Corporation applicable to Senior Indebtedness until the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Senior Indebtedness shall be paid in full. No such payments or distributions applicable to Senior Indebtedness shall, as between the Corporation, its creditors other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness, and the Holders of the Subordinated Securities, be deemed to be a payment by the Corporation to or on account of the Subordinated Securities, it being understood that the provisions of this Article
 
are and are intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Holders of the Subordinated Securities, on the one hand, and the holders of Senior Indebtedness, on the other hand. Nothing contained in this Article or elsewhere in this Indenture or in the Subordinated Securities is intended to or shall impair, as between the Corporation and the Holders of Subordinated Securities, the obligation of the Corporation, which is unconditional and absolute, to pay to the Holders of the Subordinated Securities the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Subordinated Securities as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with their terms, or to affect (except to the extent specifically provided above in this paragraph) the relative rights of the Holders of the Subordinated Securities and creditors of the Corporation other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness. Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Trustee or the Holder of any Subordinated Security from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under this Indenture, subject to the rights, if any, under this Article, of the holders of Senior Indebtedness in respect of assets or securities of the Corporation of any kind or character, whether cash, property or securities, received upon the exercise of any such remedy.

     (iii) during any time Senior Indebtedness is outstanding, the principal of, and accrued interest on, any series of Subordinated Securities shall have been declared due and payable upon an Event of Default pursuant to Section 502 hereof (and such declaration shall not have been rescinded or annulled pursuant to this Indenture);
then, unless and until such default shall have been cured or waived or shall have ceased to exist, or such declaration shall have been waived, rescinded or annulled, no payment shall be made by the Corporation on account of the principal (or premium, if any) or interest on the Subordinated Securities.
     The Trustee shall be entitled to rely on the delivery to it of a written notice by a Person representing himself to be a holder of Senior Indebtedness (or a representative of such holder or a trustee under any indenture under which any instruments evidencing any such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued) to establish that such notice has been given by a holder of such Senior Indebtedness or such representative or trustee on behalf of such holder. In the event that the Trustee determines in good faith that further evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior Indebtedness to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article Fifteen, the Trustee may request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of Senior Indebtedness held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and any other facts pertinent to the right of such Person under this Article Fifteen, and, if such evidence is not furnished, the Trustee may defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment or distribution.

     Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1501 or any other provision of this Indenture, the Trustee and any Paying Agent shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of any Senior Indebtedness, or of the occurrence of any default with respect to Senior Indebtedness of the character described in Section 1502, or of any other facts which would prohibit the making of any payment of moneys to or by the Trustee or such Paying Agent, unless and until the Trustee shall have received, no later than three Business Days prior to such payment, written notice thereof from the Corporation or from a holder of such Senior Indebtedness and the Trustee shallnot be affected by any such notice which may be received by it on or after such third Business Day.
     .
Section 1504. Securityholders Authorize Trustee to Effectuate Subordination of Securities

     .
Section 1506. Article Fifteen Not to Prevent Events of Default
     The failure to make a payment on account of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Subordinated Securities by reason of any provision of this Article Fifteen shall not be construed as preventing the occurrence of an Event of Default under Section 501 or an event which with the giving of notice or lapse of time, or both, would become an Event of Default or in any way prevent the Holders of Subordinated Securities from exercising any right hereunder other than the right to receive payment on the Subordinated Securities.
     .
Section 1507. No Fiduciary Duty of Trustee to Holders of Senior Indebtedness
     The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Indebtedness, and shall not be liable to any such holders (other than for its willful misconduct, bad faith or negligence) if it shall in good faith mistakenly pay over or distribute to the Holders of Subordinated Securities or the Corporation or any other Person, cash, property or securities to which any holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled by virtue of this Article Fifteen or otherwise. Nothing in this Section 1507 shall affect the obligation of any other such Person to hold such payment for the benefit of, and to pay such payment over to, the holders of Senior Indebtedness or their representative. Nothing in this Article Fifteen shall apply to amounts due the Trustee pursuant to Section 607 or any other Section of this Indenture.
     This instrument may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.

          Based upon the foregoing and subject to the limitations, qualifications, exceptions and assumptions set forth herein, I am of the opinion that the Securities have been duly authorized and executed by the Company, and that when duly authenticated by the Trustee and issued and delivered by the Company against payment therefore in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture, the Securities will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its respective terms.

     Such counsel may state that his opinions in paragraphs (vii) and (viii) are subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). Such counsel shall state that nothing has come to his attention that has caused him to believe that each document incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, when filed, was not, on its face, appropriately responsive, in all material respects, to the requirements of the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations. Such counsel shall also state that nothing has come to his attention that has caused him to believe that (i) the Registration Statement, including the Rule 430B Information, as of its effective date and at each deemed effective date with respect to the Underwriters pursuant to Rule 430B(f)(2) of the 1933 Act Regulations, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) the Pricing Disclosure Package at the Applicable Time contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or (iii) that the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, as of the date it was filed with, or transmitted for filing to, the Commission and at the Closing Date, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Such counsel may also state that, except as otherwise expressly provided in such opinion, he does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in or incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus and does not express any opinion or belief as to (i) the financial statements or other financial data contained or incorporated by reference therein, (ii) the statement of the eligibility and qualification of the Trustee included in the Registration Statement (the "Form T-1") or (iii) the information in the Prospectus under the caption "Book-Entry System."
     In rendering the foregoing opinion, such counsel may state that he does not express any opinion concerning any law other than the law of the State of North Carolina and may rely as to
 
all matters of the laws of the States of South Carolina, Ohio and Indiana on appropriate counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives, which may include the Corporation's other "in-house" counsel). Such counsel may also state that he has relied as to certain factual matters on information obtained from public officials, officers of the Corporation and other sources believed by him to be responsible.
 
     You shall also have received a statement of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that:
     (i) no facts have come to such counsel's attention that have caused such counsel to believe that the documents filed by the Corporation under the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations that are incorporated by reference in the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement that forms a part of the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, were not, on their face, appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations (except that in each case such counsel need not express any view as to the financial statements, schedules and other financial information included or incorporated by reference therein or excluded therefrom or the Form T-1) (ii) the Registration Statement, at the
 
Applicable Time and the Prospectus, as of its date, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Rules and Regulations (except that in each case such counsel need not express any view as to the financial statements, schedules and other financial information included or incorporated by reference therein or excluded therefrom or the Form T-1) and (iii) no facts have come to such counsel's attention that have caused such counsel to believe that the Registration Statement, at the Applicable Time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or that the Prospectus, as of its date and as of the Closing Date, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except that in each case such counsel need not express any view as to the financial statements, schedules and other financial information included or incorporated by reference therein or excluded therefrom or the statements contained in the exhibits to the Registration Statement, including the Form T-1). Such counsel shall further state that, in addition, no facts have come to such counsel's attention that have caused such counsel to believe that the Pricing Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except that such counsel need not express any view as to the financial statements, schedules and other financial information included or incorporated by reference therein or excluded therefrom or the statements contained in the exhibits to the Registration Statement, including the Form T-1).
     In addition, such statement shall confirm that the Prospectus has been filed with the Commission within the time period required by Rule 424 of the 1933 Act Regulations and any required filing of a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus pursuant to Rule 433 of the 1933 Act Regulations has been filed with the Commission within the time period required by Rule 433(d) of the 1933 Act Regulations. Such statement shall further state that the Registration Statement became effective upon filing under the 1933 Act and, pursuant to Section 309 of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "1939 Act"), the Indenture has been qualified under the 1939 Act, and that such counsel has been orally advised by the Commission that no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and, to such counsel's knowledge, no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or threatened by the Commission.
     Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP may state that its opinions in paragraphs (v) and (vi) are subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). In addition, such counsel may state that they have relied as to certain factual matters on information obtained from public officials, officers and representatives of the Corporation and that the signatures on all documents examined by them are genuine, assumptions which such counsel have not independently verified.
 
 
     The Corporation will furnish you with such conformed copies of such opinions, certificates, letters and documents as you reasonably request.
     7. (a) The Corporation agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, their respective officers and directors, and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter or within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act, as follows:
Indemnification.
 
In no case shall the Corporation be liable under this indemnity agreement with respect to any claim made against any Underwriter or any such controlling person unless the Corporation shall be notified in writing of the nature of the claim within a reasonable time after the assertion thereof, but failure so to notify the Corporation shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than under subsections 7(a) and 7(b). The Corporation shall be entitled to participate at its own expense in the defense, or, if it so elects, within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice, to assume the defense of any suit brought to enforce any such claim, but if it so elects to assume the defense, such defense shall be conducted by counsel chosen by it and approved by the Underwriter or Underwriters or controlling person or persons, or defendant or defendants in any suit so brought, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. In any such suit, any Underwriter or any such controlling person shall have the right to employ its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Underwriter or such controlling person unless (i) the Corporation and such Underwriter shall have mutually agreed to the employment of such counsel, or (ii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both such Underwriter or such controlling person and the Corporation and such Underwriter or such controlling person shall have been advised by such counsel that a conflict of interest between the Corporation and such Underwriter or such controlling person may arise and for this reason it is not desirable for the same counsel to represent both the indemnifying party and also the indemnified party (it being understood, however, that the Corporation shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys for all such Underwriters and all such controlling persons, which firm shall be designated in writing by you). The Corporation agrees to notify you within a reasonable time of the assertion of any claim against it, any of its officers or directors or any person who controls the Corporation within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act, in connection with the sale of the Notes.
 
 
     8. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the 2013 Notes or the 2018 Notes which it has agreed to purchase hereunder on the Closing Date, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such 2013 Notes and/or 2018 Notes, as applicable, on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Notes, then the Corporation shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Notes on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Corporation that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Notes, or the Corporation notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Notes, you or the Corporation shall have the right to postpone such Closing Date for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Corporation agrees to file promptly any amendments to the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus which may be required. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Notes.
Default by One or More of the Underwriters.
 
     9. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Corporation or its officers and of the several Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Corporation, or any of its officers or directors or any controlling person, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Notes.
Representations and Indemnities to Survive Delivery.
     10. In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the Corporation shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by the Representatives.
Reliance on Your Acts.
     11. . The Corporation acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Corporation on the one hand, and the Underwriters on the other hand, (ii) in connection with the offering contemplated hereby and the process leading to such transaction, each Underwriter is and has been acting solely as a principal and is not the agent or fiduciary of the Corporation or its shareholders, creditors, employees, or any other party, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed or will assume an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Corporation with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Corporation on other matters) and no Underwriter has any obligation to the Corporation with respect to the offering contemplated hereby except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement, (iv) the Underwriters and their respective affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Corporation, and (v) the Underwriters have not provided any legal, accounting, regulatory or tax advice with respect to the transaction contemplated hereby and the Corporation has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate.
