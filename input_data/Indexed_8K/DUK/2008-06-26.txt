On Thursday, June 26, 2008, Duke Energy Corporation ("Duke Energy") announced that it has executed a definitive agreement to acquire Catamount Energy Corporation, a leading wind power company located in Rutland, Vermont, from funds affiliated with Diamond Castle Holdings, LLC.  The acquisition price is approximately $240 million, plus the assumption of approximately $80 million of debt, and is incremental to Duke Energy's previously disclosed capital expenditure plan for 2008.  The acquisition would include over 300 megawatts of power generating assets, including 283 megawatts of Phases 1-5 of the Sweetwater wind power facility in West Texas, and 20 megawatts of cogeneration and biomass generation in New England.  The acquisition would also include approximately 1,750 megawatts of wind assets under development in the United States and United Kingdom.  The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2008 and is subject to customary closing conditions, including termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, and approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Public Utilities Commission of Texas.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
