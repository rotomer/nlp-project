.
 
In connection with the preparation of Duke Energy Corporation's ("Duke Energy" or the "Company") financial statements to be included in its Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2008, the Company learned that Crescent Resources, LLC ("Crescent"), due to its management decision to revise its business strategy to accelerate the timing of cash flows on certain non-strategic property holdings, recorded impairment charges, of which Duke Energy's proportionate share of such impairments is approximately $100 million.  The decision of Crescent to revise its business strategy was, in large part, made in connection with its June 2008 restructuring of the terms of its corporate credit facility.  Duke Energy will reflect these charges as a special item in its second quarter financial results.  Special items represent certain charges and credits, which management believes will not be recurring on regular basis.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
