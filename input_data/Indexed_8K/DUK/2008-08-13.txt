On August 8, 2008, Duke Energy Corporation ("Duke Energy" or the "Company") formed a joint venture with American Electric Power Company, Inc. ("AEP") to build and operate 240 miles of extra-high-voltage 765-kilovolt transmission lines and related facilities in Indiana.  Both Duke Energy and AEP own an equal interest in the joint venture and will share equally in the costs.  The transmission line would link Duke Energy's Greentown sub-station, near Kokomo, Ind., with AEP's Rockport generating station, near Evansville, Ind.  Estimated costs for the project are approximately $1 billion, a portion of which is expected to be financed by the joint venture, but final costs will depend on the routing of the line, equipment and commodity costs.  The joint venture will submit the project to PJM Interconnection and Midwest ISO for consideration in their transmission expansion plans, seek rate approval for the project from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and submit a filing in Indiana to operate as a transmission utility.  The earliest completion date for the project is expected to be 2014 or 2015.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
