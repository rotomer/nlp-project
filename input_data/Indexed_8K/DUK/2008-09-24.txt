On September 24, 2008, Duke Energy Corporation ("Duke Energy") and AREVA announced the formation of ADAGE, a joint venture dedicated to the development of green biopower energy solutions for U.S. electricity customers.  ADAGE will facilitate the development of biopower plants that will use wood waste to produce electricity.  According to the agreement, AREVA will design and build the biomass power plants and Duke Energy Generation Services, a business unit of Duke Energy, will manage the operations of the plants.  The joint venture envisions the potential to build 10 to 12 new wood biomass plants by 2014.  Although the joint venture has not chosen a specific design, a typical 50 MW biomass plant currently costs approximately $200 million to construct.  It is expected that Duke Energy and AREVA will jointly invest approximately $10 million during the first year to develop the business, and project-level financing will be utilized by ADAGE for a portion of any future construction costs.
