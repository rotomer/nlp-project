Duke Energy Ohio, Inc.  announced that the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) approved the settlement agreement on its electric security plan under Ohio's new energy law. The agreement establishes generation rates for 2009 through 2011.  The settlement agreement was reached with most intervening parties, the Staff of the PUCO and the Ohio Consumers' Counsel in October and was then sent to the PUCO for approval.  Under the settlement terms, the base cost for generation service will increase by approximately 2 percent of the total bill annually in 2009 and in 2010 for residential customers, and each year from 2009 through 2011 for non-residential customers.  Additionally, the bill for generation service will continue to include cost-based trackers for fuel and purchased power, capacity purchases and environmental compliance expenditures.
