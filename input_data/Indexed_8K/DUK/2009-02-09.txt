On February 3, 2009, the Compensation Committee ("Committee") of the Board of Directors of Duke Energy Corporation (the "Company") established the 2009 short-term incentive program ("STI") under the Duke Energy Corporation Executive Short-Term Incentive Plan for employees, including Messrs. Hauser, Manly and Turner, our named executive officers other than Mr. Rogers, who does not participate in the STI program.  Fifty percent of each participating named executive officer's 2009 STI opportunity is based on the Company's adjusted diluted earnings per share ("EPS"), with minimum, target and maximum performance levels of $1.13, $1.20 and $1.28, respectively, which levels may be adjusted by the Committee for certain types of transactions.  Twenty percent of each participating named executive officer's 2009 STI opportunity is based on an operations and maintenance ("O&M") expense control goal, with minimum, target and maximum performance levels of $60 million, $100 million and $140 million, respectively, from specified budget submissions.  The 2009 STI program will also incorporate a reliability goal, which will comprise 10% of each participating named executive officer's 2009 STI opportunity, and the remaining 20% of each participating named executive officer's 2009 STI opportunity will be based on the achievement of individual objectives, which will consist of a combination of strategic and operational measures.  If the minimum EPS performance level is not achieved, the Committee has reserved discretion to reduce payouts attributable to the O&M and reliability goals.  The target opportunity for each of Messrs. Hauser, Manly and Turner is 80% of annual base salary.  Depending on performance, each named executive officer could receive from 0% to 190% of his target opportunity.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
