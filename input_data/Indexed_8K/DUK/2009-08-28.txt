     On August 25, 2009, John H. Forsgren and E. James Reinsch were appointed to the Board of Directors of Duke Energy Corporation (the "Company"). Their directorships will expire, along with the Company's other directors' terms, at the next annual meeting of shareholders. There is no arrangement or understanding between Messrs. Forsgren or Reinsch and any other persons or entities pursuant to which Messrs. Forsgren or Reinsch were appointed as a director. As non-employee directors of the Company, Messrs. Forsgren and Reinsch will receive a pro-rated payment of the cash and stock annual retainer, will receive meeting fees in accordance with the Company's Director Compensation Program, as set forth in the Company's Annual Proxy Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 20, 2009, and will be eligible to participate in the Director Savings Plan.
     Messrs. Forsgren and Reinsch are subject to the Company's Stock Ownership Guidelines, which require outside directors to own Duke Energy common stock (or common stock equivalents) with a value equal to at least five times the annual cash retainer (i.e., an ownership level of $250,000) or retain 50% of their vested annual equity retainer.
     Mr. Reinsch is Senior Vice President and Partner of Bechtel Group, an affiliate of Bechtel Power Corporation ("Bechtel") with which Duke Energy Indiana, Inc. ("Duke Energy Indiana"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a $200 million Engineering, Procurement and Construction Management Agreement dated December 15, 2008 related to the construction by Bechtel of Duke Energy Indiana's new coal-fired electrical generation facility in Edwardsport, Indiana. Mr. Reinsch may be deemed to have an interest in the transaction described above as a result of his status as an officer of Bechtel Group.

Conditions of the Obligations of the Underwriters.
 
 
 
     Such counsel may state that his opinions in paragraphs (vii) and (viii) are subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). Such counsel shall state that nothing has come to his attention that has caused him to believe that each document incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, when filed, was not, on its face, appropriately responsive, in all material respects, to the requirements of the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations. Such counsel shall also state that nothing has come to his attention that has caused him to believe that (i) the Registration Statement, including the Rule 430B Information, as of its effective date and at each deemed effective date with respect to the Underwriters pursuant to Rule 430B(f)(2) of the 1933 Act Regulations, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) the Pricing Disclosure Package at the Applicable Time contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or (iii) that the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, as of the date it was filed with, or transmitted for filing to, the Commission and at the Closing Date, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Such counsel may also state that, except as otherwise expressly provided in such opinion, he does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in or incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus and does not express any opinion or belief as to (i) the financial statements or other financial data contained or incorporated by reference therein, (ii) the statement of the eligibility and qualification of the Trustee included in the Registration Statement (the "Form T-1") or (iii) the information in the Prospectus under the caption "Book-Entry System."
 
     In rendering the foregoing opinion, such counsel may state that he does not express any opinion concerning any law other than the law of the State of North Carolina and may rely as to all matters of the laws of the States of South Carolina, Ohio and Indiana on appropriate counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives, which may include the Corporation's other "in-house" counsel). Such counsel may also state that he has relied as to certain factual matters on information obtained from public officials, officers of the Corporation and other sources believed by him to be responsible.
 
 
     You shall also have received a statement of Robinson, Bradshaw & Hinson, P.A., dated the Closing Date, to the effect that:
     (i) no facts have come to such counsel's attention that have caused such counsel to believe that the documents filed by the Corporation under the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations that are incorporated by reference in the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement that forms a part of the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, were not, on their face, appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations (except that in each case such counsel need not express any view as to the financial statements, schedules and other financial information included or incorporated by reference therein or excluded therefrom or the Form T-1) (ii) the Registration Statement, at the Applicable Time and the Prospectus, as of its date, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Rules and Regulations (except that in each case such counsel need not express any view as to the financial statements, schedules and other financial information included or incorporated by reference therein or excluded therefrom or the Form T-1) and (iii) no facts have come to such counsel's attention that have caused such counsel to believe that the Registration Statement, at the Applicable Time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or that the Prospectus, as of its date and as of the Closing Date, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except that in each case such counsel need not express any view as to the financial statements, schedules and other financial information included or incorporated by reference therein or excluded therefrom or the statements contained in the exhibits to the Registration Statement, including the Form T-1). Such counsel shall further state that, in addition, no facts have come to such counsel's attention that have caused such counsel to believe that the Pricing Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except that such counsel need not express any view as to the financial statements, schedules and other financial information included or incorporated by reference therein or excluded therefrom or the statements contained in the exhibits to the Registration Statement, including the Form T-1).
     In addition, such statement shall confirm that the Prospectus has been filed with the Commission within the time period required by Rule 424 of the 1933 Act Regulations and any required filing of a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus pursuant to Rule 433 of the 1933 Act Regulations has been filed with the Commission within the time period required by Rule 433(d) of the 1933 Act Regulations. Such statement shall further state that the Registration Statement became effective upon filing under the 1933 Act and, pursuant to Section 309 of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "1939 Act"), the Indenture has been qualified under the 1939 Act, and that such counsel has been orally advised by the Commission that no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and, to such counsel's knowledge, no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or threatened by the Commission.
 
     Robinson, Bradshaw & Hinson, P.A. may state that its opinions in paragraphs (v) and (vi) are subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). In addition, such counsel may state that they have relied as to certain factual matters on information obtained from public officials, officers and representatives of the Corporation and that the signatures on all documents examined by them are genuine, assumptions which such counsel have not independently verified.
 
     The Corporation will furnish you with such conformed copies of such opinions, certificates, letters and documents as you reasonably request.
     7. (a) The Corporation agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, their respective officers and directors, and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter or within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act, as follows:
Indemnification.
 
In no case shall the Corporation be liable under this indemnity agreement with respect to any claim made against any Underwriter or any such controlling person unless the Corporation shall be notified in writing of the nature of the claim within a reasonable time after the assertion thereof, but failure so to notify the Corporation shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than under subsections 7(a) and 7(b). The Corporation shall be entitled to participate at its own expense in the defense, or, if it so elects, within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice, to assume the defense of any suit brought to enforce any such claim, but if it so elects to assume the defense, such defense shall be conducted by counsel chosen by it and approved by the Underwriter or Underwriters or controlling person or persons, or defendant or defendants in any suit so brought, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. In any such suit, any Underwriter or any such controlling person shall have the right to employ its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Underwriter or such controlling person unless (i) the Corporation and such Underwriter shall have mutually agreed to the employment of such counsel, or (ii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both such Underwriter or such controlling person and the Corporation and such Underwriter or such controlling person shall have been advised by such counsel that a conflict of interest between the Corporation and such Underwriter or such controlling person may arise and for this reason it is not desirable for the same counsel to represent both the indemnifying party and also the indemnified party (it being understood, however, that the Corporation shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys for all such Underwriters and all such controlling persons, which firm shall be designated in writing by you). The Corporation agrees to notify you within a reasonable time of the assertion of any claim against it, any of its officers or directors or any person who controls the Corporation within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act, in connection with the sale of the Notes.
 
 
     8. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the 2014 Notes or the 2019 Notes which it has agreed to purchase hereunder on the Closing Date, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such 2014 Notes and/or the 2019 Notes, as applicable on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Notes, then the Corporation shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Notes on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Corporation that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Notes, or the Corporation notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Notes, you or the Corporation shall have the right to postpone such Closing Date for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Corporation agrees to file promptly any amendments to the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus which may be required. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Notes.
Default by One or More of the Underwriters.
 
     9. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Corporation or its officers and of the several Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Corporation, or any of its officers or directors or any controlling person, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Notes.
Representations and Indemnities to Survive Delivery.
     10. In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the Corporation shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by the Representatives.

     11. .

No Fiduciary Relationship
 
contemplated hereby and the Corporation has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate.
