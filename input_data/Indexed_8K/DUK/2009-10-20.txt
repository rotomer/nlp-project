Item 8.01.   Other Events.
 
On October 20, 2009, Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC (the "Company") announced that it has entered into a settlement agreement with the North Carolina Public Staff, which represents consumers, on the Company's request to raise base rates in North Carolina for the first time since 1991. The terms of the agreement include a base rate increase of $315 million (or approximately 8 percent) beginning January 1, 2010.  The agreement also helps lower the total impact to customer bills as a result of riders relating to the deferral of collection of financing costs related to the Cliffside modernization project until January 1, 2011, as well as fuel costs and nuclear insurance distributions which accelerate the return of regulatory liabilities to customers.  The proposed settlement includes a 10.7 percent Return on Equity and a capital structure of 52.5 percent equity and 47.5 percent long-term debt.  Additionally, Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC agrees not to file another rate case before 2011 with any changes to rates taking effect no sooner than 2012.  The settlement agreement is subject to the review and approval by the North Carolina Utilities Commission.  Changes to rates are expected to be implemented on January 1, 2010.
 
An overview providing additional detail on the settlement is attached to this Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1
