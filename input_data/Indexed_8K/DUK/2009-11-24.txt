On November 24, 2009, Duke Energy Indiana, Inc. (the "Company") filed its fourth petition with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (the "Commission") related to the ongoing review of the Edwardsport clean coal gasification plant under construction in southwest Indiana.  The Company is projecting that the cost estimate for the plant, which was previously approved by the Commission, is estimated to exceed the approved $2.35 billion estimate.  Design modifications and growth in the scope of the project are projected to add approximately $150 million, or 6%, to the capital costs of the project, and an additional amount will also be necessary for contingency. Over the next few months, the Company will examine the costs associated with labor, final engineering, procurement and plant start-up to determine how much will be needed in contingency funds.  The Company expects to provide an updated cost estimate to the Commission by March 2010.  Any cost increases for the plant must be approved by the Commission.  The project is scheduled to be completed in 2012.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
