Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC ("DE Carolinas") entered into a First Amended and Restated engineering, construction and commissioning services agreement (the "Amended Agreement"), effective as of December 21, 2009, with Shaw North Carolina, Inc. ("Shaw").  The Amended Agreement amends and restates that certain engineering, construction and commissioning services agreement previously executed by Shaw and DE Carolinas effective as of May 5, 2008 which was filed by DE Carolinas as Exhibit 10.1 to the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2008 (the "Original Agreement").  The Original Agreement provided for the construction of a new nominally-rated 620MW combustion turbine, combined cycle natural-gas fired electric generation station (the "Station") to be located along the Yadkin River at DE Carolinas' existing Buck steam station generating facility in Rowan County, North Carolina.  Among other changes, the Amended Agreement alters the original agreement by providing that the Station will begin operations in combined cycle mode by the winter of 2011 rather than commencing operations in simple cycle mode by the summer of 2010.  As a result of the further refinement of certain terms and conditions and other amendments to the Original Agreement, the total contract value for Shaw's scope of work is approximately $322 million.  DE Carolinas retains the right to terminate the agreement with Shaw at any time at DE Carolinas' convenience, subject to customary cancellation and demobilization charges in accordance with the terms of the agreement.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
