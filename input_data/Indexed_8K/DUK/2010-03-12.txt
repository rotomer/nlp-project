Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC ("DE Carolinas") entered into an Engineering, Construction and Commissioning Services Agreement, effective March 8, 2010, with Shaw North Carolina, Inc. ("Shaw") for the construction of a new nominally-rated 620MW combustion turbine, combined cycle natural-gas fired electric generation station (the "Station") to be located at DE Carolinas' existing Dan River steam station generating site in Rockingham County, North Carolina.  The North Carolina Utilities Commission approved the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for the project in June 2008; the Station will provide intermediate generating capacity to the Carolinas system with plans to begin commercial operations by the end of 2012.  The Station will consist of (a) two General Electric 7FA combustion turbines, (b) two Vogt natural circulation, duct fired heat recovery steam generators, (c) one General Electric reheat condensing steam turbine generator and (d) all other associated appurtenances.  Shaw is working under a Limited Notice to Proceed and the total contract value for Shaw's scope of work on the Station is approximately $325 million.  DE Carolinas has rights to terminate the agreement with Shaw at any time at DE Carolinas' convenience, subject to customary cancellation and demobilization charges in accordance with the terms of the agreement.
