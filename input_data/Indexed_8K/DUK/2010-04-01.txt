Duke Energy Corporation, through its indirect subsidiary
Texas Eastern Arabian, Ltd. ("Texas Eastern"), has announced that its joint venture with Celanese Corporation and Saudi Basic Industries Corporation, National Methanol Company ("Ibn Sina"), will construct a 50,000 ton polyacetal production facility in Saudi Arabia.  Engineering and construction of the facility is expected to begin by 2011.  Duke Energy's share of the capital investment for the polyacetal production facility will be self-funded from Texas Eastern's share of Ibn Sina distributions.
 
Construction of the facility is part of an extension of the Ibn Sina joint venture for an additional 20 years through 2032 which was originally entered into in 1981 and of which Celanese Corporation and Texas Eastern each hold 25 percent with the remaining 50 percent held by Saudi Basic Industries Corporation. Upon successful startup of the polyacetal production facility, anticipated to occur in 2013, Texas Eastern's share of future distributions from Ibn Sina will decrease to 17.5 percent; however, it will retain 25 percent of the board representation and voting rights of Ibn Sina.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
