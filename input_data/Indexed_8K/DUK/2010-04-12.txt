     (b) after each of its Euro-Dollar Loans has been repaid, all payments of principal which would otherwise be applied to repay such Loans shall be applied to repay its Base Rate Loans instead.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We have acted as counsel to [Duke Energy Corporation., a Delaware corporation], [Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company] (the ""), in connection with the Credit Agreement (the ""), dated as of April 7, 2010, among Duke Energy Corporation and Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC (the ""), the banks listed on the signature pages thereof, Branch Banking and Trust Company, as Administrative Agent, and the other Agents party thereto. Capitalized terms used herein and not defined shall have the meanings given to them in the Credit Agreement. This opinion letter is being delivered pursuant to Section 3.01(b) of the Credit Agreement.
Borrower
Credit Agreement
Borrowers
     In connection with this opinion, we also examined originals, or copies identified to our satisfaction, of such other documents and considered such matters of law and fact as we, in our professional judgment, have deemed appropriate to render the opinions contained herein. Where we have considered it appropriate, as to certain facts we have relied, without investigation or analysis of any underlying data contained therein, upon certificates or other comparable documents of public officials and officers or other appropriate representatives of the Borrower.
     In rendering the opinions contained herein, we have assumed, among other things, that the Credit Agreement and any Notes to be executed (i) are within the Borrower's corporate powers, (ii) have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, (iii) have been duly executed and delivered, (iv) require no
 
action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency of official and (v) do not contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision of applicable law or regulation or of the Borrower's certificate of incorporation or by-laws or any agreement, judgment, injunction, order, decree or other instrument binding upon the Borrower or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Borrower. In addition, we have assumed that the Credit Agreement fully states the agreement between the Borrower and the Banks with respect to the matters addressed therein, and that the Credit Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of each Bank, enforceable in accordance with its respective terms.
     The opinions set forth herein are limited to matters governed by the laws of the State of North Carolina and the federal laws of the United States, and no opinion is expressed herein as to the laws of any other jurisdiction. For purposes of our opinions, we have disregarded the choice of law provisions in the Credit Agreement and, instead, have assumed with your permission that the Credit Agreement and the Notes are governed exclusively by the internal, substantive laws and judicial interpretations of the State of North Carolina. We express no opinion concerning any matter respecting or affected by any laws other than laws that a lawyer in North Carolina exercising customary professional diligence would reasonably recognize as being directly applicable to the Borrower, the Loans, or any of them.
     Based upon and subject to the foregoing and the further limitations and qualifications hereinafter expressed, it is our opinion that the Credit Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower and the Notes, if and when issued, will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower, in each case, enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with its terms.
     The opinions expressed above are subject to the following qualifications and limitations:
     1. Enforcement of the Credit Agreement and the Notes is subject to the effect of applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally.
     2. Enforcement of the Credit Agreement and the Notes is subject to the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) by which a court with proper jurisdiction may deny rights of specific performance, injunction, self-help, possessory remedies or other remedies.
 
     3. We do not express any opinion as to the enforceability of any provisions contained in the Credit Agreement or any Note that (i) purport to excuse a party for liability for its own acts, (ii) purport to make void any act done in contravention thereof, (iii) purport to authorize a party to act in its sole discretion, (iv) require waivers or amendments to be made only in writing, (v) purport to effect waivers of constitutional, statutory or equitable rights or the effect of applicable laws, (vi) impose liquidated damages, penalties or forfeiture, or (vii) purport to indemnify a party for its own negligence or willful misconduct. Indemnification provisions in the Credit Agreement are subject to and may be rendered unenforceable by applicable law or public policy, including applicable securities law.
     4. We do not express any opinion as to the enforceability of any provisions contained in the Credit Agreement or the Notes purporting to require a party thereto to pay or reimburse attorneys' fees incurred by another party, or to indemnify another party therefor, which may be limited by applicable statutes and decisions relating to the collection and award of attorneys' fees, including but not limited to North Carolina General Statutes  6-21.2.
     5. We do not express any opinion as to the enforceability of any provisions contained in the Credit Agreement purporting to waive the right of jury trial. Under North Carolina General Statutes  22B-10, a provision for the waiver of the right to a jury trial is unconscionable and unenforceable.
     6. We do not express any opinion as to the enforceability of any provisions contained in the Credit Agreement concerning choice of forum or consent to the jurisdiction of courts, venue of actions or means of service of process.
     7. It is likely that North Carolina courts will enforce the provisions of the Credit Agreement providing for interest at a higher rate resulting from a Default or Event of Default (a "") which rate is higher than the rate otherwise stipulated in the Credit Agreement. The law, however, disfavors penalties, and it is possible that interest at the Default Rate may be held to be an unenforceable penalty, to the extent such rate exceeds the rate applicable prior to a default under the Credit Agreement. Also, since North Carolina General Statutes  24-10.1 expressly provides for late charges, it is possible that North Carolina courts, when faced specifically with the issue, might rule that this statutory late charge preempts any other charge (such as default interest) by a bank for delinquent payments. The only North Carolina case which we have found that addresses this issue is a 1978 Court of Appeals decision, which in our opinion is of limited precedential value, 38 N.C. App. 120, 247 S.E.2d 648 (1978), , 297 N.C. 524, 256 S.E.2d 388 (1979). While the court in that case did allow interest
Default Rate
North Carolina National Bank v. Burnette,
rev'd on other grounds
 
after default (commencing with the date requested in the complaint) at a rate six percent in excess of pre-default interest, we are unable to determine from the opinion that any question was raised as to this being penal in nature, nor does the court address the possible question of the statutory late charge preempting a default interest surcharge. Therefore, since the North Carolina Supreme Court has not ruled in a properly presented case raising issues of its possible penal nature and those of North Carolina General Statutes  24-10.1, we are unwilling to express an unqualified opinion that the Default Rate of interest prescribed in the Credit Agreement is enforceable.
     8. We do not express any opinion as to the enforceability of any provisions contained in the Credit Agreement relating to evidentiary standards or other standards by which the Credit Agreement are to be construed.
     This opinion letter is delivered solely for your benefit in connection with the Credit Agreement and, except for any Additional Bank or any Assignee which becomes a Bank pursuant to Section 2.16 or 9.06(c) of the Credit Agreement, may not be used or relied upon by any other Person or for any other purpose without our prior written consent in each instance. Our opinions expressed herein are as of the date hereof, and we undertake no obligation to advise you of any changes of applicable law or any other matters that may come to our attention after the date hereof that may affect our opinions expressed herein.

     We have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records, certificates of public officials and other instruments and have conducted such other investigations of fact and law as we have deemed necessary or advisable for purposes of this opinion.
     In rendering the opinion contained herein, we have assumed, among other things, that the Credit Agreement and any Notes to be executed (i) are within each Borrower's corporate powers, (ii) have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, (iii) have been duly executed and delivered, (iv) require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency of
 
official and (v) do not contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision of applicable law or regulation or of either Borrower's certificate of incorporation or by-laws or any agreement, judgment, injunction, order, decree or other instrument binding upon either Borrower or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of either Borrower.
     Upon the basis of the foregoing, we are of the opinion that the Credit Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of each Borrower and the Notes, if and when issued by a Borrower, constitute valid and binding obligations of such Borrower enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, except as the same may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity.
     In giving the foregoing opinion, we express no opinion as to the effect (if any) of any law of any jurisdiction (except the State of New York) in which any Bank is located which limits the rate of interest that such Bank may charge or collect.
     This opinion is rendered solely to you in connection with the above matter. This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose or relied upon by or furnished to any other person, firm or corporation without our prior written consent, except for Additional Banks and all Participants.
