Item 7.01.  Regulation FD Disclosure.
 
Duke Energy Indiana, Inc. (the "Company") has updated its cost estimate for the Edwardsport clean coal gasification plant under construction in southwest Indiana.  The project's scale and complexity has added approximately $530 million to the $2.35 billion estimate which was previously approved by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (the "Commission").  The Company announced last November that costs would be increasing as the project's engineering progressed.  Most of the design work and equipment purchasing is now done, and total project costs are estimated at $2.88 billion, including contingency and financing costs.  The cost increases for the plant must be approved by the Commission before they can be phased into customer electric rates.  The project is scheduled to be completed in 2012.

Including remaining contingency of $126 million and AFUDC of $164 million
     
Cost increase of $530 million from previous approved cost of $2.35 billion
     
Increase primarily the result of increases to project scope and design evolution
     
If approved by IURC, the increase in costs will add about 3 percent to the average customer rate
     
Hearings scheduled to begin August 10, 2010
     
In-service date still expected to be in 2012
