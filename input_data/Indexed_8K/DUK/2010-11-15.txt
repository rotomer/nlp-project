Duke Energy Ohio MRO Proposal
                 
On November 15, 2010, Duke Energy Ohio filed with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) for approval of a MRO
                 
Under the MRO, customer rates are fully based upon market prices after a blending period
 
                 
MRO proposal is effective January 1, 2012
                 
MRO is permanent (once approved, utility cannot go back to ESP structure)
                 
Duke Energy Ohio will remain the distribution company for customers under the MRO
 
                 
Generation Pricing
                 
Continues to be bypassable for customers choosing to switch to an alternative generation provider
 
                 
Transition Period from ESP Pricing to MRO Pricing  "Blending Period"
                 
Blending Period can be for a term of no less than two years and up to 10 years (subject to PUCO discretion)
                 
Duke Energy Ohio has proposed a Blending Period from January 1, 2012 to May 31, 2014
                 
Year 1 (17 month period from January 1, 2012 to May 31, 2013)
                 
Pricing = 90% of legacy ESP price + 10% of market auction price
                 
Year 2 (June 1, 2013 to May 31, 2014)
                 
Pricing = 80% of legacy ESP price + 20% of market auction price
                 
Thereafter (June 1, 2014)
                 
Pricing = 100% of market auction price
 
                 
Market price component will be determined via a Competitive Bidding Process (CBP) or auction
 
                 
ESP price component during blending period equals the ESP rate in effect at the end of 2011
 
                 
Competitive Bidding Process Auction
                 
Descending-price clock auction format

To be administered by independent third-party
                 
Auctions will be staggered to achieve price-smoothing benefits for customers
 
                 
Generation Asset Transfer
                 
Duke Energy Ohio intends to transfer its legacy generation assets dedicated to the native load customer in Ohio no later than the end of the blending period that it has proposed in its filing
                 
Request to transfer generation assets will be made independently of the MRO application
