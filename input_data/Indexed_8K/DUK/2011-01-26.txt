Item 7.01.  Regulation FD Disclosure.
 
On January 25, 2011, Duke Energy Indiana, Inc. (the "Company") filed a motion with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (the "IURC") related to its request to increase the approved project cost of the Edwardsport clean coal gasification plant from $2.35 billion to $2.88 billion.
 
Due in part to potential disputes related to the scope of requested discovery, the Company has requested that the procedural schedule be modified with hearings being delayed from March 17-22, 2011, as currently scheduled, to early June 2011.
 
Additionally, the Company has
requested that the
periodic IGCC Riders
be processed and implemented expeditiously, subject to refund, so that
financing costs
on the project
will not continue to accrue unduly
.  Specifically, the request includes maintaining the currently scheduled hearings on IGCC-5 and IGCC-6 for March 24 and March 25, 2011, respectively.
 
The Company's motion is subject to the review and approval by the IURC.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
