Exhibit 10.1
 
This (the "Agreement") has been made as of                                    (the "Date of Grant") between , a Delaware corporation, with its principal offices in Charlotte, North Carolina (the "Corporation"), and                                 (the "Grantee").
Performance Award Agreement
Duke Energy Corporation
 
Under the Duke Energy Corporation 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as it may, from time to time, be further amended (the "Plan"), the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the "Committee"), or its delegatee, has determined the form of this Agreement and selected the Grantee, as an Employee, to receive the award evidenced by this Agreement (the "Award") and the Performance Shares and tandem Dividend Equivalents that are subject hereto.  The applicable provisions of the Plan are incorporated in this Agreement by reference, including the definitions of terms contained in the Plan (unless such terms are otherwise defined herein).
 
In accordance with the Plan, the Corporation has made this Award, effective as of the Date of Grant and upon the following terms and conditions:
 
Section 1.
              .  At target performance, the number of Performance Shares and the number of tandem Dividend Equivalents subject to this Award are each                                                              ; at maximum performance, the number of Performance Shares and the number of tandem Dividend Equivalents subject to this award are equal to 150% of the number of Performance Shares and tandem Dividend Equivalents at target performance, respectively.  The number of such Performance Shares that may become vested upon determination of achievement of each Performance Goal at maximum, as provided in Section 2(a), is 150% of the number that becomes vested at target performance.  Each Performance Share, upon becoming vested, represents a right to receive payment in the form of one (1) share of Common Stock.  Each tandem Dividend Equivalent, after its tandem Performance Share vests, represents a right to receive a cash payment equivalent in amount to the aggregate cash dividends declared and paid on one (1) share of Common Stock for the period beginning on the Date of Grant and ending on the date the vested, tandem Performance Share is paid or deferred and before the Dividend Equivalent expires.  Performance Shares and Dividend Equivalents are used solely as units of measurement, and are not shares of Common Stock and the Grantee is not, and has no rights as, a shareholder of the Corporation by virtue of this Award.
Number and Nature of Performance Shares and Tandem Dividend Equivalents
Section 2.
             
Vesting of Performance Shares
.
 
(a) .  Except as otherwise provided in this Section 2, the Performance Shares shall vest only if and to the extent the Committee, or its delegatee, determines that the Performance Goals (as defined below) have been met (provided that such determination shall be made not later than the first March 15 following the end of the Performance Period, as defined below).  To the extent Performance Goals are not met, the Performance Shares that do not so become vested shall be forfeited.  The Committee reserves the right to reduce any vesting to the extent the Committee determines that such reduction is equitable and appropriate in connection with the proposed merger with Progress Energy, Inc.
Performance Goals
 
(i)            The following Performance Goal shall apply with respect to one-half of the Performance Shares and Dividend Equivalents covered by this Agreement.  Provided Grantee's continuous employment by the Corporation, including Subsidiaries, has not terminated, or as otherwise provided in Sections 2(b) or 2(c), up to one-half of the Performance Shares subject to this Award shall become vested upon the written determination by the Committee, or its delegatee, in its sole discretion, of the extent to which the Corporation achieves the "TSR Performance Goal," which is the Corporation's Total Shareholder Return ("TSR") percentile ranking among the companies that are in the Philadelphia Utility Index as of the end of the Performance Period, with higher percentile ranking for more positive/less negative TSR, for the period beginning January 1, 2011 and ending December 31, 2013 ("Performance Period"),  in accordance with the applicable vesting percentage specified for such percentile ranking in the following schedule:
 
 
*When such determination is of a percentile ranking between those specified, the Committee, or its delegatee, in its sole discretion, shall interpolate to determine the applicable vesting percentage.
Such Performance Shares that do not so become vested shall be forfeited.  For purposes of this Agreement, TSR means the change in fair market value over a specified period of time, expressed as a percentage, of an initial investment in specified common stock, with dividends reinvested, all as determined utilizing such methodology as the Committee, or its delegatee, shall approve, provided, however, that the Committee, or its delegatee, shall have the discretion to make appropriate and equitable adjustments to the TSR of any company (including the Corporation) whose shares trade ex-dividend as of December 31, 2013, provided, however, that no such adjustment shall be permitted if it would result in the loss of the otherwise available exemption of the Award under Section 162(m) of the Code.  In the event that a company becomes a member of the Philadelphia Utility Index following January 1, 2011, such company shall not be taken into account for purposes of this Agreement.
 
(ii)           The following Performance Goal shall apply with respect to one-half of the Performance Shares and Dividend Equivalents covered by this Agreement.  Provided Grantee's continuous employment by the Corporation, including Subsidiaries, has not terminated, or as otherwise provided in Sections 2(b) or 2(c), up to one-half of the Performance Shares subject to this Award shall become vested upon the written determination by the Committee, or its delegatee, in its sole discretion, of the extent to which the Corporation achieves the "ROE Performance Goal," which is based on the Corporation's return on equity ("ROE"), as calculated in accordance with , for the Performance Period, in accordance with the applicable vesting percentage specified for ROE in the following schedule:
Exhibit A
 
 
*When such determination is at a level between those specified, the Committee, or its delegatee, in its sole discretion, shall interpolate to determine the applicable vesting percentage.
Such Performance Shares that do not so become vested shall be forfeited.
 
(b) In the event that, prior to the date that the determination of the achievement of each Performance Goal is made, the Grantee's continuous employment by the Corporation, including Subsidiaries, terminates, the Performance Shares subject to this Award are thereupon forfeited, except that if such employment terminates (i) at a time when Grantee has attained age 55 and has at least five years of vesting service under the Duke Energy Retirement Cash Balance Plan or Cinergy Corp. Non-Union Employees' Pension Plan, or under another retirement plan of the Corporation or a Subsidiary which plan the Committee, or its delegatee, in its sole discretion, determines to be the functional equivalent of the Duke Energy Retirement Cash Balance Plan or the Cinergy Corp. Non-Union Employees' Pension Plan, unless the Committee, or its delegatee, in its sole discretion, determines that Grantee is in violation of any obligation identified in Section 3, (ii) as the result of the Grantee's death, (iii) as the result of the Grantee's permanent and total disability within the meaning of Code Section 22(e)(3), (iv) as the result of the termination of such employment by the Corporation, or employing Subsidiary, other than for cause, as determined by the Corporation or employing Subsidiary, in its sole discretion, or (v) as the direct and sole result, as determined by the Corporation, or employing Subsidiary, in its sole discretion, of the divestiture of assets, a business, or a company, by the Corporation or a Subsidiary, the Performance Shares subject to this Award shall vest upon such determination of the achievement of each Performance Goal, at such vesting percentage determined by the Committee, or its delegatee, in its sole discretion, by prorating on the basis of the portion of the Performance Period that such employment continued while Grantee was entitled to payment of salary (unless such termination occurs after the end of the Performance Period, in which event the number of Performance Shares earned, if any, shall not be prorated).
 
In the event that Grantee is on an employer-approved, personal leave of absence on the date that the determination of the achievement of each Performance Goal is made, then, unless prohibited by law, vesting shall be postponed and shall not occur unless and until Grantee returns to active service in accordance with the terms of the approved personal leave of absence and before November 1 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Performance Period ends.  In the event Grantee does not return to active service from such leave of absence prior to November 1 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Performance Period ends, any Performance Shares covered by this Award that were not vested as of the commencement of such leave shall be immediately forfeited (as if Grantee terminated employment for purposes of Section 4 hereof).   Further, in the event that such determination is made and during any portion of the Performance Period the Grantee was on employer-approved, personal leave of absence, the applicable vesting percentage shall be determined by the Committee, or its delegatee, in its sole
discretion, to reflect only that portion of the Performance Period during which such employment continued while the Grantee was entitled to payment of salary.
 
(c) In the event that a Change in Control occurs before the Performance Period has ended and (i) before the Grantee's continuous employment by the Corporation, including Subsidiaries, terminates, or (ii) after such employment terminates during the Performance Period, (A) at a time when Grantee is considered "retired", unless the Corporation, in its sole discretion, determines that Grantee is in violation of any obligation identified in Section 3, or (B) as the result of an event listed in items (ii)  (v) of the first sentence of Section 2(b), the Performance Shares subject to this Award shall vest upon such occurrence, at such vesting percentage determined by the Committee, or its delegatee, in its sole discretion, by prorating down, assuming performance at the target level for each Performance Goalon the basis of the portion of the Performance Period that has elapsed prior to the time of such occurrence (or such earlier termination of employment), and the remaining Performance Shares shall be forfeited, irrespective of any subsequent determination of the achievement of each Performance Goal.
,
 
Section 3
.              .  In consideration of the continued vesting opportunity provided under Section 2 following the termination of Grantee's continuous employment by the Corporation, including Subsidiaries, if, at the time of such termination of employment, Grantee is considered "retired", Grantee agrees that during the period beginning with such termination of employment and ending with the third anniversary of the Date of Grant ("Restricted Period"), Grantee shall not (i) without the prior written consent of the Corporation, or its delegatee, become employed by, serve as a principal, partner, or member of the board of directors of, or in any similar capacity with, or otherwise provide service to, a competitor, to the detriment, of the Corporation or any Subsidiary, (ii) violate any of Grantee's other noncompetition obligations, or any of Grantee's nonsolicitation or nondisclosure obligations, to the Corporation or any Subsidiary; or (iii) except as required by subpoena or other legal process (in which event the Grantee will give the Chief Legal Officer of the Corporation prompt notice of such subpoena or other legal process in order to permit the Corporation or any affected individual to seek appropriate protective orders), publish or provide any oral or written statements about the Corporation or any Subsidiary, any of the Corporation's or any Subsidiary's current or former officers, executives, directors, employees, agents or representatives or any initiative, program or policy of the Corporation or any Subsidiary relating to any matter whatsoever that are disparaging, slanderous, libelous or defamatory, or that disclose private or confidential information about their business affairs, or that constitute an intrusion into their private lives, or that give rise to unreasonable publicity about their private lives, or that place them in a false light before the public, or that constitute a misappropriation of their name or likeness. The noncompetition obligations of clause (i) of the preceding sentence shall be limited in scope and shall be effective only with respect to competition with the Corporation or any Subsidiary in the businesses of:  production, transmission,
Violation of Grantee Obligation
distribution, or retail or wholesale marketing or selling of electricity; resale or arranging for the purchase or for the resale, brokering, marketing, or trading of electricity or derivatives thereof; energy management and the provision of energy solutions; development and management of fiber optic communications systems; development and operation of power generation facilities, and sales and marketing of electric power, domestically and abroad; and any other business in which the Corporation, including Subsidiaries, is engaged at the termination of Grantee's continuous employment by the Corporation, including Subsidiaries; and within the following geographical areas (i) any country in the world where the Corporation, including Subsidiaries, has at least US$25 million in capital deployed as of termination of Grantee's continuous employment by Corporation, including Subsidiaries; (ii) the continent of North America; (iii) the United States of America and Canada; (iv) the United States of America; (v) the states of North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Georgia, Florida, Texas, California, Massachusetts, Illinois, Michigan, New York, Colorado, Oklahoma and Louisiana; (vi) the states of North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, Colorado, Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana; and (vii) any state or states with respect to which was conducted a business of the Corporation, including Subsidiaries, which business constituted a substantial portion of Grantee's employment.  The Corporation and Grantee intend the above restrictions on competition in geographical areas to be entirely severable and independent, and any invalidity or enforceability of this provision with respect to any one or more of such restrictions, including areas, shall not render this provision unenforceable as applied to any one or more of the other restrictions, including areas.  If any part of this provision is held to be unenforceable because of the duration, scope or area covered, the Corporation and Grantee agree to modify such part, or that the court making such holding shall have the power to modify such part, to reduce its duration, scope or area, including deletion of specific words and phrases, i.e., "blue penciling", and in its modified, reduced or blue pencil form, such part shall become enforceable and shall be enforced.  Nothing in Section 3 shall be construed to prohibit Grantee from being retained during the Restricted Period in a capacity as an attorney licensed to practice law, or to restrict Grantee from providing advice and counsel in such capacity, in any jurisdiction where such prohibition or restriction is contrary to law.
 
Section 4.             
Forfeiture
.  Any Performance Share subject to this Award shall be forfeited upon the termination of the Grantee's continuous employment by the Corporation, including Subsidiaries, from the Date of Grant, except to the extent otherwise provided in Section 2.  Any Dividend Equivalent subject to this Award shall expire at the time its tandem Performance Share (i) is vested and paid, or deferred, or (ii) is forfeited. Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, this Award shall be forfeited automatically and shall be void in the event that the Grantee volunteers to terminate employment with the Corporation, including Subsidiaries, pursuant to the Duke Energy Corporation 2010 Voluntary Opportunity Plan.
Section 5.
             
Dividend Equivalent Payment
.  Payment with respect to any Dividend Equivalent subject to this Award that is in tandem with a Performance Share that is vested and paid shall be paid in cash to the Grantee at the same time as the vested Performance Share as provided in Section 6, or, if the vested Performance Share is deferred by Grantee as provided in Section 6, payment with respect to the tandem Dividend Equivalent shall likewise be deferred.  The Dividend Equivalent payment amount shall equal the aggregate cash dividends declared and paid with respect to one (1) share of Common Stock for the period beginning on the Date of Grant and ending on the date the vested, tandem Performance Share is paid or deferred and before the Dividend Equivalent expires.  However, should the timing of a particular payment under Section 6 to the Grantee in shares of Common Stock in conjunction with the timing of a particular cash dividend declared and paid on Common Stock be such that the Grantee receives such shares without the right to receive such dividend and the Grantee would not otherwise be entitled to payment under the expiring Dividend Equivalent with respect to such dividend, the Grantee, nevertheless, shall be entitled to such payment.  Dividend Equivalent payments shall be subject to withholding for taxes. Any required income tax withholdings in respect of Dividend Equivalents attributable to Performance Shares shall be satisfied by reducing the cash payment in respect of the required withholding amount, unless the Committee, or its delegatee, in its discretion, requires Grantee to satisfy such tax obligation by other payment to the Corporation.
 
Section 6.             
Payment of Performance Shares
.   Payment of Performance Shares subject to this Award that become vested shall be made to the Grantee on the earlier of: (i) the calendar year immediately following the Performance Period, or (ii) within 30 days after the occurrence of a "change in the ownership," a "change in the effective control" or a "change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets" of the Corporation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, except to the extent deferred by the Grantee in accordance with such procedures as the Committee, or its delegatee, may prescribe from time to time or except to the extent required to avoid accelerated taxation and/or tax penalties under Section 409A of the Code.  Payment (or deferrals, as applicable) shall be subject to withholding for taxes.  Payment shall be in the form of one (1) share of Common Stock for each full vested Performance Share, and any fractional vested Performance Share shall be rounded up to the next whole share for purposes of both vesting under Section 2 and payment under Section 6.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the number of shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be paid or deferred (valued at Fair Market Value on the date the respective Performance Share became vested, or if later, payable) shall be reduced by the Committee, or its delegatee, in its sole discretion, to fully satisfy tax withholding requirements, unless the Committee, or its delegate, in its discretion requires Grantee to satisfy such tax obligation by other payment to the Corporation.  In the event that payment, after any reduction in the number of shares of Common Stock to satisfy withholding for tax requirements, would be for less than ten (10) shares of Common Stock, then, if so determined by the Committee, or its delegatee, in its sole discretion, payment, instead of being
made in shares of Common Stock, shall be made in a cash amount equal in value to the shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be paid, valued at Fair Market Value on the date the respective Performance Shares became vested.
 
Section 7.
             
No Employment Right
.  Nothing in this Agreement or in the Plan shall confer upon the Grantee the right to continued employment with the Corporation or any Subsidiary, or affect the right of the Corporation or any Subsidiary to terminate the employment or service of the Grantee at any time for any reason.
 
Section 8.
             
Nonalienation
.  The Performance Shares and Dividend Equivalents subject to this Award are not assignable or transferable by Grantee.  Upon any attempt to transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate, sell or otherwise dispose of any such Performance Share or Dividend Equivalent, or of any right or privilege conferred hereby, or upon the levy of any attachment or similar process upon such Performance Share or Dividend Equivalent, or upon such right or privilege, such Performance Share or Dividend Equivalent, or such right or privilege, shall immediately become null and void.
 
Section 9.             
Determinations
.  Determinations by the Committee, or its delegatee, shall be final and conclusive with respect to the interpretation of the Plan and this Agreement.
 
Section 10.           
Governing Law
.  This Agreement shall be governed, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to transactions that take place entirely within that state.
 
Section 11
.            . 
Conflicts with Plan, Correction of Errors, Section 409A and Grantee's Consent
In the event that any provision of this Agreement conflicts in any way with a provision of the Plan, such Plan provision shall be controlling and the applicable provision of this Agreement shall be without force and effect to the extent necessary to cause such Plan provision to be controlling.  In the event that, due to administrative error, this Agreement does not accurately reflect an Award properly granted to the Grantee pursuant to the Plan, the Corporation, acting through its Executive Compensation and Benefits Department, reserves the right to cancel any erroneous document and, if appropriate, to replace the cancelled document with a corrected document.  It is the intention of the Corporation and the Grantee that this Award not result in unfavorable tax consequences to Grantee under Code Section 409A.  Accordingly, Grantee consents to such amendment of this Agreement as the Corporation may reasonably make in furtherance of such intention, and the Corporation shall promptly provide, or make available to, Grantee a copy of any such amendment.
 
To the extent applicable, it is intended that this Agreement comply with the provisions of Section 409A of the Code and that this Award not result in unfavorable tax consequences to Grantee under Section 409A of the Code.  This
Agreement will be administered and interpreted in a manner consistent with this intent, and any provision that would cause this Agreement to fail to satisfy Section 409A of the Code will have no force and effect until amended to comply therewith (which amendment may be retroactive to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code).  The Corporation and the Grantee agree to work together in good faith in an effort to comply with Section 409A of the Code including, if necessary, amending this Agreement based on further guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service from time to time, provided that the Corporation shall not be required to assume any increased economic burden.  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, to the extent required in order to avoid accelerated taxation and/or tax penalties under Section 409A of the Code, the Grantee shall not be considered to have terminated employment with Corporation for purposes of this Agreement and no payments shall be due to him under this Agreement which are payable upon his termination of employment until he would be considered to have incurred a "separation from service" from the Corporation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.  To the extent required in order to avoid accelerated taxation and/or tax penalties under Section 409A of the Code, amounts that would otherwise be payable and benefits that would otherwise be provided pursuant to this Agreement during the six-month period immediately following the Grantee's termination of employment shall instead be paid within 30 days following the first business day after the date that is six months following his termination of employment (or upon his death, if earlier).  In addition, for purposes of this Agreement, each amount to be paid or benefit to be provided to the Grantee pursuant to this Agreement shall be construed as a separate identified payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Code.
 
Grantee acknowledges and agrees that payments made under this Agreement are subject to the Corporation's requirement that the Grantee reimburse the portion of any payment where such portion of the payment was predicated upon the achievement of financial results that are subsequently the subject of a restatement caused or partially caused by Grantee's fraud or misconduct.
 
Section 12.           
Compliance with Law
.  The Corporation shall make reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable federal and state securities laws applicable to the Plan and this Award; provided, however, notwithstanding any other provision of this Award, the Corporation shall not be obligated to deliver any shares of Common Stock pursuant to this Award if the delivery thereof would result in a violation of any such law.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Award is subject to cancellation by the Corporation in its sole discretion unless the Grantee, by not later than, has signed a duplicate of this Agreement, in the space provided below, and returned the signed duplicate to the                                                , which, if, and to the extent, permitted by the Executive Compensation and Benefits Department, may be accomplished by electronic means.
                        , 2011
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused this Agreement to be executed and granted in Charlotte, North Carolina, to be effective as of the Date of Grant.
IN WITNESS OF Grantee's acceptance of this Performance Award and Grantee's agreement to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement and the Plan, Grantee has signed this Agreement this            day of                                           , 2011.
 
 

Exhibit 10.2
 
This (the "Agreement") has been made as of                                (the "Date of Grant") between , a Delaware corporation, with its principal offices in Charlotte, North Carolina (the "Corporation"), and                                (the "Grantee").
Phantom Stock
Award Agreement
,
Duke Energy Corporation
 
Under the Duke Energy Corporation 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as it may, from time to time, be further amended (the "Plan"), the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the "Committee"), or its delegatee, has determined the form of this Agreement and selected the Grantee, as an Employee, to receive the award evidenced by this Agreement (the "Award") and the Phantom Stock units and tandem Dividend Equivalents that are subject hereto.  The applicable provisions of the Plan are incorporated in this Agreement by reference, including the definitions of terms contained in the Plan (unless such terms are otherwise defined herein).
 
In accordance with the Plan, the Corporation has made this Award, effective as of the Date of Grant and upon the following terms and conditions:
 
Section 1.
             
Number and Nature of Phantom Stock Units and Tandem Dividend Equivalents
.  The number of Phantom Stock units and the number of tandem Dividend Equivalents subject to this Award are each .  Each Phantom Stock unit, upon becoming vested, represents a right to receive payment in the form of one (1) share of Common Stock.  Each tandem Dividend Equivalent represents a right to receive cash payments equivalent to the amount of cash dividends declared and paid on one (1) share of Common Stock after the Date of Grant and before the Dividend Equivalent expires.  Phantom Stock units and Dividend Equivalents are used solely as units of measurement, and are not shares of Common Stock and the Grantee is not, and has no rights as, a shareholder of the Corporation by virtue of this Award.
                                                                    
 
Section 2.
             
Vesting of Phantom Stock Units
.  The specified percentage of the Phantom Stock units subject to this Award, and not previously forfeited, shall vest, with such percentage considered satisfied to the extent such Phantom Stock units have previously vested, as follows:
 
(a)
          
Upon Grantee remaining continuously employed by the Corporation, including Subsidiaries, through the specified anniversary of the Date
of Grant (each a "Vesting Date"), with respect to the percentage of Phantom Stock units set forth next to such date:
 
 
For purposes of vesting under this Section 2(a), if such employment terminates upon Retirement, which is defined as termination at a time when Grantee has attained age 55 and has at least five years of vesting service under the Duke Energy Retirement Cash Balance Plan or Cinergy Corp. Non-Union Employees' Pension Plan, or under another retirement plan of the Corporation or Subsidiary which plan the Committee, or the delegatee, in its sole discretion, determines to be the functional equivalent of the Duke Energy Retirement Cash Balance Plan or Cinergy Corp. Non-Union Employees' Pension Plan, then Grantee's employment shall be considered to continue, with continued vesting under this Section 2(a), unless the Committee or its delegatee, in its sole discretion, determines that Grantee is in violation of any obligation identified in Section 3, in which case any such Phantom Stock units not previously vested, or vested by application of the following sentence shall be forfeited, or unless the Grantee dies, in which case the Phantom Stock units subject to this Award shall vest in accordance with the following sentences.  If such employment terminates (i) as the result of Grantee's death or (ii) as the result of Grantee's permanent and total disability within the meaning of Code Section 22(e)(3), all Phantom Stock units subject to this Award, which units have not previously been forfeited or vested, immediately shall become fully vested.  If such employment terminates (i) as the result of termination of such employment by the Corporation, or employing Subsidiary, other than for cause, as determined by the Committee or its delegatee or (ii) as the direct and sole result, as determined by the Committee or its delegatee, in its sole discretion, of the divestiture of assets, a business or a company, by the Corporation or a Subsidiary, the Phantom Stock units subject to this Award shall vest at such vesting percentage determined by the Committee or its delegatee, in its sole discretion, by prorating from the above schedule to reflect only that portion of the period beginning on the Date of Grant and ending with the third (3
rd
) anniversary of the Date of Grant during which such employment continued while Grantee was entitled to payment of salary, and any such Phantom Stock units not then or previously vested shall be forfeited.
 
Unless the Grantee's right to receive payment of the Phantom Stock units constitutes a "deferral of compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, in the event that at a time when vesting would otherwise occur under this Section 2(a) Grantee is on an employer-approved, personal leave of absence, then, unless prohibited by law, vesting shall be postponed and shall not occur unless and until Grantee returns to active service in accordance with the terms of the approved personal leave of absence and before January 14 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the leave commenced.  In the event Grantee does not return to active service from such leave of absence prior to January 14 of the calendar year immediately
following the calendar year in which the leave commenced, any Phantom Stock units covered by this Award that were not vested as of the commencement of such leave shall be immediately forfeited (as if Grantee terminated employment for purposes of Section 4 hereof).
 
(b)
          
100%, if, following the occurrence of a Change in Control and before the second anniversary of such occurrence, such employment is terminated involuntarily, and not for cause, by the Corporation, or employing Subsidiary, as determined by the Committee or its delegatee in its sole discretion.

In consideration of the continued vesting opportunity provided under Section 2 following the termination of Grantee's continuous employment by the Corporation, including Subsidiaries, due to Retirement, Grantee agrees that during the period beginning with such termination of employment and ending with the third anniversary of the Date of Grant ("Restricted Period"), Grantee shall not (i) without the prior written consent of the Corporation, or its delegatee, become employed by, serve as a principal, partner, or member of the board of directors of, or in any similar capacity with, or otherwise provide service to, a competitor, to the detriment of the Corporation or any Subsidiary, (ii) violate any of Grantee's other noncompetition obligations, or any of Grantee's nonsolicitation or nondisclosure obligations, to the Corporation or any Subsidiary; or (iii) except as required by subpoena or other legal process (in which event the Grantee will give the Chief Legal Officer of the Corporation prompt notice of such subpoena or other legal process in order to permit the Corporation or any affected individual to seek appropriate protective orders), publish or provide any oral or written statements about the Corporation or any  Subsidiary, any of the Corporation's or any Subsidiary's current or former officers, executives, directors, employees, agents or representatives or any initiative, program or policy of the Corporation or any Subsidiary relating to any matter whatsoever that are disparaging, slanderous, libelous or defamatory, or that disclose private or confidential information about their business affairs, or that constitute an intrusion into their private lives, or that give rise to unreasonable publicity about their private lives, or that place them in a false light before the public, or that constitute a misappropriation of their name or likeness.  The noncompetition obligations of clause (i) of the preceding sentence shall be limited in scope and shall be effective only with respect to competition with the Corporation or any Subsidiary in the businesses of:  production, transmission, distribution, or retail or wholesale marketing or selling of electricity; resale or arranging for the purchase or for the resale, brokering, marketing, or trading of electricity or derivatives thereof; energy management and the provision of energy solutions; development and management of fiber optic communications systems; development and operation of power generation facilities, and sales and marketing of electric power, domestically and abroad; and any other business in which the Corporation, including Subsidiaries, is engaged at the termination of Grantee's continuous employment by the Corporation, including Subsidiaries; and within the following geographical areas (i) any country in the world where the Corporation, including Subsidiaries, has at least US$25 million in capital deployed as of termination of Grantee's continuous employment by Corporation, including Subsidiaries; (ii) the continent of North America; (iii) the United States of America and Canada; (iv) the United States of America; (v) the states of North Carolina,
South Carolina, Virginia, Georgia, Florida, Texas, California, Massachusetts, Illinois, Michigan, New York, Colorado, Oklahoma and Louisiana; (vi) the states of North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, Colorado, Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana; and (vii) any state or states with respect to which was conducted a business of the Corporation, including Subsidiaries, which business constituted a substantial portion of Grantee's employment.  The Corporation and Grantee intend the above restrictions on competition in geographical areas to be entirely severable and independent, and any invalidity or enforceability of this provision with respect to any one or more of such restrictions, including areas, shall not render this provision unenforceable as applied to any one or more of the other restrictions, including areas.  If any part of this provision is held to be unenforceable because of the duration, scope or area covered, the Corporation and Grantee agree to modify such part, or that the court making such holding shall have the power to modify such part, to reduce its duration, scope or area, including deletion of specific words and phrases, i.e., "blue penciling", and in its modified, reduced or blue pencil form, such part shall become enforceable and shall be enforced.  Nothing in Section 3 shall be construed to prohibit Grantee from being retained during the Restricted Period in a capacity as an attorney licensed to practice law, or to restrict Grantee from providing advice and counsel in such capacity, in any jurisdiction where such prohibition or restriction is contrary to law.
 
Section 4.
             
Forfeiture
.  Any Phantom Stock unit subject to this Award shall be forfeited upon the termination of Grantee's continuous employment by the Corporation, including Subsidiaries, from the Date of Grant, except to the extent otherwise provided in Section 2.  Any Dividend Equivalent subject to this Award shall expire at the time the unit of Phantom Stock with respect to which the Dividend Equivalent is in tandem (i) is vested and paid, or deferred, or (ii) is forfeited.  Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, this Award shall be forfeited automatically and shall be void in the event that the Grantee volunteers to terminate employment with the Corporation, including Subsidiaries, pursuant to the Duke Energy Corporation 2010 Voluntary Opportunity Plan.
 
Section 5.
             
Dividend Equivalent Payments
.  Payments with respect to any Dividend Equivalent subject to this Award shall be paid in cash to the Grantee within 60 days after the time cash dividends are declared and paid with respect to the Common Stock on or after the Date of Grant and before the Dividend Equivalent expires, but in no event later than the calendar year in which the dividends are declared and paid.  However, should the timing of a particular payment under Section 6 to the Grantee in shares of Common Stock in conjunction with the timing of a particular cash dividend declared and paid on Common Stock be such that the Grantee receives such shares without the right to receive such dividend and the Grantee would not otherwise be entitled to payment under the expiring Dividend Equivalent with respect to such dividend, the Grantee, nevertheless, shall be entitled to such payment.  Dividend Equivalent payments shall be subject to withholding for taxes. Any required income tax withholdings in respect of Dividend Equivalents attributable to Phantom Stock units shall be satisfied by reducing the cash payment in respect of the required withholding amount, unless the Committee, or its delegatee, in its discretion, requires Grantee to satisfy such tax obligation by other payment to the Corporation.
Section 6.
             
Payment of Phantom Stock Units
.  Payment of Phantom Stock units subject to this Award shall be made to the Grantee as soon as practicable following the time such units become vested in accordance with Section 2 but in no event later than 60 days following such vesting, except to the extent deferred by Grantee in accordance with such procedures as the Committee, or its delegatee, may prescribe from time to time or except to the extent required to avoid accelerated taxation and/or tax penalties under Section 409A of the Code.  To the extent the Grantee's right to receive payment of the Phantom Stock units constitutes a "deferral of compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, then notwithstanding the first sentence of this Section 6, except in the event that the Grantee's employment terminates as a result of death, payment of vested Phantom Stock units subject to this Award shall be made to the Grantee within 60 days following the applicable Vesting Date(s) as provided in Section 2(a).  Payment (or deferrals, as applicable) shall be subject to withholding for taxes.  Payment shall be in the form of one (1) share of Common Stock for each full vested unit of Phantom Stock and any fractional vested unit of Phantom Stock shall be made in a cash amount equal in value to the shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be paid, valued at Fair Market Value on the date the respective Phantom Stock units became vested, or if later, payable.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the number of shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be paid or deferred (valued at Fair Market Value on the date the respective unit of Phantom Stock became vested, or if later, payable) shall be reduced by the Committee, or its delegatee, in its sole discretion, to fully satisfy tax withholding requirements, unless the Committee, or its delegatee, in its discretion requires Grantee to satisfy such tax obligation by other payment to the Corporation.  In the event that payment, after any such reduction in the number of shares of Common Stock to satisfy withholding for tax requirements, would be less than ten (10) shares of Common Stock, then, if so determined by the Committee, or its delegatee, in its sole discretion, payment, instead of being made in shares of Common Stock, shall be made in a cash amount equal in value to the shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be paid, valued at Fair Market Value on the date the respective Phantom Stock units became vested, or if later, payable.
 
Section 7.
             
No Employment Rights
.  Nothing in this Agreement or in the Plan shall confer upon the Grantee the right to continued employment by the Corporation or any Subsidiary, or affect the right of the Corporation or any Subsidiary to terminate the employment or service of the Grantee at any time for any reason.
 
Section 8.
             
Nonalienation
.  The Phantom Stock units and Dividend Equivalents subject to this Award are not assignable or transferable by the Grantee.  Upon any attempt to transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate, sell or otherwise dispose of any such Phantom Stock unit or Dividend Equivalent, or of any right or privilege conferred hereby, or upon the levy of any attachment or similar process upon such Phantom Stock unit or Dividend Equivalent, or upon such right or privilege, such Phantom Stock unit or Dividend Equivalent or right or privilege, shall immediately become null and void.
Section 9.
             
Determinations
.  Determinations by the Committee, or its delegatee, shall be final and conclusive with respect to the interpretation of the Plan and this Agreement.
 
Section 10.
           
Governing Law
.  The validity and construction of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of Delaware applicable to transactions taking place entirely within that state.
 
Section 11.
           
Conflicts with Plan, Correction of Errors, Section 409A and Grantee's Consent
.  In the event that any provision of this Agreement conflicts in any way with a provision of the Plan, such Plan provision shall be controlling and the applicable provision of this Agreement shall be without force and effect to the extent necessary to cause such Plan provision to be controlling.  In the event that, due to administrative error, this Agreement does not accurately reflect a Phantom Stock Award properly granted to Grantee pursuant to the Plan, the Corporation, acting through its Executive Compensation and Benefits Department, reserves the right to cancel any erroneous document and, if appropriate, to replace the cancelled document with a corrected document.  It is the intention of the Corporation and the Grantee that this Award not result in unfavorable tax consequences to Grantee under Code Section 409A.  Accordingly, Grantee consents to such amendment of this Agreement as the Corporation may reasonably make in furtherance of such intention, and the Corporation shall promptly provide, or make available to, Grantee a copy of any such amendment.
 
To the extent applicable, it is intended that this Agreement comply with the provisions of Section 409A of the Code and that this Award not result in unfavorable tax consequences to Grantee under Section 409A of the Code.  This Agreement will be administered and interpreted in a manner consistent with this intent, and any provision that would cause this Agreement to fail to satisfy Section 409A of the Code will have no force and effect until amended to comply therewith (which amendment may be retroactive to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code).  The Corporation and the Grantee agree to work together in good faith in an effort to comply with Section 409A of the Code including, if necessary, amending this Agreement based on further guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service from time to time, provided that the Corporation shall not be required to assume any increased economic burden.  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, to the extent required in order to avoid accelerated taxation and/or tax penalties under Section 409A of the Code, the Grantee shall not be considered to have terminated employment with Corporation for purposes of this Agreement and no payments shall be due to him under this Agreement which are payable upon his termination of employment until he would be considered to have incurred a "separation from service" from the Corporation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.  To the extent required in order to avoid accelerated taxation and/or tax penalties under Section 409A of the Code, amounts that would otherwise be payable and benefits that would otherwise be provided pursuant to this Agreement during the six-month period immediately following the Grantee's termination of employment shall instead be paid within 60 days following the first business day after the date that is six months following his termination of employment (or upon his death, if earlier).  In addition, for purposes of this Agreement, each amount
to be paid or benefit to be provided to the Grantee pursuant to this Agreement shall be construed as a separate identified payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Code.
 
Section 12.
           
Compliance with Law
.  The Corporation shall make reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable federal and state securities laws applicable to the Plan and this Award; provided, however, notwithstanding any other provision of this Award, the Corporation shall not be obligated to deliver any shares of Common Stock pursuant to this Award if the delivery thereof would result in a violation of any such law.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Award is subject to cancellation by the Corporation in its sole discretion unless the Grantee, by not later than , has signed a duplicate of this Agreement, in the space provided below, and returned the signed duplicate to the                                                          , which, if, and to the extent, permitted by the Executive Compensation and Benefits Department, may be accomplished by electronic means.
                       , 2011
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused this Agreement to be executed and granted in Charlotte, North Carolina, to be effective as of the Date of Grant.
 
 
 
 
IN WITNESS OF Grantee's acceptance of this Award and Grantee's agreement to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement and the Plan, Grantee has signed this Agreement this            day of                                           , 2011.
 

Exhibit 10.3
This (the "Agreement") has been made as of                            (the "Date of Grant") between , a Delaware corporation, with its principal offices in Charlotte, North Carolina (the "Corporation"), and (the "Grantee").
Performance Award Agreement
Duke Energy Corporation
James E. Rogers
 
The Corporation has entered into an employment agreement with the Grantee dated February 19, 2009 (the "Employment Agreement"), pursuant to which it has agreed to make certain equity-based awards to the Grantee, including the award memorialized by this Agreement (the "Award").  The Award memorialized by this Agreement is made pursuant to the Duke Energy Corporation 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as it may, from time to time, be further amended (the "Plan").  The applicable provisions of the Plan are incorporated in this Agreement by reference, including the definitions of terms contained in the Plan (unless such terms are otherwise defined herein).
 
In accordance with the Plan and the Employment Agreement, the Corporation has made this Award, effective as of the Date of Grant and upon the following terms and conditions:
 
Section 1
.  .
Number and Nature of Performance Shares and Tandem Dividend Equivalents
 
(a)
          
At maximum performance, the number of Performance Shares and the number of tandem Dividend Equivalents subject to Section 2(a)(i) and the remaining provisions of this Award (other than Section 2(a)(ii)) are each             ; at target performance, the number of Performance Shares and the number of tandem Dividend Equivalents subject Section 2(a)(i) and the remaining provisions of this Award (other than Section 2(a)(ii)) are each             .  Such maximum and target number of Performance Shares shall be subject to adjustment in respect of attainment of safety goals as further described in Section 2(a)(i).  The Performance Shares described in this Section 1(a) are herein referred to as the "Annual Performance Shares."
 
(b)
          
At maximum performance, the number of Performance Shares and the number of tandem Dividend Equivalents subject to Section 2(a)(ii) and the remaining provisions of this Award (other than Section 2(a)(i)) are each             ; at target performance, the number of Performance Shares and the number of tandem Dividend Equivalents subject Section 2(a)(ii) and the remaining provisions of this Award (other than Section 2(a)(i)) are each               .  The Performance Shares described in this Section 1(b) are herein referred to as the "Long-Term Performance Shares" and, together with the Annual Performance Shares, as the "Performance Shares."
(c)
          
Each Performance Share, upon becoming vested before its expiration, represents a right to receive payment in the form of one (1) share of Common Stock.  Each tandem Dividend Equivalent, after its tandem Performance Share vests, represents a right to receive a cash payment equivalent in amount to the aggregate cash dividends declared and paid on one (1) share of Common Stock for the period beginning on the Date of Grant and ending on the date the vested, tandem Performance Share is paid or deferred and before the Dividend Equivalent expires.  Performance Shares and Dividend Equivalents are used solely as units of measurement, and are not shares of Common Stock and the Grantee is not, and has no rights as, a shareholder of the Corporation by virtue of this Award.
 
Section 2
.  .
Vesting of Performance Shares
 
(a)
          
Performance Goals
 
Except as otherwise provided in this Section 2, the Performance Shares shall vest only if and to the extent the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the "Committee"), or its delegatee, determines that the performance goals for the respective performance period (the "Performance Goals") have been met (provided that such determination in respect of any performance period shall be made not later than the first March 15 following the end of the applicable performance period).  To the extent Performance Goals are not met, the Performance Shares that do not so become vested shall be forfeited.
 
(i)
           
The following Performance Goal shall apply with respect to the Annual Performance Shares and the related Dividend Equivalents.  Provided Gr
a
ntee's continuous employment by the Corporation, including Subsidiaries, has not terminated, or as otherwise provided in Sections 2(b) or 2(c), 80% of such Performance Shares shall become vested upon the written determination by the Committee, or its delegatee, in its sole discretion, of the extent to which the Corporation achieves the same goals (including the safety penalty and adder) established by the Committee for the other executive officers of the Corporation in respect of corporate performance under the Duke Energy Corporation Executive Short-Term Incentive Plan for the period beginning January 1, 2011 and ending December 31, 2011 (the "Short-Term Performance Period"), and the remaining 20% of such Performance Shares shall become vested upon the written determination by the Committee, or its delegatee, in its sole discretion, of the extent to which the Grantee achieves the individual goals established by the Committee for the Short-Term Performance Period (as set forth on Schedule I hereto), in each case in accordance with the applicable vesting percentage specified in the following schedule (expressed as a percent of the target number of Annual Performance Shares) and subject to the adjustments described therein, and such Annual Performance Shares that do not so become vested shall be forfeited:
 
 
*When a performance determination is at a level between those specified, the Committee, or its delegatee, in its sole discretion, shall interpolate to determine the applicable vesting percentage.
 
** If EPS performance is at less than $          , no amount shall be payable by reason of attainment of the                                                            .
 
(ii)
          
The following Performance Goal shall apply with respect to the Long-Term Performance Shares and the related Dividend Equivalents.  Provided Grantee's continuous employment by the Corporation, including Subsidiaries, has not terminated, or as otherwise provided in Sections 2(b) or 2(c), such Performance Shares shall become vested upon the written determination by the Committee, or its delegatee, in its sole discretion, of the extent to which the Corporation achieves the same performance share goals established by the Committee for the other executive officers of the Corporation under the Corporation's 2011 long-term incentive program for the period beginning January 1, 2011 and ending December 31, 2013 (the "Long-Term Performance Period" and, together with the Short-Term Performance Period, each a "Performance Period") in accordance with the applicable vesting percentage specified in the following schedule (expressed as a percent of the target number of Long-Term Performance Shares), and such Long-Term Performance Shares that do not so become vested shall be forfeited:
 
 
*When a performance determination is at a level between those specified, the Committee, or its delegatee, in its sole discretion, shall interpolate to determine the applicable vesting percentage.
 
(b)
          
Certain Terminations
 
The provisions of this Section 2(b) shall apply in the event that, prior to the date that the determination of the achievement of each respective Performance Goal is made, the Grantee's continuous employment by the Corporation, including Subsidiaries, terminates as follows:
(i)
           
If such employment terminates as a result of termination of such employment (1) by the Corporation without "Cause" (as defined in the Employment Agreement) or (2) by the Grantee with "Good Reason" (as defined in the Employment Agreement) or (3) by reason of retirement of the Grantee with approval of the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the "Board"), subject to the timely execution and non-revocation of a release of claims as described in the Employment Agreement, each Performance Share outstanding at the time of such termination shall remain outstanding and shall be payable (if at all) as determined with its terms without regard to the termination of employment.
 
(ii)
          
If such employment terminates (1) as the result of the Grantee's death or (2) as the result of the Grantee's disability (meaning any physical or mental illness or injury that precludes Grantee from performing any job for which he is qualified and able to perform based upon his education, training or experience), subject to the timely execution and non-revocation of a release of claims as further described in the Employment Agreement, each Performance Share outstanding at the time of such termination shall remain outstanding and shall be payable (if at all) as determined with its terms without regard to the termination of employment, provided that the amount payable shall be such proportion of the amount otherwise payable that the number of days elapsed at the time of termination (inclusive) in the applicable Performance Period not yet concluded at the time of termination bears to the total number of days in the applicable Performance Period.
 
(iii)
         
If such employment terminates as a result of termination of such employment (1) by the Employee other than with "Good Reason" (as defined in the Employment Agreement) and other than by reason of retirement with the approval of the Board or (2) by the Corporation  for "Cause" (as defined in the Employment Agreement), each Performance Share outstanding at the time of such termination shall expire and be forfeited immediately.
 
(iv)
         
If, following the occurrence of a Change in Control (as defined in the Plan as in effect on the effective date of the Employment Agreement) and before the second anniversary of such occurrence, such employment is terminated (1) by the Corporation without "Cause" (as defined in the Employment Agreement), (2) by the Grantee with "Good Reason" (as defined in the Employment Agreement) or (3) by reason of retirement of the Grantee with the approval of the Board, each Performance Share subject to this Award that is then outstanding shall vest immediately upon such termination based on the target level of performance, irrespective of any subsequent determination of the achievement of each Performance Goal.
 
(c)
          
Approved Leave of Absence
 
In the event that Grantee is on an employer-approved, personal leave of absence on the date that the determination of the achievement of each Performance Goal is made, then, unless prohibited by law, vesting shall be postponed and shall not occur unless and until Grantee returns to active service in accordance with the terms of the approved personal leave of absence and before November 1 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the applicable Performance Period ends, and if the Grantee returns after March 15 of the year following the year in which the applicable Performance Period ends, payment shall occur not
later than the year in which the Grantee returns.  In the event Grantee does not return to active service from such leave of absence prior to November 1 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Performance Period ends, any Performance Shares covered by this Award that were not vested as of the commencement of such leave shall be immediately forfeited (as if Grantee terminated employment for purposes of Section 4 hereof).   Further, in the event that such determination is made and during any portion of the applicable Performance Period the Grantee was on employer-approved, personal leave of absence, the applicable vesting percentage shall be determined by the Committee, or its delegatee, in its sole discretion, to reflect only that portion of the applicable Performance Period during which such employment continued while the Grantee was entitled to payment of salary.
 
Section 3
. 
Grantee Obligation under Employment Agreement
.  Grantee acknowledges that this Award is subject to Grantee's obligations under the confidentiality, noncompetition and nonsolicitation provisions set forth in Section 9 of the Employment Agreement.
 
Section 4
.  .  Any Performance Share subject to this Award shall be forfeited upon the termination of the Grantee's continuous employment by the Corporation, including Subsidiaries, from the Date of Grant, except to the extent otherwise provided in Section 2.  Any Dividend Equivalent subject to this Award shall expire at the time its tandem Performance Share (i) is vested and paid, or deferred, (ii) is forfeited, or (iii) expires.  The Grantee agrees that, in the event he violates the confidentiality, noncompetition or nonsolicitation provisions set forth in Section 9 of the Employment Agreement, (1) he will forfeit and not be entitled to any further payments in accordance with Section 2(b)(i) hereof and (2) if such violation is after the termination of his employment, he will be obligated to repay to the Corporation any amounts paid (determined as of the date of payment) after the termination of employment pursuant to Section 2(b) hereof, with such sum reduced by any amount previously repaid pursuant to this Section 4.  Such amount shall be paid to the Corporation in cash in a single sum within ten (10) business days after the first date of the violation, whether or not the Corporation has knowledge of the violation or has made a demand for payment. Any such payment made following such date shall bear interest at a rate equal to the prime lending rate of Citibank, N.A. (as periodically set) plus 1%.
Forfeiture/Expiration
 
Section 5
.  .  Payment with respect to any Dividend Equivalent subject to this Award that is in tandem with a Performance Share that is vested and paid shall be paid in cash to the Grantee at the same time as the vested Performance Share as provided in Section 6, or, if the vested Performance Share is deferred by Grantee as provided in Section 6, payment with respect to the tandem Dividend Equivalent shall likewise be deferred.  The Dividend Equivalent payment amount shall equal the aggregate cash dividends declared and paid with respect to one (1) share of Common Stock for the period beginning on the Date of Grant and ending on the date the vested, tandem Performance Share is paid or deferred and before the Dividend Equivalent expires.  However, should the timing of a particular payment under Section 6 to the Grantee in shares of Common Stock in conjunction with the timing of a particular cash dividend declared and paid on Common Stock be such that the Grantee receives such shares without the right to receive such dividend and the Grantee would not otherwise be entitled to payment under the expiring Dividend Equivalent with respect to such dividend, the Grantee, nevertheless, shall be entitled to such payment.  Dividend Equivalent payments shall be
Dividend Equivalent Payment
subject to withholding for taxes.  Any required tax withholdings in respect of Dividend Equivalents attributable to Performance Shares shall be satisfied by reducing the cash payment in respect of the required withholding amount, unless the Committee, or its delegatee, in its discretion, requires Grantee to satisfy such tax obligation by other payment to the Corporation.
 
Section 6
.  .   Payment of Performance Shares subject to this Award that become vested shall be made to the Grantee as soon as practicable following the end of the applicable Performance Period (and in any event on or before the first March 15 following the end of the applicable Performance Period), except to the extent deferred by the Grantee in accordance with such procedure as the Committee, or its delegatee, may prescribe from time to time; provided that, in the case of Performance Shares that become vested by reason of the application of Section 2(b)(iv), payment shall be made as soon as practicable and in any event within thirty (30) days following the applicable termination of employment unless the Change in Control does not constitute a change in the ownership or effective control of the Corporation or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Corporation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, in which case payment shall be made as soon as practicable following the end of the applicable Performance Period (and in any event on or before the first March 15 following the end of the applicable Performance Period); and provided further that payment shall in any event be made in a manner required to avoid accelerated taxation and/or tax penalties under Section 409A of the Code. Payment (or deferrals, as applicable) shall be subject to withholding for taxes. Payment shall be in the form of one (1) share of Common Stock for each full vested Performance Share, and any fractional vested Performance Share shall be rounded down to the next whole share for purposes of both vesting under Section 2 and payment under Section 6.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the number of shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be paid or deferred (valued at Fair Market Value on the date the respective Performance Share became vested, or if later, payable) shall be reduced by the Committee, or its delegatee, in its sole discretion, to fully satisfy tax withholding requirements, unless the Committee, or its delegate, in its discretion requires Grantee to satisfy such tax obligation by other payments to the Corporation.
Payment of Performance Shares
 
Section 7
.  .  Nothing in this Agreement or in the Plan shall confer upon the Grantee the right to continued employment with the Corporation or any Subsidiary, or affect the right of the Corporation or any Subsidiary to terminate the employment or service of the Grantee at any time for any reason.
No Employment Right
 
Section 8
.  .  The Performance Shares and Dividend Equivalents subject to this Award are not assignable or transferable by Grantee.  Upon any attempt to transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate, sell or otherwise dispose of any such Performance Share or Dividend Equivalent, or of any right or privilege conferred hereby, or upon the levy of any attachment or similar process upon such Performance Share or Dividend Equivalent, or upon such right or privilege, such Performance Share or Dividend Equivalent, or such right or privilege, shall immediately become null and void.

Governing Law
 
Section 11
.  In the event that any provision of this Agreement conflicts in any way with a provision of the Plan, such Plan provision shall be controlling and the applicable provision of this Agreement shall be without force and effect to the extent necessary to cause such Plan provision to be controlling.  In addition, in the event that any provision of this Agreement and/or Plan conflicts in any way with a provision of the Employment Agreement, such Employment Agreement provision shall be controlling and the applicable provision of this Agreement and/or Plan shall be without force and effect to the extent necessary to cause such Employment Agreement provision to be controlling, except to the extent such treatment would constitute a material modification of the Plan requiring stockholder approval.  In the event that, due to administrative error, this Agreement does not accurately reflect an Award properly granted to the Grantee pursuant to the Plan and the Employment Agreement, the Corporation, acting through its Executive Compensation and Benefits Department, reserves the right to cancel any erroneous document and, if appropriate, to replace the cancelled document with a corrected document.  To the extent applicable, it is intended that this Agreement comply with the provisions of Section 409A of the Code and that this Award not result in unfavorable tax consequences to Grantee under Section 409A of the Code.  This Agreement will be administered and interpreted in a manner consistent with this intent, and any provision that would cause this Agreement to fail to satisfy Section 409A of the Code will have no force and effect until amended to comply therewith (which amendment may be retroactive to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code).  The Corporation and the Grantee agree to work together in good faith in an effort to comply with Section 409A of the Code including, if necessary, amending this Agreement based on further guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service from time to time, provided that the Corporation shall not be required to assume any increased economic burden.  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, to the extent required in order to avoid accelerated taxation and/or tax penalties under Section 409A of the Code, the Grantee shall not be considered to have terminated employment with Corporation for purposes of this Agreement and no payments shall be due to him under this Agreement which are payable upon his termination of employment until he would be considered to have incurred a "separation from service" from the Corporation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.  To the extent required in order to avoid accelerated taxation and/or tax penalties under Section 409A of the Code, amounts that would otherwise be payable and benefits that would otherwise be provided pursuant to this Agreement during the six-month period immediately following the Grantee's termination of employment shall instead be paid within 30 days following the first business day after the date that is six months following his termination of employment (or upon his death, if earlier).  In addition, for purposes of this Agreement, each amount to be paid or benefit to be provided to the Grantee pursuant to this Agreement shall be construed as a separate identified payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Code.  Grantee acknowledges and agrees that payments made under this Agreement are subject to the Corporation's requirement that the Grantee reimburse the portion of any payment where such portion of the payment was predicated upon the achievement of financial results that are subsequently the subject of a restatement caused or partially caused by Grantee's fraud or misconduct.
