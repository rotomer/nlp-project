On March 10, 2011, Duke Energy Indiana, Inc. ("DE Indiana") filed testimony with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission ("IURC") proposing a framework designed to mitigate the customer rate impacts associated with the Edwardsport IGCC project.  DE Indiana's filing proposed a cap on the project's construction costs, excluding financing costs, which can be passed along to customers at $2.72 billion.  It also proposed rate-related adjustments that will lower the overall customer rate increase related to the project from an average of 19 percent to approximately 16 percent.  The proposal is subject to the approval of the IURC.
 
A summary providing additional detail on the proposal outlined in the filing is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
