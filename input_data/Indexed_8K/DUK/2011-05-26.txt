On May 23, 2011, Duke Energy Vermillion II, LLC a non-regulated indirect subsidiary of Duke Energy Ohio, Inc. ("Duke Energy Ohio"),  entered into a Facility Interest Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement") by and among Duke Energy Indiana, Inc. ("Duke Energy Indiana"), a regulated affiliate of Duke Energy Ohio, and Wabash Valley Power Association, Inc. ("WVPA")  to sell its 75% undivided ownership interest in a gas-fired electric power plant located in Vermillion County, Indiana for a total purchase price of $81.6 million (the "Transaction").  Duke Energy Indiana will pay approximately $68 million of the purchase price and WVPA will pay the remaining $13.6 million.  Upon the closing of the Transaction, Duke Energy Indiana will own a 62.5% undivided interest in the plant as a tenant in common with WVPA, which currently owns a 25% undivided interest in the plant and will own a 37.5% undivided interest after the closing.  The Transaction is expected to result in an immaterial accounting loss to Duke Energy Corporation. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the closing of the Transaction is conditioned upon the approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the "FERC") and the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (the "IURC") and that such approvals be satisfactory to Duke Energy Indiana in its sole discretion.  The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2012.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
