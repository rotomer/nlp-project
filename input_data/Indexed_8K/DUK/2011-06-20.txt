Duke Energy Ohio's current ESP expires at the end of 2011
 
                 
On November 15, 2010, Duke Energy Ohio filed with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) for approval of a MRO
 
                 
PUCO issued its final order denying Duke Energy Ohio's MRO application on May 4, 2011
