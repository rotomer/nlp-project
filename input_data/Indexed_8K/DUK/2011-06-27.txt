Item 8.01.  Other Events.
 
On June 27, 2011, Duke Energy Indiana (the "Company") filed testimony with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission ("IURC") in connection with its seventh semi-annual IGCC Rider request which included an update on the current cost forecast of the Edwardsport IGCC project.  In April 2010, the Company estimated the costs at $2.72 billion, plus Allowance for Funds Used During Construction ("AFUDC") of $164 million, for a total project cost of $2.88 billion.  Based on current data and project reports, the updated forecast excluding AFUDC has increased from $2.72 billion to $2.82 billion, not including any contingency for unexpected start-up events.  Notwithstanding this revised forecast, the Company is not increasing its previous cost estimate of $2.72 billion because the Company believes it may be able to mitigate these incremental costs and keep the project within the most recent cost estimate.
 
The increased project cost forecast of approximately $102 million consists primarily of labor productivity trends.  The Company is also forecasting a potential additional $30 million for start-up event risk. 
 
AFUDC financing costs are estimated to increase $114 million.  AFUDC increases are resulting from the delay in Construction Work in Progress (CWIP) rider proceedings that have not been processed and approved to date.  In an earlier IURC filing, the Company proposed a hard cap on the construction costs of the IGCC project of approximately $2.72 billion; however, this hard cap commitment does not include increases associated with AFUDC financing costs.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
