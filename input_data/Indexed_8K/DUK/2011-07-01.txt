Major Components of Filing
 
                 
On July 1, 2011, Duke Energy Carolinas filed a rate case with the North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC) to request an average 15 percent increase in retail revenues, or approximately $646 million:
 
                 
The rate case filing requests an overall rate of return of 8.64% based on approval of an 11.5% return on equity and a 53% equity component of the capital structure
 
                 
The filing is based on a North Carolina retail rate base of $11.2 billion as of December 31, 2010 and adjusted for known and measurable changes (hearings are expected to commence in November 2011)
 
                 
This rate increase request is driven by:
