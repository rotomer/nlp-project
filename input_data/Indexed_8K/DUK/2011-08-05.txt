Major Components of Filing
 
                 
On August 5, 2011, Duke Energy Carolinas filed a rate case with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina (PSCSC) to request an average 15 percent increase in retail revenues, or approximately $216 million:
 
                 
The rate case filing requests an overall rate of return of 8.63% based on approval of an 11.5% return on equity and a 53% equity component of the capital structure
                 
The filing is based on a South Carolina rate base of $4.1 billion as of December 31, 2010 and adjusted for known and measurable changes through October 2011 (hearings are expected to commence in December 2011)
 
                 
This rate increase request is driven by:
 
 
                 
Capital investments of $6.5 billion(1) since the 2009 rate case, including pro-forma adjustments to reflect known and measurable changes include:
