For more information on the proposals, see Duke Energy's proxy statement/prospectus included in the registration statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on July 7, 2011.

Proposal to approve the issuance of Duke Energy common stock, par value $0.001 per share, to Progress Energy shareholders in connection with the Merger
 
 
                 
Proposal to adjourn the special meeting of the shareholders of Duke Energy, if necessary, to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve either of the proposals above
 
 
Although Duke Energy and Progress Energy are targeting to complete the Merger by the end of 2011, if the Merger is not completed, Duke Energy will not amend its amended and restated certificate of incorporation to effect the reverse stock split, notwithstanding that Duke Energy's shareholders have approved the amendment.
