Item 8.01.  Other Events.
 
On October 19, 2011, Duke Energy Corporation (the "Company") revised its project cost estimate for the Edwardsport Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle project from approximately $2.72 billion, excluding financing costs, to approximately $2.98 billion, excluding financing costs. The revised cost estimate reflects additional cost pressures resulting from unfavorable labor productivity trends and incremental material quantity and scope changes. The Company previously proposed to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (the "IURC") a cost cap of approximately $2.72 billion. For the quarter ended September 30, 2011, the Company and Duke Energy Indiana, Inc. will recognize an approximate $220 million pre-tax impairment charge, related to costs expected to be incurred above the cost cap, offset by previously recorded impairment charges. The cost cap, if approved by the IURC, limits the amount of project construction costs that may be incorporated into customer rates in Indiana. As a result of the proposed cost cap, recovery of these cost increases is not considered probable.
 
This impairment charge, with an earnings per share impact of approximately $0.10, will be treated as a "special item" and will, therefore, be excluded from the Company's adjusted diluted earnings per share.
 
Through September 30, 2011, the Company has incurred approximately $2.9 billion on the project (including approximately $200 million of financing costs).
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
