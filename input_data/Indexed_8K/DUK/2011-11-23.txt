Exhibit 99.1
 
Background
 
                 
On July 1, 2011, Duke Energy Carolinas filed a rate case with the North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC) to request an average 15 percent increase in retail revenues, or approximately $646 million
                 
Based upon 11.5% return on equity (ROE) and a 53% equity component of the capital structure
                 
On November 1, 2011, North Carolina Public Staff, who represents consumers, recommended a rate increase of approximately $211 million
                 
Based upon 9.25% ROE and a 50% equity component of the capital structure
                 
On November 17, 2011, Duke Energy Carolinas revised its requested rate increase to approximately $525 million
                 
Based upon 11.25% ROE and a 53% equity component of the capital structure
                 
On November 22, 2011, Duke Energy Carolinas reached agreement with the North Carolina Public Staff (see details below)
 
Major Components of Settlement
 
                 
$369 million increase in base rates, before cash mitigation (57% of original request)
                 
Based upon ROE of 10.5% and a 53% equity component of the capital structure
                 
Cash recovery for CWIP will be deferred until the next rate case
                 
This deferral will have no earnings impact as Duke Energy Carolinas will continue to accrue AFUDC on CWIP not in base rates
                 
Duke Energy Carolinas expects to file a general rate case in 2012 for rates in effect in early 2013
                 
Average rate increase of 7.2% for each customer class
                 
Duke Energy Carolinas will donate $11 million to help needy customers in North Carolina pay their energy bills
                 
Settlement subject to the review and approval by the NCUC
                 
Hearing is scheduled to commence November 28, 2011
