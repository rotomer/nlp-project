Item 5.04. Temporary Suspension of Trading Under Registrant's Employee Benefit Plans
 
On November 30, 2011, Duke Energy Corporation (the "Company") received notice from the plan administrator of the Duke Energy Retirement Savings Plan, the Duke Energy Retirement Savings Plan for Legacy Cinergy Union Employees (Midwest), and Duke Energy Retirement Savings Plan for Legacy Cinergy Union Employees (IBEW 1393) (collectively, the "401(k) Plan") informing it that the Duke Energy Common Stock Fund under the 401(k) Plan will be closed for participant transactions from the close of business on December 30, 2011 until sometime during the week of January 1, 2012.  The blackout period is required by the 401(k) Plan's recordkeeper, Fidelity Investments, in connection with a proposed 1-for-3 reverse stock split of the Company's common stock, which will occur in connection with the proposed merger of the Company and Progress Energy, Inc.
 
Although the date of the closing of the merger (and the related 1-for-3 reverse stock split) has not yet been finalized, the notice was sent to the Company at this time due to the advance notice requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.
 
On December 6, 2011, the Company provided the attached notice to its directors and executive officers informing them that, during the blackout period, pursuant to Section 306 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Company's insider trading policy, they will be unable to trade in the Company's common stock (or related securities).  All dates contained in the attached notice assume the closing will occur on January 1, 2012, but if the closing does not occur on that date, the attached notice will be updated to reflect the actual date of the closing of the merger and the related 1-for-3 reverse stock split.  During the blackout period and for a two-year period thereafter, information about the actual beginning and ending dates of the blackout period may be obtained, without charge, by contacting Duke Energy Corporation, Attention:  Corporate Secretary, 550 South Tryon St., Charlotte, NC 28202 (telephone (704) 382-2204).
 
The notice to directors and executive officers of the Company is included as Exhibit 99.1 hereto.
 
Item 9.01.   Financial Statements and Exhibits.

Notice to Duke Energy Corporation directors and executive officers regarding blackout period.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
Duke Energy Corporation ("Duke") has received notice from the plan administrator of the Duke Energy Retirement Savings Plan, the Duke Energy Retirement Savings Plan for Legacy Cinergy Union Employees (Midwest), and Duke Energy Retirement Savings Plan for Legacy Cinergy Union Employees (IBEW 1393) (collectively, the "401(k) Plan") that activity in the Duke Energy Common Stock Fund under the 401(k) Plan will be closed for participant transactions from the close of business on December 30, 2011 until sometime during the week of January 1, 2012.  This temporary suspension is required by the 401(k) Plan's recordkeeper, Fidelity Investments, in connection with the 1-for-3 reverse stock split of Duke common stock, which will occur in connection with the expected closing of the merger with Progress Energy, Inc. on January 1, 2012.  This notice is intended to inform you that, pursuant to Section 306 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, during the blackout period you will be unable to trade in Duke common stock (or related securities).  In addition, this period occurs during a time when trading under Duke's Insider Trading Policy is generally not permitted (, not during a "trading window" pursuant to the Duke Energy Corporation Insider Trading Policy).  Please note that this restriction will not apply to certain trading activities, including (i) any purchases and sales made pursuant to certain written plans satisfying the conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended or (ii) dividend reinvestments.
i.e.
 
Although the date of the closing of the merger (and the related 1-for-3 reverse stock split) has not yet been finalized, this notice is being sent at this time, despite the uncertainty about the date of the closing, due to the advance notice requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.  All dates contained in this notice assume the closing will occur on January 1, 2012, but if the closing does not occur on that date, you will be provided with updated information regarding the actual date of the closing.
 
If you have any questions about this notice or the required trading restriction, including whether the blackout period has begun or ended, you may obtain information, without charge, by contacting Duke Energy Corporation, Attention: Corporate Secretary, 550 South Tryon St., Charlotte, NC 28202 (telephone (704) 382-2204).
