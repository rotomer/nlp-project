Item 8.01.   Other Events.
 
On December 7, 2011, Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC ("Duke Energy Carolinas") filed a revised settlement agreement with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina ("PSCSC") to revise the settlement reached on November 30, 2011 with the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff (the "ORS") on the rate case Duke Energy Carolinas previously filed with the PSCSC.  The revised agreement, which includes Wal-Mart Stores East, LP and Sam's East, Inc., intervenors in the proceeding, as well as the ORS, eliminates the provision in which Duke Energy Carolinas agreed to forego a general rate case filing in 2012 and 2013 but would receive a capital spending base rate adjustment during those years.  The settlement is subject to the review and approval of the PSCSC, and a hearing on the settlement commenced December 7, 2011.

Duke Energy Carolinas Summary of Revised Settlement Agreement on Proposed Base Rate Increase in South Carolina
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
Background
 
                 
On August 5, 2011, Duke Energy Carolinas filed a rate case with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina (PSCSC) to request an average 15 percent increase in retail revenues, or approximately $216 million
                 
Based upon 11.5% return on equity (ROE) and a 53% equity component of the capital structure
                 
On November 14, 2011, ORS, who represents South Carolina consumers, recommended a rate increase of approximately $91 million
                 
Based upon 10.5% ROE and a 53% equity component of the capital structure
                 
On November 30, 2011, Duke Energy Carolinas reached agreement with the ORS
                 
Based upon allowed ROE of 10.5% and 53% equity component of the capital structure
                 
Duke Energy Carolinas agrees to forgo a general rate case filing in 2012 and 2013.  Earliest general rate case filing will be in 2014, using a 2013 test year with rates effective no sooner than February 2015
                 
In exchange for stay-out provision, base rates will be updated annually in 2013 and 2014 for certain capital spending, not to exceed a cumulative $80 million revenue increase
                 
On December 7, 2011, Duke Energy Carolinas filed a revised agreement with the PSCSC
                 
Agreement still includes ORS but has been revised to (1) also include Wal-Mart Stores East, LP and Sam's East, Inc., intervenors to the proceeding, and (2) remove the general rate case stay-out provision and the capital spending base rate adjustment
                 
As a result, Duke Energy Carolinas expects to file a general rate case with the PSCSC in 2012 for rates in effect in early 2013
 
Major Components of Revised Settlement
 
                 
Annualized base rate increase of approximately $92.8 million (43% of requested $216 million total)
                 
Based upon allowed ROE of 10.5% and 53% equity component of the capital structure
                 
The Company will make a one-time donation of approximately $4 million to AdvanceSC, an economic development fund
                 
Changes BPM profit sharing from 50/50 (50% to AdvanceSC for economic development, low income assistance, education initiatives, and existing manufacturing support and 50% to the Company) to 90/10 (50% to AdvanceSC, 40% to customers, and 10% to the Company)
                 
Settlement subject to the review and approval by the PSCSC
                 
An evidentiary hearing commenced today, December 7, 2011
