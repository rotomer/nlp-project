On January 13, 2012, Duke Energy Corporation ("Duke Energy") and Progress Energy, Inc. ("Progress Energy") filed a request for rehearing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the "FERC") of the order issued by the FERC on December 14, 2011.  In that order, the FERC rejected the mitigation plan proposed by Duke Energy and Progress Energy in connection with their proposed merger.  The request for rehearing does not preclude the companies' right to propose a new mitigation plan in the future.
