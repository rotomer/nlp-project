ITEM 8.01.          OTHER EVENTS
 
On March 26, 2012, Duke Energy Corporation (the "Company") and Progress Energy, Inc. (together with the Company, the "Companies") filed a second wholesale market power mitigation plan (the "Plan") with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the "FERC") as part of their proposed merger.
 
The Plan consists of both permanent and interim components.  The permanent component of the Plan consists of seven transmission projects to be constructed, estimated to cost approximately $110 million, which significantly increase the power import capabilities into the Companies' service areas in the Carolinas.  The two-to-three-year interim component of the Plan consists of several power purchase agreements which will be in effect upon the closing of the merger and remain in effect until such time as the transmission projects are operational. The Companies will sell 800 megawatts during summer off-peak hours, 475 megawatts during summer peak hours, 225 megawatts during winter off-peak hours, and 25 megawatts during winter peak hours through the power purchase agreements.
 
The filing made by the Companies requests that the FERC issue an order within 60 days, but in no event later than June 8, 2012, approving the Plan along with the Joint Dispatch Agreement and Open Access Transmission Tariff previously filed by the Companies. The Companies are pursuing the remaining merger-related approvals from the North Carolina Utilities Commission and the Public Service Commission of South Carolina prior to the July 8, 2012, merger agreement termination date and are targeting a closing date for the merger of July 1, 2012.  Final agreement to the proposed mitigation efforts will be subject to appropriate resolution of the state ratemaking issues.
 
A merger scorecard, which reflects the status of the Companies' regulatory filings relating to the merger, is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
