Item 5.07.   Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
 
(a)
         
Duke Energy Corporation (the "Corporation") held its Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the "Annual Meeting") on May 3, 2012.
 
(b)
        
At the meeting, shareholders elected all 11 of the directors nominated by the Board of Directors and ratified the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Corporation's independent public accountant for 2012.  Each director received a greater number of votes cast "for" his or her election than votes cast "withheld" for his or her election as reflected below.  The shareholders approved a non-binding, advisory vote on the Corporation's named executive officer compensation.  The amendment of the Amended and Restated Certification of Incorporation of the Corporation was not approved as it required the approval of 80% of the outstanding shares of the Corporation.  Two shareholder proposals presented at the meeting also failed to receive approval.  For more information on the proposals, see Duke Energy's proxy statement dated March 22, 2012.  Set forth below are the final voting results for each of the proposals.
