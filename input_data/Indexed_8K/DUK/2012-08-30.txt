On Wednesday, August 29, 2012, Duke Energy Ohio, Inc. (the "Company" or "Duke Energy Ohio") filed an application with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (the "PUCO") seeking the establishment of a cost-based capacity charge under the new state compensation mechanism that allows fixed resource requirement ("FRR") entities to recover their embedded costs for capacity. The Company is an FRR entity in PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. until May 31, 2015.  The Company has requested the following: (1) an order establishing the amount of a cost-based capacity charge for Duke Energy Ohio; (2) an order establishing a deferral to account for the difference between the market-based capacity rates current being recovered by Duke Energy Ohio for the provision of capacity services and its cost of providing such services; and (3) an order establishing a new rider pursuant to which the deferred amounts will be collected, with the rates under such rider to be established in a separate, future proceeding.  The Company continues to move forward with obtaining the remaining regulatory approvals to transfer its legacy generation assets to an affiliate or subsidiary by no later than December 31, 2014, as required by its Electric Security Plan.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
