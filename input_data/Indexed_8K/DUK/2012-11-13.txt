Unless the Certificate of Authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused this Note to be duly executed by one of its duly authorized officers.
This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
 
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of the Corporation (the "Securities") issued and issuable in one or more series under an Indenture dated as of June 3, 2008, as supplemented (the "Indenture"), between the Corporation and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (formerly known as The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A.), as trustee (the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Corporation, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities issued thereunder, and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.  This Note is one of the series of Securities due one year or more from the date of issue and designated as "Duke Energy InterNotes"* (the "InterNotes") and is one of a tranche (this "Tranche") of such series of InterNotes having the same tenor and terms. This Note and any other certificates evidencing the InterNotes of this Tranche are referred to as the "Notes."  All terms used but not defined in this Note or in an Addendum hereto shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Indenture or on the face hereof, as the case may be.
 
This Note will not be redeemable or repayable prior to the Stated Maturity Date unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, in which event this Note will be redeemable or repayable in accordance with the provisions of the following five paragraphs unless such provisions are modified by an Addendum hereto.
 
This Note will be subject to redemption at the option of the Corporation on any date on or after the Redemption Commencement Date, if any, specified on the face hereof, in whole or from time to time in part in increments of U.S. $1,000 (provided that any remaining principal amount hereof shall be at least U.S. $1,000 ), at the Redemption Price (as defined below), together with unpaid interest accrued thereon to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption (the "Redemption Date"), on written notice given to the Holder hereof (in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture) not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date.  The "Redemption Price" shall be the Initial Redemption Percentage specified on the face hereof (as adjusted by the Annual Redemption Percentage Reduction, if any, specified on the face hereof as set forth below) multiplied by the unpaid principal amount of this Note to be redeemed.  The Initial Redemption Percentage shall decline at each anniversary of the Redemption Commencement Date by the Annual Redemption Percentage Reduction, if any, until the Redemption Price is 100% of unpaid principal amount to be redeemed.  In the event of redemption of this Note in part only, a new Note of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof and otherwise having the same terms and provisions as this Note shall be issued by the Corporation in the name of the Holder hereof upon the presentation and surrender hereof.
 
If notice of a redemption is provided and funds are deposited as required, interest will cease to accrue on and after the Redemption Date on this Tranche or portions of this Tranche called for redemption.  In the event that any Redemption Date is not a Business Day, the Corporation will pay the redemption price on the next Business Day without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay.  If less than all this Tranche is to be redeemed at the option of the Corporation, the Trustee shall select, in such manner as it shall deem fair and appropriate, the Notes to be redeemed in whole or in part.  The Trustee may select for redemption Notes and portions of Notes in amounts of $1,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.
 
This Note will be subject to repayment by the Corporation at the option of the Holder hereof on the Optional Repayment Date(s), if any, specified on the face hereof, in whole or in part in increments of U.S. $1,000 (provided that any remaining principal amount hereof shall be at least U.S. $1,000 ), at a repayment price equal to 100% of the unpaid principal amount to be repaid, together with unpaid interest accrued thereon to, but excluding, the date fixed for repayment (the "Repayment Date").  For this Note to be repaid, the Trustee must receive at its corporate trust office not more than 60 nor less than 30 calendar days prior to the Repayment Date, such Note and a duly signed and completed Option to Elect Repayment, in the form attached hereto, forwarded by the Holder hereof.  Exercise of such repayment option by the Holder hereof shall be irrevocable.  In the event of repayment of this Note in part
 
*  InterNotes is a registered service mark of Incapital Holdings LLC.
 
only, a new Note of like tenor for the unrepaid portion hereof and otherwise having the same terms and provisions as this Note shall be issued by the Corporation in the name of the Holder hereof upon the presentation and surrender hereof.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if this Note is specified on the face hereof to be a Discount Note, the amount payable to the Holder of this Note in the event of redemption, repayment or acceleration of maturity will be equal to the sum of (1) the Issue Price specified on the face hereof (increased by any accruals of the Discount, as defined below) and, in the event of any redemption of this Note (if applicable), multiplied by the Initial Redemption Percentage (as adjusted by the Annual Redemption Percentage Reduction, if applicable) and (2) any unpaid interest accrued thereon to, but excluding, the Redemption Date, Repayment Date or date of acceleration of maturity, as the case may be. The difference between the Issue Price and 100% of the principal amount of this Note is referred to herein as the "Discount".
 
For purposes of determining the amount of Discount that has accrued as of any Redemption Date, Repayment Date or date of acceleration of maturity of this Note, such Discount will be accrued so as to cause the yield on the Note to be constant.  The constant yield will be calculated using a 30-day month, 360-day year convention, a compounding period that, except for the Initial Period (as defined below), corresponds to the shortest period between Interest Payment Dates (with ratable accruals within a compounding period) and an assumption that the maturity of this Note will not be accelerated.  If the period from the Original Issue Date to the initial Interest Payment Date (the "Initial Period") is shorter than the compounding period for this Note, a proportionate amount of the yield for an entire compounding period will be accrued.  If the Initial Period is longer than the compounding period, then such period will be divided into a regular compounding period and a short period, with the short period being treated as provided in the preceding sentence.
 
If an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.
 
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Corporation and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of all series affected under the Indenture at any time by the Corporation and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Securities of all series at the time Outstanding affected thereby (voting as one class).  The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Securities of all series at the time Outstanding with respect to which a default under the Indenture shall have occurred and be continuing (voting as one class), on behalf of the Holders of the Securities of all such series, to waive, with certain exceptions, such default under the Indenture and its consequences.  The Indenture also permits the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Corporation with certain provisions of the Indenture affecting such series.  Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Corporation, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Corporation for such purpose, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Corporation and the Security Registrar and duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes, of authorized denominations and of like tenor and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.  No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Corporation may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
 
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness of the Securities of this series and for covenant defeasance at any time of certain covenants in the Indenture upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture.
 
Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Corporation, the Trustee and any agent of the Corporation or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Corporation, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
This Note is issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.  As provided in the Indenture and subject to the limitations therein set forth, this Note is exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same upon surrender of the Note or Notes to be exchanged at the office or agency of the Corporation.
 
This Note shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.
 
The following abbreviations, when used in the inscription on the face of this instrument, shall be construed as though they were written out in full according to applicable laws or regulations:

If the Survivor's Option is applicable to this Note, the authorized representative of a deceased beneficial owner of the Note or a beneficial interest in the Note shall have the option to elect repayment of such Note or interest following the death of the owner (a "Survivor's Option"). Unless specifically provided on the face of this Note, no Survivor's Option may be exercised unless the Note or a beneficial interest in the Note was purchased at least six months prior to the representative's exercise of the Survivor's Option.
 
Pursuant to exercise of the Survivor's Option, the Corporation shall repay any Note (or portion thereof) properly tendered for repayment by or on behalf of the person (the "Representative") that has authority to act on behalf of the deceased beneficial owner of a Note under the laws of the appropriate jurisdiction (including, without limitation, the personal representative, executor, surviving joint tenant or surviving tenant by the entirety of such deceased beneficial owner) at a price (unless otherwise specified on the face of this Note) equal to 100% of the principal amount of the beneficial interest of the deceased owner in such Note, plus interest accrued to, but excluding, the date of such repayment, subject to the following limitations:
 
(a) The Corporation may, in its sole discretion, limit the aggregate principal amount of InterNotes as to which exercises of the Survivor's Option shall be accepted by the Corporation from Representatives of all deceased beneficial owners in any calendar year to an amount equal to the greater of $2,000,000 or 2% of the aggregate principal amount of all InterNotes outstanding as of the end of the most recent calendar year, or such greater amount as the Corporation in its sole discretion may determine for any calendar year, and may limit to $250,000, or such greater amount as the Corporation in its sole discretion may determine for any calendar year, the aggregate principal amount of InterNotes (or portions thereof) as to which exercises of the Survivor's Option will be accepted with respect to a Representative of a deceased beneficial owner of InterNotes or a beneficial interest in InterNotes.
 
(b) The Corporation shall not permit the exercise of the Survivor's Option except in principal amounts of $1,000 and multiples of $1,000, or that would result in a Note remaining outstanding after repayment of less than $1,000 (the minimum authorized denomination of the InterNotes).
 
(c) Any valid exercise of the Survivor's Option may not be withdrawn and any Note (or portion thereof) subject to such valid exercise may not be transferred prior to repurchase or repayment.
 
Each valid exercise of the Survivor's Option shall be accepted promptly in the order that elections are received by the Trustee, except for any Note (or portion thereof) the acceptance of which would contravene any of the limitations described above, if applied, with respect to the relevant individual deceased owner of beneficial interests therein. If, as of the end of any calendar year, the aggregate principal amount of InterNotes (or portions thereof) that have been accepted pursuant to exercise of the Survivor's Option during such year has exceeded any of the limitations described above, if applied, for such year, any exercise(s) of the Survivor's Option with respect to InterNotes (or portions thereof) not accepted during such calendar year because such acceptance would have contravened either such limitation, if applied, shall be deemed to be tendered in the following calendar year in the order all such InterNotes (or portions thereof) were tendered. Any Note (or portion thereof) accepted for repayment pursuant to exercise of the Survivor's Option shall be repaid on the first Interest Payment Date that occurs 20 or more calendar days after the date of such acceptance. In the event that a Note (or any portion thereof) tendered for repayment pursuant to valid exercise of the Survivor's Option is not accepted due to the application of the limitations described above, the Trustee shall deliver a notice by first-class mail to the registered Holder thereof at its last known address as indicated in the Security Register, that states the reason such Note (or portion thereof) has not been accepted for repayment.
 
In order for a Survivor's Option to be validly exercised with respect to any Note (or portion thereof), the Trustee must receive (i) tender of a Note (or portion thereof) to be repaid, (ii) appropriate evidence satisfactory to the Corporation and the Trustee (A) that the deceased was the owner of a beneficial interest in such Note at the time of death and that the deceased or the estate has owned the Note or the beneficial interest therein for at least six months prior to the request for repayment, (B) that the death of such beneficial owner has occurred, (C) of the date of death of the beneficial owner and (D) that the Representative has authority to act on behalf of the deceased beneficial owner, (iii) if the beneficial interest in such Note is held by a nominee of the deceased beneficial owner, a certificate satisfactory to the Corporation and the Trustee from such nominee attesting to the deceased's ownership of a beneficial interest in such Note, (iv) a written request for repayment signed by the Representative, and such signature must be guaranteed by a member firm of a registered national securities exchange or of the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. ("FINRA") or a commercial bank or trust company having an office or correspondent in the United States,(v) if applicable, a properly executed assignment or endorsement, (vi) tax waivers and such other instruments or documents that the Corporation or the Trustee reasonably requires in order to establish the validity of beneficial ownership of the Note and the claimant's entitlement to payment and (vii) any additional information the Corporation or the Trustee reasonably requires to evidence satisfaction of any conditions to the exercise of the Survivor's Option or to document the beneficial ownership interest in the Note or authority to make the election and to cause the repayment of the Note (or portion thereof). Subject to the Corporation's right hereunder to limit the aggregate principal amount of InterNotes as to which exercises of the Survivor's Option shall be accepted in any one calendar year, all questions as to the eligibility or validity of any exercise of the Survivor's Option will be determined by the Corporation, in its sole discretion, which determination shall be final and binding on all parties.
 
The death of a person holding a beneficial ownership interest in a Note in joint tenancy or tenancy by the entirety with another or others shall be deemed the death of the owner of such beneficial ownership interest in such Note, and the entire principal amount of such beneficial ownership interest in such Note so held shall be subject to repayment upon request in the manner contemplated hereby.  The death of a person owning a beneficial ownership interest in a Note by tenancy in common shall be deemed the death of the owner of such beneficial ownership interest in such Note only with respect to the deceased beneficial owner's interest in the Note so held by tenancy in common; except that in the event a Note is held by husband and wife as tenants in common, the death of either shall be deemed the death of the owner of the beneficial ownership interest in the Note, and the entire principal amount of the beneficial ownership interest in the Note so held shall be subject to repayment upon request in the manner contemplated hereby. The death of a person who, during his or her lifetime, was entitled to substantially all of the beneficial interests of ownership of a Note, shall be deemed the death of the beneficial owner thereof for purposes of this provision, regardless of whether the beneficial owner was the registered Holder of the Note, if entitlement to such beneficial interest can be established to the satisfaction of the Corporation and the Trustee. Such beneficial interest shall be deemed to exist in typical cases of nominee ownership, ownership under the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act or Uniform Gifts to Minors Act, community property or other joint ownership arrangements between a husband and wife and custodial and trust arrangements where one person has all of the beneficial ownership interest in the Note during his or her lifetime.
 
For Notes represented by a Global Security, the Depositary or its nominee shall be the Holder of such Note and therefore shall be the only entity that can exercise the Survivor's Option for such Note. To obtain repayment pursuant to exercise of the Survivor's Option with respect to such Note, the Representative must provide to the broker or other entity through which the beneficial interest in such Note is held by the deceased beneficial owner (i) the documents described in clauses (ii), (iii), (iv), (vi) and (vii) of the second preceding paragraph and (ii) written instructions to such broker or other entity to notify the Depositary of such Representative's desire to obtain repayment pursuant to exercise of the Survivor's Option.  Such broker or other entity shall provide to the Trustee (i) the documents received from the Representative referred to in clause (i) of the preceding sentence and (ii) evidence satisfactory to the Corporation and the Trustee from such broker or other entity stating that it represents the deceased beneficial owner. Such broker or other entity shall be responsible for disbursing any payments it receives from the Trustee pursuant to exercise of the Survivor's Option to the appropriate Representative.

Unless the Certificate of Authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused this Note to be duly executed by one of its duly authorized officers.
 
This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of the Corporation (the "Securities") issued and issuable in one or more series under an Indenture dated as of June 3, 2008, as supplemented (the "Indenture"), between the Corporation and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (formerly known as The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A.), as trustee (the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Corporation, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities issued thereunder, and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.  This Note is one of the series of Securities due one year or more from the date of issue and designated as "Duke Energy InterNotes"* (the "InterNotes") and is one of a tranche (this "Tranche") of such series of InterNotes having the same tenor and terms. This Note and any other certificates evidencing the InterNotes of this Tranche are referred to as the "Notes."  All terms used but not defined in this Note or in an Addendum hereto shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Indenture or on the face hereof, as the case may be.
 
This Note will not be redeemable or repayable prior to the Stated Maturity Date unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, in which event this Note will be redeemable or repayable in accordance with the provisions of the following five paragraphs unless such provisions are modified by an Addendum hereto.
 
This Note will be subject to redemption at the option of the Corporation on any date on or after the Redemption Commencement Date, if any, specified on the face hereof, in whole or from time to time in part in increments of U.S. $1,000 (provided that any remaining principal amount hereof shall be at least U.S. $1,000 ), at the Redemption Price (as defined below), together with unpaid interest accrued thereon to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption (the "Redemption Date"), on written notice given to the Holder hereof (in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture) not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date.  The "Redemption Price" shall be the Initial Redemption Percentage specified on the face hereof (as adjusted by the Annual Redemption Percentage Reduction, if any, specified on the face hereof as set forth below) multiplied by the unpaid principal amount of this Note to be redeemed.  The Initial Redemption Percentage shall decline at each anniversary of the Redemption Commencement Date by the Annual Redemption Percentage Reduction, if any, until the Redemption Price is 100% of unpaid principal amount to be redeemed.  In the event of redemption of this Note in part only, a new Note of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof and otherwise having the same terms and provisions as this Note shall be issued by the Corporation in the name of the Holder hereof upon the presentation and surrender hereof.
 
If notice of a redemption is provided and funds are deposited as required, interest will cease to accrue on and after the Redemption Date on this Tranche or portions of this Tranche called for redemption.  In the event that any Redemption Date is not a Business Day, the Corporation will pay the redemption price on the next Business Day without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay.  If less than all this Tranche is to be redeemed at the option of the Corporation, the Trustee shall select, in such manner as it shall deem fair and appropriate, the Notes to be redeemed in whole or in part.  The Trustee may select for redemption Notes and portions of Notes in amounts of $1,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.
 
This Note will be subject to repayment by the Corporation at the option of the Holder hereof on the Optional Repayment Date(s), if any, specified on the face hereof, in whole or in part in increments of U.S. $1,000 (provided that any remaining principal amount hereof shall be at least U.S. $1,000 ), at a repayment price equal to 100% of the unpaid principal amount to be repaid, together with unpaid interest accrued thereon to, but excluding, the date fixed for repayment (the "Repayment Date").  For this Note to be repaid, the Trustee must receive at its corporate trust office not more than 60 nor less than 30 calendar days prior to the Repayment Date, such Note and a duly signed and completed Option to Elect Repayment, in the form attached hereto, forwarded by the Holder

hereof.  Exercise of such repayment option by the Holder hereof shall be irrevocable.  In the event of repayment of this Note in part only, a new Note of like tenor for the unrepaid portion hereof and otherwise having the same terms and provisions as this Note shall be issued by the Corporation in the name of the Holder hereof upon the presentation and surrender hereof.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if this Note is specified on the face hereof to be a Discount Note, the amount payable to the Holder of this Note in the event of redemption, repayment or acceleration of maturity will be equal to the sum of (1) the Issue Price specified on the face hereof (increased by any accruals of the Discount, as defined below) and, in the event of any redemption of this Note (if applicable), multiplied by the Initial Redemption Percentage (as adjusted by the Annual Redemption Percentage Reduction, if applicable) and (2) any unpaid interest accrued thereon to, but excluding, the Redemption Date, Repayment Date or date of acceleration of maturity, as the case may be. The difference between the Issue Price and 100% of the principal amount of this Note is referred to herein as the "Discount".
 
For purposes of determining the amount of Discount that has accrued as of any Redemption Date, Repayment Date or date of acceleration of maturity of this Note, such Discount will be accrued so as to cause the yield on the Note to be constant.  The constant yield will be calculated using a 30-day month, 360-day year convention, a compounding period that, except for the Initial Period (as defined below), corresponds to the shortest period between Interest Payment Dates (with ratable accruals within a compounding period) and an assumption that the maturity of this Note will not be accelerated.  If the period from the Original Issue Date to the initial Interest Payment Date (the "Initial Period") is shorter than the compounding period for this Note, a proportionate amount of the yield for an entire compounding period will be accrued.  If the Initial Period is longer than the compounding period, then such period will be divided into a regular compounding period and a short period, with the short period being treated as provided in the preceding sentence.
 
This Note will bear interest during each day of an Interest Reset Period at the rate per year applicable to such Interest Reset Period determined in accordance with the applicable provisions below by reference to the Interest Rate Index specified on the face hereof based on the Index Maturity, if any, specified on the face hereof (i) plus or minus the Spread, if any, and/or (ii) multiplied by the Spread Multiplier, if any, specified on the face hereof.  Commencing with the Initial Interest Reset Date specified on the face hereof, the rate at which interest on this Note is payable shall be reset as of each Interest Reset Date specified on the face hereof (as used herein, the term "Interest Reset Date" shall include the Initial Interest Reset Date). As used herein, "Interest Reset Period" shall mean the time period of the duration specified on the face hereof which runs from and including, an Interest Reset Date to, but not including, the next succeeding Interest Reset Date (or, if earlier, the Maturity Date). The determination of the rate of interest at which this Note will be reset on any Interest Reset Date shall be made on the Interest Determination Date (as defined below) pertaining to such Interest Reset Date. If any Interest Reset Date would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Reset Date shall be postponed to the next succeeding day that is a Business Day, except that if the Interest Rate Index specified on the face hereof is LIBOR and such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Reset Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day.
 
If the Interest Rate Index specified on the face hereof is Federal Funds Rate or Prime Rate, the Interest Determination Date pertaining to an Interest Reset Date for this Note shall be the second Business Day prior to such Interest Reset Date. If the Interest Rate Index specified on the face hereof is LIBOR (in which case this Note shall be a "LIBOR Note" as such term is used herein), the Interest Determination Date pertaining to an Interest Reset Date for this Note shall be the second London Business Day prior to such Interest Reset Date. As used herein, "London Business Day" means any day on which dealings in deposits in the United States dollars are transacted in the London interbank market. If the Interest Rate Index specified on the face hereof is Treasury Rate, the Interest Determination Date pertaining to an Interest Reset Date for this Note shall be the day of the week in which such Interest Reset Date falls on which direct obligations of the United States ("Treasury Bills") normally would be auctioned, whether such auction occurs or not. Treasury Bills are normally sold at auction on Monday of each week, unless that day is a legal holiday, in which case the auction is normally held on the following Tuesday, except that the auction may be held on the preceding Friday; provided, that if an auction is held on the Friday of the week preceding such Interest Reset Date, the Interest Determination Date shall be such preceding Friday.
 
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, the "Calculation Date" pertaining to any Interest Determination Date will be the earlier of (i) the tenth calendar day after such Interest Determination Date or, if
that day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day or (ii) the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date or Stated Maturity Date or date of earlier redemption or repayment, as the case may be. The determination of any interest rate by the Calculation Agent will be final and binding absent manifest error. As used herein, "Calculation Agent" shall mean the Calculation Agent specified on the face hereof or, if a Calculation Agent is not so specified, The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. and, in either such case, its successors and assigns and any replacement therefor appointed by the Corporation upon its resignation or removal.
 
Accrued interest hereon shall be an amount calculated by multiplying the Principal Amount specified on the face hereof by an accrued interest factor. Such accrued interest factor shall be computed by adding the interest factor calculated for each day in the period for which interest is being paid. The interest factor for each such date shall be computed by dividing the interest rate applicable to such day (i) by 360 if the Interest Rate Index specified on the face hereof is LIBOR, Federal Funds Rate or Prime Rate or (ii) by the actual number of days in the year if the Interest Rate Index specified on the face hereof is Treasury Rate. All percentages resulting from any calculation of the rate of interest on this Note will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward (e.g., 9.876545% (or .09876545) being rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655)). All dollar amounts used in or resulting from that calculation will be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upward). The interest rate in effect on any Interest Reset Date will be the applicable rate as reset on such date. The interest rate applicable to any other day is the interest rate from the immediately preceding Interest Reset Date (or, if none, the Initial Interest Rate specified on the face hereof).
 
The Calculation Agent shall calculate the interest rate hereon in accordance with the foregoing and the Interest Rate Index provisions set forth below. At the request of the holder hereof, the Calculation Agent will provide to the holder hereof the interest rate hereon then in effect and, if available, the interest rate that will become effective as of the next Interest Reset Date.
 
Determination of LIBOR Rate
. If this Note is a LIBOR Note, it will bear interest at a rate per year calculated using LIBOR (as defined below) and the Spread and/or Spread Multiplier, if any, specified on the face hereof.
 
"LIBOR" with respect to any Interest Determination Date will be the rate for deposits in U.S. dollars having the Index Maturity, specified on the face hereof, commencing on the second London Business Day immediately following such Interest Determination Date, as such rate is displayed on Reuters on page LIBOR01 (or any other page as may replace such page on such service or any successor service for the purpose of displaying the London interbank rates of major banks for United States dollars) ("Reuters Page LIBOR01") as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Interest Determination Date.
 
If the rate cannot be set as described above, then "LIBOR" shall be determined as follows:
 
(i)
                                    
The Calculation Agent will select (after consultation with the Corporation) the principal London offices of four major banks in the London interbank market, and will request each bank to provide its offered quotation for deposits in United States dollars for the period of the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof, commencing on the second London Business Day immediately following the Interest Determination Date, to prime banks in the London interbank market at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on the Interest Determination Date and in a principal amount equal to an amount that is representative for a single transaction in United States dollars in the market at that time.
 
(ii)
                                 
If at least two of these banks provide a quotation, the Calculation Agent will compute LIBOR on the Interest Determination Date as the arithmetic mean of such quotations.
 
(iii)
                              
If fewer than two of these banks provide a quotation, the Calculation Agent will select (after consultation with the Corporation) three major banks in The City of New York to provide a rate quote at approximately 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Interest Determination Date in United States dollars for loans to leading European banks, having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof, commencing on the second London Business Day immediately following the Interest Determination Date and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in the market at that time. The Calculation Agent will compute LIBOR on the Interest Determination Date as the arithmetic mean of these quoted rates.
(iv)
                             
If none of these banks provides a quotation as contemplated above, LIBOR for that Interest Determination Date will remain LIBOR for the immediately preceding Interest Reset Period, or, if there was no preceding Interest Reset Period, the rate of interest payable will be the Initial Interest Rate specified on the face hereof.
 
Any interest rate on this Note that the Calculation Agent is required to calculate by reference to a rate displayed on Reuters or other electronic service (any of Reuters or other electronic service, a "Service") may, if such rate of such Service is also reported on Bloomberg L.P. ("Bloomberg") or another recognized electronic source (any of Bloomberg or such other recognized electronic source, a "Source"), be calculated by the Calculation Agent using the report of such rate of such Service on such Source, unless the Calculation Agent has actual knowledge that such report on such Source is inaccurate.
 
Determination of Treasury Rate
. If the Interest Rate Index specified on the face hereof is Treasury Rate, this Note will bear interest at a rate per year calculated using the Treasury Rate (as defined below) and the Spread and/or Spread Multiplier, if any, specified on the face hereof.
 
As used herein, "Treasury Rate" means the rate for the auction held on the Interest Determination Date of Treasury Bills having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof as that rate appears on the display on Reuters (or any successor Service) on page USAUCTION 10 (or any other page as may replace this page on that Service or any successor Service) or page USAUCTION 11 (or any other page as may replace this page on that Service or any successor Service) under the heading "INVEST RATE."
 
If the rate cannot be set as described above, then "Treasury Rate" shall be determined by the Calculation Agent using the following methods in succession:
 
(i)
                                    
If the rate is not published as described above by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date pertaining to such Interest Determination Date, the Treasury Rate will be the auction average rate of Treasury Bills (expressed as a bond equivalent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and applied on a daily basis) as otherwise announced by the U.S. Department of Treasury.
 
(ii)
                                 
In the event that the auction rate of Treasury Bills having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof is not published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on such Calculation Date, or if no auction is held, then the Treasury Rate will be the rate (expressed as a bond equivalent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and applied on a daily basis) on the Interest Determination Date of Treasury Bills having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof as published in H.15(519) under the heading "U.S. Government Securities/Treasury Bills/Secondary Market" or, if not yet published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on such Calculation Date, the rate on the Interest Determination Date of Treasury Bills as published in H.15 Daily Update, or other Source used for the purpose of displaying that rate, under the caption "U.S. Government Securities/Treasury Bills/Secondary Market."
 
(iii)
                              
If the rate is not yet published in H.15 Daily Update or another Source by 3:00 p.m., New York City time on the Calculation Date, then the Treasury Rate will be calculated as a yield to maturity (expressed as a bond equivalent, on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and applied on a daily basis) of the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid rates, as of approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the Interest Determination Date, of three leading primary U.S. government securities dealers in The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Corporation) for the issue of Treasury Bills with a remaining maturity closest to the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof.
 
(iv)
                             
If fewer than three of the dealers are quoting as contemplated above, the Treasury Rate for that Interest Determination Date will remain the Treasury Rate for the immediately preceding Interest Reset Period, or, if there was no preceding Interest Reset Period, the rate of interest payable will be the Initial Interest Rate specified on the face hereof.
 
As used herein:
 
(i)
                                    
"H.15(519)" means "Statistical Release H.15(519), Selected Interest Rates," or any successor publication as published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
(ii)

Determination of the Federal Funds Rate
. If the Interest Rate Index specified on the face hereof is Federal Funds Rate, this Note will bear interest at a rate per year calculated using the Federal Funds Rate (as defined below) and the Spread and/or Spread Multiplier, if any, specified on the face hereof.
 
As used herein, "Federal Funds Rate" means, for an Interest Determination Date, the rate with respect to that date for federal funds as published in H.15(519) under the heading "Federal Funds (Effective)," as this rate is displayed on Reuters (or any successor Service) on page FEDFUNDS 1 (or any other page as may replace this page on that Service or any successor Service) ("Reuters Page FEDFUNDS 1").
 
If the rate cannot be set as described above, then "Federal Funds Rate" shall be determined by the Calculation Agent using the following methods in succession:
 
(i)
                                    
If the rate does not appear on Reuters Page FEDFUNDS 1 or is not yet published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date pertaining to such Interest Determination Date, then the Federal Funds Rate will be the rate with respect to the Interest Determination Date as published in the H.15 Daily Update or another Source used for the purpose of displaying this rate under the heading "Federal Funds (Effective)."
 
(ii)
                                 
If the rate is not yet published in H.15 Daily Update or another Source by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on such Calculation Date, then the Federal Funds Rate with respect to the Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of the rates, as of 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Interest Determination Date, for the last transaction in overnight federal funds arranged by three leading brokers of federal funds transactions in The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Corporation).
 
(iii)
                              
If fewer than three brokers are quoting as contemplated above, the Federal Funds Rate for that Interest Determination Date will remain the Federal Funds Rate for the immediately preceding Interest Reset Period, or, if there was no preceding Interest Reset Period, the rate of interest payable will be the Initial Interest Rate specified on the face hereof.
 
Determination of Prime Rate
. If the Interest Rate Index specified on the face hereof is Prime Rate, this Note will bear interest at a rate calculated using the Prime Rate (as defined below) and the Spread and/or Spread Multiplier, if any, specified on the face hereof.
 
As used herein, "Prime Rate" means, with respect to an Interest Determination Date, the rate set forth on that date in H.15(519) under the heading "Bank Prime Loan" or if not published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date pertaining to such Interest Determination Date, the rate on the Interest Determination Date as published in H.15 Daily Update, or another Source used for the purpose of displaying this rate, under the heading "Bank Prime Loan."
 
If the rate cannot be set as described above, then "Prime Rate" shall be determined by the Calculation Agent using the following methods in succession:
 
(i)
                                    
If the rate is not published in H.15 Daily Update or another Source by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, then the Prime Rate will be the arithmetic mean of the rates of interest that appear on Reuters on page USPRIME 1 (or any other page as may replace this page on that Service or any successor Service for the purpose of displaying prime rates or base lending rates of major United States banks) ("Reuters Page USPRIME 1") as a bank's publicly announced prime rate or base lending rate in effect as of 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Interest Determination Date.
(ii)
                                 
If fewer than four rates appear on Reuters Page USPRIME 1 on that date, then the Prime Rate will be the arithmetic mean of the prime rates or base lending rates quoted by three major banks in The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Corporation) on the basis of the actual number of days in the year divided by a 360-day year as of the close of business on the Interest Determination Date.

If fewer than three banks are quoting as contemplated above, the Prime Rate for that Interest Determination Date will remain the Prime Rate for the immediately preceding Interest Reset Period, or, if there was no preceding Interest Reset Period, the rate of interest payable will be the Initial Interest Rate specified on the face hereof.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the interest rate will in no event be (i) higher than the lesser of (x) 18% per year, (y) the maximum rate permitted by New York law as the same may be modified by United States law of general application and (z) the Maximum Interest Rate, if any, specified on the face hereof or (ii) be less than the Minimum Interest Rate, if any, specified on the face hereof.
 
If an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.

The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Securities of all series at the time Outstanding with respect to which a default under the Indenture shall have occurred and be continuing (voting as one class), on behalf of the Holders of the Securities of all such series, to waive, with certain exceptions, such default under the Indenture and its consequences.  The Indenture also permits the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Corporation with certain provisions of the Indenture affecting such series.  Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.

No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Corporation may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
 
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness of the Securities of this series and for covenant defeasance at any time of certain covenants in the Indenture upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture.

If the Survivor's Option is applicable to this Note, the authorized representative of a deceased beneficial owner of the Note or a beneficial interest in the Note shall have the option to elect repayment of such Note or interest following the death of the owner (a "Survivor's Option"). Unless specifically provided on the face of this Note, no Survivor's Option may be exercised unless the Note or a beneficial interest in the Note was purchased at least six months prior to the representative's exercise of the Survivor's Option.
 
Pursuant to exercise of the Survivor's Option, the Corporation shall repay any Note (or portion thereof) properly tendered for repayment by or on behalf of the person (the "Representative") that has authority to act on behalf of the deceased beneficial owner of a Note under the laws of the appropriate jurisdiction (including, without limitation, the personal representative, executor, surviving joint tenant or surviving tenant by the entirety of such deceased beneficial owner) at a price (unless otherwise specified on the face of this Note) equal to 100% of the principal amount of the beneficial interest of the deceased owner in such Note, plus interest accrued to, but excluding, the date of such repayment, subject to the following limitations:
 
(a) The Corporation may, in its sole discretion, limit the aggregate principal amount of InterNotes as to which exercises of the Survivor's Option shall be accepted by the Corporation from Representatives of all deceased beneficial owners in any calendar year to an amount equal to the greater of $2,000,000 or 2% of the aggregate principal amount of all InterNotes outstanding as of the end of the most recent calendar year, or such greater amount as the Corporation in its sole discretion may determine for any calendar year, and may limit to $250,000, or such greater amount as the Corporation in its sole discretion may determine for any calendar year, the aggregate principal amount of InterNotes (or portions thereof) as to which exercises of the Survivor's Option will be accepted with respect to a Representative of a deceased beneficial owner of InterNotes or a beneficial interest in InterNotes.
 
(b) The Corporation shall not permit the exercise of the Survivor's Option except in principal amounts of $1,000 and multiples of $1,000, or that would result in a Note remaining outstanding after repayment of less than $1,000 (the minimum authorized denomination of the InterNotes).
 
(c) Any valid exercise of the Survivor's Option may not be withdrawn and any Note (or portion thereof) subject to such valid exercise may not be transferred prior to repurchase or repayment.
 
Each valid exercise of the Survivor's Option shall be accepted promptly in the order that elections are received by the Trustee, except for any Note (or portion thereof) the acceptance of which would contravene any of the limitations described above, if applied, with respect to the relevant individual deceased owner of beneficial interests therein. If, as of the end of any calendar year, the aggregate principal amount of InterNotes (or portions thereof) that have been accepted pursuant to exercise of the Survivor's Option during such year has exceeded any of the limitations described above, if applied, for such year, any exercise(s) of the Survivor's Option with respect to InterNotes (or portions thereof) not accepted during such calendar year because such acceptance would have contravened either such limitation, if applied, shall be deemed to be tendered in the following calendar year in the order all such InterNotes (or portions thereof) were tendered. Any Note (or portion thereof) accepted for repayment pursuant to exercise of the Survivor's Option shall be repaid on the first Interest Payment Date that occurs 20 or more calendar days after the date of such acceptance. In the event that a Note (or any portion thereof) tendered for repayment pursuant to valid exercise of the Survivor's Option is not accepted due to the application of the limitations described above, the Trustee shall deliver a notice by first-class mail to the registered Holder thereof at its last known address as indicated in the Security Register, that states the reason such Note (or portion thereof) has not been accepted for repayment.
 
In order for a Survivor's Option to be validly exercised with respect to any Note (or portion thereof), the Trustee must receive (i) tender of a Note (or portion thereof) to be repaid, (ii) appropriate evidence satisfactory to the Corporation and the Trustee (A) that the deceased was the owner of a beneficial interest in such Note at the time of death and that the deceased or the estate has owned the Note or the beneficial interest therein for at least six months prior to the request for repayment, (B) that the death of such beneficial owner has occurred, (C) of the date of death of the beneficial owner and (D) that the Representative has authority to act on behalf of the deceased beneficial owner, (iii) if the beneficial interest in such Note is held by a nominee of the deceased beneficial owner, a certificate satisfactory to the Corporation and the Trustee from such nominee attesting to the deceased's ownership of a beneficial interest in such Note, (iv) a written request for repayment signed by the
Representative, and such signature must be guaranteed by a member firm of a registered national securities exchange or of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. ("FINRA") or a commercial bank or trust company having an office or correspondent in the United States,(v) if applicable, a properly executed assignment or endorsement, (vi) tax waivers and such other instruments or documents that the Corporation or the Trustee reasonably requires in order to establish the validity of beneficial ownership of the Note and the claimant's entitlement to payment and (vii) any additional information the Corporation or the Trustee reasonably requires to evidence satisfaction of any conditions to the exercise of the Survivor's Option or to document the beneficial ownership interest in the Note or authority to make the election and to cause the repayment of the Note (or portion thereof). Subject to the Corporation's right hereunder to limit the aggregate principal amount of InterNotes as to which exercises of the Survivor's Option shall be accepted in any one calendar year, all questions as to the eligibility or validity of any exercise of the Survivor's Option will be determined by the Corporation, in its sole discretion, which determination shall be final and binding on all parties.
 
The death of a person holding a beneficial ownership interest in a Note in joint tenancy or tenancy by the entirety with another or others shall be deemed the death of the owner of such beneficial ownership interest in such Note, and the entire principal amount of such beneficial ownership interest in such Note so held shall be subject to repayment upon request in the manner contemplated hereby.  The death of a person owning a beneficial ownership interest in a Note by tenancy in common shall be deemed the death of the owner of such beneficial ownership interest in such Note only with respect to the deceased beneficial owner's interest in the Note so held by tenancy in common; except that in the event a Note is held by husband and wife as tenants in common, the death of either shall be deemed the death of the owner of the beneficial ownership interest in the Note, and the entire principal amount of the beneficial ownership interest in the Note so held shall be subject to repayment upon request in the manner contemplated hereby. The death of a person who, during his or her lifetime, was entitled to substantially all of the beneficial interests of ownership of a Note, shall be deemed the death of the beneficial owner thereof for purposes of this provision, regardless of whether the beneficial owner was the registered Holder of the Note, if entitlement to such beneficial interest can be established to the satisfaction of the Corporation and the Trustee. Such beneficial interest shall be deemed to exist in typical cases of nominee ownership, ownership under the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act or Uniform Gifts to Minors Act, community property or other joint ownership arrangements between a husband and wife and custodial and trust arrangements where one person has all of the beneficial ownership interest in the Note during his or her lifetime.
 
For Notes represented by a Global Security, the Depositary or its nominee shall be the Holder of such Note and therefore shall be the only entity that can exercise the Survivor's Option for such Note. To obtain repayment pursuant to exercise of the Survivor's Option with respect to such Note, the Representative must provide to the broker or other entity through which the beneficial interest in such Note is held by the deceased beneficial owner (i) the documents described in clauses (ii), (iii), (iv), (vi) and (vii) of the second preceding paragraph and (ii) written instructions to such broker or other entity to notify the Depositary of such Representative's desire to obtain repayment pursuant to exercise of the Survivor's Option.  Such broker or other entity shall provide to the Trustee (i) the documents received from the Representative referred to in clause (i) of the preceding sentence and (ii) evidence satisfactory to the Corporation and the Trustee from such broker or other entity stating that it represents the deceased beneficial owner. Such broker or other entity shall be responsible for disbursing any payments it receives from the Trustee pursuant to exercise of the Survivor's Option to the appropriate Representative.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
I am Deputy General Counsel and Assistant Corporate Secretary of Duke Energy Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company").  The Company has entered into a Selling Agent Agreement (the "Selling Agent Agreement") dated as of November 13, 2012 with Incapital LLC, as Purchasing Agent, and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Edward Jones & Co., L.P., Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, RBC Capital Markets, LLC, UBS Securities LLC, and Wells Fargo Advisors, LLC, as Agents, pursuant to which the Company may from time to time issue and sell, in one or more tranches, up to $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of a series of its senior notes to be designated as Duke Energy InterNotes Due One Year or More from Date of Issue (the "Securities").  The Securities are to be issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of June 3, 2008 (the "Original Indenture"), by and between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (the "Trustee"), as amended and supplemented (referred to as the "Indenture").  Reference is made to the registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-169633) of the Company relating to the Securities and other securities of the Company filed on September 29, 2010, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), allowing for delayed offerings pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act and the information deemed to be a part of such registration statement as of the date hereof pursuant to Rule 430B of the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Act (the "Rules and Regulations") (such registration statement, being hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement").
 
This opinion is being delivered in accordance with the requirements of Item 601(b)(5) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act.
 
I am a member of the bar in the State of North Carolina and my opinions set forth herein are limited to Delaware corporate law and the laws of the State of New York and the federal laws of the United States that, in my experience, are normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated above and, to the extent that judicial or regulatory orders or decrees or consents, approvals, licenses, authorizations, validations, filings, recordings or registrations with governmental authorities are relevant, to those required under such laws (all of the foregoing being referred to as "Opined on Law").  I do not express any opinion with respect to the law of
 
 
any jurisdiction other than Opined on Law or as to the effect of any such non-opined law on the opinions herein stated.  This opinion is limited to the laws, including the rules and regulations, as in effect on the date hereof, which laws are subject to change with possible retroactive effect.
 
In rendering the opinion set forth herein, I or attorneys under my supervision (with whom I have consulted) have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified by my satisfaction, of:
 
(a)

(k)
                                
the written consent of the Assistant Treasurer of the Company, dated as of November 13, 2012.
 
I or attorneys under my supervision (with whom I have consulted) have also examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such records of the Company and such agreements, certificates and receipts of public officials, certificates of officers or other representatives of the Company and others, and such other documents as I or attorneys under my supervision (with whom I have consulted) have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinions set forth below.
 
In my examination, I or attorneys under my supervision (with whom I have consulted) have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to me as facsimile, electronic, certified, conformed, or photostatic copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such documents.  In making my examination of executed documents or documents to be executed, I have assumed that the parties thereto, other than the Company had or will have the power, corporate or otherwise, to enter into and perform all obligations thereunder and have also assumed the due authorization by all requisite action, corporate or other, and the execution and delivery by such parties of such documents, and, as to parties other than the Company, the validity and binding effect on such parties.  As to any facts material to this opinion that I or attorneys under my supervision (with whom I have consulted) did not independently establish or verify, we have relied upon statements and representations of officers and other representatives of the Company and others and of public officials.
 
The opinion set forth below is subject to the following further qualifications, assumptions and limitations:
 
(i)
                                    
the validity or enforcement of any agreements or instruments may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and
 
(ii)
                                 
I do not express any opinion as to the applicability or effect of any fraudulent transfer, preference or similar law on any agreements or instruments or any transactions contemplated thereby.
 
Based upon the foregoing and subject to the limitations, qualifications, exceptions and assumptions set forth herein, I am of the opinion that when (i) the form or forms of the Securities and the final terms thereof have been duly approved or established by appropriate action taken by the Company and in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, and (ii) the Securities have been duly executed, authenticated, completed, issued and delivered against payment therefor in accordance with such action and the Indenture and in the manner contemplated by the Selling Agent Agreement, the Securities will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms.
 
I hereby consent to the filing of this opinion with the Commission as Exhibit 5.1 to the Registration Statement through incorporation by reference of a current report on Form 8-K.  I also hereby consent to the use of my name under the heading "Legal Matters" in the prospectus which forms a part of the Registration Statement.  In addition, if a pricing supplement relating to the offer and sale of any particular Note or Notes is prepared and filed by the Company with the Commission on this date or a future date and the pricing supplement contains a reference to this opinion substantially in the form set forth below, this consent shall apply to the reference to my opinion in substantially such form:
 
"In the opinion of Duke Energy Corporation's counsel, when the notes offered by this pricing supplement have been executed and issued by Duke Energy Corporation and authenticated by the trustee pursuant to an Indenture dated as of June 3, 2008, as amended and supplemented, between Duke Energy Corporation and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (the "Indenture"), and delivered against payment as contemplated herein, such notes will constitute valid and binding obligations of Duke Energy Corporation, enforceable in accordance with their terms.  The opinion expressed above is subject to specified qualifications, assumptions and limitations, including that the validity or enforcement of any agreements or instruments may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and that such counsel does not express any opinion as to the applicability or effect of any fraudulent transfer, preference or similar law on any agreements or instruments or any transactions contemplated by such opinion.  In addition, this opinion is subject to customary assumptions, including, other than with respect to Duke Energy Corporation, (i) that the parties to documents, including the Indenture, relevant to such opinion had or will have the power, corporate or otherwise, to enter into and perform all obligations thereunder, (ii) the due authorization thereof by all requisite action, corporate or other by such parties, (iii) the execution and delivery by such parties of such documents, and (iv) the validity and binding effect of such documents on such parties, all as stated in the letter of such counsel dated November 13, 2012, which has been filed as Exhibit 5.1 to a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Duke Energy Corporation on November 13, 2012."
 
In giving this consent, I do not thereby admit that I am within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder.  This opinion is expressed as of the date hereof unless otherwise expressly stated, and I disclaim any undertaking to advise you of any subsequent changes in the facts stated or assumed herein or of any subsequent changes in applicable laws.

DUKE ENERGY CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), proposes to issue and sell a series of its senior notes to be designated as Duke Energy InterNotes

The obligations of the Purchasing Agent and any Agent to purchase Notes in connection with any Terms Agreement are subject to the following further conditions:  (i) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or preventing or suspending the use of any prospectus shall have been issued and be in effect and no pending proceedings for that purpose or pursuant to Section 8A under the 1933 Act against the Company or relating to any offering of Notes shall have been instituted or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened by the SEC; (ii) since the date of such Terms Agreement, the rating assigned by Moody's Investor Service, Inc., Standard & Poor's Rating Services or Fitch Ratings Ltd., or any successor thereto that is a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (as such term is defined in Section 3(a)(62) of the 1934 Act), to any debt securities or preferred stock of the Company shall not have been lowered; (iii) the Company shall have filed the Pricing Supplement relating to a particular sale of Notes with the SEC in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations; (iv) any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus required to be filed by the Company with respect to the applicable Notes pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the 1933 Act Regulations, shall have been filed with the SEC within the applicable time periods prescribed for such filings under such Rule 433 or, if applicable, in accordance with Rule 164(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations;(v) there shall not have come to the attention of the Purchasing Agent or any other Agent any facts that would cause the Purchasing Agent or any such Agent to believe that the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus included or includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and (vi) since the date of such Terms Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus, there shall not have been any material adverse change in the condition of the Company, financial or otherwise, except as reflected in or contemplated by the Registration Statement, Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus, and, since such dates and up to the related Settlement Date (as defined herein), there shall not have been any material transaction entered into by the Company other than transactions contemplated by the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus and transactions in the ordinary course of business, in each case the effect of which in the reasonable judgment of the Purchasing Agent and the applicable Agent or Agents is so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to market
such Notes or enforce contracts for the sale of such Notes on the terms and in the manner contemplated by the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus.
 
(f)

If any condition specified in this Section II shall not have been fulfilled when and as required to be fulfilled, this Agreement and any Terms Agreement may be terminated by the Purchasing Agent and the applicable Agent or Agents with respect to itself or themselves, respectively, by notice to the Company at any time and any such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party, except that the provisions specified in the penultimate paragraph of Section IX hereof shall survive and remain in effect as specified therein.
 
In further consideration of the agreements of the Purchasing Agent and the Agents herein contained, the Company covenants as follows:
 
(a)
                                
The Company will cause any Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus to be filed pursuant to, and in compliance with, Rule 424(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations, in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b) (without reliance on Rule 424(b)(8)) and will take such steps as it deems necessary to ascertain promptly whether the form of prospectus transmitted for filing under Rule 424(b) was received for filing by the SEC and, in the event that it was not, it will promptly file such prospectus; the Company will advise the Purchasing Agent and Agents promptly of the filing of any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement, any Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus and of the institution by the SEC of any stop order proceedings in respect of the Registration Statement, and will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and to obtain as soon as possible its lifting, if issued.
 
(b)
                                
If at any time when the delivery of a Prospectus shall be required by law in connection with sales of any of the Notes, either (i) any event shall have occurred as a result of which the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus, in each case as amended or supplemented, would include any untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or (ii) for any other reason it shall be necessary to amend or supplement the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus, or to file under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act") any document incorporated by reference in the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus in order to comply in all material respects with the requirements of the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, the Company will (A) notify you to suspend the solicitation of offers to purchase Notes and if notified by the Company, you shall forthwith suspend such solicitation and cease using the Time of Sale Prospectus and Prospectus and (B) promptly prepare and file with the SEC, subject to clause (j),  such document incorporated by reference in the Time of Sale Prospects and Prospectus or an amendment or supplement to the Registration
Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus, whether by filing documents pursuant to the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act or otherwise (including, if consented to by the Agents, by means of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus), which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance and will provide to you without charge a reasonable number of copies thereof, which you shall use thereafter.
 
(c)
                                 
The Company, during the period when a prospectus relating to the Notes is required to be delivered (or but for the exemption in Rule 172 of the 1933 Act Regulations would be required to be delivered) under the 1933 Act, will timely file all documents required to be filed with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 14 of the 1934 Act.
 
(d)
                                
The Company represents and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior written consent of the Purchasing Agent, and each Agent represents and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior written consent of the Company and the Purchasing Agent, it will not make, any offer relating to the Notes that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 405 of the 1933 Act Regulations, required to be filed with the SEC.  Any such free writing prospectus (which shall include the Pricing Supplement discussed in Section III(e) below), consented to in writing by the Company and the Purchasing Agent is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus."  Unless otherwise agreed by the Company and the applicable Agents, the Company (A) has treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and (B) has complied and will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 of the 1933 Act Regulations applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the SEC, legending and record keeping.  The Company will, pursuant to reasonable procedures developed in good faith, retain copies of each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus that is not filed with the SEC in accordance with Rule 433 of the 1933 Act Regulations.
 
(e)
                                 
The Company will prepare a Pricing Supplement relating to the final terms of the particular Notes and their offering in a form approved by the Purchasing Agent and, upon such approval, will file such Pricing Supplement within the period required by Rule 424(b).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein (including the preceding paragraph), the Purchasing Agent and the Agents may use a free writing prospectus that contains only (a) (i) information describing the preliminary terms of the particular Notes or their offering, (ii) information meeting the requirements of Rule 134 of the 1933 Act Regulations or (iii) information that describes the final terms of the particular Notes or their offering and that is or is to be included in the Pricing Supplement contemplated in the first sentence of this paragraph or (b) other customary information that is neither "issuer information," as defined in Rule 433, nor otherwise an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
 
(f)
                                  
If, prior to the completion of the distribution of the applicable Notes, at any time following the issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus there occurs an event or development as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus conflicts with the information contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus or includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Company will promptly notify the Purchasing Agent and the
Agents thereof so that any use of such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus may cease until it is amended or supplemented.
 
(g)
                                 
The Company will make generally available to its security holders and to you as soon as practicable earning statements that satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the 1933 Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder covering twelve month periods beginning, in each case, not later than the first day of the Company's fiscal quarter next following the "effective date" (as defined in Rule 158 under the 1933 Act) of the Registration Statement with respect to each sale of Notes.
 
(h)
                                
The Company will furnish to the Purchasing Agent and the Agents, without charge, copies of the Registration Statement (four of which will include all exhibits other than those incorporated by reference), the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus, and all amendments and supplements to such documents, and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in each case as soon as available and in such quantities as the Purchasing Agent and the Agents reasonably request.
 
(i)
                                    
The Company will arrange or cooperate in arrangements for the qualification of the Notes for offering and sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Purchasing Agent and the Agents designate and will continue such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Notes; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or to file any general consents to service of process under the laws of any state where it is not now so subject.
 
(j)
                                   
The Company will give counsel to the Purchasing Agent and the Agents notice of its intention to file or prepare any additional registration statement with respect to the registration of additional Notes or any amendment to the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus (other than an amendment or supplement providing solely for a change in the interest rates or maturity dates of Notes or similar changes or an amendment or supplement to either the Registration Statement or Prospectus effected by the filing of a document with the Commission pursuant to the 1934 Act) and will furnish such counsel with copies of any such registration statement or amendment or supplement proposed to be filed or prepared a reasonable time in advance of such proposed filing or preparation, as the case may be, and will give such counsel a reasonable opportunity to comment on any such proposed amendment or supplement.
 
(k)
                                
The Company will notify the Purchasing Agent and the Agents and their counsel immediately, and confirm the notice in writing, of (i) the effectiveness of any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement or any new registration statement relating to the Notes, or when any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus shall have been filed (other than Preliminary Pricing Supplements, Pricing Supplements or amendments or supplements relating exclusively to offerings of securities other than the Notes, except as set forth in the Procedures (as defined herein)), (ii) the receipt of any comments from the SEC with respect to the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any Time of Sale of Prospectus (other than with respect to a document filed with the SEC pursuant to the 1934 Act incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any Time of Sale Prospectus, in which case notice will be provided to counsel to the Agents), (iii) any request by the SEC for any amendment to the
Registration Statement or the filing of a new registration statement or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus or any document incorporated by reference therein or otherwise deemed a part thereof or for additional information (other than with respect to a document filed with the SEC pursuant to the 1934 Act incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any Time of Sale Prospectus, in which case notice will be provided to counsel to the Agents), (iv) the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any new registration statement relating to the Notes or the issuance of any order preventing or suspending the use of the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus, or the suspension of the qualification of the Notes for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or the initiation of or notification of any threat to initiate any proceedings for any of such purposes and (v) the initiation of any examination pursuant to Section 8(e) under the 1933 Act relating to the Registration Statement or any new registration statement relating to the Notes or the Company becoming subject to a proceeding under Section 8A under the 1933 Act in connection with the Notes.
 
(l)
                                    
The Company shall not be required to comply with the provisions of subsections (a), (b) or (j) of this Section or the provisions of Section VII(b), (c) and (d) during any period from the time (i) the Agents have suspended solicitation of purchases of the Notes pursuant to a direction from the Company and (ii) the Agents shall not then hold any Notes as principal purchased from the Purchasing Agent, to the time the Company shall determine that solicitation of purchases of the Notes should be resumed or shall subsequently agree for the Purchasing Agent to purchase Notes as principal.
 
(m)
                            
Unless otherwise agreed upon between the Purchasing Agent acting as principal and the Company, between the date of the agreement by the Purchasing Agent to purchase Notes from the Company and the related settlement thereof (the "Settlement Date"), the Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Purchasing Agent, issue, sell, offer or contract to sell, grant any option for the sale of, or otherwise dispose of, any of its debt securities or guarantees similar to Notes (other than the Notes that are to be sold pursuant to such agreement or commercial paper in the ordinary course of business or, for the avoidance of doubt, any debt securities having an aggregate principal amount of $100,000,000 or more sold pursuant to an underwritten offering or having an aggregate principal amount of $50,000,000 or more sold solely to institutional investors, any variable-denomination floating rate demand notes or any notes delivered in connection with the issuance of tax-exempt debt securities).
 
(n)
                                
The Company will use the net proceeds received by it from the sale of the Notes in the manner specified in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus.
 
(o)
                                
The Company shall use its best efforts in cooperation with the Purchasing Agent and the Agents to permit the Notes to be eligible for clearance and settlement through The Depository Trust Company.
 
(p)
                                
The Company will notify the Purchasing Agent as soon as practicable, and confirm such notice in writing, of any change in the rating assigned by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization, as such term is defined in Section 3(a)(62) of the 1934 Act, to the program under which the Notes are issued or any debt securities (including the Notes) of the
Company, or the public announcement by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of the program or any such debt securities, or the withdrawal by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization of its rating of the program or any such debt securities.  The Purchasing Agent will, in turn, notify promptly the other Agents of any such change.
 
(q)
                                
The Company will not issue any Notes if such issuance would not comply with Condition 7.6 of the order of the North Carolina Utilities Commission ("NCUC") dated June 29, 2012, in Docket No. E-7, sub 986.
 
(a)
                                
The Agents agree to use their reasonable best efforts to solicit offers to purchase and receive offers to purchase a particular tranche of Notes upon the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus and upon the terms communicated to the Agents from time to time by the Purchasing Agent.  For the purpose of such solicitations, the Agents will use the Time of Sale Prospectus relating to a particular tranche of Notes, and the Agents will solicit offers to purchase only as permitted or contemplated thereby and herein and will solicit offers to purchase the Notes only as permitted by the 1933 Act and the applicable securities laws or regulations of any jurisdiction. An Agent's commitment to purchase Notes from the Purchasing Agent as principal shall be deemed to have been made on the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements of the Company herein contained and shall be subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth.  Unless the context otherwise requires, references herein to "this Agreement" shall include each applicable Terms Agreement.  The Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to suspend solicitations of offers to purchase the Notes at any time for any period of time or permanently.  Upon receipt of instructions (which may be given orally and confirmed in writing) from the Company to the Purchasing Agent and the Agents, the Agents will suspend promptly solicitation of offers to purchase until such time as the Company has advised the Purchasing Agent and the Agents that such solicitation may be resumed.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Purchasing Agent nor any Agent shall be obligated to resume solicitations of offers to purchase Notes unless the Company has complied with the provisions of Sections III(a), III(b) and VII in full.
 
(b)
                                
Unless otherwise instructed by the Company, the Agents are authorized to solicit offers to purchase the Notes only in denominations of $1,000 or more (in integral multiples of $1,000).  The Agents are not authorized to appoint subagents or to engage the services of any other broker or dealer in connection with the offer or sale of the Notes without the consent of the Company and the Purchasing Agent.  The Purchasing Agent and each Agent shall have the right, in its discretion reasonably exercised, to reject any offer to purchase Notes, as a whole or in part, and any such rejection shall not be deemed a breach of its agreements contained herein. Unless otherwise instructed by the Company, the Purchasing Agent shall communicate to the Company, orally or in writing, each offer to purchase Notes, other than offers to purchase that had been rejected by the Purchasing Agent or any Agent.  The Company shall have the sole right to accept offers to purchase Notes and may reject any proposed offers to purchase Notes as a whole or in part.  The Company agrees to pay, without duplication, the Purchasing Agent, as consideration
 
 
for soliciting offers to purchase Notes pursuant to a Terms Agreement, a concession in the form of a discount equal to the percentages of the aggregate principal amount of each Note actually sold as set forth in hereto; provided, however, that the Company and the Purchasing Agent may agree instead to a discount greater than or less than the percentages set forth in hereto.  The actual aggregate discount with respect to each sale of Notes will be set forth in the related Pricing Supplement.  The Purchasing Agent and the Agents or Selected Dealers will share the above-mentioned concession in such proportions as they may agree.  Unless otherwise authorized by the Company, all Notes shall be sold to the public initially at a purchase price not to exceed 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued interest, if any.  Such purchase price shall be set forth in the confirmation statement of the Agent or Selected Dealer responsible for such sale that is delivered to each purchaser of the related Notes.
Exhibit C
Exhibit C
 
(c)
                                 
Procedural details relating to the issue and delivery of, and the solicitation of purchases and payment for, the Notes are set forth in the Administrative Procedures attached hereto as , as amended from time to time (the "Procedures").  Unless otherwise provided in the applicable Terms Agreement, the provisions of the Procedures shall apply to all transactions contemplated hereunder.  The Purchasing Agent, the Agents and the Company each agree to perform the respective duties and obligations specifically provided to be performed by each in the Procedures.  The Procedures may only be amended by written agreement of the Company and the Purchasing Agent.
Exhibit D
 
(d)
                                
Each of the Company, the Purchasing Agent and the Agents acknowledge and agree, and each Selected Dealer will be required to acknowledge and agree, that the Notes are being offered for sale in the United States only.
 
Each sale of Notes shall be made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and a separate agreement in substantially the form attached as (each, a "Terms Agreement"), to be entered into by the Company and the Purchasing Agent, which will provide for the sale of such Notes by the Company to, and the purchase and reoffering thereof by, the Purchasing Agent as principal.  A Terms Agreement may also specify certain provisions relating to the reoffering of such Notes by the Purchasing Agent.  Each Terms Agreement shall describe the Notes to be purchased pursuant thereto by the Purchasing Agent as principal, and may specify, among other things, the principal amount of Notes to be purchased, the annual interest rate (or, coupon) or interest rate index or formula (and whether such interest rate shall be fixed or floating (or, coupon type)), the interest payment frequency (or, coupon payments), the maturity date, whether the Notes provide for a Survivor's Option (as such term is defined in the Time of Sale Prospectus), whether the Notes are redeemable or otherwise repayable and, if so, on what terms and conditions, the net proceeds to the Company, the initial public offering price (or, issue price), at which the Notes are proposed to be reoffered, the Settlement Date and any other relevant terms.  In connection with the resale of the Notes purchased, without the consent of the Purchasing Agent, no Agent may reallow any portion of the discount paid to it.
Exhibit E
(a)
                                
The Company represents and warrants to the Purchasing Agent and the Agents as of the date hereof, as of the time of each acceptance (the "Time of Acceptance") by the Company of an offer to purchase Notes (including each applicable Terms Agreement), as of the Settlement Date, and as of each date the Registration Statement or the Prospectus is amended or supplemented, as follows:
 
(1)
                                
(A)  (i)(a) At the time of the filing of the Registration Statement, (b) at the time of the most recent amendment thereto for purposes of complying with Section 10(a)(3) of the 1933 Act (whether such amendment was by post-effective amendment, incorporated report filed pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the 1934 Act or form of prospectus) and (c) at the time the Company or any person acting on its behalf (within the meaning, for this clause only, of Rule 163(c)) made any offer relating to the Notes in reliance on the exemption under Rule 163, the Company was a "well-known seasoned issuer" as defined in Rule 405; and (ii) at the earliest time after the filing of the Registration Statement that the Company or another offering participant made a bona fide offer (within the meaning of Rule 164(h)(2)) of the Notes, the Company was not an "ineligible issuer" as defined in Rule 405.  The Registration Statement is an "automatic shelf registration statement" as defined in Rule 405, that initially became effective within three years of the date hereof.  If immediately prior to the third anniversary of the original effective date of the Registration Statement (the "Renewal Deadline") of the initial effective date of the Registration Statement, any of the Notes remain unsold by the Purchasing Agent or the Agents, the Company will, at its option prior to the Renewal Deadline, file, if it has not already done so and is eligible to do so, a new automatic shelf registration statement relating to the Notes, in a form reasonably satisfactory to counsel to the Agents.  If the Company is no longer eligible to file an automatic shelf registration statement, the Company will, prior to the Renewal Deadline, if it has not already done so, file a new shelf registration statement relating to the Notes, in a form reasonably satisfactory to counsel to the Agents, and will use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective within 180 days after the Renewal Deadline.  The Company will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Notes to continue as contemplated in the expired registration statement relating to the Notes.

post-effective amendment to be declared effective as soon as practicable, (iv) promptly notify the Agents of such effectiveness, and (v) take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Notes to continue as contemplated in the registration statement that was the subject of the Rule 401(g)(2) notice or for which the Company has otherwise become ineligible.

(a)
                    
The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Purchasing Agent and each Agent and their respective officers and directors and each person, if any, who controls the Purchasing Agent or any Agent (collectively, "Agent Indemnified Parties"), within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act, as follows:
 
(1)
                                
against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) including the Rule 430B Information, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, unless such statement or omission or such alleged statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Purchasing Agent or any Agent through the Purchasing Agent expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus  (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or  Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, such information being limited to the following: the third and fourth sentences in the fifth paragraph and the second sentence in the sixth paragraph, under the section captioned "Plan of Distribution" in the Prospectus Supplement dated November 13, 2012 and any additional information specified in a Terms Agreement relating to a particular issuance of Notes;
 
(2)
                                
against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, if such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company; and
 
(3)
                                
against any and all expense whatsoever reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such
alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (1) or (2) of this Section VIII(a).
 
In no case shall the Company be liable under this indemnity agreement with respect to any claim made against any Agent Indemnified Party unless the Company shall be notified in writing of the nature of the claim within a reasonable time after the assertion thereof, but failure so to notify the Company shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than under subsections VIII(a) and VIII(b). The Company shall be entitled to participate at its own expense in the defense, or, if it so elects, within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice, to assume the defense of any suit brought to enforce any such claim, but if it so elects to assume the defense, such defense shall be conducted by counsel chosen by it and approved by the Purchasing Agent and the Agents who are party to such suit, or defendant or defendants in any suit so brought, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.  In any such suit, the Agent Indemnified Parties shall have the right to employ their own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Agent Indemnified Parties unless (i) the Company and such Agent Indemnified Parties shall have mutually agreed to the employment of such counsel, or (ii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both such Agent Indemnified Parties and the Company and such Agent Indemnified Parties shall have been advised by such counsel that a conflict of interest between the Company and such Agent Indemnified Parties may arise and for this reason it is not desirable for the same counsel to represent both the indemnifying party and also the indemnified party (it being understood, however, that the Company shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys for all such Agent Indemnified Parties, which firm shall be designated in writing by the Purchasing Agent and the Agents).  The Company agrees to notify the Purchasing Agent and the Agents within a reasonable time of the assertion of any claim against it, any of its officers or directors or any person who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act, in connection with the sale of the Notes.
 
(b)
                                
The Purchasing Agent and the Agents severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and each of the officers of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act to the same extent as the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, but only with respect to statements or omissions made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Purchasing Agent or any Agent through the Purchasing Agent expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, such information being limited to the following: the third and fourth sentences in the fifth paragraph and the second sentence in the sixth paragraph, under the section captioned "Plan of Distribution" in the Prospectus Supplement dated November 13, 2012 and any additional information specified in a Terms Agreement relating to a particular issuance of Notes.  In case any action shall be brought against the Company or any person so indemnified based on the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), the Time of Sale Prospectus,
the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus and in respect of which indemnity may be sought against the Purchasing Agent or any Agent, the Purchasing Agent or such Agent shall have the rights and duties given to the Company, and the Company and each person so indemnified shall have the rights and duties given to the Purchasing Agent and the Agents, by the provisions of subsection (a) of this Section.
 
(c)
                                 
No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d)
                                
If the indemnification provided for in this Section VIII is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever (or actions in respect thereof) that would otherwise have been indemnified under the terms of such indemnity, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Purchasing Agent and the Agents on the other from the offering of the relevant Notes.  If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Purchasing Agent and the Agents on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Purchasing Agent and the Agents on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Notes (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total discounts and commissions received by the Purchasing Agent and the applicable Agents in connection with the offering of such Notes. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Purchasing Agent and any of the Agents on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Purchasing Agent and the Agents agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Purchasing Agent and the Agents were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or
 
 
claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section, neither the Purchasing Agent nor any Agent shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which such Notes purchased by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which the Purchasing Agent or such Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Purchasing Agent's and the Agents' obligations to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations as set forth in the applicable Terms Agreement and not joint.
 
The Company may elect to suspend or terminate the offering of Notes under this Agreement at any time; the Company also (as to the Purchasing Agent or any one or more of the Agents) or any Agent (as to itself) may terminate the appointment and arrangements described in this Agreement.  Upon receipt of instructions from the Company, the Purchasing Agent shall suspend or terminate the participation of any Selected Dealer under the Master Selected Dealer Agreement attached hereto as Schedule A to .  Such actions may be taken, in the case of the Company, by giving prompt written notice of suspension to the Purchasing Agent and all of the Agents and by giving not less than five (5) days' written notice of termination to the affected party and the other parties to this Agreement or, in the case of the Purchasing Agent or an Agent, by giving not less than five (5) days' written notice of termination to the Company. The Company shall promptly notify the other parties in writing of any such termination.
Exhibit D
 
The Purchasing Agent may, and upon the request of an Agent with respect to any Notes being purchased by such Agent shall, terminate any Terms Agreement relating to a particular sale of Notes immediately upon notice to the Company at any time at or prior to the Settlement Date relating thereto, if, (i) there is a suspension or material limitation in trading of the securities of the Company on the New York Stock Exchange, (ii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York is declared by either Federal or New York State authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States occurs, or (iii) any outbreak of hostilities or escalation thereof or other calamity or crisis involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war occurs, if the effect of such event or events specified in clauses (i) through (iii) makes it, in the judgment of the Purchasing Agent or such Agent or Agents, impracticable or inadvisable to market the Notes or enforce contracts for the sale of the Notes on the terms and in the manner contemplated by the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus.
 
Any Terms Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Purchasing Agent or other Agent on the terms set forth herein or incorporated by reference therein.  The termination of this Agreement shall not require termination of any agreement by the Purchasing Agent to purchase Notes as principal, and the termination of any such agreement shall not require termination of this Agreement.
If this Agreement is terminated, Section III(g), Section VIII, Section XI, Section XII and Section XIII hereof shall survive and shall remain in effect; provided that if at the time of termination of this Agreement an offer to purchase Notes has been accepted by the Company but the time of delivery to the Purchasing Agent of such Notes has not occurred, the provisions of all of Section III, Section IV(b), (c) and (d) and Section V hereof and the Terms Agreement with respect to such Notes shall also survive until time of delivery.
 
In the event that this Agreement is terminated and a proposed offering of Notes is not completed according to the terms of this Agreement and an executed Terms Agreement, the Purchasing Agent and the applicable Agents will be reimbursed by the Company only for out-of-pocket accountable expenses actually incurred to the extent a written request therefor is submitted to the Company, accompanied by invoices or other documents setting forth in reasonable detail the amount of such expenses.
 
Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all statements, requests, notices and advices hereunder shall be in writing, or by telephone if promptly confirmed in writing, and if to the Purchasing Agent or an Agent shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered in person or sent by telex, telecopier transmission or email (confirmed in writing), or registered mail to the Purchasing Agent or such Agent at its address, telex or telecopier number or email address set forth on hereto and if to the Company shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered or sent by telex, telecopier transmission or email (confirmed in writing) or registered mail to the Company at the address specified below.  All such notices shall be effective on receipt.

The execution and delivery by the Company of the Selling Agent Agreement does not, and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated thereby and in any Terms Agreement, including the issuance and sale of the Notes, would not, in each case as of the date of such opinion, (i) conflict with the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws, (ii) constitute a violation of, or a breach of or default under, the terms of any of the contracts set forth on Schedule I to this or (iii) violate or conflict with, or result in any contravention of, any Applicable Law.  "Applicable Law" means the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and those laws, rules and regulations of the State of New York and those federal laws, rules or regulations of the United States of America, in each case as in effect on the date of such opinion and that, in such counsel's experience, are normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Selling Agent Agreement, any Terms Agreement and the Indenture (other than the antifraud provisions of the United States federal securities laws, state securities or blue sky laws, antifraud laws and the rules and regulations of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority), but without having made any investigation as to the applicability of any specific law, rule or regulation.

"Governmental Approval" means any consent, approval, license, authorization or validation of, or filing, qualification or registration with, any Governmental Authority required to be made or obtained by the Company as of the date of such opinion pursuant to Applicable Laws, other than any consent, approval, license, authorization, validation, filing, qualification or registration that may have become applicable as a result of the involvement of any party (other than the Company) in the transactions contemplated by the Selling Agent Agreement, any Terms Agreement or the Indenture or because of such parties' legal or regulatory status or because of any other facts specifically pertaining to such parties and "Governmental Authority" means any court, regulatory body, administrative agency or governmental body of the State of North Carolina, the State of Delaware or the United States of America having jurisdiction over the Company as of the date of such opinion under Applicable Law.

(5)
                                
The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Trustee, is a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.
 
(6)
                                
The Notes have been duly authorized by the Company for issuance and sale pursuant to the Selling Agent Agreement and any applicable Terms Agreement, and when the terms of any Notes have been established in accordance with the Indenture and the written consent of the Assistant Treasurer of the Company, dated as of November 13, 2012 (the "Authorizing Resolutions") and such Notes in substantially the form attached to the Authorizing Resolutions have been completed, executed, issued, authenticated and delivered pursuant to the provisions of the Selling Agent Agreement, the Authorizing Resolutions, any applicable Terms Agreement, the Company Order of the Assistant Treasurer and Assistant Corporate Secretary of the Company, dated as of November 13, 2012 and the Indenture against payment therefor in accordance with the terms of the Selling Agent Agreement and any applicable Terms Agreement, such Notes will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits of the Indenture in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and will be enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms.
 
(7)
                                
The statements under the caption "Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences" in the Prospectus Supplement, insofar as such statements summarize legal matters or legal conclusions discussed therein, fairly present, in all material respects such legal matters or legal conclusions.

(9)
                                
The Company is not and, assuming the offering and sale of the Notes and the application of the proceeds thereof on the date of such opinion as described in the Prospectus, would not be an "investment company," as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
 
(10)
                         
The statements in the Prospectus under the caption "Plan of Distribution," insofar as such statements purport to summarize certain provisions of the Selling Agent Agreement, fairly summarize such provisions in all material respects.
Such counsel shall also state that:
 
(i)
                                    
no facts have come to its attention that have caused it to believe that the documents filed by the Company under the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations that are incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, when filed, were not, on their face, appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations (except that in each case such counsel need not express any view as to the financial statements, schedules and other financial information included or incorporated by reference therein or excluded therefrom, compliance with XBRL interactive data requirements or the Form T-1), (ii) the Registration Statement, as of the later of its effective date or the most recent filing by the Company of its Annual Report on Form 10-K after such effective date, and the Prospectus, as of the date of such opinion, appeared on their faces to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements under the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations (except that in each case such counsel need not express any view as to the financial statements, schedules and other financial information included or incorporated by reference therein or excluded therefrom, compliance with XBRL interactive data requirements or the Form T-1), and (iii) no facts have come to its attention that have caused it to believe that the Registration Statement, as of the later of its effective date or the most recent filing by the Company of its Annual Report on Form 10-K after such effective date, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, not misleading, or that the Prospectus, as of the date of such opinion, contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except that in each case such counsel need not express any view as to the financial statements, schedules and other financial information included or incorporated by reference therein or excluded therefrom, including XBRL interactive data, or the statements contained in the exhibits to the Registration Statement, including the Form T-1).
 
In addition, such counsel shall confirm that the Prospectus has been filed with the SEC within the time period required by Rule 424 of the 1933 Act Regulations.  Such counsel shall further state that the Registration Statement became effective upon filing under the 1933 Act and, pursuant to Section 309 of the 1939 Act, the Indenture has been qualified under the 1939 Act, and that such counsel has been orally advised by the SEC that no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and, to such counsel's knowledge, no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or threatened by the SEC.
 
Such counsel may state that its opinions in paragraphs (5) and (6) are subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).  In addition, such counsel may state that they have relied as to certain factual matters on information obtained from public officials, officers and representatives of the Company and that the signatures on all documents examined by them are genuine, assumptions which such counsel have not independently verified.

Each of the Company and the Principal Subsidiaries is duly qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the ownership or leasing of its property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to so qualify, considering all such cases in the aggregate, does not have a material adverse effect on the business, properties, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole.
 
(3)

(6)
                                
Assuming the consents and approvals described in opinion (9) have been obtained, the execution and delivery by the Company of the Selling Agent Agreement and the Indenture do not, and the execution and delivery of any applicable Terms Agreement and performance of the Selling Agent Agreement, the Indenture and any applicable Terms Agreement as they relate to the issue and sale of the Notes would not, in each case as of the date of such opinion, violate or contravene any of the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Company or any statute or any order, rule or regulation in effect on the date of such opinion of which such counsel is aware of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its Principal Subsidiaries or any of their respective property, nor would such action conflict with or result in a breach or violation as of the date of such opinion of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument in effect on
the date of such opinion and known to such counsel to which the Company or any of its Principal Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or their respective property is bound or to which any of its property or assets is subject, which affects in a material way the Company's ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Indenture and the Notes.
 
(7)

The Notes have been duly authorized by the Company for issuance and sale pursuant to the Selling Agent Agreement and any applicable Terms Agreement. When the terms of any Notes have been established in accordance with the Indenture and the written consent of the Assistant Treasurer of the Company, dated as of November 13, 2012 (the "Authorizing Resolutions") and such Notes in substantially the form attached to the Authorizing Resolutions have been completed, executed, issued, authenticated and delivered pursuant to the provisions of the Selling Agent Agreement, the Authorizing Resolutions, any applicable Terms Agreement, the Company Order of the Assistant Treasurer and Assistant Corporate Secretary of the Company, dated as of November 13, 2012 and the Indenture against payment therefor in accordance with the terms of the Selling Agent Agreement and any applicable Terms Agreement, such Notes will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, and will be entitled to the benefits afforded by the Indenture in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Notes.
 
(9)
                                
No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification is required as of the date of such opinion to authorize, or for the Company to consummate, the transactions contemplated by the Selling Agent Agreement and any applicable Terms Agreement, except for such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Notes by the Underwriters and except as required in Condition 7.6 of the order of the North Carolina Utilities Commission dated June 29, 2012, in Docket No. E-7, sub 986, which consent has been obtained for the issuance of up to $           of Notes on or prior to December 31, [insert year in which opinion is given] (which amount shall be reduced by any senior notes issued by the Company after the date of such opinion).
 
Such counsel shall also state that:
 
Nothing has come to such counsel's attention that has caused him to believe that each document incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, when filed, was not, on its face, appropriately responsive, in all material respects, to the requirements of the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations.  Nothing has come to such counsel's attention that has caused him to believe that (i) the Registration Statement, as of the later of its effective date or the most recent filing by the Company of its Annual Report on Form 10-K after such effective date, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) the Prospectus, as of the date of such opinion, contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Except as otherwise expressly provided in such opinion, such counsel need not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in or incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement or the Prospectus and need not express any opinion or belief as to (i) the financial statements or other financial data contained or incorporated by reference therein, including XBRL interactive data, (ii) the statement of the eligibility and qualification of the Trustee included in the Registration Statement (the "Form T-1") or (iii) the information in the Prospectus under the caption "Registration and SettlementThe Depository Trust Company."
 
Such counsel may state that he does not express any opinion concerning any law other than the law of the State of North Carolina, and such counsel may rely as to all matters of the laws of the states of Florida, South Carolina, Ohio and Indiana on appropriate counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Purchasing Agent and the Agents, which may include the Company's other "in-house" counsel). Such counsel may state that the opinions in paragraphs (7) and (8) are subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and that he has relied as to certain factual matters on information obtained from public officials, officers of the Company and other sources believed by such counsel to be responsible.

Dear Selected Dealer:
 
In connection with public offerings of securities after the date hereof for which we are acting as lead agent, as lead or co-manager of an underwriting syndicate or otherwise involved in the distribution of securities by means of an offering of securities for sale to selected dealers, you may be offered the right as a selected dealer to purchase as principal a portion of such securities.  This will confirm our mutual agreement as to the general terms and conditions applicable to your participation in any such selected dealer group organized by us as follows.
 
1.             .  The terms and conditions of this letter agreement (this "Agreement") shall be applicable to any offering of notes ("Notes"), whether a public offering effected pursuant to a registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), or an offering exempt from registration thereunder (other than an offering of Notes effected wholly outside the United States of America), in respect of which Incapital LLC ("Incapital"), clearing through DTC Number 0235 via Dain Rauscher Inc. (the "Account") (acting for its own Account or for the account of any underwriting or agent or similar group or syndicate), is responsible for managing or otherwise implementing the sale (whether by acting as lead agent or manager or by facilitating the re-offer of Notes or otherwise) of the Notes to selected dealers ("Selected Dealers") and has expressly informed you that these terms and conditions shall be applicable.  Any such offering of Notes to you as a Selected Dealer is hereinafter called an "Offering."  In the case of any Offering where we are acting for the account of any underwriting or agent or similar group or syndicate (whether purchasing as principal for resale or soliciting as agent purchases of Notes directly from the issuer) ("Underwriters"), the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be for the benefit of, and binding upon, such Underwriters, including, in the case of any Offering where we are acting with others as representatives of Underwriters, such other representatives.  The use of the defined term Underwriter herein shall be understood to include acting as agent.
