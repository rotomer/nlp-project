Exhibit 99.1 DeVry Inc. Reports Fiscal 2003 Third-Quarter Revenues, Earnings, Spring Term Enrollment at DeVry University OAKBROOK TERRACE, Ill., April 22 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- DeVry Inc. (NYSE: DV), an international higher education company, today reported revenues and earnings for the third quarter of fiscal year 2003, ended March 31, 2003. DeVry Inc. also announced spring term student enrollments at DeVry University. Revenues for the third quarter were $169.4 million, compared with $164.8 million for the same period one year ago. Revenues for the nine-month period ended March 31, 2003 were $505.2 million versus $486.1 million for the same period last year. Third-quarter net income was $14.9 million, or $0.21 per share, compared with $18.4 million, or $0.26 per share in the prior year. For the first nine months of fiscal 2003, net income was $49.0 million, or $0.70 per share, compared with $50.9 million, or $0.72 per share for the previous year (all per share data diluted). In addition, DeVry University today announced that 43,045 undergraduate students enrolled for the 2003 spring term, compared with 45,810 one year ago, a decline of 6.0 percent. New undergraduate student enrollment declined 3.6 percent to 8,053 for the spring term compared to 8,351 in the previous year. Undergraduate enrollment in the spring term was negatively impacted by the previously announced consolidation of DeVry's two Toronto area campuses. However, new undergraduate enrollment in the United States increased from 7,733 one year ago to 7,759 this year. At Keller Graduate School of Management (KGSM), the number of coursetakers for the 2003 February term increased 18 percent to 11,715, compared with 9,925 for the same term last year. "We are encouraged by the continued strong interest in our business and online programs, as well as by what appears to be the beginning of a positive trend in our core U.S. enrollment," said Ronald L. Taylor, president and co- chief executive officer. "We believe our more robust marketing efforts have helped us to better communicate the value and quality of a DeVry University degree to potential students." In March 2003, DeVry signed a definitive agreement to acquire Ross University, the operator of Ross University School of Medicine and Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine, located in the Caribbean countries of Dominica and St. Kitts/Nevis, respectively. Ross University is one of the world's largest providers of medical and veterinary education with enrollment of more than 2,500 students. DeVry expects the transaction to close during the company's fiscal fourth quarter. "The acquisition of Ross University represents an entry into the health sciences field at the highest levels of professionalism," said Dennis J. Keller, chairman and co-chief executive officer. "We believe there are significant opportunities to grow in this field, utilizing the combined resources of Ross University, DeVry University and Becker Conviser Professional Review." During the quarter, DeVry opened its sixth DeVry University Center (DVUC) in the Atlanta area and converted existing KGSM centers to DVUCs in Milwaukee, Tampa Bay, Kansas City and the Atlanta area, where two centers were converted. In March, the Company opened a new undergraduate campus in the Denver area and a new graduate center in Manhattan. DeVry now operates 25 undergraduate campuses and 39 adult learner centers across North America. DeVry Inc. (NYSE: DV) is the holding company for DeVry University and Becker Conviser Professional Review. DeVry University offers associate, bachelor's and master's degree programs in technology, business and management. Becker Conviser Professional Review is a leading provider of preparatory coursework for the certified public accountant, certified management accountant and chartered financial analyst exams.
