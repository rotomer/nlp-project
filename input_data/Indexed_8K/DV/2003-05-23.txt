In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, for purposes of each employee benefit plan sponsored by Buyer and its Affiliates for the benefit of Non-Union Employees (such plans, collectively the "New Plans"), which provide medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Non-Union Employee, Buyer shall cause such Non-Union Employee (and his or her covered dependents) to be given credit for his service with the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date for purposes of satisfying all
56 pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements, and Buyer shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents under a Plan during the portion of the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs to be taken into account under a corresponding New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

59 as to the certification that the representations and warranties made by such Seller in Article III are true and correct in all material respects at and as of the Closing Date), and (ii) any nonfulfillment or breach of any covenant, agreement or other provision by such Seller. (b) The Sellers, severally and not jointly (pro rata according to each Seller's Common Percentage), shall indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties and save and hold them harmless against any Losses which the Buyer Indemnified Parties may suffer or sustain resulting from, arising out of or caused by: (i) any breach of any representation or warranty of the Company under Article IV, or of the certification in the certificate delivered by the Company to Buyer pursuant to Section 2.01(g)(i) (solely as to the certification that the representations and warranties made by the Company in Article IV are true and correct in all material respects at and as of the Closing Date), (ii) any nonfulfillment or breach of any covenant, agreement or other provision by the Company prior to the Closing (other than Section 6.06), (iii) any breach of the covenants set forth in Section 11.03 (Tax Matters), (iv) any breach of the covenant in Section 6.06 (Notification) and (v) the Seller Retained Actions; provided, however, that, except for claims for indemnification in respect of breaches of representations and warranties contained in Section 4.01 (Organization and Corporate Power), Section 4.02(a) (Subsidiaries), Section 4.03(a) and (c) (Authorization; No Breach; Valid and Binding Agreement), Section 4.08 (Tax Matters); Section 4.09(d) (St. Kitts Agreement) and Section 4.19 (Brokerage) (for which representations and warranties the Sellers shall be responsible for all Losses from the first dollar (subject to the Cap)), the Sellers shall have no liability under clause (i) or clause (iv) above, unless the aggregate of (x) all Losses relating thereto for which the Sellers would, but for this proviso, be liable exceed on a cumulative basis an amount equal to $1,500,000 (the "Deductible"), and then only to the extent such Losses exceed the Deductible; provided further that the Sellers' aggregate liability under clauses (i), (iii) and (iv) above shall in no event exceed $47,500,000 (the "Cap").

Other than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud, Buyer may not avoid the limitations on liability of the Sellers set forth in this Section 9.02 by seeking damages for breach of contract, tort or pursuant to any other theory of liability. (d) If Buyer, on behalf of the Company, has repaid the then outstanding balance of Indebtedness on the Closing Date as set forth on, and in accordance with, the Payoff Letters, then the Sellers, severally and not jointly (pro rata according to each Seller's Common Percentage), shall
60 indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties and save and hold them harmless against any Losses which the Buyer Indemnified Parties may suffer or sustain resulting from, arising out of, or caused by the failure of any Payoff Letter to state accurately the amount required to be paid in order for such Indebtedness to be paid in full as of the Closing Date.

Such Seller shall provide the Company with such documents and information as the Company shall reasonably request in order to pursue such indemnification. If the Company recovers any amounts under the Recapitalization Agreement pursuant to such indemnification claim, the Company shall pay such amounts to the Stockholder Representatives, less any expenses incurred by the Company in connection with the pursuit of such indemnification claim to the extent that such expenses were not previously reimbursed to the Company by or on behalf of such Seller, and the Stockholder Representatives shall promptly distribute such net amount to the applicable Seller. 9.03 Indemnification by Buyer for the Benefit of the Sellers. Buyer shall indemnify the Sellers and their officers, directors, partners, members, employees, agents, representatives and successors (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Parties") and hold them harmless against any Losses which the Seller Indemnified Parties may suffer or sustain, as a result of: (a) any breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer under this Agreement, (b) any nonfulfillment or breach of any covenant, agreement or other provision by Buyer, (c) any claim or suit against any of the Seller Indemnified Parties under the Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification Act or any Legal Requirement which relates to actions taken by Buyer or the Company or its Subsidiaries at any time after the Closing Date with regard to any site of employment or one or more facilities or operating units within any site of employment of the Company or its Subsidiaries, (d) any claims by any employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries against any of the Seller Indemnified Parties relating to any breach or violation of, or noncompliance with (i) any employment agreement or contract or similar arrangement between the Company or its Subsidiaries on the one hand, and such employee, on the other, or (ii) or any other bonus or incentive or similar plan or arrangement, in each case, if and to the extent that the breach, violation or noncompliance giving rise to such claims occur after the Closing Date and (e) any claim or suit brought against any of the Seller Indemnified Parties at any time on or after the Closing Date relating to actions taken by Buyer or the Company or its Subsidiaries, in each case, at any time after the Closing Date, other than any claim or action by Buyer pursuant to Section 9.02 relating to any breach by any of the Seller Indemnified Parties, and other than any claim or action to the extent that the Sellers are, or would be, obligated to indemnify Buyer under Section 9.02. The indemnification paid for the benefit of each Seller will be determined pro rata based upon the Common Percentages.
62 (b) Other than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud, this Section 9.03 constitutes each Sellers' sole and exclusive remedy for any and all Losses or other claims relating to or arising from this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby including, without limitation, with respect to any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of this Agreement. 9.04 Manner of Payment; Release. -------------------------- (a) Any indemnification of the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 9.02 shall be paid on a several and not joint basis and shall be effected as follows: (i) first, so long as funds remain in the Escrow Account, payment shall be made from the Escrow Account on behalf of the Sellers in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, and, (ii) thereafter, by wire transfer of immediately available funds from the applicable individual Seller to an account designated by Buyer within 15 days after the determination thereof. Any indemnification of the Seller Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 9.03 shall be effected by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the Stockholder Representatives within 15 days after the determination thereof (which amount shall be promptly distributed to the Sellers pro rata based upon each Seller's Common Percentage). Each indemnification payment made pursuant to this Article IX shall, with respect to the Seller making or receiving such indemnification payment and Buyer, be deemed to be an adjustment to the Common Share Proceeds (or, to the extent such Seller has no Common Share Proceeds, the Final Option Proceeds) of such Seller. (b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any indemnification due pursuant to Section 9.02(a) is satisfied from funds in the Escrow Account (a "Seller Escrow Indemnification Claim"), the Stockholder Representatives may equitably adjust distributions to the Sellers from the Holdback Amount and from the Escrow Account (pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement) so that each Seller liable for a Seller Escrow Indemnification Claim bears the full liability for such Seller's indemnification obligations. After the Holdback Amount and the Escrow Account have been depleted, if the distributions in connection with the Holdback Amount and Escrow Account were not sufficient, with respect to each Seller Escrow Indemnification Claim, to compensate each Seller other than the indemnifying Seller in connection with such claim (such that only the applicable indemnifying Seller bore the liability in connection with such claim), then, such indemnifying Seller shall indemnify each other Seller for distributions from the Escrow Account forgone by each other Seller due to payments made to satisfy such Seller Escrow Indemnification Claim (to the extent that such foregone distributions were not otherwise satisfied by an equitable adjustment to the distribution of the Holdback Amount).
63 (c) Effective as of the Closing, (i) Buyer and each Buyer Indemnified Party hereby waives against each Seller Released Party, on behalf of such releasing party's predecessors, successors, executors, administrators, heirs, estate, and past, present and future assigns, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action it or they may have against the Seller Released Parties arising under or based upon, directly or indirectly, any circumstance, contract or other agreement (whether express, implied, oral or written), activity, action, omission, event, cause or matter occurring or existing on or before the Closing Date, in each case, arising out of such Seller Released Parties' actions or omissions as a stockholder, director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or its Subsidiaries, in connection with the Management Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, without limitation, the negotiations thereof, but except as provided in clauses (x) and (y) below) and (ii) each Seller and each Seller Indemnified Party hereby waives against each Buyer Released Party, on behalf of such releasing party's predecessors, successors, executors, administrators, heirs, estate, and past, present and future assigns, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action it or they may have against the Buyer Released Parties arising under or based upon, directly or indirectly, any circumstance, contract or other agreement (whether express, implied, oral or written), activity, action, omission, event, cause or matter occurring or existing on or before the Closing Date in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, without limitation, the negotiations thereof, but except as provided in clauses (x) and (y) below), except, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), for (x) any and all rights, claims and causes of action such releasing party may have under this Agreement and (y) any and all rights, claims and causes of action arising out of fraud. 9.05 Defense of Third Party Claims. Any Person making a claim for indemnification under Section 9.02 or Section 9.03 (an "Indemnitee") shall notify the indemnifying party (an "Indemnitor") of the claim in writing promptly after receiving written notice of any action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim against it (if by a third party), describing the claim, the amount thereof (if known and quantifiable) and the basis thereof; provided that the failure to so notify an Indemnitor shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that (and only to the extent that) such failure shall have caused the damages for which the Indemnitor is obligated to be greater than such damages would have been had the Indemnitee given the Indemnitor prompt notice hereunder. Any Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim giving rise to an Indemnitee's claim for indemnification at such Indemnitor's expense, and at its option shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof by appointing a reputable counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee to be the lead counsel in connection with such defense; provided that the Indemnitee shall be entitled to
64 participate in the defense of such claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose; provided however, that the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by the Indemnitee. If the Indemnitor shall control the defense of any such claim then the Indemnitor shall be entitled to settle such claim; provided that the Indemnitor shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnitee (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) before entering into any settlement of a claim or ceasing to defend such claim if, pursuant to or as a result of such settlement or cessation, injunctive or other equitable relief will be imposed against the Indemnitee or if such settlement does not expressly and unconditionally release the Indemnitee from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such claim, without prejudice except for payments that would be required to be paid by Buyer representing the Deductible. 9.06 Determination of Loss Amount. The amount of any Loss subject to indemnification under Section 9.02 or Section 9.03 shall be calculated net of (i) any Tax Benefit actually received by the Indemnitee on account of such Loss and (ii) any insurance proceeds actually received by the Indemnitee on account of such Loss. If the Indemnitee actually receives a Tax Benefit after an indemnification payment is made to it, the Indemnitee shall promptly pay to the Person or Persons that made such indemnification payment the amount of such Tax Benefit at such time or times as and to the extent that such Tax Benefit is actually realized by the Indemnitee. For purposes hereof, "Tax Benefit" shall mean any actual reduction in Taxes payable or an actual refund of Taxes previously paid. The Indemnitee shall seek full recovery under all insurance policies covering any Loss to the same extent as they would if such Loss were not subject to indemnification hereunder. In the event that an insurance or other recovery is made by any Indemnitee with respect to any Loss for which any such Person has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the recovery shall be made promptly to the Person or Persons that provided such indemnity payments to such Indemnitee.

All decisions and actions by the Stockholder Representatives (to the extent authorized by this Agreement) shall be binding upon all of the Sellers, and no Seller shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same.

Buyer agrees that the Stockholder Representatives, as the Stockholder Representatives, shall have no liability to Buyer for any Authorized Action, except to the extent that such Authorized Action is found by a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction to have constituted fraud or willful misconduct. Each Seller hereby severally, for itself only and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Stockholder Representatives against all expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement

The Stockholder Representatives shall not have by reason of this Agreement a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Seller, except in respect of amounts received on behalf of such Seller. The Stockholder Representatives shall not be liable to any Seller for any action taken or omitted by it or any agent employed by it hereunder or under any other document entered into in connection herewith, except that the Stockholder Representatives shall not be relieved of any liability imposed by law for willful misconduct. The Stockholder Representatives shall not be liable to the Sellers for any apportionment or distribution of payments made by the Stockholder Representatives in good faith, and if any such apportionment or distribution is subsequently determined to have been made in error the sole recourse of any Seller to whom payment was due, but not made, shall be to recover from other Sellers any payment in excess of the amount to which they are determined to have been entitled. The Stockholder Representatives shall not be required to make any inquiry concerning either the performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement. Neither the Stockholder Representatives nor any agent employed by them shall incur any liability to any Seller by virtue of the failure or refusal of the Stockholder Representatives for any reason to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or relating to the performance of its other duties hereunder, except for actions or omissions constituting fraud or bad faith. 10.05 Action by the Stockholders Representatives.

The information contained in the schedules hereto is disclosed solely for the purposes of this Agreement, and no information contained therein shall be deemed to be an admission by any party hereto to any third party of any matter whatsoever, including of any violation of law or breach of any agreement. 11.02 Acknowledgment by Buyer. Buyer acknowledges that it has conducted to its satisfaction, an independent investigation and verification of the financial condition, results of operations, assets, liabilities, properties and projected operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and, in making its determination to proceed with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer has relied on the results of its own independent investigation and verification and the representations, warranties and covenants of the Company and the Sellers expressly and specifically set forth in this Agreement, including the schedules. SUCH REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS BY THE COMPANY AND THE SELLERS CONSTITUTE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY AND THE
68 SELLERS TO BUYER IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, AND BUYER UNDERSTANDS, ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ALL OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY RELATING TO THE FUTURE OR HISTORICAL FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, ASSETS OR LIABILITIES OF THE COMPANY) ARE SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMED BY THE COMPANY AND THE SELLERS. No claim shall be brought or maintained by the Company, its Subsidiaries or Buyer or their respective successors or permitted assigns against any officer, director or employee (present or former) of the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Sellers or any direct or indirect equityholder of the Sellers, and no recourse shall be brought or granted against any of them, by virtue of or based upon any alleged misrepresentation or inaccuracy in, or breach of any of the representations, warranties or covenants of the Sellers set forth or contained in, this Agreement or any certificate delivered hereunder, except to the extent provided in Section 9.02 herein and except for knowing or willful breaches of this Agreement (but only if claims related to such breaches are made after a proper termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(b)) and claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud (and in the event of such fraud, such recourse shall be brought or granted solely against the Person or Persons committing such fraud). 11.03 Tax Matters. ----------- (a) Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns. Subject to Section 11.03(d), Buyer shall timely prepare and file or send (or cause to be timely prepared and filed or sent) all Tax Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries required to be filed for all taxable periods ending prior to or including the Closing Date which have not yet been filed as of the Closing Date and shall timely pay (or cause to be timely paid) all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns, provided, however, that, subject to the Cap, Sellers shall reimburse Buyer (in the manner set forth in Section 9.04(a)) for the pre-Closing portion of such Taxes shown on such Tax Returns to the extent the pre-Closing portion of such Taxes exceeds the amount (if any) accrued, provided, or otherwise reserved for on the Final Working Capital Statement with respect to such Tax Returns. The pre-Closing portion of Taxes for any Tax Return for any Tax period that includes the Closing Date shall be determined by closing the books of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the end of the day prior to the Closing Date and, for the avoidance of doubt, calculated without taking into account any item of income, gain, loss or deduction attributable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the transactions described in Section 1.01(a) of this Agreement). At least 30 days prior to the date on which each such Tax Return is due (including extensions), Buyer shall submit such Tax Return to the Stockholder Representatives for the Stockholder Representatives' comment. If the
69 Stockholder Representatives reasonably expect that the filing of such Tax Return, as prepared by Buyer, will adversely affect the Tax liability, the amount received under this Agreement or the indemnification obligation, in each case, of any Seller, the Stockholder Representatives shall, within 10 business days of receipt of such Tax Return, give notice to Buyer of their objection and provide final written comments on such Tax Return. If the parties cannot resolve any disputes with respect to the Stockholder Representatives' written comments within 5 business days of receipt thereof, the dispute shall be submitted to the Independent Auditor for resolution. If the Independent Auditor cannot resolve any differences between the Stockholder Representatives and Buyer with respect to such Tax Return or calculation at least 5 business days prior to the due date of such Tax Return, such Tax Return shall be filed as prepared by Buyer, and, thereafter, to the extent the Independent Auditor resolves such dispute in a manner which would require the amendment of such Tax Return, such Tax Return shall be amended in a manner consistent with such resolution. Promptly upon resolution by the Independent Auditor and the filing of an amended Tax Return, the liability of the Sellers and Buyer for Taxes with respect to such Tax Return shall be redetermined in a manner consistent with the provisions of this Section 11.03, and any payments made between such parties prior to the filing of such amended Tax Return shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such redetermination. The determination by such Independent Auditor shall be final and binding on both the Buyer and the Sellers. The fees and expenses of the Independent Auditor shall be borne one-half by the Buyer and one-half by the Sellers. (b) Transfer Taxes. Any real property transfer or gains Tax, stamp Tax, stock transfer Tax, or other similar Tax incurred as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, "Transfer Taxes"), and any penalties or interest with respect to the Transfer Taxes shall be paid one-half by Buyer and one-half by Sellers. The Sellers and Buyer agree to cooperate with respect to the filing of any returns with respect to the Transfer Taxes, including promptly supplying any information in their possession reasonably necessary to complete such returns. Each party shall use reasonable efforts to avail itself of any available exemptions from any such Taxes or fees, and to cooperate with the other parties in providing any information and documentation that may be necessary to obtain such exemptions. (c) Cooperation. Sellers and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their respective affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors and representatives reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax Returns, including maintaining and making available to each other all records necessary in connection with Taxes, resolving all disputes and audits with respect to all taxable periods relating to Taxes and obtaining necessary signatures of the Company and its Subsidiaries.
70 (d) The Sellers shall, except as limited below, control audits, examinations or other proceedings (each, a "Tax Proceeding") with respect to Tax Returns of the Company or its Subsidiaries for Tax periods ending on or before the Closing Date (whether or not such Tax Returns are filed before or after the Closing Date), but only to the extent that any adjustment resulting from such Tax Proceeding would give rise to an indemnification obligation of Sellers under Section 9.02. The Sellers shall promptly notify Buyer of the commencement of any such Tax Proceeding and shall allow Buyer and its counsel to participate in such Tax Proceedings at Buyer's sole cost and expense. However, nothing in this Section 11.03(d) will require Buyer, the Company or any Subsidiary to make any claim or election, or take any action, that would increase any Tax liability for which Buyer has no claim against Sellers under this Agreement (unless the Deductible precludes such a claim) or that otherwise would have, in Buyer's reasonable judgment, an adverse effect on Buyer, the Company or any Subsidiary in any taxable period ending after the Closing Date. (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Sellers shall have no obligation to indemnify Buyer for (i) any Taxes that result from the transactions described in Section 1.01(a) of this Agreement; (ii) any Losses arising out of or caused by breach by any Seller of representations, warranties or covenants set forth in this Agreement where such breach would not have occurred but for the occurrence of the transactions described in Section 1.01(a) of this Agreement; (iii) any Transfer Taxes that result from the transactions described in Section 1.01(a) of this Agreement; and (iv) any Taxes accrued, provided or otherwise reserved for on the Final Working Capital Statement. (f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Buyer shall indemnify Sellers for any incremental Taxes imposed on the Sellers that result from (i) the transactions described in Section 1.01(a) of this Agreement in excess of Taxes that would have been imposed on the Sellers had the transaction described in Section 1.01(a) not occurred and instead the sale of the Company been structured as a transaction described in Section 1.01(b) of this Agreement and (ii) the failure of the Company to withhold FICA and FUTA Taxes upon the exercise of ISOs pursuant to Section 1.02(b) immediately prior to the Closing. 11.04 Litigation Support. In the event and for so long as any party to this Agreement actively is contesting or defending against any action, suit, proceeding, hearing, investigation, charge, complaint, claim, or demand in connection with (i) any transaction contemplated under this Agreement or (ii) any fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act, or transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, each of the other parties will reasonably cooperate with him, her, or it and his, her, or its counsel in the contest or defense, make available their personnel at reasonable times
71 and on reasonable notice, and provide such testimony and access to their books and records as shall be necessary in connection with the contest or defense, all at the sole cost and expense of the contesting or defending Party (unless the contesting or defending Party is entitled to indemnification therefor under Article IX hereof). 11.05 Further Assurances. From time to time, as and when requested by any party hereto, any other party shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other actions, all at the sole cost and expense of the requesting party (unless the requesting party is entitled to indemnification therefor under Article IX of this Agreement), as the requesting party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to evidence and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 11.06 Confidentiality. Each Seller will treat and hold as such all of the Confidential Information, refrain from using any of the Confidential Information except in connection with this Agreement, and deliver promptly to Buyer or destroy, at the request and option of Buyer, all tangible embodiments (and all copies) of the Confidential Information which are in his, her, or its possession. In the event that any Seller is requested or required pursuant to oral or written question or request for information or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand, or similar process to disclose any Confidential Information, that Seller will notify Buyer promptly of the request or requirement so that Buyer may seek an appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the provisions of this Section 11.06. If any Seller is, on the advice of counsel, compelled by law to disclose any Confidential Information, that Seller may disclose the Confidential Information; provided, however, that the disclosing Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of such disclosure. "Confidential Information" shall mean all of the information in the possession of such Seller that is currently treated by the Company or its Subsidiaries as confidential, but does not include information which (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by a Seller in breach of this Agreement, (ii) was or is independently developed by a Seller without the use or knowledge of information provided by or on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or (iii) is or becomes available to a Seller on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Company or its Subsidiaries, provided that such source is not known to such Seller to be bound by a confidentiality or other agreement restricting disclosure or use of such information. Buyer acknowledges that (1) certain Sellers make investments from time to time in businesses in the for-profit education industry, (2) that representatives of such Sellers have in the past participated, and will in the future participate, in the management of such businesses and (3) that the use of general knowledge regarding such industry acquired by Sellers or their representatives before or during the Sellers' ownership of the Company shall not violate this Section 11.06.

Buyer shall, and Buyer shall cause the Company to promptly execute and deliver all such documents and take all such actions in connection with the Seller Retained Actions as the Stockholder Representatives shall reasonably request. (d) Buyer, on the one hand, and the Stockholder Representatives (on behalf of the Sellers), on the other hand, shall each designate contact persons, each reasonably acceptable to the other party, as a primary point for communication between the parties and their representatives regarding the Seller Retained Actions.
