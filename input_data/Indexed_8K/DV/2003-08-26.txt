Reports Fiscal 2003 Fourth-Quarter, Year-End Results and Summer Term Enrollment OAKBROOK TERRACE, Ill., August 19, 2003 -- DeVry Inc. (NYSE: DV), an international higher education company, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year-end of fiscal 2003, and student enrollment for the summer term. Financial Results - ----------------- Revenues for the full year ended June 30, 2003, were $679.6 million, an increase of 4.9 percent compared with $648.1 million in the prior year. Fourth quarter revenues were $174.4 million, an increase of 7.6 percent compared with $162.0 million in the same quarter last year. Net income for the year was $61.1 million or $0.87 per share (diluted), a decline of 8.8 percent compared with $67.1 million or $0.95 per share (diluted) for fiscal year 2002. Full year net income includes certain non-recurring income tax benefits totaling $8.1 million or approximately $0.12 per share recognized in the second quarter. Net income for the fourth quarter was $12.1 million, or $0.17 per share, down 25.0 percent compared with $16.2 million, or $0.23 per share in the year ago period. Included in fourth quarter financial results are pretax charges of approximately $2.6 million related to workforce reductions in both eastern Canada and the United States. Dennis J. Keller, chairman and co-chief executive officer, said, "Earnings in the fourth quarter were also affected by previous shortfalls in undergraduate campus-based enrollment at DeVry University and, especially, the underperformance of our Canadian operations. We continued to adjust our cost base to reflect the smaller student population and as a result incurred staff severance expenses during the period."
4 -more- During the fourth quarter, DeVry completed the acquisition of Ross University, which provides Doctor of Medicine and Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree programs. Ronald L. Taylor, president and co-chief executive officer, said, "We are extremely pleased with the integration of Ross University into DeVry and believe that the opportunities in this market segment are very attractive. We particularly look forward to exploring the synergies between Ross, DeVry University and Becker Conviser Professional Review." Summer Enrollment - ----------------- DeVry University announced today that new undergraduate student enrollment for the 2003 summer term increased by 2.5 percent to 10,607, compared with 10,345 in the previous year. This increase compares to a 3.6 percent decline in new students in the 2003 spring term. New undergraduate students at the company's U.S. campuses increased 4.5 percent to 10,252 compared with 9,806 in the prior year. The total number of enrolled undergraduate students was 41,075, a decline of 5.2 percent compared with 43,342 a year ago. This compares to a decline of 6.0 percent in total enrollments for the 2003 spring term. At DeVry University's Keller Graduate School of Management, the number of coursetakers for the 2003 July term increased 15.5 percent to 9,483 compared with 8,209 in the June term last year. The total number of students enrolled at Ross University for the term beginning in May was 2,852 compared to 2,552 last year, an increase of 11.8 percent. "We are pleased to see strong student interest in our business degree programs, both at DeVry University Centers and online, and the beginnings of renewed interest in technology programs. In addition, solid enrollment results in the May term at Ross University reflect improved marketing efforts, which capitalize on its strong brand equity," Taylor said. "In light of the growing demand for both medical doctors and veterinarians, we plan to expand capacity at these campuses to meet this market need." In fiscal 2003, new DeVry University Centers were opened in Plano, Texas; Valley Forge, Pa.; and the Cobb-Galleria area of Atlanta. New campuses were opened in Philadelphia; Miramar, Fla.; and Denver. A new center offering graduate degree programs opened in Manhattan in April. The Company expects to open six to eight new DeVry University Centers in fiscal 2004 in addition to its Houston campus, which will open in November.
