4 Contacts: For Immediate Release Joan Bates Investor Relations 630-574-1949 Jonelle Niffenegger Media Relations 630-706-3212 DeVry Inc. Reports Enrollment Growth for 2003 Fall Term at DeVry University and Ross University OAKBROOK TERRACE, Ill., (December 4, 2003) DeVry Inc. (NYSE: DV), an international higher education company, today reported enrollment for the 2003 fall term. At DeVry University, new undergraduate student enrollment for the 2003 fall term increased 6.2 percent to 10,633, compared with 10,011 in the previous year. Total undergraduate student enrollment in the 2003 fall term was 43,001, a decrease of 2.5 percent, compared to 44,123 for the 2002 fall term. These results exclude enrollments at DeVry's Toronto location, which did not enroll new students pursuant to the company's agreement with RCC College of Technology. Fall 2003 enrollments represent an improvement from both the 2.5 percent increase in new student enrollment and the 5.2 percent decline in total student enrollments in the 2003 summer term. Including Toronto, new undergraduate student enrollment for the 2003 fall term of 10,633 increased by 3.2 percent from 10,303 in the prior year. Total undergraduate student enrollment in the 2003 fall term was 43,383, including Toronto, a decrease of 4.0 percent, compared to 45,200 for the 2002 fall term. For fiscal 2004, Keller Graduate School of Management (KGSM) adopted the DeVry University academic calendar, which consists of six 8-week terms, as opposed to five 10-week terms in the prior KGSM calendar. For the 2003 November term, the number of coursetakers at KGSM increased 4.8 percent to 11,274 compared with 10,761 in the November term last year. We expect the total KGSM coursetaker enrollment growth in the six terms of fiscal year 2004 to exceed the 21 percent year-to-year growth posted in fiscal year 2003. The total number of online coursetakers for the 2003 fall term more than doubled to 9,077 compared with 3,824 in the same term a year ago.
5 The total number of students enrolled at Ross University for the 2003 September term was 3,174 compared to 2,713 last year, an increase of 17.0 percent. This compares to an 11.8 percent increase in the 2003 May term. "We continue to gain momentum and show positive new student enrollment results due to our improved advertising and outreach programs, strong interest in our online degree programs, and the addition of our new Houston campus and new DeVry University Centers," said Ronald L. Taylor, president and co-chief executive officer of DeVry Inc. "In addition, we believe that the ability to supplement the campus experience with the flexibility of taking online courses allows DeVry to efficiently and effectively meet the needs of its diverse student population." "The acquisition and integration of Ross University has been very successful and has exceeded our performance expectations," said Dennis J. Keller, DeVry's chairman and co-chief executive officer. "We look forward to continued growth as Ross helps to meet the strong demand for physicians and veterinarians in the United States."
