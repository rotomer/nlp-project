Exhibit 99.1 DeVry Inc. Reports Fiscal 2004 Third Quarter Results, Spring Term Enrollment at DeVry University and Ross University OAKBROOK TERRACE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 20, 2004--DeVry Inc. (NYSE: DV), an international higher-education company, today reported financial results for the third quarter and nine months of fiscal year 2004 ended March 31, 2004. DeVry Inc. also announced spring term student enrollments at DeVry University and Ross University. Revenues for the quarter were $196.8 million, a 16.2 percent increase compared with $169.4 million for the same period one year ago. Revenues for the nine-month period ended March 31, 2004 were $584.8 million versus $505.2 million for the same period last year, an increase of 15.8 percent. Net income for the quarter totaled $16.3 million, or $0.23 per share, compared with $14.9 million, or $0.21 per share, for the same period last year. For the first nine months of fiscal 2004, net income was $42.4 million, or $0.60 per share, compared with $49.0 million, or $0.70 per share, for the previous year, which included $8.2 million or $0.12 per share of certain non-recurring income tax benefits. "During the third quarter, Becker Professional Review experienced lower enrollment and reduced revenues and operating profits in its certified public accountant exam preparation courses," said Dennis J. Keller, chairman and co-chief executive officer of DeVry Inc. The decline in operating earnings from Becker operations in the third quarter of 2004 compared to the third quarter of 2003 was approximately $0.04 per share. "Because of a change in the CPA exam schedule and a new computer-based test format, many students elected to defer their preparatory coursework until after the new exam was implemented. Becker has enhanced its product to adapt to the new exam and we expect to benefit in the future as candidates take advantage of a more flexible test timetable," Mr. Keller added. At DeVry University, new undergraduate student enrollment for the 2004 spring term increased 6.1 percent to 8,366, compared with 7,885 in the previous year. Total undergraduate student enrollment in the 2004 spring term was 40,870, a decline of 3.1 percent, compared to 42,192 for the 2003 spring term. These results exclude enrollments at DeVry's Toronto location, which last enrolled new students in July 2003. During fiscal 2004, Keller Graduate School of Management (KGSM) aligned its academic calendar with that of DeVry University. Graduate coursework is now completed in six 8-week terms as opposed to five 10-week terms in the prior KGSM calendar. For the March 2004 term, the number of coursetakers at KGSM increased 3.5 percent to 11,812 compared with 11,413 in the April term last year. The fiscal year 2004 annual coursetaker enrollment at KGSM is expected to increase by more than 20 percent from the previous year. The total number of online undergraduate and graduate coursetakers for the 2004 spring term increased 110.4 percent to 11,032 compared with 5,244 in the same term a year ago. The total number of students enrolled at Ross University for the 2004 January term was 3,229 compared to 2,906 in the same period last year, an increase of 11.1 percent. Ross University experiences seasonal enrollment patterns similar to DeVry University, with slower growth in the spring term than in other terms. During the quarter, DeVry announced the opening of a DeVry University Center (DVUC) in Gurnee, Illinois, giving the university its 11th Chicago area location. Also, DeVry recently announced the opening of a Sacramento, California, Level II regional facility and its third location in the greater Philadelphia area. Effective with the opening of these centers in July 2004, DeVry University will operate 69 physical locations across North America, which includes 24 campuses and 45 centers.
