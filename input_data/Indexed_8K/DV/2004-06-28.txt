John Skubiak Named President, DeVry University DeVry Inc. (NYSE:DV), an international higher-education company, today announced the appointment of Daniel Hamburger as its president and chief operating officer, effective July 1, 2004. Hamburger has served as executive vice president of the company since 2002. Ronald L. Taylor will become the company's chief executive officer. Taylor currently serves as co-CEO with Dennis J. Keller, who will remain chairman of the board of directors. As part of this transition, O. John Skubiak, executive vice president of the company, will also assume the title of president of DeVry University. "Having successfully directed the growth of DeVry University Online and Becker Professional Review, Daniel is fully prepared for a significant expansion of his responsibilities," stated Ronald L. Taylor. "In his new role, he will assume responsibility for managing our operations and implementing plans for expansion." Regarding the appointment of Skubiak as president of DeVry University, Taylor added, "John Skubiak has directed the operations of DeVry University for the past two years. In addition, he has held senior management positions with Keller Graduate School of Management and DeVry Institutes for over 25 years. His record of performance in marketing, student recruitment and school operations is outstanding." Hamburger has extensive executive leadership experience in both high growth startups and large organizations with successful Internet and technology-based ventures. He was previously chairman and chief executive officer of Indeliq, a developer of simulation-based training software, which merged with Accenture Learning in 2002. From 1998 to 2000, Hamburger was president of W.W. Grainger's Internet Commerce Division. Hamburger commented, "DeVry today is an operationally strong, technologically advanced, and financially sound industry leader in post-secondary education, but we see opportunities for improvement. We will work diligently to improve our operating efficiencies, accelerate top-line growth, expand margins and positively impact the returns we generate for our shareholders." Ronald L. Taylor has served as the company's president and co-CEO since November 2002, as president and chief operating officer since 1980 and as a director since 1973.

"We believe DeVry is about to begin an exciting period in its business cycle, with the company well positioned to achieve long-term growth. These management changes will allow the company to focus on increasing undergraduate enrollment, expanding the DeVry University Center model and maintaining its leadership position in high quality post-secondary education," added Keller.
