Exhibit 99.1 DeVry Inc. Reports Fiscal 2004 Fourth-Quarter, Year-End Results and Summer Term Enrollment OAKBROOK TERRACE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 18, 2004--DeVry Inc. (NYSE:DV), an international higher education company, today reported financial results for the fiscal 2004 fourth quarter and year-end, and student enrollment for the 2004 summer term. Financial and Operating Results Fiscal 2004 fourth quarter revenues were $200.0 million, an increase of 14.7 percent compared with $174.4 million for the same period one year ago. Net income for the fourth quarter was $15.7 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, up 29.2 percent compared with $12.1 million, or $0.17 per share for the same period last year, which included pretax charges of approximately $2.6 million related to workforce reductions in both eastern Canada and the United States. Revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004, were $784.9 million, an increase of 15.5 percent compared with $679.6 million in fiscal 2003. Net income for the year was $58.1 million or $0.82 per diluted share, a decline of 5.0 percent compared with $61.1 million or $0.87 per share in fiscal 2003, which included certain non-recurring income tax benefits totaling $8.1 million or approximately $0.12 per share. DeVry also said that as a result of a change in the CPA exam schedule, it has realigned Becker Professional Review's fiscal calendar to that of DeVry Inc. Although the company previously indicated that this change would be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004, the appropriate accounting treatment is to recognize the change in the first quarter of fiscal year 2005. The realignment is expected to add $0.02 to earnings for the year. "The demand for entry-level accountants is reported to be the highest it has been in many years," said Ronald Taylor, chief executive officer of DeVry Inc. "We see current enrollment for Becker's CPA review courses recovering nicely and expect future Becker enrollment to reflect the increased demand for accountants." "As of July 1, we significantly strengthened our management team with the appointment of Daniel Hamburger as president and chief operating officer and John Skubiak as president of DeVry University, in addition to the previous hiring of Paul Eppen as chief marketing officer," commented Taylor. "These changes provide an immediate boost to our management team and give us the management resources necessary to achieve our strategic goals." In fiscal 2004, new DeVry University Centers (DVUCs) were opened in Indianapolis, Las Vegas, Philadelphia's Center City, Pittsburgh, Portland, Sacramento, Seven Hills (Cleveland), Ohio, and Gurnee, Ill. Also during the fourth quarter, construction of a new facility in northern Colorado Springs was announced, and a new Fort Worth, Texas location is scheduled to begin classes in September 2004. Most recently, the company announced its plans to open a new center in Broward County, Florida. DeVry currently operates 71 locations, comprising 23 DeVry University campuses and 48 DVUCs, and offers undergraduate and graduate degree programs online. During the fourth quarter, DeVry University announced two new online concentrations within its business administration bachelor degree program. Also during the quarter, Michigan State University and The Ohio State University became clinical training affiliates of Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine. Summer Enrollment DeVry University announced today that new undergraduate student enrollment for the 2004 summer term increased by 0.9 percent to 10,522, compared with 10,431 in the previous year. Total undergraduate student enrollment in the 2004 summer term was 38,036, a decline of 5.8 percent, compared to 40,398 for the 2003 summer term. These results exclude enrollments at DeVry's Toronto location, which last enrolled new students in July 2003. At DeVry University's Keller Graduate School of Management (KGSM), the number of coursetakers for the 2004 July term increased 8.4 percent to 10,276 compared with 9,483 in the July term last year. During fiscal 2004, KGSM aligned its academic calendar with that of DeVry University. The annual schedule for graduate coursework is now six eight-week terms as opposed to five 10-week terms in the prior KGSM calendar. The total number of online undergraduate and graduate coursetakers for the 2004 summer term increased 92.8 percent to 12,590 compared with 6,531 in the same term a year ago. The total number of students enrolled at Ross University for the 2004 May term was 3,310 compared to 2,852 in the same period last year, an increase of 16.1 percent. "There is strong interest in our business and healthcare programs, and significant growth at the graduate school, at the DVUCs, online and at Ross University; however, undergraduate technology enrollments continue to be weak," stated Taylor. "We are adopting a comprehensive program to aggressively address this issue and expect to see improvements in the area of recruiting. We are, of course, subject to ongoing general market conditions in the technology area." Daniel Hamburger, president and chief operating officer, commented, "Modifications have been implemented to refocus our marketing and sales efforts on specific audiences, which include recent high school graduates, adult learners, technology and business students and those interested in our online programs. These changes include a revamped high school outreach program and advertisements specifically oriented toward high school students." "Though weak technology enrollments will continue to affect performance in the near term, we are confident that with the plan we have in place, we will be successful in attracting an increasing number of full-time students looking for a high-quality education and an accelerated entry into a subsequent career," concluded Hamburger.
