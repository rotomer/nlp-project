Exhibit 99.1 DeVry Inc. Reports Fiscal 2005 First Quarter Results OAKBROOK TERRACE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 20, 2004--DeVry Inc. (NYSE:DV), an international higher education company, today reported financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2005 ended September 30, 2004. Financial and Operating Results Revenues for the first quarter were $188.4 million, compared with $189.2 million for the same quarter one year ago. Net income for the quarter totaled $4.3 million, or $0.06 per fully diluted share, compared with $10.5 million, or $0.15 per fully diluted share, for the same period last year. First quarter results include $0.02 in earnings per share from a change in accounting reflecting the realignment of Becker Professional Review's previous reporting year-end to that of the DeVry Inc. year-end. The decrease in revenue in the first quarter is attributable to the previously reported decrease in the total number of undergraduate students enrolled in technology programs at DeVry University in the 2004 summer term. In addition to the effects of continued weak technology enrollments, DeVry's earnings were negatively affected by a greater proportion of part-time students enrolled in its undergraduate courses. Also affecting results in the first quarter was expense incurred in advance of revenue to support the growth of online programs and DeVry University Centers (DVUCs). These expenses include new marketing programs; increased student services staff and additional information systems infrastructure. "While we are extremely dissatisfied with results this quarter, we do not expect this depressed level of earnings performance to continue throughout fiscal 2005," said Ronald L. Taylor, chief executive officer of DeVry Inc. "We remain committed to the previously announced initiatives which we believe will lead to increased full-time undergraduate enrollments and continued strong momentum with adult learners." During the first quarter, the company opened new DVUCs in Florida, Georgia, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Texas. In addition, the company began offering new online concentrations in security management and hospitality management and plans to offer its associate degree program in health information technology online early next year. Also, during the quarter, DeVry University expanded its biomedical technology programs to additional sites; bringing the total number of locations where one or more of these programs is offered to 18.
