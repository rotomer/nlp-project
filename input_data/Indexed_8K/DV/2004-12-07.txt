Exhibit 99.1 DeVry Inc. Announces Fall Enrollments at DeVry University and Ross University OAKBROOK TERRACE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 7, 2004--DeVry Inc. (NYSE:DV), an international higher-education company, today reported enrollment at DeVry University for the 2004 fall term and at Ross University for the fall term that began in September. New undergraduate student enrollment for the 2004 fall term was 10,018, compared with 10,633 in the previous year, a decrease of 5.8 percent. Total undergraduate student enrollment in the 2004 fall term was 39,450, a decline of 8.3 percent, compared to 43,001 for the 2003 fall term. At DeVry University's Keller Graduate School of Management (KGSM), the number of coursetakers for the 2004 November term increased 9.7 percent to 12,368 compared with 11,274 in the November term last year. The total number of online undergraduate and graduate coursetakers for the 2004 fall term increased almost 79 percent to 16,236 compared with 9,077 in the same term a year ago. The total number of students enrolled at Ross University for the 2004 September term was 3,353 compared to 3,174 in the same period last year, an increase of 5.6 percent. "Enrollment in online courses and at Keller Graduate School of Management continued to show solid growth during the 2004 fall term as our business programs remain in high demand and an increasing number of undergraduate students took advantage of DeVry's high-quality online offerings," said Ronald Taylor, chief executive officer of DeVry Inc. "Lower full-time undergraduate enrollment at DeVry University will remain the principal factor impacting the company's financial performance for the remainder of fiscal 2005." Daniel Hamburger, president and chief operating officer, commented, "We have already made good progress in identifying the factors affecting undergraduate enrollment and have put in place a turnaround plan. This plan includes addressing our marketing deficiencies, regaining and improving recruiting productivity, making program and delivery options more competitive, and improving operational effectiveness. The management team is optimistic that these actions will positively influence undergraduate enrollments beginning with the 2005 summer class," concluded Hamburger. The company also said it will continue with its plan to build the infrastructure necessary to support anticipated long-term growth at Ross University. Taylor added, "Ross enrollments slowed during the September term as we implemented a more controlled and measured expansion plan at these facilities. We are projecting flat enrollment for Ross in the near term as we implement measures to assure that Ross continues to produce high quality graduates." In addition, Becker Professional Review recently realigned its fiscal calendar to match the calendar of DeVry Inc. Compared to the previous year, the company expects lower fiscal 2005 second quarter results at Becker due to the inconsistency of the comparable periods and a change in the flow of course enrollments for CPA candidates. The company also stated that fiscal 2005 third quarter results are expected to be higher than the prior year and believes that on an annual basis, overall results in 2005 will exceed results in 2004.
