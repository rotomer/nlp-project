Exhibit 99.1 DeVry Inc. Reports Fiscal 2005 Second Quarter Results OAKBROOK TERRACE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 27, 2005--DeVry Inc. (NYSE: DV), an international higher education company, today reported financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 ended December 31, 2004. Revenues for the second quarter were $194.5 million, compared with $198.8 million for the same quarter one year ago. Revenues for the six-month period ended December 31, 2004, were $382.9 million compared to $388.0 million last year. Net income for the quarter totaled $5.9 million, or $0.08 per fully diluted share, compared with $15.6 million, or $0.22 per fully diluted share, for the same period last year. For the first six months of fiscal 2005, net income was $10.2 million, or $0.14 per share, compared with $26.1 million, or $0.37 per share for the first half of fiscal 2004. "Earnings results in the second quarter reflect both reduced full-time campus enrollments during the 2004 fall term and increasing levels of part-time students at DeVry University Online and at DeVry University Centers," said Ronald L. Taylor, chief executive officer of DeVry Inc. In December 2004, the company reported that for the 2004 fall term, new undergraduate student enrollment at DeVry University declined 5.8 percent and total undergraduate student enrollment declined 8.3 percent from the previous year. Second quarter results were also affected by a $2.2 million pre-tax accrual for a work force reduction that included a voluntary separation plan offered to employees with more than 20 years of service. As of the end of the second quarter, 39 employees had accepted the separation plan and an additional 45 employees accepted the plan in January 2005. In addition, in January 2005, an involuntary reduction in force was implemented which eliminated approximately 75 currently filled positions and 100 open positions. The costs associated with the January 2005 acceptances of the voluntary separation plan and the involuntary reduction in force will be recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2005. The company believes that at least $10.5 million in annual salary and benefit costs will be eliminated by these actions. Because of the costs associated with implementing these work force reductions, they are not expected to have a positive financial impact in this fiscal year but will reduce the cost of operations in fiscal 2006 and beyond. 4
"As we continue to execute our plan to improve products and services and address marketing and recruitment deficiencies, we have begun to see early indications of favorable response to our efforts for the 2005 spring term," said Daniel Hamburger, DeVry's president and chief operating officer. "Moreover, we believe that these activities will positively influence undergraduate enrollments in the 2006 fiscal year." During the second quarter, DeVry announced the opening of a new DeVry University Center in San Antonio, Texas, with plans to begin offering undergraduate and graduate degree programs in July 2005. DeVry University currently operates 72 locations in North America. Also during the quarter, the company continued to enhance its management team with the addition of Dr. Thomas Shepherd as Ross University president, and Steve Riehs as vice president and general manager of online operations at DeVry Inc. Jim Ritchey has been appointed interim chief information officer, replacing Bruno LaCaria, who retired. Most recently, John Holbrook rejoined DeVry University as vice president of new student recruitment.
