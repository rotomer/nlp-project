Exhibit 99.1 DeVry Inc. Reports Fiscal 2005 Third Quarter Results, Spring Enrollment at DeVry University and Ross University OAKBROOK TERRACE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 21, 2005--DeVry Inc. -- (NYSE:DV), an international higher-education company, today reported financial results for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2005 ended March 31, 2005. DeVry Inc. also announced spring enrollments at DeVry University and Ross University. Revenues for the third quarter were $201.9 million, compared with $196.8 million for the same quarter one year ago. For the nine-month period ended March 31, 2005, revenues of $584.8 million were identical to the revenues reported for the same period last year. Net income for the quarter totaled $11.9 million, or $0.17 per fully diluted share, compared with $16.3 million, or $0.23 per fully diluted share, for the same period last year. For the first nine months of fiscal 2005, net income was $22.1 million, or $0.31 per share, compared with $42.4 million, or $0.60 per share for the first nine months of fiscal 2004. "Our third quarter financial results reflect lower total DeVry University enrollments caused by recruiting underperformance in previous terms and a greater proportion of part-time adult students, as enrollments at DeVry University Centers (DVUCs) and online have grown in recent terms," said Ronald L. Taylor, chief executive officer of DeVry Inc. "Our operating plan continues to focus on new student enrollments, while generating additional operating efficiencies to reduce expenses and improve financial results." Third quarter results were negatively affected by a $2.9 million pre-tax charge for previously announced workforce reductions. As a result of these workforce reductions, savings in fiscal 2006 are estimated at more than $10.5 million. During the fourth quarter, the company announced an additional voluntary workforce reduction program. The company expects charges in the fourth quarter related to this program to approximate the charges recorded in the third quarter. At DeVry University, new undergraduate student enrollment in spring 2005 increased 6.4 percent to 8,902 students, compared to 8,366 in spring 2004. Total student enrollment in spring 2005 declined 6.8 percent to 38,083 students, compared to 40,870 students in the previous year as a result of previous enrollment shortfalls. For the March 2005 session, the number of coursetakers at Keller Graduate School of Management increased 5.8 percent to 12,496 from 11,812 coursetakers in March 2004. In the January 2005 session, coursetakers also increased 5.8 percent to 12,597 coursetakers compared to 11,909 in the prior year. The total number of online undergraduate and graduate coursetakers in spring 2005 increased 79.1 percent to 19,759, compared to 11,032 in the same term a year ago. The total number of students enrolled at Ross University for the January 2005 term declined 3.3 percent to 3,122, compared to 3,229 last year as a result of higher standards in Ross University's admission criteria and academic progress requirements. The company expects the revised admission and academic policies to have a modest negative impact on student enrollment in the May 2005 class. "Improved undergraduate new student enrollment was fueled by the continued demand for our DVUC and online delivery modes," said Daniel Hamburger, DeVry's president and chief operating officer. "We expect continued strength in our online operations and at our DVUCs into the summer term, but the outcomes of our initiatives to improve full-time day enrollments at the large campus locations are still unclear. We expect some variability in enrollments as we continue to refine our marketing initiatives." During the third quarter DeVry University announced plans to open a second center in the Twin Cities area and expects to begin offering undergraduate and graduate degree programs in July 2005, and announced a plan to open a new center in San Antonio in July 2005, pending necessary approvals. DeVry University currently operates 74 locations in North America. Also during the third quarter, DeVry completed the acquisition of Deaconess College of Nursing for approximately $5.3 million in cash. Deaconess offers associate and bachelor's degree programs in nursing and a bachelor's degree completion program designed for registered nurses who have previously completed an associate degree program. Located in St. Louis, Missouri, the school currently enrolls approximately 450 students.
