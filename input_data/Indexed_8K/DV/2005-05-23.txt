Exhibit 99.1 DeVry Inc. Provides Update on Workforce Reduction Program OAKBROOK TERRACE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 19, 2005--DeVry Inc. (NYSE:DV), an international higher education company, today announced that on May 18, 2005, DeVry University implemented a reduction in force of full-time and part-time faculty positions at its campuses throughout North America. In order to improve operational effectiveness, DeVry University previously implemented two Voluntary Separation Plans (VSP) during the current fiscal year. While these voluntary plans have helped to align resources with needs, they have not been sufficient to totally offset enrollment declines at DeVry University's campuses. The most recent reductions in force affected 134 people following a recently completed evaluation of DeVry's campus-based instructional needs for the 2006 fiscal year. The company estimates that at least $6 million in annual salary and benefit costs will be eliminated by these actions, but due to severance costs associated with implementing these workforce reductions, savings will not positively impact financial results until fiscal 2006 and beyond. "We highly value the contributions of all of our instructors, and do not make these decisions without serious consideration," said Ronald L. Taylor, DeVry's chief executive officer. "A major focus of our turnaround plan is to increase operational effectiveness, and these actions will help DeVry University better align its workforce resources with the changes in demand we are experiencing for more part-time, online, and business-focused programs." DeVry Inc. (NYSE: DV) is the holding company for DeVry University, Ross University, Deaconess College of Nursing and Becker Professional Review. DeVry University, which includes Keller Graduate School of Management, offers associate, bachelor's and master's degree programs in technology, business and management.
