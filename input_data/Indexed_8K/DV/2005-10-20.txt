Exhibit 99.1 DeVry Inc. Reports Fiscal 2006 First-Quarter Results, September Enrollment at Ross University and Keller Graduate School of Management; First Quarter Results Include Stock Option Expense OAKBROOK TERRACE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 20, 2005--DeVry Inc. (NYSE:DV), an international higher education company, today reported financial results for the fiscal 2006 first quarter and September 2005 enrollment at Ross University and Keller Graduate School of Management (KGSM). Revenues for the first quarter were $196.8 million, compared with $188.4 million for the same quarter one year ago. Net income for the quarter totaled $4.7 million, or $0.07 per fully diluted share, which includes the expense of share-based payments, compared with $2.1 million, or $0.03 per fully diluted share on a restated basis, for the same period last year. Effective with the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, "Share-Based Payment," using the modified retrospective approach. Accordingly, the fiscal 2006 and restated 2005 first quarters include recognition of stock option expense. The fiscal 2006 first quarter after-tax effect of stock option expense is approximately $1.0 million. For the restated fiscal 2005 first quarter, the effect is approximately $2.2 million after-tax. "We are pleased to report an increase in both revenue and earnings over the prior year, and we expect improvement throughout fiscal 2006," said Ronald L. Taylor, DeVry's chief executive officer. "We are focused on solid execution of our growth plan." The number of new students enrolled at Ross University for the September 2005 term increased 40.6 percent to 575, compared to 409 in the 2004 September term. Total Ross students in the September term were 3,227, or 3.8 percent lower than the prior year. Last year, Ross University raised its admission criteria and increased its academic progress requirements, which negatively affected new student recruiting, student retention and total enrollments during fiscal 2005. For the September 2005 session, the total number of coursetakers at KGSM increased 5 percent to 12,732 compared to 12,129 in the prior year's session. Fall 2005 enrollment results for DeVry University and the November session at KGSM will be reported December 5. During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, enrollments at Becker Professional Review, which includes Becker CPA Review and Stalla Review for the CFA, increased over the prior year. The professional and training segment posted record revenue of approximately $12.3 million for the 2006 fiscal first quarter, compared to $10.7 million last year. "We are pleased with the progress we are making at Ross University and in each of our other operations," said Daniel Hamburger, DeVry's president and chief operating officer. "Actions taken in fiscal 2005 to improve marketing and recruiting processes and to reduce expenses appear to be having a favorable impact on fiscal 2006 results."
