Exhibit 99.1 DeVry Inc. Reports Fiscal 2006 Second-Quarter Results OAKBROOK TERRACE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 26, 2006--DeVry Inc. (NYSE:DV), an international higher education company, reported today financial results for the fiscal 2006 second quarter and the six-month period ended December 31, 2005. Revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 were $209.9 million, compared to $194.5 million for the same quarter one year ago. For the six-month period of fiscal 2006, revenues were $406.6 million compared to $382.9 million last year. Fiscal 2005 first half results include the effect of a $2.2 million pre-tax accrual for work force reductions and a $1.8 million net income adjustment for a change in accounting at Becker Professional Review. Net income for the quarter totaled $10.8 million, or $0.15 per fully diluted share, compared to $4.7 million, or $0.07 per fully diluted share, on a restated basis, for the same period last year. For the first half of fiscal 2006, net income was $15.6 million, or $0.22 per share, compared to $6.8 million, or $0.10 per share, on a restated basis, for the first half of fiscal 2005. Effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, "Share-Based Payment". Net income for all periods includes the expense of share-based payments. The after-tax effect of stock option expense for the fiscal 2006 second quarter is approximately $0.8 million and $1.2 million for the fiscal 2005 second quarter. "Revenues, earnings and operating margins in the second quarter improved significantly over last year, and we are happy that we are on course to produce improved financial results for the year," said Ronald L.
