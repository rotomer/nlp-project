Exhibit 99.1 DeVry Inc. Reports Fiscal 2006 Third-Quarter Results, Enrollment at DeVry University, Keller Graduate School of Management and Ross University; New Undergraduate Students Increased 16.4 Percent OAKBROOK TERRACE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 25, 2006--DeVry Inc. (NYSE:DV), an international higher education company, today reported financial results for the fiscal 2006 third quarter and the nine-month period ended March 31, 2006. DeVry Inc. also announced enrollments at DeVry University, Keller Graduate School of Management and Ross University. Revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 were $220.2 million, compared to $201.9 million for the same quarter one year ago. For the nine-month period of fiscal 2006, revenues were $626.9 million compared to $584.8 million last year. Net income for the quarter totaled $15.7 million, or $0.22 per fully diluted share, compared to $10.9 million, or $0.15 per fully diluted share, on a restated basis, for the same period last year. For the nine months of fiscal 2006, net income was $31.2 million, or $0.44 per share, compared to $17.7 million, or $0.25 per share, on a restated basis, for the first nine months of fiscal 2005. Net income for 2005 has been restated to include the expense of share-based payments in accordance with new accounting requirements (FAS123R). The after-tax effect of stock option expense for the fiscal 2006 third quarter was approximately $0.8 million and $1.1 million for the fiscal 2005 third quarter. "Our financial and enrollment results in the third quarter are positive signs that the company is effectively executing its strategic plan," said Ronald L. Taylor, DeVry's chief executive officer. "The technology sector is continuing to recover, and we are encouraged by the growth experienced across all of our operations. Although future enrollment periods at DeVry University may not experience the same high levels of growth in new students, we are working to continue the upward momentum we've created during the last several class starts." At DeVry University, new undergraduate student enrollment in spring 2006 increased 16.4 percent to 10,359 students, compared to 8,902 in spring 2005. Total undergraduate student enrollment in spring 2006 increased 1.2 percent to 38,523 students, compared to 38,083 students in the previous year. For the January 2006 session, the number of graduate coursetakers at Keller Graduate School of Management increased 9.4 percent to 13,776, compared to 12,597 coursetakers in January 2005. In the March 2006 session, graduate coursetakers increased 12.3 percent to 14,029 from 12,496 in the prior year. The total number of online undergraduate and graduate coursetakers in spring 2006 increased 46.3 percent to 28,912, compared to 19,759 last year. At Ross University, new students increased 67.5 percent to 387 in the January term, compared to 231 in the same term last year. Total students increased 4.5 percent to 3,264, compared to 3,122 last year. "In spring 2006, DeVry University experienced a year-over-year increase in total undergraduate students for the first time since spring 2002," said Daniel Hamburger, DeVry's president and chief operating officer. "Additionally, new students in technology programs increased 37.7 percent over the prior year, and new student campus enrollment increased approximately 11 percent. While we are rebuilding from a smaller enrollment base than in prior years, these results are indicative of better integration of marketing and recruiting and the introduction of new degree programs at both the associate and baccalaureate levels."
