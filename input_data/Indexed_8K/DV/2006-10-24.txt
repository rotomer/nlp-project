Exhibit 99.1 DeVry Inc. Announces Fiscal 2007 First-Quarter Results, September Enrollment at Ross University and Keller Graduate School of Management OAKBROOK TERRACE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 24, 2006--DeVry Inc. (NYSE: DV), an international higher education company, reported financial results for the fiscal 2007 first quarter and September 2006 enrollment at Ross University and Keller Graduate School of Management. Revenues in the first quarter increased 12.1 percent to $220.7 million, compared with $196.8 million for the same quarter one year ago. Net income for the first quarter was $20.9 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, compared to $4.7 million, or $0.07 per diluted share last year. Net income in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 includes a gain on the sale of a DeVry University facility located in West Hills, Calif., of $11.8 million, net of tax, or $0.16 per share. "Effective management of DeVry's diverse portfolio of high-quality program offerings allowed the company to deliver solid results in the first quarter, while keeping the focus on long-term growth and profitability," said Ronald L. Taylor, DeVry's chief executive officer. "We believe we're on track to continue this progress in fiscal 2007 and beyond." For the September 2006 session, the total number of coursetakers at Keller Graduate School of Management (KGSM) increased 10.5 percent to 14,069 coursetakers compared to 12,732 coursetakers in the prior year's session. Fall 2006 enrollment results for DeVry University and the November session at KGSM will be reported December 7. The number of new students enrolled at Ross University for the September 2006 term was 576, compared to 575 in the previous year. In the September 2005 term, new students grew 40.6 percent. The total number of students enrolled at Ross during the same period increased 15.4 percent to 3,724, compared to 3,227 last year. Ross University is adding faculty, classrooms, laboratories and student housing to satisfy increasing student demand. During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, Becker Professional Review, which includes Becker CPA Review and Stalla Review for the CFA, posted a revenue increase of 32.6 percent over last year's first quarter. "While overall company performance in the quarter was strong, our results were affected by marketing and recruiting investments that we believe will yield better long-term enrollment results at DeVry University," said Daniel Hamburger, DeVry's president and chief operating officer. "Our priorities remain clear - to grow our enrollments, improve the utilization of our assets, and continue to deliver high-quality programs to meet the needs of our students."
