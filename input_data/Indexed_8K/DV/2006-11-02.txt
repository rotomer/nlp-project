The paragraph related to Ross University enrollment in the October 24, 2006 press release should have read as follows: The number of new students enrolled at Ross University for the September 2006 term was 628, compared to 575 in the previous year. In the September 2005 term, new students grew 40.6 percent. The total number of students enrolled at Ross during the same period increased 15.4 percent to 3,724, compared to 3,227 last year. Ross University is adding faculty, classrooms, laboratories and student housing to satisfy increasing student demand.
