Exhibit 99.1 DeVry Inc. Adopts Dividend Policy and Stock Repurchase Program OAKBROOK TERRACE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 15, 2006--DeVry Inc. (NYSE: DV), an international higher education company, announced today that its board of directors had adopted a dividend policy, declared its first dividend and approved a stock repurchase program. DeVry's board of directors declared today a dividend of $0.05 per share, payable on January 15, 2007, to common stockholders of record as of December 20, 2006. The Board stated its intent to declare dividends on a semi-annual basis, resulting in an annual dividend rate of $0.10 per share. The stock repurchase plan allows the company to buy back up to $35 million of its common stock within the next two years. The timing and amount of any repurchase will be determined by company management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. These repurchases may be made through the open market, including block purchases, or in privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. The buyback will be funded through available cash balances and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Shares of stock repurchased under the program will be held as treasury shares. "Initiation of a dividend program and adoption of the plan to repurchase company stock reflect DeVry's strong cash flow generation, long-term growth prospects and focus on enhancing shareholder value," said Daniel Hamburger, president and chief operating officer of DeVry Inc.
