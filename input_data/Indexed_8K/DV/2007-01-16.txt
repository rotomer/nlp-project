(b) Any such request shall be made to the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m., 15 Business Days prior to the date of the desired Credit Extension (or such other time or date as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent and, in the case of any such request pertaining to Letters of Credit, the L/C Issuer, in its or their sole discretion). In the case of any such request pertaining to Eurocurrency Rate Loans, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender thereof; and in the case of any such request pertaining to Letters of Credit, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the L/C Issuer thereof. Each Lender (in the case of any such request pertaining to Eurocurrency Rate Loans) or the L/C Issuer (in the case of a request pertaining to Letters of Credit) shall notify the Administrative Agent, not later than 11:00
 
-27-
a.m., five Business Days after receipt of such request whether or not it consents, in its sole discretion, to the making of Eurocurrency Rate Loans or the issuance of Letters of Credit, as the case may be, in such requested currency.
 
(c) Any failure by a Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, to respond to such request within the time period specified in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to be a refusal by such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, to permit Eurocurrency Rate Loans to be made or Letters of Credit to be issued in such requested currency. If the Administrative Agent and all the Lenders consent to making Eurocurrency Rate Loans in such requested currency, the Administrative Agent shall so notify DeVry and such currency shall thereupon be deemed for all purposes to be an Alternative Currency hereunder for purposes of any Revolving Borrowings of Eurocurrency Rate Loans; and if the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer consent to the issuance of Letters of Credit in such requested currency, the Administrative Agent shall so notify DeVry and such currency shall thereupon be deemed for all purposes to be an Alternative Currency hereunder for purposes of any Letter of Credit issuances. If the Administrative Agent shall fail to obtain consent to any request for an additional currency under this Section 1.8, the Administrative Agent shall promptly so notify DeVry.
 
1.9.
Change of Currency
.
iii)
Each obligation of the Borrowers to make a payment denominated in the national currency unit of any member state of the European Union that adopts the Euro as its lawful currency after the date hereof shall be redenominated into Euro at the time of such adoption (in accordance with the EMU Legislation). If, in relation to the currency of any such member state, the basis of accrual of interest expressed in this Agreement in respect of that currency shall be inconsistent with any convention or practice in the London interbank market for the basis of accrual of interest in respect of the Euro, such expressed basis shall be replaced by such convention or practice with effect from the date on which such member state adopts the Euro as its lawful currency; provided that if any Revolving Borrowing in the currency of such member state is outstanding immediately prior to such date, such replacement shall take effect, with respect to such Revolving Borrowing, at the end of the then current Interest Period.
 
(b) Each provision of this Agreement shall be subject to such reasonable changes of construction as the Administrative Agent may from time to time specify to be appropriate to reflect the adoption of the Euro by any member state of the European Union and any relevant market conventions or practices relating to the Euro.
 
(c) Each provision of this Agreement also shall be subject to such reasonable changes of construction as the Administrative Agent may from time to time specify to be appropriate to reflect a change in currency of any other country and any relevant market conventions or practices relating to the change in currency.
 
1.10.
Letter of Credit Amounts
.
 
Unless otherwise specified, all references herein to the amount of a Letter of Credit at any time shall be deemed to be the Dollar Equivalent of the stated amount of such Letter of Credit in effect at such time; provided, however, that with respect to any Letter of Credit that, by its terms or the terms of any Issuer Document related thereto, provides for one or more automatic
 
-28-
increases in the stated amount thereof, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be the Dollar Equivalent of the maximum stated amount of such Letter of Credit after giving effect to all such increases, whether or not such maximum stated amount is in effect at such time.
 
 
 
2.1.
Revolving Loans
.
 
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Lender severally agrees to make loans (each such loan, a Revolving Loan) to the Borrowers or either of them in Dollars or in one or more Alternative Currencies from time to time, on any Business Day during the Availability Period, in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the amount of such Lenders Commitment;
provided
,
however
, that after giving effect to any Borrowing:
 
(a) the Total Outstandings shall not exceed the Aggregate Commitments,
 
(b) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Revolving Loans of any Lender, plus such Lenders Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations, plus such Lenders Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount of all Swing Line Loans shall not exceed such Lenders Commitment;
 
(c) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of all Revolving Loans made to GEI plus the Outstanding Amount of the L/C Obligations of GEI shall not exceed the GEI Sublimit, and
 
(d) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of all Revolving Loans and L/C Obligations denominated in Alternative Currencies shall not exceed the Alternative Currency Sublimit.
 
Within the limits of each Lenders Commitment, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, each Borrower may borrow under this Section 2.1, prepay under Section 2.5, and reborrow under this Section 2.1. Revolving Loans may be Base Rate Loans or Eurocurrency Rate Loans, as further provided herein.
 
2.2.
Borrowings, Conversions and Continuations of Revolving Loans
.
 
(a) Each Revolving Borrowing, each conversion of Revolving Loans from one Type to the other, and each continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be made upon the applicable Borrowers irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, which may be given by telephone. Each such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 10:00 a.m.:
 
(i) three Business Days prior to the requested date of any Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Dollars or of any conversion of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Dollars to Base Rate Revolving Loans,
 
-29-
(ii) four Business Days (or five Business Days in the case of a Special Notice Currency) prior to the requested date of any Borrowing or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies, and
 
(iii) on the requested date of any Borrowing of Base Rate Revolving Loans.
 
Each telephonic notice by the applicable Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.2(a) must be confirmed promptly by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a written Revolving Loan Notice, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the applicable Borrower. Each Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Except as provided in Sections 2.3(c) and 2.4(c), each Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Revolving Loans shall be in a principal amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof. Each Revolving Loan Notice (whether telephonic or written) shall specify:
 
(i) whether the applicable Borrower is requesting a Borrowing, a conversion of Revolving Loans from one Type to the other, or a continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans,
 
(ii) the requested date of the Borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day),
 
(iii) the principal amount of Revolving Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued,
 
(iv) the Type of Revolving Loans to be borrowed or to which existing Revolving Loans are to be converted,
 
(v) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with respect thereto, and
 
(vi) the currency of the Revolving Loans to be borrowed.
 
If DeVry fails to specify a currency in a Revolving Loan Notice requesting a Borrowing, then the Revolving Loans so requested shall be made in Dollars. If Borrower fails to specify a Type of Revolving Loan in a Revolving Loan Notice or if a Borrower fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the related Revolving Loans shall be made as, or converted to, Base Rate Loans;
provided
,
however
, that in the case of a failure to timely request a continuation of Revolving Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, such Loans shall be continued as Eurocurrency Rate Loans in their original currency with an Interest Period of one month. Any such automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Eurocurrency Rate Loans. If a Borrower requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in any such Revolving Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month. No Revolving Loan may be converted into or continued as a Revolving Loan denominated in a different currency, but instead must be prepaid in the original currency of such Revolving Loan and reborrowed in the other currency.
 
(b) Following receipt of a Revolving Loan Notice, the Administrative Agent shall
 
-30-
promptly notify each Lender of the amount (and currency) of its Pro Rata Share of the applicable Revolving Loans, and if no timely notice of a conversion or continuation is provided by the applicable Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the details of any automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans or continuation of Revolving Loans denominated in a currency other than Dollars, in each case as described in the preceding subsection. In the case of a Borrowing, each Lender shall make the amount of its Revolving Loan available to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds at the Administrative Agents Office not later than 12:00 (noon) in the case of any Revolving Loan denominated in Dollars, and not later than the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent in the case of any Revolving Loan in an Alternative Currency, in each case on the Business Day specified in the applicable Revolving Loan Notice. Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 4.2 (and, if such Borrowing is the initial Credit Extension, Section 4.1), the Administrative Agent shall make all funds so received available to the applicable Borrower in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent either by (i) crediting the account of such Borrower on the books of Bank of America with the amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided to (and reasonably acceptable to) the Administrative Agent by such Borrower;
provided
,
however
, that if, on the date the Revolving Loan Notice with respect to such Borrowing is given by DeVry, there are Swing Line Loans or L/C Borrowings outstanding, then the proceeds of such Borrowing denominated in Dollars shall be applied, first, to the payment in full of any such L/C Borrowings, second, to the payment in full of any such Swing Line Loans, and third, to DeVry as provided above.
 
(c) Except as otherwise provided herein, a Eurocurrency Rate Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurocurrency Rate Loan. During the existence of a Default, no Loans may be requested as, converted to or continued as Eurocurrency Rate Loans (whether in Dollars or any Alternative Currency) without the consent of the Required Lenders, and the Required Lenders may demand that any or all of the then outstanding Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency be prepaid, or redenominated into Dollars in the amount of the Dollar Equivalent thereof, on the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto.
 
(d) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrowers and the Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for Eurocurrency Rate Loans upon determination of such interest rate. At any time that Base Rate Loans are outstanding, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrowers and the Lenders of any change in Bank of Americas prime rate used in determining the Base Rate promptly following the public announcement of such change.
 
(e) After giving effect to all Borrowings, all conversions of Revolving Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations of Revolving Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than ten Interest Periods in effect with respect to Revolving Loans.

provided
that the L/C Issuer shall not be obligated to make any L/C Credit Extension with respect to any Letter of Credit, and no Lender shall be obligated to participate in any Letter of Credit if as of the date of such L/C Credit Extension:
 
(w)
 
the Total Outstandings would exceed the Aggregate Commitments,
 
(x)

(y) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of all Revolving Loans made to GEI, plus the Outstanding Amount of the L/C Obligations of GEI shall not exceed the GEI Sublimit;
 
(z)
 
the Outstanding Amount of the L/C Obligations shall not exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit;
 
Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each Borrower's ability to obtain Letters of Credit shall be fully revolving, and accordingly each Borrower may, during the foregoing period, obtain Letters of Credit to replace Letters of Credit that have expired or that have been drawn upon and reimbursed. All Existing Letters of Credit shall be deemed to have been issued pursuant hereto, and from and after the Original Closing Date shall be subject to and governed by the terms and conditions hereof.
 
(ii) The L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if:
 
(A) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the L/C Issuer from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any Law applicable to the L/C Issuer or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the L/C Issuer shall prohibit, or request that the L/C Issuer refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which the L/C Issuer is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Original Closing Date, or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Original Closing Date and which the L/C Issuer in good faith deems material to it;
 
(B) the expiry date of such requested Letter of Credit would occur after the Letter of Credit Expiration Date (in which case the L/C Issuer shall not issue
 
-32-
such Letter of Credit, unless all the Lenders have approved such expiry date);
 
(C) the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate one or more policies of the L/C Issuer; or
 
(D) such Letter of Credit is in an initial amount less than the Dollar Equivalent of $100,000.
 
(iii) The L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to amend any Letter of Credit if (A) the L/C Issuer would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof, or (B) the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed amendment to such Letter of Credit.
 
(b)
Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit; Auto-Renewal Letters of Credit
.
 
(i) Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as the case may be, upon the request of the applicable Borrower delivered to the L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in the form of a Letter of Credit Application, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of such Borrower. Such Letter of Credit Application must be received by the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent not later than 10:00 a.m. at least two Business Days (or such later date and time as the L/C Issuer may agree in a particular instance in its sole discretion) prior to the proposed issuance date or date of amendment, as the case may be. In the case of a request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the L/C Issuer: (A) the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (B) the amount thereof; (C) the expiry date thereof; (D) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; (E) the documents to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (F) the full text of any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; and (G) such other matters as the L/C Issuer may require. In the case of a request for an amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the L/C Issuer (A) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (B) the proposed date of amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (C) the nature of the proposed amendment; and (D) such other matters as the L/C Issuer may require.
 
(ii) Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit Application of a Borrower, the L/C Issuer will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of such Letter of Credit Application and, if not, the L/C Issuer will provide the Administrative Agent with a copy thereof. Upon receipt by the L/C Issuer of confirmation from the Administrative Agent that the requested issuance or amendment is permitted in accordance with the terms hereof, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the L/C Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of the requesting Borrower or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with the L/C
 
-33-
Issuer's usual and customary business practices. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the L/C Issuer a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Lenders Pro Rata Share times the amount of such Letter of Credit.
 
(iii) If a Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Application, the L/C Issuer may, in its sole and absolute discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic renewal provisions (each, an Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit); provided that any such Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit must permit the L/C Issuer to prevent any such renewal at least once in each twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the Nonrenewal Notice Date) in each such twelve-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the L/C Issuer, neither Borrower shall be required to make a specific request to the L/C Issuer for any such renewal. Once an Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit has been issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the L/C Issuer to permit the renewal of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date;
provided
,
however
, that the L/C Issuer shall not permit any such renewal if (A) the L/C Issuer has determined that it would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its renewed form under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of Section 2.3(a)(ii) or otherwise), or (B) it has received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is two Business Days before the Nonrenewal Notice Date (1) from the Administrative Agent that the Required Lenders have elected not to permit such renewal or (2) from the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the related Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 4.2 is not then satisfied.
 
(iv) Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the L/C Issuer will also deliver to the applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment.
 
(c)
Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations
.
 
(i) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall notify the applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof. In the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency, the applicable Borrower shall reimburse the L/C Issuer in such Alternative Currency, unless (A) the L/C Issuer (at its option) shall have specified in such notice that it will require reimbursement in Dollars, or (B) in the absence of any such requirement for reimbursement in Dollars, the applicable Borrower shall have notified the L/C Issuer promptly following receipt of the notice of drawing that it will reimburse the L/C Issuer in Dollars. In the case of any such reimbursement in Dollars of a drawing under a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency, the L/C Issuer shall notify the applicable Borrower of the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of the drawing promptly following the determination thereof. Not later than 11:00 a.m. on the date of
 
-34-
any payment by the L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit to be reimbursed in Dollars, or the Applicable Time on the date of any payment by the L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit to be reimbursed in an Alternative Currency (each such date, an 
Honor Date
), the applicable Borrower shall reimburse the L/C Issuer through the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing and in the applicable currency. If a Borrower fails to so reimburse the L/C Issuer by such time, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (expressed in Dollars) in the amount of the Dollar Equivalent thereof, in the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency (the Unreimbursed Amount), and the amount of such Lenders Pro Rata Share thereof. In such event, such Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Revolving Borrowing of Base Rate Loans to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in Section 2.2 for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Aggregate Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section 4.2 (other than the delivery of a Revolving Loan Notice). Any notice given by the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.3(c)(i) may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice.
 
(ii) Each Lender (including the Lender acting as L/C Issuer) shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.3(c)(i) make funds available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer in Dollars, at the Administrative Agents Office for Dollar-denominated payments in an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 12:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section 2.3(c)(iii), each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Revolving Loan to the related Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the L/C Issuer.
 
(iii) With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans because the conditions set forth in Section 4.2 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the related Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate. In such event, each Lenders payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.3(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.3.
 
(iv) Until each Lender funds its Revolving Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to this Section 2.3(c) to reimburse the L/C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lenders Pro Rata Share of such amount shall be solely for the account of the L/C Issuer.
 
-35-
(v) Each Lenders obligation to make Revolving Loans or L/C Advances to reimburse the L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this Section 2.3(c), shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the L/C Issuer, either Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing;
provided
,
however
, that each Lenders obligation to make Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section 2.3(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.2 (other than delivery of a Revolving Loan Notice). No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of either Borrower to reimburse the L/C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by the L/C Issuer under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein.
 
(vi) If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.3(c) by the time specified in Section 2.3(c)(ii), the L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect. A certificate of the L/C Issuer submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
(d)
Repayment of Participations
.
 
(i) At any time after the L/C Issuer has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Lender such Lenders L/C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with Section 2.3(c), if the Administrative Agent receives for the account of the L/C Issuer any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the related Borrower or otherwise), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such Lender its Pro Rata Share thereof (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Lenders L/C Advance was outstanding) in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent.
 
(ii) If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.3(c)(i) is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 11.6 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the L/C Issuer in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer its Pro Rata Share thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect.
 
(e)
Obligations Absolute
. The obligation of each Borrower to reimburse the L/C Issuer
 
-36-
for each drawing under each Letter of Credit and to repay each L/C Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including the following:
 
(i) any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto;
 
(ii) the existence of any claim, counterclaim, set-off, defense or other right that such Borrower may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the L/C Issuer or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction;
 
(iii) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit;
 
(iv) any payment by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law;
 
(v) any adverse change in the relevant exchange rates or in the availability of the relevant Alternative Currency to the Borrowers, or in the relevant currency markets generally; or
 
(vi) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, such Borrower.
 
Each Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance with such Borrowers instructions or other irregularity, such Borrower will immediately notify the L/C Issuer. Such Borrower shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the L/C Issuer and its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid.
 
(f)
Role of L/C Issuer
. Each Lender and each Borrower agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of the L/C Issuer, any Agent-Related Person nor any of the respective correspondents, participants or assignees of the
 
-37-
L/C Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Letter of Credit Application. Each Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit;
provided
,
however
, that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude such Borrower from pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of the L/C Issuer, any Agent-Related Person, nor any of the respective correspondents, participants or assignees of the L/C Issuer, shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (v) of Section 2.3(e);
provided
,
however
, that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, the applicable Borrower may have a claim against the L/C Issuer, and the L/C Issuer may be liable to such Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by such Borrower which such Borrower proves were caused by the L/C Issuer's willful misconduct or gross negligence or the L/C Issuer's willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the L/C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and the L/C Issuer shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason.

No removal of the L/C Issuer shall be effective prior to the acceptance by another Lender hereunder of an appointment as L/C Issuer. Upon the acceptance of an appointment as L/C Issuer, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the interests, rights and obligations of the retiring L/C Issuer and the retiring L/C Issuer shall be discharged from its obligations to issue additional Letters of Credit hereunder. At the time such removal shall become effective, the Borrowers shall pay all accrued and unpaid fees pursuant to Section 2.3(g) and (h). The acceptance of an appointment as L/C Issuer hereunder by a successor Lender shall be evidenced by an agreement entered into by such successor, in a form satisfactory to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent, and, from and after the effective date of such agreement, (a) such successor Lender shall have all the rights and obligations of the previous L/C Issuer under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and (b) references herein and in the other Loan Documents to the term "L/C Issuer" shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous L/C Issuer, or to such successor and all previous L/C Issuers, as the context shall require.

(a)
The Swing Line
. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Swing Line Lender shall make, in its sole discretion, loans in Dollars (each such loan, a Swing Line Loan) to DeVry from time to time on any Business Day during the Availability Period in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the amount of the Swing Line Sublimit (notwithstanding the fact that such Swing Line Loans, when aggregated with the Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount of Revolving Loans and L/C Obligations of the Lender acting as Swing Line Lender, may exceed the amount of such Lenders Commitment);
provided
,
however
, that after giving effect to any Swing Line Loan,
 
(i) the Total Outstandings shall not exceed the Aggregate Commitments,
 
(ii) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Revolving Loans of any Lender, plus such Lenders Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations, plus such Lenders Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount of all Swing Line Loans, shall not exceed such Lenders Commitment,
 
and
provided
,
further
, that DeVry shall not use the proceeds of any Swing Line Loan to refinance any outstanding Swing Line Loan. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, DeVry may borrow under this Section 2.4, prepay under Section 2.5, and
 
-39-
reborrow under this Section 2.4. Each Swing Line Loan shall be a Base Rate Loan. Immediately upon the making of a Swing Line Loan, each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Swing Line Lender a risk participation in such Swing Line Loan in an amount equal to the product of such Lenders Pro Rata Share times the amount of such Swing Line Loan.
 
(b)
Borrowing Procedures
. Each Swing Line Borrowing shall be made upon DeVrys irrevocable notice to the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent, which may be given by telephone. Each such notice must be received by the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 (noon) on the requested borrowing date, and shall specify (i) the amount to be borrowed, which shall be a minimum of $100,000, and (ii) the requested borrowing date, which shall be a Business Day. Each such telephonic notice must be confirmed promptly by delivery to the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent of a written Swing Line Loan Notice, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of DeVry. Promptly after receipt by the Swing Line Lender of any telephonic Swing Line Loan Notice, the Swing Line Lender will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has also received such Swing Line Loan Notice and, if not, the Swing Line Lender will notify the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) of the contents thereof. Unless the Swing Line Lender has received notice (by telephone or in writing) from the Administrative Agent (including at the request of any Lender) prior to 12:00 (noon) on the date of the proposed Swing Line Borrowing (A) directing the Swing Line Lender not to make such Swing Line Loan as a result of the limitations set forth in the proviso to the first sentence of Section 2.4(a), or (B) that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Article IV is not then satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Swing Line Lender will, not later than 2:00 p.m. on the borrowing date specified in such Swing Line Loan Notice, make the amount of its Swing Line Loan available to DeVry at its office by crediting the account of DeVry on the books of the Swing Line Lender in immediately available funds.
 
(c)
Refinancing of Swing Line Loans
.
 
(i) The Swing Line Lender at any time in its sole and absolute discretion may request, on behalf of DeVry (which hereby irrevocably authorizes the Swing Line Lender to so request on its behalf), that each Lender make a Base Rate Revolving Loan in an amount equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the amount of Swing Line Loans then outstanding. Such request shall be made in writing (which written request shall be deemed to be a Revolving Loan Notice for purposes hereof) and in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.2, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified therein for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the unutilized portion of the Aggregate Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section 4.2. The Swing Line Lender shall furnish DeVry with a copy of the applicable Revolving Loan Notice promptly after delivering such notice to the Administrative Agent. Each Lender shall make an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of the amount specified in such Revolving Loan Notice available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds for the account of the Swing Line Lender at the Administrative Agents Office not later than 12:00 (noon) on the day specified in such Revolving Loan Notice, whereupon, subject to Section 2.4(c)(ii), each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Revolving Loan to DeVry in such amount. The Administrative Agent
 
-40-
shall remit the funds so received to the Swing Line Lender.
 
(ii) If for any reason any Swing Line Loan cannot be refinanced by such a Borrowing in accordance with Section 2.4(c)(i), the request for Base Rate Revolving Loans submitted by the Swing Line Lender as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by the Swing Line Lender that each of the Lenders fund its risk participation in the relevant Swing Line Loan and each Lenders payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender pursuant to Section 2.4(c)(i) shall be deemed payment in respect of such participation.
 
(iii) If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.4(c) by the time specified in Section 2.4(c)(i), the Swing Line Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Swing Line Lender at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect. A certificate of the Swing Line Lender submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (iii) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
(iv) Each Lenders obligation to make Revolving Loans or to purchase and fund risk participations in Swing Line Loans pursuant to this Section 2.4(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the Swing Line Lender, DeVry or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing;
provided
,
however
, that each Lenders obligation to make Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section 2.4(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.2. No such funding of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of DeVry to repay Swing Line Loans, together with interest as provided herein.
 
(v) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.4, the Swing Line Lender shall not make any Swing Line Loan after the Swing Line Lender has received written notice from any Lender (which Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders of such notice) specifying that a Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, describing the nature thereof and stating that, as a result thereof, such Lender shall cease to make Revolving Loans or purchase participating interests with respect to Swing Line Loans, as the case may be, and no Lender will be required to make Revolving Loans or to purchase participating interests, as the case may be, with respect to any Swing Line Loan made after the Swing Line Lender has received such notice;
provided
,
however
, that the Swing Line Lender may resume making Swing Line Loans and the obligations of the Lenders to make Revolving Loans and purchase such participating interests with respect to Swing Line Loans shall be reinstated upon the earlier to occur of (x) the date upon which such Lender notifies the Swing Line Lender (with prompt written notice to the Administrative Agent and the other
 
-41-
Lenders) that its prior notice is withdrawn and (y) the date upon which the Default or Event of Default specified in such notice is no longer continuing.
 
(d)
Repayment of Participations
.
 
(i) At any time after any Lender has purchased and funded a risk participation in a Swing Line Loan, if the Swing Line Lender receives any payment on account of such Swing Line Loan, the Swing Line Lender will distribute to such Lender its Pro Rata Share of such payment (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Lenders risk participation was funded) in the same funds as those received by the Swing Line Lender.
 
(ii) If any payment received by the Swing Line Lender in respect of principal or interest on any Swing Line Loan is required to be returned by the Swing Line Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 11.6 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Swing Line Lender in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to the Swing Line Lender its Pro Rata Share thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate. The Administrative Agent will make such demand upon the request of the Swing Line Lender.
 
(e)
Interest for Account of Swing Line Lender
. The Swing Line Lender shall be responsible for invoicing DeVry for interest on the Swing Line Loans. Until each Lender funds its Base Rate Revolving Loan or risk participation pursuant to this Section 2.4 to refinance such Lenders Pro Rata Share of any Swing Line Loan, interest in respect of such Pro Rata Share shall be solely for the account of the Swing Line Lender.
 
(f)
Payments Directly to Swing Line Lender
. DeVry shall make all payments of principal and interest in respect of the Swing Line Loans directly to the Swing Line Lender.
 
(g)

Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment and the Type(s) of Revolving Loans to be prepaid and, if Eurocurrency Rate Loans are to be prepaid, the Interest Period(s) of such Loans. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of such Lenders Pro Rata Share of such prepayment. If such notice is given by a Borrower, such Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein. Any prepayment of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan shall be accompanied by all accrued interest thereon, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.5. Each such prepayment shall be applied to the Revolving Loans of the Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares.

Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment. If such notice is given by DeVry, DeVry shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein.
 
(c) If for any reason the Total Outstandings of either Borrower at any time exceed the Aggregate Commitments then in effect to such Borrower, DeVry shall immediately prepay Loans in an aggregate amount equal to such excess;
provided
,
however
, that DeVry shall not be required to Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations pursuant to this Section 2.5(c) unless after the prepayment in full of the Revolving Loans and Swing Line Loans the Total Outstandings exceed the Aggregate Commitments then in effect.
 
(d) If the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrowers at any time that the Outstanding Amount of all Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies at such time exceeds the Alternative Currency Sublimit then in effect, then, within two Business Days after receipt of such notice, the Borrowers shall prepay Loans in an aggregate amount sufficient to reduce such Outstanding Amount as of such date of payment to an amount not to exceed 100% of the Alternative Currency Sublimit then in effect.
 
2.6.

The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Lenders of any such notice of termination or reduction of the Aggregate Commitments. Except as set forth in clause (iv) above, the amount of any such Aggregate Commitment reduction shall not be applied to the Alternative Currency Sublimit or the Letter of Credit Sublimit unless otherwise specified by DeVry.
 
(b) Any reduction of the Aggregate Commitments shall be applied to the Commitment of each Lender according to its Pro Rata Share. All commitment fees accrued until the effective date of any termination of the Aggregate Commitments shall be paid on the effective date of such termination.

-44-
2.9.
Fees
.
In addition to certain fees described in subsections (g) and (h) of Section 2.3:
 
(a)
Commitment Fee
. DeVry shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Pro Rata Share, a commitment fee equal to the Applicable Rate times the actual daily amount by which the Aggregate Commitments exceed the sum of (i) the Outstanding Amount of Revolving Loans and (ii) the Outstanding Amount of L/C Obligations. The commitment fee shall accrue at all times during the Availability Period, including at any time during which one or more of the conditions in Article IV is not met. The commitment fee shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the Original Closing Date, and on the Maturity Date, provided that if DeVry has not received an invoice for such fees, such fees shall be due one Business Day after receipt of an invoice therefore. The commitment fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears, and if there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the actual daily amount shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect.
 
(b)
Other Fees
. (i) DeVry shall pay to the Arranger and the Administrative Agent for their own respective accounts fees in the amounts and at the times specified in the Original Fee Letter or the Third Amendment Fee Letter, as the case may be (it being understood that such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever), and (ii) DeVry shall pay to the Lenders such fees as shall have been separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at the times so specified. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.
 
2.10.
Computation of Interest and Fees
.
 
All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans when the Base Rate is determined by Bank of Americas prime rate shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year), or, in the case of interest in respect of Revolving Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies as to which market practice differs from the foregoing, in accordance with such market practice. Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.12(a), bear interest for one day. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.
 
2.11.
Evidence of Debt
.
 
(a) The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to each Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or
 
-45-
any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of each Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, each Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lenders Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount, currency and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.
 
(b) In addition to the accounts and records referred to in subsection (a), each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such Lender of participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by the Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.
 
2.12.
Payments Generally
.
 
(a) All payments to be made by the Borrowers shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein and except with respect to principal of and interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, all payments by the Borrowers (or either of them) hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agents Office in Dollars and in Same Day Funds not later than 1:00 p.m. on the date specified herein. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrowers hereunder with respect to principal and interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agents Office in such Alternative Currency and in Same Day Funds not later than the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent on the dates specified herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may require that any payments due under this Agreement be made in the United States. If, for any reason, any Borrower is prohibited by any Law from making any required payment hereunder in an Alternative Currency, such Borrower shall make such payment in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent of the Alternative Currency payment amount. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lenders Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 1:00 p.m. in the case of payments in Dollars, or (ii) after the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent in the case of payments in an Alternative Currency, shall in each case be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.
 
(b) If any payment to be made by the Borrower s (or either of them) shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.
 
-46-
 
 (c) Unless either Borrower or any Lender has notified the Administrative Agent, prior to the date any payment is required to be made by it to the Administrative Agent hereunder, that such Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, has timely made such payment and may (but shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount to the Person entitled thereto. If and to the extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds, then:
   
 
(i) if such Borrower failed to make such payment, each Lender shall forthwith on demand repay to the Administrative Agent the portion of such assumed payment that was made available to such Lender in immediately available funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at the applicable Overnight Funds Rate from time to time in effect; and
 
(ii) if any Lender failed to make such payment, such Lender shall forthwith on demand pay to the Administrative Agent the amount thereof in immediately available funds, together with interest thereon for the period from the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to such Borrower to the date such amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent (the Compensation Period) at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Funds Rate from time to time in effect. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lenders Revolving Loan included in the applicable Borrowing. If such Lender does not pay such amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agents demand therefore, the Administrative Agent may make a demand therefore upon DeVry, and DeVry shall pay such amount to the Administrative Agent, together with interest thereon for the Compensation Period at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest applicable to the applicable Borrowing. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the Administrative Agent or DeVry may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.
 
A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or DeVry with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (c) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
 
(d) If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.
 
(e) The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Revolving Loans and to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans are several and not joint. The failure of
 
-47-
any Lender to make any Revolving Loan or to fund any such participation on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Revolving Loan or purchase its participation.
 
(f) Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.
 
2.13.
Sharing of Payments
.
 
If, other than as expressly provided elsewhere herein, any Lender shall obtain on account of the Revolving Loans made by it, or the participations in L/C Obligations or in Swing Line Loans held by it, any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) in excess of its ratable share (or other share contemplated hereunder) thereof, such Lender shall immediately (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Revolving Loans made by them and/or such subparticipations in the participations in L/C Obligations or Swing Line Loans held by them, as the case may be, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment in respect of such Revolving Loans or such participations, as the case may be, pro rata with each of them;
provided
,
however
, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 11.6 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the purchasing Lender in its discretion), such purchase shall to that extent be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price paid therefore, together with an amount equal to such paying Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such paying Lender's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered, without further interest thereon. Each Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off, but subject to Section 11.9) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased under this Section 2.13 and will in each case notify the Lenders following any such purchases or repayments. Each Lender that purchases a participation pursuant to this Section 2.13 shall from and after such purchase have the right to give all notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications under this Agreement with respect to the portion of the Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the purchasing Lender were the original owner of the Obligations purchased.
 
2.14. Increase in Commitments.
 
(a)
 
Upon notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders), DeVry may from time to time (but not more than twice), request an increase in the Aggregate Commitments by an amount (for all such requests) not exceeding $100,000,000; provided, however, that (i) any increase shall be in an aggregate amount of $15,000,000 or any
 
-48-
whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, and (ii) no Default shall then exist. At the time of sending such notice, DeVry (in consultation with the Administrative Agent) shall specify the time period within which each Lender is requested to respond (which shall in no event be less than ten Business Days from the date of delivery of such notice to the Lenders). Each Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent within such time period whether or not it agrees to increase its Commitment and, if so, whether by an amount equal to, greater than, or less than its Pro Rata Share of such requested increase. Any Lender not responding within such time period shall be deemed to have declined to increase its Commitment, it being understood that no Lender shall have any obligation to increase its Commitment. The Administrative Agent shall notify DeVry and each Lender of the Lenders responses to each request made hereunder. To achieve the full amount of a requested increase, DeVry may also invite additional Eligible Assignees to become Lenders pursuant to a joinder agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and its counsel.
 
(b)
 
If the Aggregate Commitments are increased in accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent and DeVry shall determine the effective date (the Increase Effective Date) and the final allocation of such increase. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify DeVry and the Lenders of the final allocation of such increase and the Increase Effective Date. As a condition precedent to such increase, DeVry shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the following, in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, dated as of such Increase Effective Date, and in sufficient copies for each Lender:
 
(i)
 
a certificate signed by the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of DeVry certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by DeVry approving such increase,
 
(ii)
 
a certificate signed by a Responsible Officer of DeVry certifying that, before and after giving effect to such increase, (A) the representations and warranties contained in Article V and the other Loan Documents are true and correct on and as of the Extension Effective Date (except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they are true and correct as of such earlier date, and except that for purposes of this Section 2.14, the representations and warranties contained in Section 5.5(a) and (b) hereof shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements furnished pursuant to Section 6.1 (a) and (b) hereof), and (B) no Default exists,
 
(iii)
 
an acknowledgment signed by each other Loan Party consenting to such increase and reaffirming its obligations under the Loan Documents; and
 
(iv)
 
to the extent requested by the Administrative Agent, such opinions of counsel (including opinions of counsel for its Non-U.S. Subsidiaries) reaffirming the opinions furnished pursuant to Sections 4.1 and 6.15 as applied to the increase in Commitments pursuant to this Section and confirming that the Collateral secures the Obligations as so increased.
 
On the Increase Effective Date, the Administrative Agent shall revise Schedule 2.1 to reflect the increase in Commitments and the allocation thereof, it being understood that (i) each Lender's Pro Rata Share shall be revised to reflect a fraction (expressed as a decimal, carried out to the ninth decimal place) the numerator of which is the amount of the aggregate Commitment of such
 
-49-
Lender at such time and the denominator of which is the amount of the Aggregate Commitments of all Lenders, and (ii) the allocation of such Lender's Commitment shall be revised to reflect such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Aggregate Commitments as so revised. DeVry shall prepay any Revolving Loans outstanding on the Increase Effective Date (and pay any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.5) to the extent necessary to keep all outstanding Revolving Loans ratable with any revised Pro Rata Shares arising from any nonratable increase in the Commitments under this Section.
 
(c)
 
This Section shall supersede any provisions in Sections 2.13 or 11.1 to the contrary.
 
3.1.
Taxes
.
 
(a) Any and all payments by the Borrowers to or for the account of the Administrative Agent or any Lender under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar charges, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in the case of the Administrative Agent and each Lender, taxes (Excluded Taxes) imposed on or measured by its overall net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it (in lieu of net income taxes), by the jurisdiction (or any political subdivision thereof) under the Laws of which the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, is organized or maintains a lending office (all such non-excluded taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar charges, and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as Taxes). If either Borrower shall be required by any Laws to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.1(a)), each of the Administrative Agent and such Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions, (iii) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable Laws, and (iv) within 30 days after the date of such payment, such Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative Agent (which shall forward the same to such Lender) the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof. The Obligations of the Borrowers under this Section 3.1 are subject to the provisions of Section 11.16.
 
(b) In addition, each Borrower agrees to pay any and all present or future stamp, court or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes or charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made under any Loan Document or from the execution, delivery, performance, enforcement or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as Other Taxes).
 
(c) If either Borrower shall be required to deduct or pay any Taxes or Other Taxes from
 
-50-
or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, such Borrower shall also pay to the Administrative Agent or to such Lender, as the case may be, at the time interest is paid, such additional amount that the Administrative Agent or such Lender specifies is necessary to preserve the after-tax yield (after factoring in all taxes, including taxes imposed on or measured by net income) that the Administrative Agent or such Lender would have received if such Taxes or Other Taxes had not been imposed.
 
(d) Each Borrower agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender for (i) the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes (including any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on additional amounts payable under this Section 3.1) paid by the Administrative Agent and such Lender with respect to payments made by a Borrower hereunder, (ii) amounts payable under Section 3.1(c), and (iii) any liability (including additions to tax, penalties, interest and expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, but excluding penalties, interest and expenses imposed or asserted on account of the bad faith or willful neglect of the Administrative Agent or such Lender). Payment under this subsection (d) shall be made within 30 days after the date the Lender or the Administrative Agent makes a demand therefore.
 
3.2.
Illegality
.
 
If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Eurocurrency Rate Loans (whether denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency), or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars or any Alternative Currency in the applicable interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the applicable Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies or, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in Dollars, to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the applicable Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the applicable Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable and such Loans are denominated in Dollars, convert all Eurocurrency Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period therefore, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the applicable Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. Each Lender agrees to designate a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender.
 
3.3.
Inability to Determine Rates
.
 
If the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a Eurocurrency Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (a) deposits (whether in Dollars or an Alternative Currency) are not being offered to banks in the applicable offshore
 
-51-
interbank market for such currency for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurocurrency Rate Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurocurrency Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan (whether denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency), or (c) the Eurocurrency Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the applicable Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the applicable Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.
 
3.4.
Increased Costs; Reserves on Eurocurrency Rate Loans
.
 
(a)
Increased Costs Generally
. If any Change in Law shall:
 
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except (A) any reserve requirement contemplated by Section 3.4(e) and (B) the requirements of the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority or the European Central Bank reflected in the Mandatory Cost, other than as set forth below) or the L/C Issuer;
 
(ii) subject any Lender or the L/C Issuer to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, any participation in a Letter of Credit or any Eurocurrency Rate Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender or the L/C Issuer in respect thereof (except for Taxes or Other Taxes covered by Section 3.1 and the imposition of, or any change in the rate of, any Excluded Tax payable by such Lender or the L/C Issuer);
 
(iii) result in the failure of the Mandatory Cost, as calculated hereunder, to represent the cost to any Lender of complying with the requirements of the Bank of England and/or the Financial Services Authority or the European Central Bank in relation to its making, funding or maintaining Eurocurrency Rate Loans; or
 
(iv) impose on any Lender or the L/C Issuer or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
 
-52-
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Rate Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or the L/C Issuer of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the L/C Issuer hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, DeVry will pay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
 
(b)
Capital Requirements
. If any Lender or the L/C Issuer determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or the L/C Issuer or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lenders or the L/C Issuers holding company, if any, regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders or the L/C Issuers capital or on the capital of such Lenders or the L/C Issuers holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the L/C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or the L/C Issuer or such Lenders or the L/C Issuers holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lenders or the L/C Issuers policies and the policies of such Lenders or the L/C Issuers holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time DeVry will pay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or such Lenders or the L/C Issuers holding company for any such reduction suffered.
 
(c)
Certificates for Reimbursement
. A certificate of a Lender or the L/C Issuer setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to DeVry shall be conclusive absent manifest error. DeVry shall pay (or cause GEI to pay) such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
 
(d)
Delay in Requests
. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the L/C Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders or the L/C Issuers right to demand such compensation, provided that no Borrower shall be required to compensate a Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than 90 days prior to the date that such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, notifies DeVry of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lenders or the L/C Issuers intention to claim compensation therefore (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 90-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).
 
-53-
(e)
Additional Reserve Requirements
. DeVry shall pay to each Lender, (i) as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as Eurocurrency Liabilities), additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurocurrency Rate Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), and (ii) as long as such Lender shall be required to comply with any reserve ratio requirement or analogous requirement of any central banking or financial regulatory authority imposed in respect of the maintenance of the Commitments or the funding of the Eurocurrency Rate Loans, such additional costs (expressed as a percentage per annum and rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest five decimal places) equal to the actual costs allocated to such Commitment or Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), which in each case shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan, provided DeVry shall have received at least 10 days prior notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest or costs from such Lender. If a Lender fails to give notice 10 days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest or costs shall be due and payable 10 days from receipt of such notice.
 
3.5.
Compensation for Losses
.
 
Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, DeVry shall promptly compensate (or cause GEI to compensate) such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:
 
(a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);
 
(b) any failure by either Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by DeVry or GEI as applicable;
 
(c)
 
any failure by either Borrower to make payment of any Loan or drawing under any Letter of Credit (or interest due thereon) denominated in an Alternative Currency on its scheduled due date or any payment thereof in a different currency; or
 
(d) any assignment of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefore as a result of a request by DeVry pursuant to Section 11.16;
 
including any loss of anticipated profits, any foreign exchange losses and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan, from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained or from the performance of any foreign exchange contract. DeVry shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.
 
-54-
For purposes of calculating amounts payable by DeVry to the Lenders under this Section 3.5, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurocurrency Rate Loan made by it at the Eurocurrency Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the offshore interbank market for such currency for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurocurrency Rate Loan was in fact so funded.
 
3.6.
Matters Applicable to all Requests for Compensation
.
 
(a) A certificate of the Administrative Agent or any Lender claiming compensation under this Article III and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining such amount, the Administrative Agent or such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.
 
(b) To the extent reasonably possible, each Lender shall designate an alternate Lending Office with respect to its Eurocurrency Rate Loans to reduce any liability of the Borrowers to such Lender under Sections 3.1 and 3.4 and/or to avoid suspension of such Lender's obligation to make Eurocurrency Rate Loans under Section 3.2, as long as such designation is not, in the judgment of such Lender, disadvantageous to such Lender.
 
(c) Upon any Lender's making a claim for compensation under Section 3.1 or 3.4 or any exercise by such Lender of its rights not to make Eurocurrency Rate Loans under Section 3.2, the Borrowers may replace such Lender in accordance with Section 11.16.
 
3.7.

The obligations of each Borrower under this Article III shall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments and repayment of all other Obligations hereunder.
 
4.1.

The books and records of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders showing the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be admissible in evidence in any action or proceeding, and shall be binding upon DeVry and conclusive, absent manifest error, for the purpose of establishing the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations. This guaranty shall not be affected by the genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or any instrument or agreement evidencing any Guaranteed Obligations, or by the existence, validity, enforceability, perfection, or extent of any collateral therefore, or by any fact or circumstance relating to the Guaranteed Obligations which might otherwise constitute a defense to the obligations of DeVry hereunder.

10.7.
Reinstatement

Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, DeVry otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed);
 
(ii) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Obligations or the Commitments assigned (i.e., the same proportionate assignment by a Lender of the Obligations owing to it by DeVry and GEI, respectfully), except that this clause (ii) shall not apply to rights in respect of Swing Line Loans;
 
(iii) any assignment of a Commitment must be approved by the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Swing Line Lender unless the Person that is the proposed assignee is itself a Lender (whether or not the proposed assignee would otherwise qualify as an Eligible Assignee);
 
(iv) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 (it being understood that pursuant to such Assignment and Assumption Agreement the assignee shall be bound by the terms of the Pledge Agreement); and
 
(v) No such assignment shall be made to any Person that, on the effective date of such assignment, through its Lending Offices, is not capable of lending the applicable Alternative Currencies to the relevant Borrowers without the imposition of any additional Taxes.
 
Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.1, 3.4, 3.5, 11.4 and 11.5 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment). Upon request, the applicable Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section.
 
(c) The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at the Administrative Agents Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts of the Loans and L/C Obligations owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms
 
-96-
hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
 
(d) Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person or DeVry or any of DeVrys Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a Participant) in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lenders participations in L/C Obligations and/or Swing Line Loans) owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to Section 11.1 that directly affects such Participant. Subject to subsection (e) of this Section, each Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.1, 3.4 and 3.5 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 11.9 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.13 as though it were a Lender.
 
(e) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.1 or 3.4 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with such Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.1 unless such Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of such Borrower, to comply with Section 11.15 as though it were a Lender.
 
(f) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
 
(g) As used herein, the following terms have the following meanings:
 
Eligible Assignee
 means (a) a Lender; (b) an Affiliate of a Lender; (c) an Approved Fund; and (d) any other Person (other than a natural person) approved by (i) the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Swing Line Lender, and (ii) unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, DeVry (each such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided that notwithstanding the foregoing,
 
-97-
Eligible Assignee shall not include DeVry or any of DeVrys Affiliates or Subsidiaries any Person which cannot make the representations in Section 11.15(a).
 
Fund
 means any Person (other than a natural person) that is (or will be) engaged in making, purchasing, holding or otherwise investing in commercial loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its business.
 
Approved Fund
 means any Fund that is administered or managed by (a) a Lender, (b) an Affiliate of a Lender or (c) an entity or an Affiliate of an entity that administers or manages a Lender.
 
(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender that is a Fund may create a security interest in all or any portion of the Loans owing to it and the Note, if any, held by it to the trustee for holders of obligations owed, or securities issued, by such Fund as security for such obligations or securities, provided that unless and until such trustee actually becomes a Lender in compliance with the other provisions of this Section 11.7, (i) no such pledge shall release the pledging Lender from any of its obligations under the Loan Documents and (ii) such trustee shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of a Lender under the Loan Documents even though such trustee may have acquired ownership rights with respect to the pledged interest through foreclosure or otherwise.
 
(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time Bank of America assigns all of its Commitment and Loans pursuant to subsection 11.7(b) above, Bank of America may, (i) upon 30 days notice to DeVry and the Lenders, resign as L/C Issuer and/or (ii) upon 30 days notice to DeVry, resign as Swing Line Lender. In the event of any such resignation as L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, DeVry shall be entitled to appoint from among the Lenders a successor L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender hereunder;
provided
,
however
, that no failure by DeVry to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of Bank of America as L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, as the case may be. If Bank of America resigns as L/C Issuer, it shall retain all the rights and obligations of the L/C Issuer hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto (including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Revolving Loans or fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section 2.3(c)). If Bank of America resigns as Swing Line Lender, it shall retain all the rights of the Swing Line Lender provided for hereunder with respect to Swing Line Loans made by it and outstanding as of the effective date of such resignation, including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Revolving Loans or fund risk participations in outstanding Swing Line Loans pursuant to Section 2.4(c).
 
(j) The words execution, signed, signature, and words of like import in any Assignment and Assumption shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.

Confidentiality.
 
Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates' directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential); (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority; (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process; (d) to any other party to this Agreement; (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights hereunder; (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any Eligible Assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective Eligible Assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any direct or indirect contractual counterparty or prospective counterparty (or such contractual counterparty's or prospective counterparty's professional advisor) to any credit derivative transaction relating to obligations of the Loan Parties; (g) with the consent of DeVry; (h) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than DeVry; or (i) to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or any other similar organization. In addition, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may disclose the existence of this Agreement and information about this Agreement to market data collectors, similar service providers to the lending industry, and service providers to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in connection with the administration and management of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the Commitments, and the Credit Extensions. For the purposes of this Section, Information means all information received from any Loan Party relating to any Loan Party or its business, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by any Loan Party; provided that, in the case of information received from a Loan Party after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified in writing at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.
 
11.9.
Set-off
.
 
In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by law, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, each Lender is authorized at any time and from time to time, without prior notice to DeVry or any other Loan Party, any such notice being waived by DeVry (on its own behalf and on behalf of each Loan Party) to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held by, and other indebtedness at any time owing by, such Lender to or for the credit or the account of the respective Loan Parties against any and all Obligations owing to such Lender hereunder or under any other Loan Document, now or hereafter existing, irrespective of whether or not the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall have made demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured or denominated in a currency different from that of the applicable deposit or indebtedness.
 
-99-
 
Each Lender agrees promptly to notify DeVry and the Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application made by such Lender;
provided
,
however
, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.
 
11.10.
Interest Rate Limitation
.
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the Maximum Rate). If the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the applicable Borrower. In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.
 
11.11.
Counterparts

11.12.
Integration
.
 
This Agreement, together with the other Loan Documents, comprises the complete and integrated agreement of the parties on the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, on such subject matter. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and those of any other Loan Document, the provisions of this Agreement shall control; provided that the inclusion of supplemental rights or remedies in favor of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders in any other Loan Document shall not be deemed a conflict with this Agreement. Each Loan Document was drafted with the joint participation of the respective parties thereto and shall be construed neither against nor in favor of any party, but rather in accordance with the fair meaning thereof.
 
11.13.
Survival of Representations and Warranties
.
 
All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default at the time of any Credit Extension, and shall continue in full force and effect as
 
-100-
long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any Letter of Credit shall remain outstanding.
 
11.14.
Severability
.
 
If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.
 
11.15.
Tax Forms
.
 
(a) (i) Each Lender that is not a United States person within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a Foreign Lender) shall deliver to the Administrative Agent, the date on which the first payment to such Lender is due hereunder (or upon accepting an assignment of an interest herein), two duly signed completed copies of either IRS Form W-8BEN or any successor thereto (relating to such Foreign Lender and entitling it to an exemption from withholding tax on all payments to be made to such Foreign Lender by the Borrowers pursuant to this Agreement) or IRS Form W-8ECI or any successor thereto (relating to all payments to be made to such Foreign Lender by the Borrowers pursuant to this Agreement) or such other evidence satisfactory to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent that such Foreign Lender is entitled to an exemption from U.S. withholding tax, including any exemption pursuant to Section 881(c) of the Code. Thereafter and from time to time, each such Foreign Lender shall (A) promptly submit to the Administrative Agent such additional duly completed and signed copies of one of such forms (or such successor forms as shall be adopted from time to time by the relevant United States taxing authorities) as may then be available under then current United States laws and regulations to avoid, or such evidence as is satisfactory to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent of any available exemption from United States withholding taxes in respect of all payments to be made to such Foreign Lender by the Borrowers pursuant to this Agreement, (B) promptly notify the Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption, and (C) take such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its Lending Office) to avoid any requirement of applicable Laws that the Borrowers make any deduction or withholding for Taxes from amounts payable to such Foreign Lender.
 
(ii)
 
Each Foreign Lender, to the extent it does not act or ceases to act for its own account with respect to any portion of any sums paid or payable to such Lender under any of the Loan Documents (for example, in the case of a typical participation by such Lender), shall deliver to the Administrative Agent on the date when such Foreign Lender ceases to act for its own account with respect to any portion of any such sums
 
-101-
paid or payable, and at such other times as may be necessary in the determination of the Administrative Agent (in the reasonable exercise of its discretion), (A) two duly signed completed copies of the forms or statements required to be provided by such Lender as set forth above, to establish the portion of any such sums paid or payable with respect to which such Lender acts for its own account that is not subject to U.S. withholding tax, and (B) two duly signed completed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY (or any successor thereto), together with any information such Lender chooses to transmit with such form, and any other certificate or statement of exemption required under the Code, to establish that such Lender is not acting for its own account with respect to a portion of any such sums payable to such Lender.
 
(iii)
 
Neither Borrower shall be required to pay any additional amount to any Foreign Lender under Section 3.1 (a) with respect to any Taxes required to be deducted or withheld on the basis of the information, certificates or statements of exemption such Lender transmits with an IRS Form W-8IMY pursuant to this Section 11.15(a) or (b) if such Lender shall have failed to satisfy the foregoing provisions of this Section 11.15(a); provided that if such Lender shall have satisfied the requirement of this Section 11.15(a) on the date such Lender became a Lender or ceased to act for its own account with respect to any payment under any of the Loan Documents, nothing in this Section 11.15(a) shall relieve either Borrower of its obligation to pay any amounts pursuant to Section 3.1 in the event that, as a result of any change in any applicable law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order, or any change in the interpretation, administration or application thereof, such Lender is no longer properly entitled to deliver forms, certificates or other evidence at a subsequent date establishing the fact that such Lender or other Person for the account of which such Lender receives any sums payable under any of the Loan Documents is not subject to withholding or is subject to withholding at a reduced rate.
 
(iv)
 
The Administrative Agent may, without reduction, withhold any Taxes required to be deducted and withheld from any payment under any of the Loan Documents with respect to which the Borrowers are not required to pay additional amounts under this Section 11.15(a).
 
(b) Upon the request of the Administrative Agent, each Lender that is a United States person within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall deliver to the Administrative Agent two duly signed completed copies of IRS Form W-9. If such Lender fails to deliver such forms, then the Administrative Agent may withhold from any interest payment to such Lender an amount equivalent to the applicable back-up withholding tax imposed by the Code, without reduction.
 
(c) If any Governmental Authority asserts that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold or backup withhold, as the case may be, any tax or other amount from payments made to or for the account of any Lender, such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent therefore, including all penalties and interest, any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts payable to the Administrative Agent under this Section, and costs and expenses (including Attorney Costs) of the Administrative Agent. The obligation of the Lenders under this Section shall survive the termination of the Aggregate Commitments, repayment of all other
Obligations hereunder and the resignation of the Administrative Agent.

Replacement of Lenders
.
 
 
Under any circumstances set forth herein providing that the Borrowers shall have the right to replace a Lender as a party to this Agreement, the Borrowers may, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, replace such Lender by causing such Lender to assign its Commitment (with the assignment fee to be paid by the Borrowers in such instance) pursuant to Section 11.7(b) to one or more other Lenders or Eligible Assignees procured by the Borrowers;
provided
,
however
, that if the Borrowers elect to exercise such rights with respect to any Lender pursuant to Section 3.6(c), they shall be obligated to replace all Lenders that have exercised similar rights pursuant to Sections 3.1, 3.2 or 3.4. The Borrowers shall or shall each cause the replacement Lender to (x) pay in full all principal, interest, fees and other amounts owing to such replaced Lender through the date of replacement (including any amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.5), (y) provide appropriate assurances and indemnities (which may include letters of credit) to the L/C Issuer and the Swing Line Lender as each may reasonably require with respect to any continuing obligation to fund participation interests in any L/C Obligations or any Swing Line Loans then outstanding, and (z) release such replaced Lender from its obligations under the Loan Documents. Any Lender being replaced shall execute and deliver an Assignment and Assumption with respect to such Lender's Commitment and outstanding Loans and participations in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans.

Attachments to U.S. Subsidiary Guaranty:
 
Exhibit A
 
 
Form of Guaranty Joinder
 
 
 
 
This U.S.
Subsidiary Guaranty
dated as of May 16, 2003, as amended and restated as of January 11, 2007 (this
Guaranty
) is entered into on a joint and several basis by each of the undersigned (which parties are hereinafter referred to individually as a
Guarantor
and collectively as the
Guarantors
).
 
 
A.
Reference is made to the Credit Agreement dated as of May 16, 2003, as amended to and including the Third Amendment thereto (the "
Third Amendment
") dated as of January 11, 2007 (herein, as the same may be further amended or modified from time to time, the
Credit Agreement
) among DeVry Inc., a Delaware corporation (
DeVry
), Global Education International, Inc. (
GEI
and, together with DeVry, the
Borrowers
), the lenders party thereto (the 
Lenders
), and Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent (the 
Administrative Agent
) providing for, among other things, up to $175 million in loans (the 
Loans
) and letters of credit (the 
Letters of Credit
).
 
B. 
Each Guarantor is a direct or indirect U.S. Subsidiary of DeVry.
 
C. 
The Credit Extensions under the Credit Agreement have benefited and will continue to benefit the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries by, among other things, providing funds to enable the Borrowers to finance working capital and capital expenditures, support the issuance of standby letters of credit, make Restricted Payments to the extent permitted in Section 7.6 of the Credit Agreement, and for other general corporate purposes.
 
D. 
Pursuant to the Credit Agreement as originally executed as of May 16, 2003, each of the Guarantors executed a Guaranty dated as of May 16, 2003 (the "Existing Guaranty Agreement"), or a Guaranty Joinder joining such Guarantor as a party thereto, and now desire to amend and restate such Existing Guaranty Agreement in its entirety. The obligations of the Lenders to make Credit Extensions under the Credit Agreement are conditioned on, among other things, the execution and delivery by the Guarantors of a Guaranty in the form hereof. As consideration therefor and in order to induce the Lenders to execute the Third Amendment and to make Credit Extensions under the Credit Agreement, the Guarantors are willing to execute this Guaranty case as security for the Obligations under the Credit Agreement.
 
E. 
The Administrative Agent and the Lenders have required as a condition to the effectiveness of the Third Amendment and to their obligations to make Credit Extensions under the Credit Agreement that DeVry cause each Person that hereafter at any time becomes a U.S. Subsidiary to enter into a Guaranty Joinder in substantially the form set forth as Exhibit A hereto (a 
Guaranty Joinder
) as security for the Obligations under the Credit Agreement and DeVry
 
has agreed to cause each Person that hereafter becomes a U.S. Subsidiary to execute a Guaranty Joinder.
 
Now, therefore
, as required by the Credit Agreement and in consideration of the premises and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, each Guarantor does hereby covenant and agree, jointly and severally, as follows:
 
 
Capitalized terms used herein but not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Credit Agreement or as the context shall otherwise require.
 
 
(a) 
Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 2(b) hereof, each Guarantor jointly and severally does hereby irrevocably, absolutely and unconditionally guarantee unto the Administrative Agent and the Lenders: (1) the full and prompt payment of all Obligations (as defined in the Credit Agreement) including, without limitation, all principal of and interest under, all Loans (whether Base Rate Loans, Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Swing Line Loans), all L/C Obligations, all L/C Borrowings, all Specified Swap Obligations and all fees, expenses and other amounts, if any, from time to time outstanding, as and when such payments shall become due and payable, whether by lapse of time, upon redemption or prepayment, by extension or by acceleration or declaration or otherwise (including, to the extent legally enforceable, interest due on overdue payments of principal) in Federal or other immediately available funds of the United States of America which at the time of payment or demand therefor shall be legal tender for the payment of public and private debts, (2) the full and prompt performance and observance by the Borrowers of each and all of the obligations, covenants and agreements required to be performed or owed by the Borrowers under the terms of the Loan Documents, and (3) the full and prompt payment, upon demand by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, of all costs and expenses, legal or otherwise (including reasonable attorneys fees), if any, as shall have been expended or incurred in the protection or enforcement of any rights, privileges or liabilities in favor of the Administrative Agent or any Lender under or in respect of any Loan Document or in any action in connection therewith or herewith and in each and every case irrespective of the validity, regularity, or enforcement of any of the Loan Documents or any of the terms thereof or any other like circumstance or circumstances (the payment, performance and observance of all such Obligations, covenants and agreements being herein collectively called the 
Guaranteed Obligations
).
 
(b) 
The liability of each Guarantor under this Guaranty shall not exceed an amount equal to a maximum amount as will, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other liabilities of such Guarantor, contingent or otherwise, be enforceable under applicable law and result in the performance of the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder and not constitute a fraudulent transfer, obligation or conveyance.
                                                                                                                                                             
                F-1-5    
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
  
  
   
   
   
 
(c) 
All amounts payable under this Guaranty by each Guarantor shall be made in the lawful currency of the United States of America.
 
 
This is a guarantee of payment and performance and each Guarantor hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any right to require that any action on or in respect of any Obligation or any Loan Document be brought against the Borrowers or any other Person or that resort be had to any direct or indirect security for the Guaranteed Obligations or any Loan Document or any other remedy. The Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders may, at its option, proceed hereunder against any Guarantor in the first instance to collect monies when due, the payment of which is guaranteed hereby, without first proceeding against the Borrowers or any other Person and without first resorting to any direct or indirect security for the Guaranteed Obligations or any Loan Document or any other remedy. The liability of each Guarantor hereunder shall in no way be affected or impaired by any acceptance by the Administrative Agent or any Lender of any direct or indirect security for, or other guaranties of, any debt, liability or obligation of the Borrowers or any other Person to the Administrative Agent or any Lender or by any failure, delay, neglect or omission by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to realize upon or protect any such guarantees, debt, liability or obligation or any instruments evidencing the same or any direct or indirect security therefor or by any approval, consent, waiver, or other action taken, or omitted to be taken by the Administrative Agent or any Lender.
 
The covenants and agreements on the part of the Guarantors herein contained shall be joint and several covenants and agreements, and references to the Guarantors shall be deemed references to each of them and none of them shall be released from liability hereunder by reason of the guarantee ceasing to be binding as a continuing security on any other of them.
 
 
(a)
Each Guarantor hereby consents and agrees that the Administrative Agent and/or any Lender from time to time, with or without any further notice to or assent from any other Guarantor may, without in any manner affecting the liability of any Guarantor under this Guaranty, and upon such terms and conditions as the Administrative Agent or such Lender may deem advisable:
 
(1)
 
extend in whole or in part (by renewal or otherwise), modify, increase, change, compromise, release or extend the duration of the time for the performance or payment of any debt, liability or obligation of the Borrowers or of any other Person secondarily or otherwise liable for any debt, liability or obligations of the Borrowers on the Guaranteed Obligations or under any Loan Document, or waive any Default or Event of Default with respect thereto, or waive, modify, amend or change any provision of any Loan Document;
 
(2)
 
sell, release, surrender, modify, impair, exchange or substitute any and all property, of any nature and from whomsoever received, held by, or for the benefit of, the
 
                                                                                                                                                             
               F-1-6    
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
  
& #160; 
   
   
   
Administrative Agent or any Lender as direct or indirect security for the payment or performance of any debt, liability or obligation of the Borrowers or of any other Person secondarily or otherwise liable for any debt, liability or obligation of the Borrowers under any Loan Document; and/or
 
(3)
 
settle, adjust or compromise any claim of the Borrowers against any other Person secondarily or otherwise liable for any debt, liability or obligation of the Borrowers under any Loan Document.
 
 
Each Guarantor hereby ratifies and confirms any such extension, renewal, change, sale, release, waiver, surrender, exchange, modification, amendment, impairment, substitution, settlement, adjustment or compromise and agrees that the same shall be binding upon it, and hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any and all defenses, counterclaims or offsets which it might or could have by reason thereof, it being understood that such Guarantor shall at all times be bound by this Guaranty and remain liable hereunder.
 
   (b)  
Each Guarantor hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law:
 
 
(1)
 
notice of acceptance of this Guaranty by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders or of the creation, renewal or accrual of any liability of the Borrowers, present or future, or of the reliance of the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders upon this Guaranty (it being understood that all Guaranteed Obligations described in Section 2 hereof shall conclusively be presumed to have been created, contracted or incurred in reliance upon the execution of this Guaranty); and
 
 
(2)
 
demand of payment by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders from the Borrowers or any other Person indebted in any manner on or for any of the Guaranteed Obligations; and
 
 
(3)
 
presentment for the payment by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders or any other Person of any Loan Document or any other instrument, protest thereof and notice of its dishonor to any party thereto and to such Guarantor.
 
 
The obligations of each Guarantor under this Guaranty and the rights of the Administrative Agent to enforce such obligations by any proceedings, whether by action at law, suit in equity or otherwise, shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination, whether by reason of any claim of any character whatsoever or otherwise and shall not be subject to any defense, set-off, counterclaim (other than any compulsory counterclaim), recoupment or termination whatsoever.
 
(c) 
The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall be binding upon such Guarantor and its successors and assigns, and shall remain in full force and effect until the date on which all Commitments of the Lenders shall have terminated, all Letters of Credit shall have expired or terminated and all Obligations have indefeasibly been paid in full
             F-1-7    
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
  
  
   
   
   
 
(the Termination Date) and such obligations shall not be affected, modified or impaired upon the happening from time to time of any event, including, without limitation, any of the following, whether or not with notice to or the consent of any Guarantor:
               F-1-8    
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
  
   
  
   
   
   
 
(1)
 
the genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of any of the Loan Documents or any of the terms of any thereof, the continuance of any obligation on the part of the Borrowers or any other Guarantor on or in respect of or under any Loan Document or the power or authority or the lack of power or authority of the Borrowers to execute and deliver any Loan Document or of any other Guarantor to execute and deliver this Guaranty or to perform any of its obligations hereunder or the existence or continuance of the Borrowers or any other Guarantor as a legal entity; or
 
(2)
 
any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance by the Borrowers or any other Guarantor of any obligations of any kind or character whatsoever under any Loan Document; or
 
(3)
 
any creditors rights, bankruptcy, receivership or other insolvency proceeding of the Borrowers or any other Guarantor or in respect of the property of the Borrowers or any other Guarantor or any merger, consolidation, reorganization, dissolution, liquidation, the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of or winding up of the Borrowers or any other Guarantor; or
 
(4)
 
impossibility or illegality of performance on the part of the Borrowers or any other Guarantor of its obligations under any Loan Document; or
 
(5)
 
in respect of the Borrowers or any other Guarantor, any change of circumstances, whether or not foreseen or foreseeable, whether or not imputable to the Borrowers or any other Guarantor, or other impossibility of performance through fire, explosion, accident, labor disturbance, floods, droughts, embargoes, wars (whether or not declared), civil commotion, acts of God or the public enemy, delays or failure of suppliers or carriers, inability to obtain materials, action of any federal or state regulatory body or agency, change of law or any other causes affecting performance, or any other
force majeure
, whether or not beyond the control of the Borrowers or any other Guarantor and whether or not of the kind hereinbefore specified; or
 
(6)
 
any attachment, claim, demand, charge, Lien, order, process, lien or any other happening or event or reason, similar or dissimilar to the foregoing, or any withholding or diminution at the source, by reason of any taxes, assessments, expenses, debt, obligations or liabilities of any character, foreseen or unforeseen, and whether or not valid, incurred by or against the Borrowers or any Guarantor or any claims, demands, charges or Liens of any nature, foreseen or unforeseen, incurred by any Guarantor, or against any sums payable in respect of or under any Loan Document, so that such sums would be rendered inadequate or would be unavailable to make the payments herein provided; or
 
(7)
 
any order, judgment, decree, ruling or regulation (whether or not valid) of any court of any nation or of any political subdivision thereof or any body, agency, department, official or administrative or regulatory agency of any thereof or any other action, happening, event or reason whatsoever which shall delay, interfere with, hinder or

prevent, or in any way adversely affect, the performance by the Borrowers or any Guarantor of its respective obligations under or in respect of any Loan Document; or
 
(8)

any change in the ownership of any shares of the Borrowers or any Guarantor; or
 
(12)
 
any defense whatsoever that: (i) the Borrowers or any other Guarantor might have to the payment under any Loan Document, other than payment thereof in Federal or other immediately available funds, or (ii) the Borrowers or any other Guarantor might have to the performance or observance of any of the provisions of any Loan Document, whether through the satisfaction or purported satisfaction by the Borrowers or any other Guarantor of its debts due to any cause such as bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, merger, consolidation, reorganization, dissolution, liquidation, winding-up or otherwise; or
 
(13)
 
any act or failure to act with regard to any Loan Document or anything which might vary the risk of any Guarantor; or
 
(14)
 
any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any Guarantor in respect of the obligations of any Guarantor under this Guaranty;
 
 
provided
that the specific enumeration of the above-mentioned acts, failures or omissions shall not be deemed to exclude any other acts, failures or omissions, though not specifically mentioned above, it being the purpose and intent of this Guaranty that the obligations of each Guarantor shall be absolute, irrevocable and unconditional and shall not be discharged, impaired or varied except by the payment of all Obligations in accordance with their respective terms whenever the same shall become due and payable and all other sums due and payable under any Loan Document, at the place specified in and all in the manner and with the effect provided in the Credit Agreement, as may be amended or modified from time to time.

foregoing, it is understood that repeated and successive demands may be made and recoveries may be had hereunder as and when, from time to time, the Borrowers shall default under or in respect of the terms of any Loan Document and that notwithstanding recovery hereunder for or in respect of any given default or defaults by the Borrowers under any Loan Document shall remain in full force and effect and shall apply to each and every subsequent default.

All rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder may be transferred or assigned at any time and shall be considered to be transferred or assigned at any time or from time to time upon the appointment of a successor to the Administrative Agent or any permitted transfer by a Lender of its rights under the Credit Agreement, whether with or without the consent of or notice to the Guarantors under this Guaranty or to the Borrowers.
 
(e) 
To the extent of any payments made under this Guaranty, each Guarantor shall be subrogated to the rights of the Administrative Agent and/or the Lenders to whom such payment was made, but such Guarantor covenants and agrees that such right of subrogation shall be subordinate in right of payment to the prior indefeasible final payment in cash in full of all amounts due and owing by the Borrowers with respect to the Obligations under the Loan Documents and by the Guarantors under this Guaranty, and the Guarantors shall not take any action to enforce such right of subrogation, and the Guarantors shall not accept any payment in respect of such right of subrogation, until the Termination Date. If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor in violation of the preceding sentence at any time prior to the indefeasible payment in cash in full of all amounts payable under the Loan Documents and this Guaranty, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Lenders and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to be credited and applied to the amounts due or to become due with respect to all amounts payable under the Loan Documents and this Guaranty, whether matured or unmatured. Each Guarantor acknowledges that it has received direct and indirect benefits from the financing arrangements contemplated by the Loan Documents and that the waiver set forth in this paragraph (e) is knowingly made as a result of the receipt of such benefits.
 
(f) 
Each Guarantor agrees that, to the extent either Borrower, any other Guarantor or any other Person makes any payment under any of the Loan Documents, which payment or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, voided, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside, recovered, rescinded or is required to be retained by or repaid to a trustee, receiver, or any other Person under any bankruptcy code, common law, or equitable cause, then and to the extent of such payment, the obligation or the part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect with respect to the Guarantors obligations hereunder, as if said payment had not been made. The liability of the Guarantors hereunder shall not be reduced or discharged, in whole or in part, by any payment to the Administrative Agent or any Lender from any source that is thereafter paid, returned or refunded in whole or in part by reason of the assertion of a claim of any kind relating thereto, including, but not limited to, any claim for breach of contract, breach of warranty, preference, illegality, invalidity, or fraud asserted by any account debtor or by any other Person.

(g) 
Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender, shall be under any obligation: (1) to marshall any assets in favor of the Guarantors or in payment of any or all of the liabilities of the Borrowers under or in respect of the Loan Documents or the obligations of the Guarantors hereunder or (2) to pursue any other remedy that the Guarantors may or may not be able to pursue themselves and that may lighten the Guarantors burden, any right to which each Guarantor hereby expressly waives.
 
(h) 
The obligations of each Guarantor under this Guaranty rank
pari passu
in right of payment with all other Indebtedness of such Guarantor which is not secured or which is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of such Guarantor.
 
 
Each Guarantor represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and each Lender that:
 
(a)
 
Such Guarantor is a corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership or other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, and is duly qualified as a foreign corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership or other similar legal entity and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required by law, other than those jurisdictions as to which the failure to be so qualified or in good standing could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on (1) the ability of such Guarantor to perform its obligations under this Guaranty, or (2) the validity or enforceability of this Guaranty against such Guarantor (herein in this Section 5, a
Material Adverse Effect
). Such Guarantor has the power and authority to own or hold under lease the properties it purports to own or hold under lease, to transact the business it transacts and proposes to transact, to execute and deliver this Guaranty and to perform the provisions hereof.
 
(b)
 
This Guaranty has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or other organizational action on the part of such Guarantor, and this Guaranty constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of such Guarantor enforceable against such Guarantor in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by (1) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally and (2) general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
 
(c)
 
The execution, delivery and performance by such Guarantor of this Guaranty will not (1) contravene, result in any breach of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation of any Lien in respect of any property of such Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries under its charter documents, or except for contraventions, breaches or defaults which could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, under any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan, purchase or credit agreement, lease, or any other agreement or instrument to which such Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries is bound or by which such Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties may be bound or
           F-1-12    
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
  
   
  
  
   
   
   
 
affected, (2) conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any order, judgment, decree, or ruling of any court, arbitrator or Governmental Authority applicable to such Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries or (3) violate any provision of any statute or other rule or regulation of any Governmental Authority applicable to the such Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries.
 
(d)
 
No consent, approval or authorization of, or registration, filing or declaration with, any Governmental Authority is required in connection with the execution, delivery or performance by such Guarantor of this Guaranty.
 
(
e)
 
Except in the case of DeVry Canada, LLC, DeVry Leasing Corp. and DeVry Educational Products Inc., such Guarantor is solvent, has capital not unreasonably small in relation to its business or any contemplated or undertaken transaction and has assets having a value both at fair valuation and at present fair salable value greater than the amount required to pay its debts as they become due and greater than the amount that will be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts as they become absolute and matured. Such Guarantor does not intend to incur, or believe that it will incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they become due. Such Guarantor will not be rendered insolvent by the execution and delivery of, and performance of its obligations under, this Guaranty. Such Guarantor does not intend to hinder, delay or defraud its creditors by or through the execution and delivery of, or performance of its obligations under, this Guaranty.
 
(f)
 
All representations in the Credit Agreement applicable to such Guarantors (or any of them) are true and correct in all material respects.
 
 
This Guaranty may be amended, and the observance of any term hereof may be waived (either retroactively or prospectively), pursuant to the provisions of Section 11.1 of the Credit Agreement. This Guaranty may be amended by the addition of additional Guarantors pursuant to a Guaranty Joinder.
 
 
Section 7.1. 
Consent to Jurisdiction; Service of Process; Waiver of Jury Trial
.   (a) Each Guarantor irrevocably submits to the nonexclusive
in personam
jurisdiction of any State of New York or federal court sitting in New York City, over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Guaranty. To the fullest extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, each Guarantor irrevocably waives and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise, any claim that it is not subject to the
in personam
jurisdiction of any such court, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court and any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

(b) 
Each Guarantor agrees, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that a final judgment in any suit, action or proceeding of the nature referred to in paragraph (a) of this Section 7.1 brought in any such court shall be conclusive and binding upon such party, subject to rights of appeal and may be enforced in the courts of the United States of America or the State of New York (or any other courts to the jurisdiction of which such party is or may be subject) by a suit upon such judgment.
 
(c) 
Each Guarantor consents to process being served in any suit, action or proceeding of the nature referred to in paragraph (a) of this Section 7.1 by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to the address of such Guarantor specified in Section 8 or at such other address of which you shall then have been notified pursuant to said Section or to any agent for service of process appointed pursuant to the provisions of Section 7.2. Each Guarantor agrees that such service upon receipt (i) shall be deemed in every respect effective service of process upon it in any such suit, action or proceeding and (ii) shall, to the full extent permitted by law, be taken and held to be valid personal service upon and personal delivery to such party. Notices hereunder shall be conclusively presumed received as evidenced by a delivery receipt furnished by the United States Postal Service or any reputable commercial delivery service.
 
(d) 
Nothing in this Section 7.1 shall affect the right of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders to serve process in any manner permitted by law, or limit any right that the Administrative Agent or the Lenders may have to bring proceedings against any Guarantor in the courts of any appropriate jurisdiction or to enforce in any lawful manner a judgment obtained in one jurisdiction in any other jurisdiction.
 
(e) 
Each Guarantor waives trial by jury in any action brought on or with respect to this Guaranty or the Loan Documents or any other document executed in connection herewith or therewith.

Each Guarantor agrees to take any and all action necessary to continue such designation in full force and effect and should such designee, appointee and agent become unavailable for this purpose for any reason, each Guarantor will forthwith irrevocably designate a new designee, appointee and agent, which shall irrevocably agree to act as such, with the powers and for purposes speci-fied in this Section 7.2. Each Guarantor further irrevocably consents and agrees to service of any and all legal process, summons, notices and documents out of any of the aforesaid courts in any such action, suit or proceeding relating to any Loan Document or this Guaranty delivered to such Guarantor in accordance with this Section 7.2 or to its then designee, appointee or agent for service. If service is made upon such designee,

appointee and agent, a copy of such process, summons, notice or document shall also be provided to any Guarantor at the address specified in Section 8 by registered or certified mail, or overnight express air courier;
provided
that failure of such Lender to provide such copy to such Guarantor shall not impair or affect in any way the validity of such service or any judgment rendered in such action or proceedings. Each Guarantor agrees that service upon such Guarantor or any such designee, appointee and agent as provided for herein shall constitute valid and effective personal service upon such Guarantor with respect to matters contemplated in this Section 7.2 and that the failure of any such designee, appointee and agent to give any notice of such service to such Guarantor shall not impair or affect in any way the validity of such service or any judgment rendered in any action or proceeding based thereon. Nothing herein shall, or shall be construed so as to, limit the right of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders to bring actions, suits or proceedings with respect to the obligations and liabilities of any Guarantor under, or any other matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment rendered in any such action, suit or proceeding, in the courts of whatever jurisdiction in which the respective offices of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders may be located or assets of such Guarantor may be found or as otherwise shall to Administrative Agent or the Lenders seem appropriate, or to affect the right to service of process in any jurisdiction in any other manner permitted by law.

(a) 
No remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Administrative Agent or any Lender is intended to be exclusive of any other available remedy or remedies, but each and every such remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given under this Guaranty now or hereafter existing at law or in equity. No delay or omission to exercise any right or power accruing upon any default, omission or failure of performance hereunder shall impair any such right or power or shall be construed to be a waiver
           F-1-15    
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
  
   
  
   
  
   
   
   
 
thereof but any such right or power may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient. In order to entitle the Administrative Agent or any Lender to exercise any remedy reserved to it under the Guaranty, it shall not be necessary for such Administrative Agent or Lender to physically produce the Loan Documents in any proceedings instituted by it or to give any notice, other than such notice as may be herein expressly required.
 
 (b) 
The Guarantors will pay all sums becoming due under this Guaranty by the method and at the address specified for such purpose in the Credit Agreement, or by such other reasonable method or at such other address as the Administrative Agent or the Lenders shall have from time to time specified to the Guarantors in writing for such purpose, without the presentation or surrender of this Guaranty or any Loan Documents.
 
(c)

(d) 
If the whole or any part of this Guaranty shall be now or hereafter become unenforceable against any one or more of the Guarantors for any reason whatsoever or if it is not executed by any one or more of the Guarantors, this Guaranty shall nevertheless be and remain fully binding upon and enforceable against each other Guarantor as if it had been made and delivered only by such other Guarantors.
 
(e) 
This Guaranty shall be binding upon each Guarantor and its successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the Administrative Agent and each Lender and its successors and assigns whether so expressed or not, until the Termination Date.
