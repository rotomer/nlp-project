Exhibit 99.1 DeVry Inc. Reports Fiscal 2007 Second-Quarter Results Earnings Increased 51 Percent on Record Revenues OAKBROOK TERRACE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 25, 2007--DeVry Inc. (NYSE: DV), an international higher education company, reported today financial results for the fiscal 2007 second quarter and the six-month period ended December 31, 2006. Revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 increased 13.2 percent to $237.5 million, compared to $209.9 million for the same quarter one year ago. For the six-month period of fiscal 2007, revenues were up 12.7 percent to $458.2 million compared to $406.6 million last year. Net income increased 51.4 percent for the quarter to $16.4 million, or $0.23 per fully diluted share, compared to $10.8 million, or $0.15 per fully diluted share, for the same period last year. For the first half of fiscal 2007, net income increased 140 percent to $37.3 million, or $0.52 per fully diluted share, compared to $15.6 million, or $0.22 per fully diluted share, for the first half of fiscal 2006. Net income in the first half of fiscal 2007 includes a gain on the sale of a DeVry University facility located in West Hills, Calif., of $11.8 million, net of tax, or $0.16 per share. During the quarter, the company announced the adoption of a dividend and stock repurchase program. The first dividend of $0.05 per share was paid on January 12 to common stockholders of record as of December 20, 2006. DeVry's board of directors stated its intent to declare dividends on a semi-annual basis, resulting in an annual dividend rate of $0.10 per share. The stock repurchase program allows the company to buy back up to $35 million of its common stock within the next two years. DeVry further reduced its outstanding debt, ending the fiscal 2007 second quarter with $50 million of debt and a strong cash position, as illustrated in the accompanying Chart 1. Also, as part of its overall financing strategy, DeVry recently entered into an amended credit agreement that will result in more favorable interest rates and borrowing terms. "We posted solid revenue increases and delivered improved bottom line results for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2007," said Daniel Hamburger, DeVry's president and chief executive officer. "In addition, we continued to strengthen our financial position and have taken actions with our overall financial strategy to drive shareholder value." DeVry University opened its second location in Tampa, Fla., in January and announced it will open a new location in Memphis, Tenn., this March, bringing its total number of locations to 84. The Memphis facility will offer both bachelor's and master's degree programs. As previously announced in December 2006, DeVry University achieved its sixth consecutive period of positive enrollment growth. New students increased 11.9 percent and total students increased 4.9 percent. DeVry University was once again cited by Diverse Issues in Higher Education as a top producer of minority graduates for select programs. Historical enrollment information and minority graduate rankings are provided as supplemental information to this press release as Charts 2 and 3, respectively. The company recently announced that Chamberlain College of Nursing has received approval to establish a new campus in Columbus, Ohio, with classes scheduled to begin in March 2007. Chamberlain will be co-located with the existing DeVry University campus. As a result of continued demand for highly-skilled accounting professionals, Becker Professional Review once again experienced strong results in the second quarter, with revenue increasing 49.5 percent over last year. Hamburger added, "We are pleased with our continued progress on our five-year strategic plan and the initiatives undertaken to drive future enrollment, revenue and earnings growth."
