Item 8.01 Other Events. On March 12, 2007, the Company announced a Voluntary Separation Plan (VSP). The Company notified eligible employees of this decision on March 12, 2007. The decision to take this action resulted from a thorough analysis which revealed that a reduction in the number of employees at the Company's DeVry University subsidiary was warranted to address the Company's cost structure and real estate utilization. The VSP will be offered at 22 of the Company's DeVry University campuses with 285 employees being eligible to participate, and separation of employment is expected to be effective on June 30, 2007. The Company anticipates that the pre-tax expenses associated with this VSP will be approximately $3-4 million, which consists primarily of severance and extended healthcare benefits coverage. The Company anticipates that these expenses will be recognized primarily over the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2007.
