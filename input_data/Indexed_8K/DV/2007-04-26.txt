Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition On April 26, 2007, DeVry Inc. issued a press release announcing the Company's fiscal 2007 third quarter operating results and 2007 spring term enrollments. The full text of that press release is included in Exhibit 99.1 in this Form 8-K. Item 8.01 Other Events. On April 26, 2007, DeVry Inc. issued a press release announcing an involuntary workforce reduction. The full text of that press release is included in Exhibit 99.1 in this Form 8-K. The decision to take this action was based on the results of the previously announced voluntary separation plan and resulted from a thorough analysis which revealed that a reduction in the number of employees at the Company's DeVry University subsidiary was warranted to address the Company's cost structure and real estate utilization. This involuntary workforce reduction will affect approximately 145 DeVry University campus-based employees. The Company anticipates that the pre-tax expenses associated with this involuntary workforce reduction will be approximately $2.6 million, which consists primarily of severance and extended healthcare benefits coverage. The Company anticipates that these expenses will be recognized primarily over the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007. Forward-Looking Statements This Form 8-K and the related press release contain forward-looking statements within the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than those that are purely historical are forward-looking statements. Words such as "expect," "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "intend," "plan," and similar expressions also identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements regarding the anticipated timing, number of impacted employees, savings, and pre-tax expenses associated with the reduction in employees at the Company's DeVry University subsidiary. Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements including, without limitation, the risk that subsequent unanticipated events, including unanticipated costs, may occur in connection with the reduction in employees. Additional information regarding factors that could cause results to differ can be found in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. Readers should also consult the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2006. These forward-looking statements are based on information as of April 26, 2007, and the Company assumes no obligation to publicly update or revise its forward-looking statements even if experience or future changes make it clear that any projected results expressed or implied therein will not be realized.

Exhibit 99.1 DeVry Inc. Reports Fiscal 2007 Third-Quarter Results, Enrollment at DeVry University, Ross University Debt Free at Quarter End OAKBROOK TERRACE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 26, 2007--DeVry Inc. (NYSE: DV), an international higher education company, reported today its financial results for the fiscal 2007 third quarter and the nine-month period ended March 31, 2007, and spring enrollment at DeVry University and Ross University. Revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 increased 12.5 percent to $247.8 million, compared to $220.2 million for the same quarter one year ago. For the nine-month period of fiscal 2007, revenues were up 12.6 percent to $706.0 million compared to $626.9 million last year. Net income increased 46.2 percent for the quarter to $22.9 million, or $0.32 per fully diluted share, compared to $15.7 million, or $0.22 per fully diluted share, for the same period last year. For the first nine months of fiscal 2007, net income increased 92.8 percent to $60.2 million, or $0.85 per fully diluted share, compared to $31.2 million, or $0.44 per fully diluted share, for the first nine months of fiscal 2006. Net income in the first nine months of fiscal 2007 includes a gain on the sale of a DeVry University facility located in West Hills, Calif., of $11.8 million, net of tax, or $0.16 per share. Third-quarter and nine-month results include a pre-tax gain of approximately $1.0 million for the sale of excess land in Tinley Park, Ill. The pre-tax gain was offset by a severance charge of $1.1 million pre-tax for the previously announced Voluntary Separation Plan for eligible DeVry University campus-based employees. The company expects charges related to this program in the fourth quarter of $2.6 million pre-tax. Based on the results of the voluntary separation plan, today the company announced an involuntary workforce reduction that will affect approximately 145 employees at DeVry University campuses. The company expects to incur a charge of approximately $2.6 million related to severance charges from this involuntary reduction in the fourth quarter. Annual savings are expected to be approximately $10 million per year as a result of these voluntary and involuntary plans. "We take these difficult decisions seriously and have endeavored to conduct these plans with respect for the individual," said Daniel Hamburger, president and chief executive officer. " In line with our strategic plan, we are focused on realigning our cost structure with our revenue streams and making investments to support high growth areas such as DeVry University Centers, online education, Ross University and Chamberlain College of Nursing." At DeVry University, new undergraduate student enrollment in spring 2007 increased 6.9 percent to 11,075 students, compared to 10,359, in spring 2006. Total undergraduate student enrollment in spring 2007 increased 5.5 percent to 40,637 students, compared to 38,523 students in the previous year. For the January 2007 session, the number of graduate coursetakers at Keller Graduate School of Management increased 10.9 percent to 15,278, compared to 13,776 coursetakers in January 2006. In the March 2007 session, graduate coursetakers increased 5.2 percent to 14,756 from 14,029 in the prior year. The total number of online undergraduate and graduate coursetakers in spring 2007 increased 22.5 percent to 35,417, compared to 28,912 last year. DeVry University opened a new location in San Jose, Calif., in March, and in April announced a new Master of Science in Educational Technology program, marking the first master's degree program that will be offered solely under the DeVry University brand. At Ross University, new students increased 28.2 percent to 496 in the January 2007 term, compared to 387 in the same term last year. Total students increased 14.8 percent to 3,747, compared to 3,264 last year. As a result of continued demand for accounting and finance professionals, DeVry's professional and training segment once again experienced strong results in the third quarter, with revenue increasing almost 17 percent over last year. Mr. Hamburger added, "As a result of our efforts to optimize our core business, we continued to show year-over-year improvement in spring enrollment results. We are pleased with these overall results and will continue to implement our multi-year plan to improve enrollment at our campuses." In November 2006, the company adopted a stock repurchase program which allows for the repurchase of up to $35 million of its common stock within the next two years. During the quarter, the company purchased approximately 194,000 shares of DeVry common stock for approximately $5.3 million. DeVry further reduced its outstanding debt during the quarter, ending the fiscal 2007 third quarter with no debt and cash of $135.8 million, as illustrated in the accompanying Chart 1.
