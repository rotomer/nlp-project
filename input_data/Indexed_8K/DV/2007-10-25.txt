Exhibit 99.1 DeVry Inc. Announces Strong Fiscal 2008 First-Quarter Results Increased revenue and operating leverage drive significant earnings growth during the quarter OAKBROOK TERRACE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 25, 2007--DeVry Inc. (NYSE:DV), a global provider of educational services, reported financial results for the fiscal 2008 first quarter and September 2007 enrollment at Ross University and Keller Graduate School of Management. Revenues in the first quarter increased 14.2 percent to $250.3 million, compared with $219.2 million for the same quarter one year ago. Net income for the first quarter was $26.8 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared to $20.9 million, or $0.29 per diluted share last year. Net income in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 includes the up front loss of $2.3 million, net of tax, or $0.03 per share, from the sale/leaseback transactions at Phoenix, Seattle, and Alpharetta, Ga., while last year's results included the gain from the West Hills facility sale, which was $11.8 million, net of tax, or $0.16 per share. Excluding these discrete items from both years, net income for the first quarter totaled $29.1 million in fiscal 2008 versus $9.1 million in fiscal 2007, an increase of 221 percent, while earnings per share totaled $0.40 in fiscal 2008 versus $0.13 in fiscal 2007, an increase of 208 percent. Preliminary operating segment results are included in the financial statements in today's announcement. "The strong earnings results during the first quarter were driven by double-digit revenue growth across all three of our operating segments, combined with the operating leverage we achieved from our cost management focus and the impact of our real estate optimization plan," said Daniel Hamburger, DeVry's president and chief executive officer. "While we expect to achieve further operating leverage in the coming quarters, we anticipate higher levels of spending on facilities, personnel and systems infrastructure to support long-term growth." During the first quarter, DeVry University opened new locations in Nashville, Tenn., Detroit, and Bakersfield, Calif. For the September 2007 session, the total number of coursetakers at DeVry University's Keller Graduate School of Management (KGSM) reached a record high of 15,857 coursetakers compared to 14,069 coursetakers in the September 2006 session, an increase of 12.7 percent. Fall 2007 enrollment results for DeVry University and the November session at KGSM will be reported December 6. The number of new students enrolled at Ross University for the September 2007 term was 572 compared to 628 in the previous year, a decrease of 8.9 percent. The decrease is related to a higher number of transfer students last year along with near term capacity constraints during Ross' peak September enrollment period. The total number of students enrolled for the same period increased 4.3 percent to 3,885, compared to 3,724 last year. Ross University continues to make investments in faculty, classrooms, laboratories, and student housing to respond to capacity constraints and continued strong student demand for medical and veterinary medical education. During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, DeVry repurchased approximately 155,000 shares of its common stock at cost of approximately $5.4 million. To date, approximately 510,500 shares of DeVry stock have been purchased on the open market as part of this program for a total of $15.9 million at an average cost of $31.22 per share. Recently, DeVry signed an agreement to acquire Advanced Academics Inc. (AAI), a leading provider of online secondary education. AAI supplements traditional classroom programs through online course instruction using highly qualified teachers and a proprietary technology platform specifically designed for secondary education. The acquisition is an investment in a high growth market and consistent with DeVry's strategy to aggressively grow online and to diversify its program offerings.
