If the inspectors consider other reliable information for the limited purpose permitted herein, the inspectors at the time they make their certification pursuant to subsection (b)(v) of this Section 7 shall specify the precise information considered by them including the person or persons from whom they obtained the information, when the information was obtained and the basis for the inspectors' belief that such information is accurate and reliable.

The Corporation shall indemnify any Director or officer of the Corporation and may, upon the act of the Board of Directors, indemnify any other person whom it shall have the power to indemnify under Section 145 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he or she is or was acting in his or her official capacity as a Director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, as the case may be, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable in the performance of his or her duty to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
Section 3.  To the extent that a Director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Sections 1 and 2 of this article, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he or she shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection therewith.
Section 4.  Any indemnification under Sections 1 and 2 of this article (unless ordered by a Court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the Director, officer employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Sections 1 and 2 of this article.  Such determination shall be made (1) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (2) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable a quorum of disinterested Directors so directs, by
10
independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (3) by the stockholders.
Section 5.  Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding as authorized by the Board of Directors in the manner provided in Section 4 of this article upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Director, officer, employee or agent to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation under this article.
Section 6.  The Corporation shall indemnify any Director or officer of the Corporation and may, upon the act of the Board of Directors, indemnify any other person whom it shall have power to indemnify under Section 145 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, (i) arising under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act or 1974 or regulations promulgated thereunder, or under any other law or regulation of the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof or law or regulation of any state or political subdivision or any agency or instrumentality of either, or under the common law of any of the foregoing, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, penalties, taxes and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonable incurred by him or her in connection with such action, suit or proceeding by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a fiduciary, disqualified person or party in interest with respect to an employee benefit plan covering employees of the Corporation or of a subsidiary corporation, or is or was serving in any other capacity with respect to such plan, or has or had any obligations or duties with respect to such plan by reason of such laws or regulations, provided that such person was or is a Director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or (ii) under revenue or taxation laws or regulations, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, penalties, taxes, amounts paid in settlement and amounts paid as penalties or fines necessary to contest the imposition of such penalties or fines, actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with such action, suit or proceeding by reason of the fact that he or she is or was acting in his or her official capacity as a Director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, as the case may be, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise and had responsibility for or participated in activities relating to compliance with such revenue or taxation laws and regulations; provided, however, that such person did not act dishonestly or in willful or reckless violation of the provisions of the law or regulation under which such suit or proceeding arises.  Unless the Board of Directors determines that under the circumstances then existing, it is probable that such Director, officer, employee or agent will not be entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation under this section, expenses incurred in defending such suit or proceeding, including the amount of any penalties or fines necessary to be paid to contest the imposition of such penalties or fines, shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Director, officer, employee or agent to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation under this section.
Section 7.  The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, and granted
11
pursuant to, this article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those indemnified or advanced expenses may be entitled under any by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official capacity and as to action in his or her official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a Director or officer who has ceased to be a Director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of the Director or officer, and may, upon such act of the Board of Directors, continue as to such other persons and inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such other persons.
Section 8.  The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a Director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not he or she would be entitled to indemnity against such liability under the provisions of this article.
