New undergraduate student enrollment for fall 2007 increased 10.7 percent to 13,204 students compared with 11,930 in the previous year. Total undergraduate student enrollment increased 10.3 percent to 44,594 students compared to 40,434 in fall 2006. This was DeVry University's ninth consecutive period of positive undergraduate new student growth and the sixth consecutive period of positive total student enrollment growth.

The total number of online undergraduate and graduate coursetakers in the November 2007 session increased 28.0 percent to 41,128 compared with 32,123 in the same term a year ago. "Initiatives to increase enrollments produced very favorable undergraduate student results in the fall at DeVry University and robust growth at Keller Graduate School of Management in the November session. These results were driven by improvements made to our recruiting processes, strong demand for online programs, and a heightened focus on the retention of existing students," said Daniel Hamburger, president and chief executive officer of DeVry Inc. "We're making progress in attracting recent high school graduates and we believe much of the opportunity still lies ahead. We also remain focused on better utilization of our real estate assets." Financial results for the company's fiscal 2008 second quarter will be announced after-market on January 24, 2008, with a conference call to follow at 3:30 p.m. Central time.
