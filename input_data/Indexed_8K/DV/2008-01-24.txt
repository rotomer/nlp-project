Six Months Ended December 31
For the first six months of fiscal 2008, revenues were up 15.2 percent to $524.1 million compared to $454.8 million last year. Trailing twelve month revenues crossed the $1 billion mark.
Operating income increased 47.6 percent to $80.8 million in the first half of fiscal 2008 compared to $54.8 million for the same period last year.
Net income for the first six months of fiscal 2008 increased 67.9 percent to $62.6 million compared to $37.3 million in the same period last year. In the first half of fiscal 2008 diluted earnings per share were $0.87 compared with $0.52 per diluted share last year, an increase of 67.3 percent. Six-month diluted weighted average shares outstanding increased to 72,274,000 in fiscal 2008 from 71,162,000 in fiscal 2007.
Net income in the first half of fiscal 2008 includes the up front loss of $2.3 million, net of tax, or $0.03 per share, from the sale/leaseback transactions at Phoenix, Seattle, and Alpharetta, Ga., while last years results included the gain from the West Hills, Calif., facility sale, which was $11.8 million, net of tax, or $0.16 per share. Excluding these discrete items from both years, net income for the first half totaled $64.9 million in fiscal 2008 versus $25.5 million in fiscal 2007, an increase of 155 percent, while six-months earnings per share totaled $0.90 in fiscal 2008 versus $0.36 in fiscal 2007, an increase of 150 percent.
In the first half of fiscal 2008, we successfully executed on many of our strategic initiatives - growing our total student population through improved new student recruiting and better retention, opening new locations and diversifying into secondary education through the acquisition of Advanced Academics, said Daniel Hamburger, DeVrys president and chief executive officer. Earnings were strong as a result of solid revenues, operating leverage and disciplined cost management, as well as the timing of certain marketing and personnel-related expenses now likely to occur in the second half of the year.
Hamburger added, We will be making important investments in our technology infrastructure, marketing, recruiting, and student services in the second half of fiscal 2008. These actions, which will add to our costs and impact earnings for the remainder of the fiscal year, are designed to further enhance quality and support growth over the longer term.
