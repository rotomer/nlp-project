EXHIBIT INDEX

Exhibit 99.1
DeVry Inc. Reports Strong Fiscal 2008 Third-Quarter Results,
Enrollment at DeVry University, Ross University
OAKBROOK TERRACE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--DeVry Inc. (NYSE: DV), a global provider of educational services, reported today its financial results for the fiscal 2008 third quarter and the nine-month period ended March 31, 2008. DeVry also reported enrollment at DeVry University and Ross University.
Three Months Ended March 31
Revenues in the fiscal 2008 period increased 18.4 percent to $291.0 million, compared with $245.8 million for the same quarter one year ago.
Operating income in the fiscal 2008 period was $50.6 million compared to $29.6 million for the same period last year, an increase of 70.9 percent.
Net income for the fiscal 2008 period was $38.3 million compared to $22.9 million in the same period last year, an increase of 67.2 percent. In the fiscal 2008 period diluted earnings per share were $0.53 compared with $0.32 per diluted share last year, an increase of 65.6 percent. Third-quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding increased to 72,515,000 in fiscal 2008 from 71,512,000 in fiscal 2007.
Nine Months Ended March 31
In the fiscal 2008 period, revenues were up 16.3 percent to $815.0 million compared to $700.6 million last year.
Operating income increased 55.8 percent to $131.4 million in the fiscal 2008 period compared to $84.3 million for the same period last year.
Net income for the fiscal 2008 period increased 67.6 percent to $101.0 million compared to $60.2 million in the same period last year. In the fiscal 2008 period diluted earnings per share were $1.40 compared with $0.85 per diluted share last year, an increase of 64.7 percent. Nine-month diluted weighted average shares outstanding increased to 72,358,000 in fiscal 2008 from 71,279,000 in fiscal 2007.
Net income in the first nine months of fiscal 2008 includes the up front loss of $2.3 million, net of tax, from the sale/leaseback transactions at Phoenix, Seattle, and Alpharetta, Ga. Fiscal 2007 results included gains from the West Hills, Calif., facility and Tinley Park, Ill., excess land sales. These gains were partially offset by severance related costs for workforce reductions, netting $11.8 million, after-tax. Excluding these discrete items from both years, net income for the first nine months totaled $103.2 million in fiscal 2008 versus $48.5 million in fiscal 2007, an increase of 113 percent, while nine-month earnings per share totaled $1.43 in fiscal 2008 versus $0.68 in fiscal 2007, an increase of 110 percent.
We are pleased with the strong performance from all our operations through the first nine months of fiscal 2008, said Daniel Hamburger, DeVry Inc.s president and chief executive officer. Continued improvements in the new student recruiting process and robust market demand for our high-quality programs resulted in solid enrollment results in the spring. These results combined with operating leverage enabled DeVry to deliver another quarter of outstanding earnings growth.
Hamburger added, As we indicated last quarter, investments in marketing, recruiting, information technology and human resources will continue into the fourth quarter. Although these actions will increase our costs in the near term, we believe they will help us achieve even greater long-term momentum.
