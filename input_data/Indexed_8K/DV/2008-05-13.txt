In addition, the Company announced its Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program, which allows the company to buy back up to $50 million of its common stock through December 31, 2010. The timing and amount of any repurchase will be determined by management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. These repurchases may be made through the open market, including block purchases, or in privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. The buyback will be funded through available cash balances and/or borrowings, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
