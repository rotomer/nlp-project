DeVry has informed the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, which is working with the Department of Justice, that it will cooperate fully with the inquiry and furnish the requested information and documents.

Forward Looking Statements
         This Form 8-K and the related press release contain forward-looking statements within the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than those that are purely historical are forward-looking statements. Words such as expect, anticipate, believe, estimate, intend, plan, and similar expressions also identify forward-looking statements.

Additional information regarding factors that could cause results to differ can be found in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007.
         These forward-looking statements are based on information as of May 19, 2008, and the Company assumes no obligation to publicly update or revise its forward-looking statements even if experience or future changes make it clear that any projected results expressed or implied therein will not be realized.
