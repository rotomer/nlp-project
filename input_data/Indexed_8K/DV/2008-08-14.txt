Exhibit 99.1
DeVry Inc. Reports Record Year-End Results
Fiscal year 2008 diluted EPS increases 62 percent to $1.73
OAKBROOK TERRACE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--DeVry Inc. (NYSE:DV), a global provider of education services, reported today its financial results for the fiscal fourth quarter and full year ended June 30, 2008. DeVry also reported enrollment results at DeVry University, including its Keller Graduate School of Management, Chamberlain College of Nursing and Ross University.
Three Months Ended June 30
Revenues increased 18.9 percent to $276.8 million, compared with $232.8 million a year ago.
Operating income increased 72.5 percent to $30.9 million, compared to $18.0 million for the same period last year.
Net income increased 54.0 percent to $24.6 million from $16.0 million in the same period last year, while fully diluted earnings per share in the quarter increased 54.5 percent to $0.34, compared with $0.22 per diluted share last year.
Twelve Months Ended June 30
For the full year, fiscal 2008 revenues increased 17.0 percent to $1,091.8 million, from $933.5 million last year.
Operating income rose 58.7 percent to $162.3 million, compared with $102.3 million in 2007.
Net income for the fiscal year 2008 increased 64.8 percent to $125.5 million from $76.2 million in 2007. Fully diluted earnings per share were $1.73 versus $1.07 in the prior year, an increase of 61.7 percent.
The 2008 full year results include the net loss of $2.3 million from sale/leaseback transactions at the companys Phoenix, Seattle, and Alpharetta, Ga., campuses reported earlier this year. Fiscal 2007 results included a net gain of $12.7 million related to gains from the sales of land in West Hills, Calif., and Tinley Park, Ill., which were partially offset by severance related costs for workforce reductions. Excluding these discrete items from both years, full-year net income of $127.8 million for the fiscal year 2008, represents an increase 90 percent compared to the prior year.
Fiscal 2008 was an outstanding year, delivering record revenue and earnings. We made excellent progress expanding student enrollments and improving academic quality in all of our schools, said Daniel Hamburger, DeVrys president and chief executive officer. We invested in marketing, recruiting, information technology and people across our businesses. At the same time, we optimized our real estate and improved operational efficiency throughout the year to enhance margins.
Mr. Hamburger added, The recently announced acquisition of U.S. Education Corporation marks a major step in DeVrys strategy to increase our presence in healthcare and to broaden our offerings at the pre-baccalaureate level. The addition of 17 campuses in the western U.S. will also help us extend our programs beyond Ross and Chamberlain to a wider array of students seeking high-demand healthcare careers through certificate and associate degree programs.
Business Highlights
DeVry University
Enrollment Results:
DeVry University continued to show strong undergraduate enrollment growth with new summer enrollments increasing 19.3 percent to 16,595 compared to 13,906 last year. Total student enrollments were up 12.6 percent to 45,907 students versus 40,774 in the prior year. Total graduate coursetakers including Keller Graduate School of Management (KGSM) in July 2008 totaled 16,017, up 14.2 percent versus 14,023 for the same period in 2007. In May 2008 total coursetakers increased 15.7 percent to 16,537 from last years 14,290.
Meeting the market demand for additional online offerings, DeVry University introduced four new online degree programs during the quarter. The total number of online undergraduate and graduate coursetakers was 44,503 in July 2008, an increase of 24.0 percent over July 2007.
Academic Outcomes/Graduate Employment Statistics:
System-wide, 92.4 percent of DeVry Universitys graduates for the year ending October 2007 were in the active job market and employed in their fields within 6 months of graduation at an average starting salary of $43,635.
Ross University
In the 2008 May term, new students at Ross University increased 15.6 percent to 481, compared to 416 students last year. Total students increased 7.9 percent to 4,064 compared to 3,767 students in the same term last year. Last month, Ross University announced that it will open a new branch campus in Freeport, Grand Bahama in January 2009. Ross also announced several new affiliations for medical clinical rotations in the United States.
Chamberlain College of Nursing
Chamberlains summer enrollment almost doubled, to 2,176 students versus 1,089 last year. Strong demand for nursing programs and the opening of new campuses in Addison, Ill., and Phoenix in March 2008 contributed to the improvement.
Becker Professional Review
Continued strong demand for accounting and finance professionals resulted in Becker CPA Review and the Stalla Review for the CFA Exams serving approximately 50,000 students worldwide in fiscal 2008. Becker expanded its international scope recently by signing an exclusive provider agreement with the CFA Society of the United Kingdom to offer Stallas review programs.
Share Repurchase Update and Strong Balance Sheet
DeVry completed the $35 million stock repurchase program in April 2008. The average cost per share for this program was $38.53 per share. A second repurchase program, which was authorized by DeVrys Board of Directors in May 2008 for $50 million, has not yet been initiated due to considerations related to the acquisition of U.S. Education Corporation.
DeVrys strong cash flow from operations funded $51.6 million in capital expenditures for the fiscal year, excluding the purchase and immediate sale of the DeVry University Alpharetta campus. This amount includes the purchase of a building in Wood Dale, Ill., to support the continued growth of DeVrys online operations. DeVry expects fiscal 2009 capital spending to be approximately $65 to $70 million, excluding the acquisition of U.S. Education, for expanded student technology systems; spending related to the expansion of Ross new branch campus in Freeport; facility improvements; and continued geographic expansion within Chamberlain College of Nursing. At the end of the fiscal year, DeVry had zero debt and approximately $276.7 million in cash and marketable securities compared to $129.2 million a year ago.
Long-term Outlook
Consistent with our five-year strategic plan, DeVrys long term financial objective is to deliver double-digit revenue growth and roughly 20 percent compound annual earnings per share growth, said Mr. Hamburger. While there may be fluctuations on a short-term basis along the way, we are taking a long-term view of managing the business to drive growth, quality and increased margins.
