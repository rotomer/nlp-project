Item 7.01     Regulation FD Disclosure
On October 21, 2008, DeVry Inc. issued a press release announcing the U.S. Department of Justice has informed DeVry that it has declined to intervene in a lawsuit alleging DeVry submitted false claims to the U.S. Department of Education in violation of the False Claims Act.  The decision not to intervene came after the Department of Justice concluded its previously-announced inquiry into the allegations.  The lawsuit, which was unsealed as a result of the Governments decision not to intervene, was filed by a former DeVry employee over a year ago.  If the former employee elects to proceed with the lawsuit, DeVry intends to defend itself vigorously.
The full text of this press release is included in Exhibit 99.1 in this Form 8-K.
