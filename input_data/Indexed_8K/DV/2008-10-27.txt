Exhibit 99.1
DeVry Inc. Announces Fiscal 2009 First-Quarter Results
Increased revenues continue to drive strong earnings growth
Diluted EPS increases nearly 30 percent to $0.48
OAKBROOK TERRACE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 23, 2008--DeVry Inc. (NYSE:DV), a global provider of education services, reported today its fiscal 2009 first quarter financial results and September 2008 graduate enrollment at DeVry University, including its Keller Graduate School of Management, and Ross University.
Three Months Ended September 30
Revenues increased 21.3 percent to $303.7 million, compared with $250.3 million a year ago.
Operating income increased 38.1 percent to $46.8 million, compared with $33.9 million for the same period last year.
Net income increased 29.8 percent to $34.8 million from $26.8 million in the same period last year, while fully diluted earnings per share in the quarter increased 29.7 percent to $0.48, compared with $0.37 per diluted share last year.
Please note that fiscal 2008 first quarter net income included a $2.3 million loss, net of tax, or $0.03 per share, from the sale/leaseback transactions at Phoenix, Seattle, and Alpharetta, Ga. Excluding this discrete item from last year, fiscal 2009 first quarter operating income would have increased 24.4 percent; net income and earnings per share would have increased approximately 20.0 percent.
Our strong results in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 demonstrate that we are executing our strategic plan  increasing enrollment through improved marketing and recruiting, as well as further diversifying our offerings with the completion of the U.S. Education acquisition," said Daniel Hamburger, DeVrys president and chief executive officer. We continue to show sustained growth and believe that even in tough economic times, our diversified portfolio positions us well to achieve our long term growth goals and to maximize shareholder value.
Business Highlights
DeVry completed its acquisition of U.S. Education, the parent organization of Apollo College and Western Career College on September 18, 2008. Apollo College and Western Career College operate 17 campus locations in the western United States and prepare students for careers in the high-growth allied healthcare sector through certificate and associate degree programs. As previously disclosed, DeVry expects the addition of Apollo College and Western Career College to be marginally dilutive to earnings by about $0.01 per share in fiscal 2009 primarily because of amortization expense, and accretive to earnings in fiscal 2010 and beyond.
DeVry University
For the September 2008 session, total DeVry University graduate coursetakers, including its Keller Graduate School of Management, totaled 17,799, up 12.2 percent versus 15,857 for the same period in 2007. DeVry Universitys Fall 2008 undergraduate enrollment and November session graduate enrollment will be reported on December 4, 2008.
Ross University
At Ross University, in the 2008 September term, total students increased 8.8 percent to 4,219 compared to 3,876 students in the same term last year. New students increased 6.3 percent to 608, compared to 572 students last year. Ross University continues to make investments in faculty, classrooms, clinical affiliations, and student housing to respond to capacity constraints and continued strong demand for medical and veterinary medical education. Ross University is also making investments in preparation for its new clinical center in Freeport, Grand Bahama, scheduled to open January 2009.
Balance Sheet/Cash Flow
DeVry generated $96.8 million of operating cash flow during the fiscal 2009 first quarter, driven primarily by strong operating results. As of September 30, 2008, cash and short- and long-term investment balances totaled $242.3 million. Outstanding borrowings of $165.9 million were incurred to fund the acquisition of U.S. Education.
Conclusion
DeVry continues to provide access to high-quality education for career-minded students, while responding to the overwhelming market need for professionals in the healthcare, business, and technology sectors, added Hamburger. To that end, we are very pleased to add the quality programs of U.S. Education to our offerings. The integration of U.S. Education is on track and we look forward to realizing the numerous opportunities that this combination provides.
As we look to the future, I am pleased to work with Dr. Harold Shapiro, president emeritus of Princeton University, who will take over as board chair of DeVry Inc. at our annual stockholders meeting next month. Harolds experience, along with the continued support and counsel of Dennis Keller as a director emeritus, will help to guide our long-term strategies in the years to come, concluded Hamburger.
