Item 7.01  Regulation FD Disclosure
On September 18, 2008, DeVry Inc. (the "Company") completed the acquisition of U.S. Education Corporation ("USEC") from William Blair Capital Partners VII QP, L.P., ClearLight Partners, LLC and the other stockholders and optionholders of USEC.  Pursuant to the transaction, the Company purchased approximately 99% of the common stock and all of the preferred stock of USEC directly from the stockholders and acquired the remaining shares of USEC that were held by a minority stockholder through a "short-form" merger under the Delaware General Corporation Law.
On September 23, 2008, DeVry Inc. filed a Current Report on Form 8-K ("Initial Form 8-K") reporting on the completion of this acquisition.
On November 25, 2008, DeVry Inc. filed a Current Report on Form 8-K/A to amend and supplement the Initial Form 8-K to include financial statements and pro forma financial information required by Items 9.01(a) and 9.01(b) of Form 8-K.
This Current Report on Form 8-K contains quarterly pro forma financial information regarding the combined operations of DeVry Inc. and USEC.  This information, which is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K, is not required by Item 2.01 of Form 8-K, but is being provided as supplemental information.
Item 9.01 - Financial Statements and Exhibits
(b) Pro Forma Financial Information.
The following pro forma financial information is included in this report:
(i). Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Statements of Income of DeVry Inc. for the quarters ended September 30, 2007, December 31, 2007, March 31, 2008 and June 30, 2008 are attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
(c) Exhibits
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
The following unaudited Pro Forma Combined Statements of Income give effect to DeVry Inc's (DeVry's or the Company's) acquisition of all the outstanding shares of capital stock of U.S. Education Corporation ("USEC"), which was consummated on September 18, 2008. USEC is the parent organization of Apollo College and Western Career College.  USEC, headquartered in Mission Viejo, California, prepares students for careers in health care through certificate and associate degree programs in such fields as nursing, biotechnology, medical and dental assisting, dental hygiene, respiratory therapy, pharmacy tech, lab tech, physical therapy tech and vet tech.
Total consideration paid for USEC was $301,550,000 in cash, which includes the purchase price of $290,000,000, working capital adjustments of $8,185,000 and direct costs of $3,365,000.  The total consideration was comprised of $135,792,000 of internal cash resources, $120,000,000 of borrowings under DeVry's existing credit facility and approximately $45,758,000 of borrowings against its outstanding auction rate securities. The final purchase price is subject to adjustment based upon adjustments to actual working capital at the closing date.
The pro forma amounts recorded herein relating to the acquisition are subject to adjustment as DeVry has not yet completed the final allocation of the purchase price.  The purchase price is subject to final closing adjustments, the final valuation of the identifiable intangible assets acquired, and any deferred income tax impact on the aforementioned adjustments.  DeVry expects to finalize the purchase price and complete the allocations no later than the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.
The pro forma information is based on the historical financial statements of DeVry and USEC and gives effect to the transaction under the purchase method of accounting and the activity associated with financing the transaction with the assumptions and adjustments in the accompanying notes to the unaudited Pro Forma Combined Statements of Income.  Under the purchase method of accounting, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition.  The historical carrying values of all assets and liabilities except intangible assets and goodwill approximate fair value.  Accordingly, no adjustments to the corresponding carrying values were recorded with the exception of intangible assets and goodwill.
The unaudited Pro Forma Combined Statements of Income combine the results of operations of USEC with the results of operations of DeVry for the four quarters of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, as if the acquisition was consummated as of July 1, 2007.
The unaudited Pro Forma Combined Statements of Income have been prepared by DeVry management based upon the financial statements of DeVry and USEC.  These unaudited Pro Forma Combined Statements of Income may not be indicative of the results that actually would have occurred if the combination had been in effect on the dates indicated or which may be obtained in the future.  The unaudited Pro Forma Combined Statements of Income should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of USEC for the year ended June 30, 2008, as filed by DeVry with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under Form 8-K/A on November 25, 2008, and of DeVry contained in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, as filed with the SEC.
Certain reclassifications have been made in the unaudited Pro Forma Combined Statements of Income to conform USEC's reported amounts to be consistent with the presentation by DeVry.

The unaudited Pro Forma Combined Statements of Income combine the results of operations of DeVry and USEC as though the acquisition occurred on July 1, 2007.  The quarterly periods used for USEC in this combination were from the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008.   In combining the entities, the following pro forma adjustments have been made based on the preliminary purchase accounting allocations and may change based upon the final purchase price allocation:
(b)  Elimination of DeVry interest income.  The invested cash balances of DeVry would be reduced by the cash used to fund the acquisition. The interest earned on this invested cash is eliminated based on the Company's quarterly average investment interest rates for fiscal 2008 of 4.35% for the first quarter, 4.309% for the second quarter, 3.2886% for the third quarter and 3.1525% for the fourth quarter.
(c)  Elimination of USEC interest expense and deferred financing fee amortization.  The debt associated with this interest was repaid as part of this acquisition and would be eliminated from the combined Company. Interest paid on capital leases by USEC was not eliminated.
(d)  Interest expense on borrowings to effect acquisition.  These amounts were calculated using the quarterly average LIBOR in effect during fiscal 2008, adjusted for DeVry's required spread of 50 basis points on these rates of 5.9367% for the first quarter, 5.4219% for the second quarter, 3.7842% for the third quarter and 3.0874% for the fourth quarter.
(e)  Tax effects on above adjustments (a) through (d) using  the Company's estimated incremental effective tax rate applicable to this transaction for each of the quarters in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008
.
(f)  In January 2008, the campuses of Apollo College (consisting of two main campuses and six branch campuses owned by Apollo College, Inc. ("ACI") and one main campus owned by American Institute of Health Technology, Inc. ("AIHT")) changed their institutional accreditation from ABHES to the Accrediting Council of Independent Collages and Schools (ACICS). In conjunction with this change, $19,000,000 of identified intangible asset value ascribed to accreditation at the time of the acquisitions of AIHT and ACI was written off by USEC in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008.
