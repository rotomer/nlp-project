Exhibit 99.1
DeVry Inc. Announces Fall 2008 Enrollment at DeVry University
Strong Enrollment Growth Trend Continues
OAKBROOK TERRACE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 4, 2008--DeVry Inc. (NYSE: DV), a global provider of educational services, reported today its fall 2008 enrollment at DeVry University.
New undergraduate student enrollment for fall 2008 increased 19.7 percent to 15,811 students compared with 13,204 in the previous year. Total undergraduate student enrollment increased 16.9 percent to 52,146 students versus 44,594 in fall 2007.
Graduate coursetakers enrolled in masters degree programs at DeVry University and its Keller Graduate School of Management increased 13.7 percent in November 2008 to 17,803, compared to 15,657 for the same period in 2007.
The total number of online undergraduate and graduate coursetakers in the November 2008 session increased 25.5 percent to 51,628 versus 41,128 in the same session a year ago.
We delivered outstanding enrollment results at DeVry University in a challenging economic environment, driven by our focus on academic quality, said Daniel Hamburger, president and chief executive officer of DeVry Inc. At the same time, economic conditions and the continued mix shift toward online enrollments contributed to a decline in average course load per student. We plan to continue to make investments to support DeVry Universitys strategy of improving student retention through academic quality and customer service, increasing real estate utilization and enhancing marketing and recruiting.
