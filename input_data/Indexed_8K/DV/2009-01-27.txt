Exhibit 99.1
DeVry Inc. Announces Fiscal 2009 Second-Quarter Results
Strong enrollment growth drives increase in revenues and earnings
OAKBROOK TERRACE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 27, 2009--DeVry Inc. (NYSE:DV), a global provider of educational services, today reported financial results for its fiscal 2009 second-quarter and six-month period ended December 31, 2008. Financial highlights are as follows:
Three Months Ended December 31
Revenues increased 35.0 percent to $369.6 million, compared with $273.7 million a year ago.
Operating income increased 33.3 percent to $62.5 million, compared with $46.9 million for the same period last year.
Net income increased 19.7 percent to $42.9 million from $35.8 million in the same period last year, while fully diluted earnings per share in the quarter increased 20.4 percent to $0.59, compared with $0.49 per diluted share last year.
Six Months Ended December 31
Revenues increased 28.5 percent to $673.3 million, compared with $524.1 million a year ago.
Operating income increased 35.3 percent to $109.4 million, compared with $80.8 million for the same period last year.
Net income increased 24.0 percent to $77.7 million from $62.6 million in the same period last year, while fully diluted earnings per share in the quarter increased 23.0 percent to $1.07, compared with $0.87 per diluted share last year.
Note that results for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2009 include U.S. Education, which was acquired September 18, 2008. Note also that first half net income in fiscal 2008 included a $2.3 million loss, net of tax, or $0.03 per share, from sale/leaseback transactions. Net income and earnings per share for the first half of fiscal 2009 would have increased approximately 19.7 percent and 18.9 percent versus prior year, respectively, if discrete items from the same period in 2008 were excluded from the comparison.
In these turbulent times, we are especially pleased to report these results, which were driven by enrollment gains in the fall and our continued focus on academic outcomes, said Daniel Hamburger, DeVrys president and chief executive officer. There is one key measure of our success that cannot be found on our income statement or balance sheet  it is the employment rate of our graduates. A remarkable 92 percent of recent graduates from DeVry University were employed in their field of study within six months of graduation despite the weakening job market.
Business Highlights
DeVry University
As previously announced in December 2008, DeVry University new undergraduate enrollment increased 19.7 percent and total undergraduate enrollment rose 16.9 percent. At Keller Graduate school of Management (KGSM), the number of coursetakers in November 2008 increased 13.7 percent.
DeVry recently announced two transactions as part of its ongoing real estate optimization program. DeVry University signed a lease on a new green campus in Long Beach, Calif., furthering its presence in the Southern California market. Separately, it also entered into an agreement to buy out of a portion of its lease at DeVry Universitys Long Island City, New York, campus.
DeVry University and its Keller Graduate School of Management recently announced that two of its degree programs earned accreditation by the Project Management Institutes Global Accreditation Center. Kellers Master of Project Management degree and DeVry Universitys Project Management concentration within the undergraduate Business Administration degree program were awarded accreditation. DeVry University and Keller represent one of only 13 universities in the U.S. and 21 schools internationally to be granted this elite designation by the Project Management Institute, the worlds leading association for project management professionals.
System-wide, 92.1 percent of DeVry Universitys October 2007, February 2008 and June 2008 graduates in the active job market were employed in their fields of study with six months of graduation at an average starting salary of $45,376.
Ross University
Ross University opened its clinical training center in Freeport, Grand Bahama, and began courses in January. In addition, Ross welcomed two new board members  Dr. Connie R. Curran, the president of a consulting group specializing in healthcare services and human resources and current DeVry Inc. board member; and Dr. Alvin Richard Tarlov, a healthcare public policy expert.
Chamberlain College of Nursing
Chamberlain continues its plans for strategic geographic expansion in order to meet demand for nursing professionals. Applications have been submitted for a location in Jacksonville, Fla. Chamberlain is targeting an opening of that location in the fall pending approvals. Similarly, it is planning to expand its programs by offering an online Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) degree later this spring pending regulatory approvals.
Apollo College/Western Career College (U.S. Education)
The integration of Apollo College and Western Career College is proceeding on track. A breakout of the impact of the addition of these schools on Medical and Healthcare revenue and operating profit on a proforma basis is shown in the attached segment information. During the quarter, Apollo College introduced a new dental hygiene program at its Portland, Ore. campus.
Becker Professional Review
Beckers operations were affected by the continued deterioration in the financial services sector during the quarter. It expects these market conditions will persist at least through calendar 2009. Becker remains focused on long-term growth and is exploring additional markets and industries to further leverage its leadership in education for accounting and finance professionals.
New Student Information System (Project DELTA)
DeVry selected SunGard Higher Education to provide its new student information system for DeVry University and Chamberlain College of Nursing. SunGard Higher Education's Banner Unified Digital Campus system will be implemented to help increase levels of efficiency and strengthen student service. Total spending related to Project DELTA is expected to be $50 to $60 million over the next three years, the majority of which will be capitalized.
Balance Sheet/Cash Flow
DeVry generated $138.8 million of operating cash flow during the first six months of fiscal 2009, driven primarily by the continuation of strong operating results. As of December 31, 2008, cash, marketable securities and investment balances totaled $262.9 million and outstanding borrowings were $155.1 million.
Semi-Annual Common Stock Cash Dividend
In November, DeVrys Board of Directors approved a 33 percent increase in the companys dividend to $0.16 annually. A semi-annual dividend payment of $0.08 was made on January 9, 2009 to shareholders of record as of December 12, 2008.
Share Repurchase Plan
During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, DeVry repurchased approximately 98,100 shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $5.4 million, or $54.62 per share. These repurchases were made under DeVrys $50 million repurchase program.
Conclusion
We are mindful of the challenging economic environment we face and continue to invest in our growth opportunities while maintaining an appropriately conservative capital structure, added Hamburger. We believe this prudent approach to the execution of our strategic plan creates a balance that allows us to make investments in academic quality, student services and further diversification.
