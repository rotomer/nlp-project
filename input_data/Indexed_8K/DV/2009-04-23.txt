Exhibit 99.1
DeVry Inc. Announces Fiscal 2009 Third-Quarter Results
Record revenues driven by favorable enrollment trends
OAKBROOK TERRACE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 23, 2009--DeVry Inc. (NYSE:DV), a global provider of educational services, today reported financial results for its fiscal 2009 third-quarter and nine-month period ended March 31, 2009. DeVry also reported enrollment results at DeVry University (including its Keller Graduate School of Management), Chamberlain College of Nursing, Ross University, and U.S. Education (including Apollo College and Western Career College). DeVrys continued focus on student academic outcomes produced the following results:
Three Months Ended March 31
Revenues increased 34.7 percent to $391.9 million, compared with $291.0 million in the prior-year period.
Operating income increased 42 percent to $71.8 million, compared with $50.6 million for the same period last year.
Net income increased 32.8 percent to $50.9 million from $38.3 million in the same period last year.
Fully diluted earnings per share increased 32.1 percent to $0.70, compared with $0.53 per diluted share last year.
Nine Months Ended March 31
Revenues increased 30.7 percent to $1,065.2 million, compared with $815.0 million for the same period last year.
Operating income increased 37.9 percent to $181.1 million, compared with $131.4 million in the comparable prior-year period.
Net income increased 27.4 percent to $128.6 million compared with $101.0 million for the same period last year.
Fully diluted earnings per share in the period increased 26.4 percent to $1.77, compared with $1.40 per diluted share in the prior year.
Third-quarter and nine-month results include the impact of U.S. Education, which was acquired on September 18, 2008. It should also be noted that net income in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 includes an after-tax charge of $2.5 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, related to the buyout of a portion of a lease at DeVry Universitys Long Island City, New York, campus. Excluding this charge, net income and earnings per share in the third quarter would have increased 39.4 percent and 39.6 percent, respectively.
We continued to see significant gains in enrollment, as prospective students are attracted by our strong track record of high quality education and career outcomes, said Daniel Hamburger, DeVrys president and chief executive officer. I am very pleased with the progress we have made in improving academic quality across all of our schools, growing enrollment, and further diversifying our offerings. Our strong enrollment and improved retention are providing a quality base of revenue, which we expect will help propel future growth.
Business Highlights
DeVry University
DeVry University continued to report strong undergraduate enrollment growth, with new spring enrollments increasing 15.1 percent to 14,288 compared with 12,410 last year. Total student enrollment increased 18.8 percent to 53,259 students, compared with 44,814 in spring 2008.
For the January 2009 session, graduate coursetakers enrolled in masters degree programs at DeVry University and its Keller Graduate School of Management rose to 19,475, an increase of 12.1 percent over January 2008. For the March 2009 session, the number of graduate coursetakers was 19,357, an increase of 13.8 percent over prior year.
The total number of online undergraduate and graduate coursetakers in the March 2009 session increased 27.0 percent to 55,745 versus 43,889 in the same session a year ago.
During the quarter, DeVry University unveiled a new academic structure that more clearly defines the distinct academic disciplines available across the university. Included in the new structure are:
The College of Business and Management
- Keller Graduate School of Management
The College of Engineering and Information Sciences
The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences
The College of Media Arts and Technology
The College of Health Sciences
This new structure provides a home for all degrees at all levels, including flexibility for future curricula. Furthermore, it adopts an organization that is more familiar to students.
Ross University
In the January 2009 term at Ross University, new students increased 10.9 percent to 611, and total student enrollment rose to 4,323 students, an increase of 7.8 percent over the January 2008 term. Ross continues to expand its facilities and faculty and is moving forward with its plans for a permanent clinical facility in Freeport, Grand Bahama.
Chamberlain College of Nursing
Chamberlain's new student enrollment in spring 2009 increased 68.1 percent to 763 students, compared to 454 in spring 2008. Total student enrollment rose 104.5 percent to 3,722 students compared with 1,820 during the same period last year.
During the quarter, Chamberlain received all necessary regulatory approvals to offer an online Master of Science in Nursing degree, which will launch this summer. In addition, last month Chamberlain received a five-year approval for the associates degree program at its Columbus, Ohio, location. Chamberlain expects to open a new campus in Jacksonville, Fla., this summer, pending final approvals.
Apollo College/Western Career College (U.S. Education)
New student enrollment at U.S. Education rose 26.8 percent to 4,323 compared with 3,408 in spring 2008. Total enrollment increased 21.8 percent to a record 10,928 students, compared with 8,973 for the same period last year.
Apollo College will launch its first online bachelors degree completion programs this summer. Beginning in July, Apollo College will offer a bachelors in both medical imaging and respiratory care. Apollo will utilize the DeVry Online Services technology platform, further leveraging DeVrys high quality resources such as faculty recruiting, curriculum development and student services.
Becker Professional Review
Revenues for Becker were flat during the quarter as a result of the ongoing weakness in the financial services sector. As previously disclosed, continued soft market conditions are anticipated at least through calendar 2009. Becker remains well-positioned for long-term growth in the accounting and finance fields.
Fanor Acquisition
On April 1, 2009, DeVry Inc. completed its acquisition of a majority stake in Fanor, a leading provider of private postsecondary education in northeastern Brazil. Under terms of the agreement, DeVry purchased an 82.3 percent stake in Fanor, including real estate and the reduction of Fanors debt, for a total cash outlay of $40.4 million.
Balance Sheet/Cash Flow
During the first nine months of fiscal 2009, DeVry generated $287.9 million of operating cash flow, primarily driven by the continuation of strong operating results. As of March 31, 2009, cash, marketable securities and investment balances totaled $354.2 million and outstanding borrowings were $135.1 million.
Share Repurchase Plan
During the third quarter of fiscal 2009, DeVry repurchased 206,683 shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $10.3 million, or $50.06 per share. As of March 31, 2009, 304,783 shares of DeVry stock have been purchased as part of the current program for a total of $15.7 million at an average cost of $51.53 per share.
Conclusion
We believe our philosophy of putting our students first and focusing on excellent academic and career outcomes is paying off, said Hamburger. We remain optimistic about DeVrys future prospects. Our focus on a strategy of diversification, integrity, and a commitment to quality academic outcomes should help us achieve steady financial performance during all economic cycles.

Selected Operating Data
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information and Supplemental Reconciliation Schedule
DeVry executed certain real estate transactions in the three and nine month periods ended March 31, 2009 and 2008, which resulted in significant lease termination charges and/or losses on the sale of facilities. The following table illustrates the effects of the real estate transactions on DeVrys earnings. Management believes that the non-GAAP disclosure of net income and earnings per share provides investors with useful supplemental information regarding the underlying business trends and performance of DeVrys ongoing operations and is useful for period-over-period comparisons of such operations given the discrete nature of these real estate transactions. DeVry uses these supplemental financial measures internally in its budgeting process. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, DeVrys reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table reconciles these items to the relevant GAAP information (in thousands, except per share data):
