(NYSE:DV), a global provider of educational services, today reported financial results for its fiscal 2009 fourth-quarter and full year ended June 30, 2009. DeVry also reported enrollment results at DeVry University, including its Keller Graduate School of Management (KGSM), Chamberlain College of Nursing, Ross University, and U.S. Education, which includes Apollo College and Western Career College. Strong enrollment and DeVrys continued focus on academic quality and student outcomes produced the following results:
Three Months Ended June 30

Operating income increased 73.5 percent to $53.7 million.
Net income increased 50.7 percent to $37.0 million.

Operating income rose 44.7 percent to $234.8 million.
Net income increased 31.9 percent to $165.6 million.
Fully diluted earnings per share increased 31.8 percent to $2.28.
Fiscal 2009 was a year of accomplishment for DeVry, said Daniel Hamburger, DeVrys president and chief executive officer. We made great strides in executing our strategic plan and expanding into educational areas that are in high demand. We also continued investing in our brands, programs and infrastructure. As a result, we experienced strong enrollment growth, improved retention throughout the year, and delivered record financial results.
Fourth-quarter and twelve-month results include the impact of U.S. Education, which was acquired on September 18, 2008, as well as a $4.9 million reserve, or $3.1 million after-tax, for a litigation settlement that is conditioned upon obtaining governmental approval.
Business Highlights
DeVry University
DeVry University continued to achieve strong undergraduate enrollment growth with new summer enrollments increasing 14.8 percent to 19,057 compared to 16,595 last year. Total student enrollments were up 21.9 percent to a record 55,979 students versus 45,907 in the prior year.
Total graduate coursetakers including Keller Graduate School of Management totaled 18,822 in May 2009, up 13.8 percent compared to the same period in 2008. In July 2009 total coursetakers increased 12.3 percent to 17,991 from the prior year.
The total number of online undergraduate and graduate coursetakers was a record 56,321 in July 2009, an increase of 26.6 percent over July 2008.
Ross University
In the May 2009 term at Ross University, new students increased 16.8 percent to 562, and total student enrollment rose to 4,448 students, an increase of 9.4 percent over the May 2008 term. Recently Ross University School of Medicine received full, four-year accreditation by the Caribbean Accreditation Authority for Education in Medicine and other Health Professions (CAAM-HP), in addition to its longstanding accreditation by the Dominica Medical Board.
Chamberlain College of Nursing
Chamberlain's new student enrollment in summer 2009 increased 51.9 percent to 1,558 students, compared to 1,026 students in summer 2008. Total student enrollment rose 77.8 percent to 4,302 students compared with 2,419 during the same period last year.
In July 2009, Chamberlain began offering classes at its new campus in Jacksonville, Fla. Recently it announced plans to relocate its St. Louis, Mo., campus in March 2010. Chamberlain will co-locate with DeVry University at the new site. Chamberlain also launched an online Master of Science in Nursing degree program in July.
Apollo College/Western Career College (U.S. Education)
New student enrollment at U.S. Education rose 15.4 percent to 4,411 compared with 3,821 for the period April 1 through July 31. Total enrollment increased 17.9 percent to 10,644 students for the same period, compared with 9,028 last year.
Apollo College developed its first online bachelors degree completion programs. Degree programs in medical imaging and respiratory care will be offered in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Apollo College's Mesa, Arizona campus also received approval for a new physical therapy assisting program starting in September 2009 and a new Dental Hygiene program starting early next year.
Western Career College received approval to offer four online associate degree programs starting in September. Western Career College also received approval to open a new campus in Pomona, Calif., in spring 2010, which will be co-located with DeVry University.
Becker Professional Education
Revenues for Becker grew 6.0 percent during the quarter, despite a tough economic environment. Becker continued to expand its relationships with key accounting and financial partners and remains well-positioned for long-term growth. The division was renamed Becker Professional Education to better emphasize its wide array of programs and services, and reflect its commitment to career-long learning for accounting, finance and project management professionals.
Fanor
The integration of Fanor is proceeding as planned. Beginning this quarter, Fanors results will be reported in the Other Educational Services segment (see new segment reporting section below). DeVry will report enrollment results at Fanor as part of next quarters results, given its academic calendar.
Balance Sheet/Cash Flow
For fiscal 2009, DeVry generated $249.5 million of operating cash flow, primarily driven by the continuation of strong operating results. As of June 30, 2009, cash, marketable securities and investment balances totaled $225.4 million and outstanding borrowings were $124.8 million.
Share Repurchase Plan
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, DeVry repurchased 402,750 shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $18.0 million, or $44.64 per share. As of June 30, 2009, 707,533 shares of DeVry stock have been purchased as part of the current program for a total of $33.7 million at an average cost of $47.61 per share.
Conclusion
DeVry is positioned for continued success in fiscal 2010, said Hamburger. While we recognize that comparisons on a percentage basis may be more difficult this coming year, we expect strong enrollments and continue to focus on long-term quality and growth. We will continue to put our students first and make prudent investments in our programs and infrastructure to support our growth and diversification strategy.

These forward-looking statements generally can be identified by phrases such as DeVry Inc. or its management "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "foresees," "forecasts," "estimates" or other words or phrases of similar import.

Selected Operating Data
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information and Supplemental Reconciliation Schedule
DeVry executed certain real estate transactions in fiscal years 2009 and 2008, which resulted in significant lease termination charges and losses on sale of facilities. Also, DeVry recorded a litigation settlement reserve in fiscal year 2009. The following table illustrates the effects of the real estate transactions and litigation reserve on DeVrys earnings. Management believes that the non-GAAP disclosure of net income and earnings per share provides investors with useful supplemental information regarding the underlying business trends and performance of DeVrys ongoing operations and are useful for period-over-period comparisons of such operations given the discrete nature of the real estate transactions and litigation settlement reserve. DeVry uses these supplemental financial measures internally in its budgeting process. However, the non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, DeVrys reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table reconciles these items to the relevant GAAP information (in thousands, except per share data):
