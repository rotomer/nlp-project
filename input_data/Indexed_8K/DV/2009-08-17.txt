Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers. (b) Pursuant to the Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the "Certificate of Incorporation") of DeVry Inc. (the "Company"), the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") is divided into three classes of directors that serve staggered three year terms. The Certificate of Incorporation provides that each class of directors must have, as nearly as possible, one-third of the total number of directors serving on the Board. Each of Mr. Robert C. McCormack and Mr. Charles A. Bowsher notified the Company on August 11, 2009 that he would retire from the Board effective at the Company's annual meeting of stockholders scheduled for November 11, 2009 (the "2009 Annual Meeting"), and therefore, he would not stand for re-election to the Board at such meeting. Without Mr. McCormack and Mr. Bowsher, the Board would have the following composition: five Class I directors, three Class II directors and two Class III directors. In order to address the resulting imbalance in the size of the classes, on August 11, 2009, the Board nominated Lyle Logan for election to Class III at the 2009 Annual Meeting, and Mr. Logan confirmed he will relinquish his position as a Class I director in the event he is elected to Class III.
