(b)
  
During the Restricted Period, the Executive will not, directly or indirectly, in any manner:  (i) hire or engage, or recruit, solicit or otherwise attempt to employ or retain or enter into any business relationship with, any Person who is or was an employee of or consultant to DeVry or its Affiliates within the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the termination of Executive's employment, (ii) induce or attempt to induce any person who is or was an employee of, or consultant to, DeVry or its Affiliates within the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the termination of Executive's employment, to leave the employ of DeVry or the relevant Affiliates, or in any way interfere with the relationship between DeVry, its Affiliates and any of their employees or consultants, (iii) employ or retain or enter into any business relationship with any person who was an employee of or consultant to DeVry or its Affiliates within the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the termination of Executive's employment, or (iv) recommend the hiring of, or provide a reference for any person who was an employee of or consultant to DeVry or its Affiliates (provided, however that the Executive may hire former employees and consultants to DeVry and its Affiliates after such former employees or consultants have ceased to be employed or otherwise engaged by DeVry or its Affiliates for a period of at least twelve (12) months).

(d)
  
The Executive acknowledges and agrees that the restrictions contained in this Section 13 with respect to time, geographical area and scope of activity are reasonable and do not impose a greater restraint than is necessary to protect the goodwill and other legitimate business interests of DeVry and its Affiliates.

However, if, at the time of enforcement of this Section 13, a court holds that the duration, geographical area or scope of activity restrictions stated herein are unreasonable under circumstances then existing or impose a greater restraint than is necessary to protect the goodwill and other business interests of DeVry and its Affiliates, the Parties agree that the maximum duration, scope or area reasonable under such circumstances will be substituted for the stated duration, scope or area and that the court will be allowed to revise the restrictions contained herein to cover the maximum duration, scope and area permitted by law, in all cases giving effect to the intent of the parties that the restrictions contained herein be given effect to the broadest extent possible.  The existence of any claim or cause of action by the Executive against DeVry, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, will not constitute a defense to the enforcement by DeVry of the provisions of Sections 10, 11, 12 or this Section 13, which Sections will be enforceable notwithstanding the existence of any breach by DeVry.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive will not be prohibited from pursuing such claims or causes of action against DeVry.  The Executive consents to DeVry notifying any future employer of the Executive of the Executive's obligations under Sections 10, 11, 12 and this Section 13 of this Agreement.
 
(e)
  
In the event of the breach or a threatened breach by the Executive of any of the provisions of Sections 10, 11, 12 or this Section 13, DeVry, in addition and supplementary to any other rights and remedies existing in its favor, will be entitled to seek specific performance and/or injunctive or other equitable relief (in the form of a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction and/or permanent injunction) from a court of competent jurisdiction in order to enforce or prevent any violations of the provisions hereof.
 
(f)
  
Upon the Executives written request, the CEO may, in the CEOs sole discretion, permit the Executive to engage in certain work or activity that is otherwise prohibited by this Agreement, if and only if the Executive first provides the CEO with written evidence satisfactory to the CEO, including assurances from any new employer of the Executive, that the contribution of Executives knowledge to that work or activity will not cause the Executive to disclose, base judgment upon, or use DeVrys trade secrets or other Confidential Information.  The Executive shall not engage in such work or activity unless and until the Executive receives written consent from the CEO.
 
11
 
(g)
  
Neither the CEOs consent under Section 13(f) nor DeVrys failure to seek enforcement of any restrictive covenant under this Agreement shall be deemed a consent or waiver by DeVry of any subsequent breach of this Agreement by the Executive and DeVry shall have the right to seek enforcement of this Agreement against the Executive for any breach not specifically consented to in writing by the CEO or DeVry.

However, if, at the time of enforcement of this Section 13, a court holds that the duration, geographical area or scope of activity restrictions stated herein are unreasonable under circumstances then existing or impose a greater restraint than is necessary to protect the goodwill and other business interests of DeVry and its Affiliates, the Parties agree that the maximum duration, scope or area reasonable under such circumstances will be substituted for the stated duration, scope or area and that the court will be allowed to revise the restrictions contained herein to cover the maximum duration, scope and area permitted by law, in all cases giving effect to the intent of the parties that the restrictions contained herein be given effect to the broadest extent possible.  The existence of any claim or cause of action by the Executive against DeVry, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, will not constitute a defense to the enforcement by DeVry of the provisions of Sections 10, 11, 12 or this Section 13, which Sections will be enforceable notwithstanding the existence of any breach by DeVry.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive will not be prohibited from pursuing such claims or causes of action against DeVry.  The Executive consents to DeVry notifying any future employer of the Executive of the Executive's obligations under Sections 10, 11, 12 and this Section 13 of this Agreement.
 
(e)

(f)
  
Upon the Executives written request, the CEO may, in the CEOs sole discretion, permit the Executive to engage in certain work or activity that is otherwise prohibited by this Agreement, if and only if the Executive first provides the CEO with written evidence satisfactory to the CEO, including assurances from any new employer of the Executive, that the contribution of Executives knowledge to that work or activity will not cause the Executive to disclose, base judgment upon, or use DeVrys trade secrets or other Confidential Information.  The Executive shall not engage in such work or activity unless and until the Executive receives written consent from the CEO.

(g)
  
Neither the CEOs consent under Section 13(f) nor DeVrys failure to seek enforcement of any restrictive covenant under this Agreement shall be deemed a consent or waiver by DeVry of any subsequent breach of this Agreement by the Executive and DeVry shall have the right to seek enforcement of this Agreement against the Executive for any breach not specifically consented to in writing by the CEO or DeVry.

During the Restricted Period, the Executive will not, directly or indirectly, in any manner:  (i) hire or engage, or recruit, solicit or otherwise attempt to employ or retain or enter into any business relationship with, any Person who is or was an employee of or consultant to DeVry or its Affiliates within the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the termination of Executive's employment, (ii) induce or attempt to induce any person who is or was an employee of, or consultant to, DeVry or its Affiliates within the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the termination of Executive's employment, to leave the employ of DeVry or the relevant Affiliates, or in any way interfere with the relationship between DeVry, its Affiliates and any of their employees or consultants, (iii) employ or retain or enter into any business relationship with any person who was an employee of or consultant to DeVry or its Affiliates within the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the termination of Executive's employment, or (iv) recommend the hiring of, or provide a reference for any person who was an employee of or consultant to DeVry or its Affiliates (provided, however that the Executive may hire former employees and consultants to DeVry and its Affiliates after such former employees or consultants have ceased to be employed or otherwise engaged by DeVry or its Affiliates for a period of at least twelve (12) months).
 
(c)
  
During the Restricted Period, the Executive will not, directly or indirectly:  (i) call on, solicit or service any Customer with the intent of selling or attempting to sell any service or product similar to, or competitive with, the services or products sold by DeVry or its Affiliates as of the date of the termination of Executive's employment, or (ii) in any way interfere with the relationship between DeVry, its Affiliates and any Customer, supplier, licensee or other business relation (or any prospective Customer, supplier, licensee or other business relationship) of DeVry or its Affiliates (including, without limitation, by making any negative or disparaging statements or communications regarding DeVry, its Affiliates or any of their operations, officers, directors or

investors).  This non-solicitation provision applies to those Customers, suppliers, licensees or other business relationships of DeVry with whom the Executive: (1) has had contact or has solicited at any time in the twelve (12) month period of time preceding the termination of the Executive's employment; (2) has supervised the services of any of DeVry's or Affiliates employees who have had any contact with or have solicited at any time during the twelve (12) month period of time preceding the termination of Executive's employment; or (3) has had access to any Confidential Information about such Customers, suppliers, licensees or other business relationships at any time during the twelve (12) month period of time preceding the termination of Executives employment.
 
(d)
  
The Executive acknowledges and agrees that the restrictions contained in this Section 13 with respect to time, geographical area and scope of activity are reasonable and do not impose a greater restraint than is necessary to protect the goodwill and other legitimate business interests of DeVry and its Affiliates.  In particular, the Executive agrees and acknowledges that DeVry is currently engaging in Business and actively marketing its services and products throughout the Restricted Area, that Executive's duties and responsibilities for DeVry and/or its Affiliates are co-extensive with the entire scope of DeVry's Business, that DeVry has spent significant time and effort developing and protecting the confidentiality of their methods of doing business, technology, customer lists, long term customer relationships and trade secrets and that such methods, technology, customer lists, customer relationships and trade secrets have significant value.  However, if, at the time of enforcement of this Section 13, a court holds that the duration, geographical area or scope of activity restrictions stated herein are unreasonable under circumstances then existing or impose a greater restraint than is necessary to protect the goodwill and other business interests of DeVry and its Affiliates, the Parties agree that the maximum duration, scope or area reasonable under such circumstances will be substituted for the stated duration, scope or area and that the court will be allowed to revise the restrictions contained herein to cover the maximum duration, scope and area permitted by law, in all cases giving effect to the intent of the parties that the restrictions contained herein be given effect to the broadest extent possible.  The existence of any claim or cause of action by the Executive against DeVry, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, will not constitute a defense to the enforcement by DeVry of the provisions of Sections 10, 11, 12 or this Section 13, which Sections will be enforceable notwithstanding the existence of any breach by DeVry.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive will not be prohibited from pursuing such claims or causes of action against DeVry.  The Executive consents to DeVry notifying any future employer of the Executive of the Executive's obligations under Sections 10, 11, 12 and this Section 13 of this Agreement.
 
(e)
  
In the event of the breach or a threatened breach by the Executive of any of the provisions of Sections 10, 11, 12 or this Section 13, DeVry, in addition and supplementary to any other rights and remedies existing in its favor, will be entitled to seek specific performance and/or injunctive or other equitable relief (in the form of a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction and/or permanent injunction) from a court of competent jurisdiction in order to enforce or prevent any violations of the provisions hereof.
 
11
 
(f)
  
Upon the Executives written request, the CEO may, in the CEOs sole discretion, permit the Executive to engage in certain work or activity that is otherwise prohibited by this Agreement, if and only if the Executive first provides the CEO with written evidence satisfactory to the CEO, including assurances from any new employer of the Executive, that the contribution of Executives knowledge to that work or activity will not cause the Executive to disclose, base judgment upon, or use DeVrys trade secrets or other Confidential Information.  The Executive shall not engage in such work or activity unless and until the Executive receives written consent from the CEO.
 
(g)
  
Neither the CEOs consent under Section 13(f) nor DeVrys failure to seek enforcement of any restrictive covenant under this Agreement shall be deemed a consent or waiver by DeVry of any subsequent breach of this Agreement by the Executive and DeVry shall have the right to seek enforcement of this Agreement against the Executive for any breach not specifically consented to in writing by the CEO or DeVry.
