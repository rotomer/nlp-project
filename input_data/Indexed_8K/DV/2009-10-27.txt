Exhibit 99.1
DeVry Inc. Announces Record First-Quarter Results
OAKBROOK TERRACE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 27, 2009--DeVry Inc. (NYSE:DV), a global provider of educational services, today reported financial results for its fiscal 2010 first-quarter ended September 30, 2009. DeVry also reported enrollment results at Ross University and Fanor, and graduate coursetakers at DeVry University. DeVrys continued execution of its growth and diversification strategy and its focus on academic quality produced the following financial results:
Three Months Ended September 30, 2009:
Revenues increased 42 percent to a record $431 million.
Operating income increased 70 percent to $79.4 million.
Net income increased 57 percent to $54.7 million.
Diluted earnings per share increased 58 percent to $0.76.
Our financial results this quarter were driven largely by exceptional revenue growth, said Daniel Hamburger, DeVrys president and chief executive officer. Our institutions continue to experience strong enrollment and student retention, as evidenced by our results at Keller, Ross and Fanor. These financial results provide the resources for us to continue to make investments that enhance academic quality, improve student services, and expand access to education.
Business Highlights
Business, Technology, and Management Segment
DeVry University
For the September 2009 session, total graduate coursetakers at DeVry University including its Keller Graduate School of Management, increased 15.2 percent to a record 20,496 versus 17,799 for the same period in 2008. DeVry Universitys fall 2009 undergraduate enrollment and November session graduate enrollment will be reported on Dec. 8, 2009.
DeVry University launched a new campaign to increase awareness of the re-organization of its academic degree programs into five distinct colleges. The multimedia campaign began running in September and will continue to run throughout the rest of the fiscal year. Consistent with its real estate optimization strategy, DeVry University announced plans to co-locate its Jacksonville, Fla., campus with Chamberlain College of Nursing by the end of the second quarter.
Medical and Healthcare Segment
Ross University
In the 2009 September term, new students increased 9.5 percent to 666, compared to 608 students last year. Total students increased 9.1 percent to 4,601 compared to 4,219 students in the same term last year. Ross University continues to make investments in its facilities, clinical affiliations, and student services to respond to continued strong demand for medical and veterinary medical education.
Chamberlain College of Nursing
In an articulation agreement with Keller Graduate School of Management, Chamberlain will launch a program where graduates of Chamberlains Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) program will receive course credits toward obtaining a Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree from Keller.
Chamberlain also announced plans to co-locate its campus with DeVry University in Crystal City, Va., and Chicago, and is targeting openings of those locations in summer 2010, pending approvals.
Apollo College/Western Career College (U.S. Education)
Apollo College and Western Career College launched their first ever online degree programs this September. Apollo College launched two online bachelors degree completion programs, and Western Career College launched four online associate degree programs. In addition, Apollo College opened its new campus in Reno, Nev., with a registered nursing degree program.
Professional Education Segment
Becker Professional Education
The Professional Education segment continued to be affected negatively by the impact of the soft economy and slowdown in hiring within the accounting and finance professions. Although conditions are not expected to materially improve throughout 2010, Becker Professional Education remains well-positioned for long-term growth. Beckers CPA line of products continues to be a valued resource for key accounting firms, and its Stalla Review for CFA Exams division now has affiliations with 15 of the top 20 CFA societies around the world.
Other Educational Services Segment
Advanced Academics
During the quarter, Advanced Academics (AAI) further expanded its presence in key states, such as California, where it established its first service contract with a charter school in Sonoma. In addition, it signed contracts to provide online educational content to 10 new school districts in five states across the country.
Fanor
For the September 2009 term, new students increased 13.6 percent to 2,151, compared to 1,893 students last year. Total students increased 10.6 percent to 11,532 compared to 10,424 students in the same term last year. Fanor continues to expand its curriculum and has received approval to launch a psychology degree program at its Fortaleza campus beginning next semester.
Balance Sheet/Cash Flow
For the first quarter, DeVry generated $177.2 million of operating cash flow, driven by the continuation of strong operating results and working capital management. As of September 30, 2009, cash, marketable securities and investment balances totaled $340.5 million and outstanding borrowings were $104.8 million.
Share Repurchase Plan
During the quarter, DeVry repurchased approximately 235,000 shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $11.7 million. As of Sept. 30, 2009, DeVry had repurchased more than $45 million of its $50 million program at an average cost of $48.12 per share, and expects to complete the current share repurchase program more than a year in advance of the authorization period.
Conclusion
Fiscal 2010 is off to a solid start and we are confident that this will be another strong year for us, said Hamburger. DeVry will continue to focus on the development of quality programs and services for our students and on opportunities to leverage synergies across our institutions for future growth.
