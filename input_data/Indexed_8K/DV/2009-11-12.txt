On November 11, 2009, DeVry Inc. issued a press release announcing that its board of directors approved a 25 percent dividend increase, raising its dividend from $0.16 to $0.20 per share annually.  Payable on a semi-annual basis, the next dividend payment of $0.10 will be made on January 7, 2010, to common stockholders of record as of December 11, 2009. The policy of the Board of Directors is that any payment of dividends will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will be dependent on the earnings and financial requirements of the Company and other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant.
In addition, the Company announced its board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program, which allows the company to buy back up to $50 million of its common stock through December 31, 2011. This new repurchase program is to commence upon completion of the existing $50 million program. The timing and amount of any repurchase will be determined by management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. These repurchases may be made through the open market, including block purchases, or in privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. The buyback will be funded through available cash balances and/or borrowings, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
The full text of this press release is included in Exhibit 99.1 in this Form 8-K.
