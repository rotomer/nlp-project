(NYSE:DV), a global provider of educational services, today reported results for its fiscal 2010 second-quarter and six-month period ended Dec. 31, 2009.

At a time when state budget cuts and shrinking endowments are making it difficult for colleges and universities to meet the increasing demand for quality education in this country, the private sector is playing an important role in helping to educate our countrys workforce and ensuring that we remain competitive in the global marketplace, said Daniel Hamburger, DeVrys president and chief executive officer. We are proud to be a part of the solution and are committed to helping our students meet their career aspirations.
Business Highlights
Business, Technology, and Management Segment
DeVry University
As previously announced in December 2009, DeVry University new undergraduate enrollment increased 19.4 percent and total undergraduate enrollment rose 22.7 percent. At Keller Graduate School of Management, the number of coursetakers in November 2009 increased 16.5 percent to an all-time record of more than 20,000 coursetakers. DeVry Universitys strong results and execution continue to position it well for the remainder of fiscal 2010. DeVry University continues to make strategic investments in its career services and financial services operations to assist students in achieving their career goals.
Medical and Healthcare Segment
Chamberlain College of Nursing
During the quarter, Chamberlain received Higher Learning Commission (HLC) approval for its programs in Jacksonville, Fla., and preliminary approval in Crystal City, Va. Programs at the new Crystal City campus will begin in summer 2010 pending other approvals. Chamberlains new Chicago campus is also expected to open in summer 2010 pending approvals. In addition, Chamberlain will move from its current St. Louis campus to a new, state-of the-art location in nearby Maryland Heights. All four of these Chamberlain campuses are co-locations with DeVry University.
In July Chamberlain will begin offering an online Registered Nurse (RN) to Master of Nursing in Science (MSN) program providing greater flexibility for students to achieve an MSN degree.
Apollo College/Western Career College (U.S. Education)
With the integration of Apollo College and Western Career College essentially complete, the focus now centers on other areas of value creation. Apollo College launched a physical therapy assistant (PTA) program in its Mesa, Ariz., campus during the quarter. Recently, call center operations were moved to its Phoenix location, and accounting functions were consolidated in Mission Viejo, Calif.
Professional Education Segment
Becker Professional Education
Although conditions in the accounting and finance fields are not expected to materially improve in 2010, Becker continues to make investments to position itself for long term growth. During the quarter, Becker launched a pilot program targeting recent college graduates who have been most affected by the current job market. The new program offers zero percent financing for the Becker CPA Review. Becker also signed an exclusive agreement in December to distribute its CPA preparation materials in China through China Distance Education Holdings Limited, the largest CPA training provider in the country.
Other Educational Services Segment
DeVry Brasil
DeVry is in the midst of organizing its schools under the DeVry Brasil group platform to integrate operations and leverage best practices across Fanor, Ruy Barbosa and Area 1. During the quarter, Fanors Fortaleza campus received approval for two new programs in environmental engineering and physical education, while Ruy Barbosa received approvals for five new bachelors degree programs, including nursing, physiotherapy and nutrition.
Balance Sheet/Cash Flow
For the first half of fiscal 2010, DeVry generated $267.3 million of operating cash flow, driven by the continuation of strong operating results and working capital management. As of Dec. 31, 2009, cash, marketable securities and investment balances totaled $334.2 million and outstanding borrowings were $44.7 million.
Share Repurchase Plan
During the quarter, DeVry completed its second share repurchase program, repurchasing $50 million of common stock at an average cost of $48.67 per share. DeVrys board of directors authorized a third repurchase program in November 2009 of up to $50 million.
Conclusion
We are pleased with our continued solid performance and acknowledge the significant contributions of our 17,000 colleagues around the world in executing our growth and diversification strategies, said Hamburger. As we enter the new calendar year, our primary focus will remain on achieving strong student outcomes. We will continue to put our students first by prudently investing in high quality educational programs and services to help them succeed in their chosen careers.
