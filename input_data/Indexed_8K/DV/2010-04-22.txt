(NYSE:DV), a global provider of educational services, today reported results for its fiscal 2010 third-quarter and nine-month period ended March 31, 2010.

Diluted earnings per share increased 63 percent to $2.88
We continued to achieve favorable enrollment trends during this quarter, as students were attracted by the value proposition of our educational offerings, which includes high quality programs and services and a strong track record of academic outcomes for students, said Daniel Hamburger, DeVrys president and chief executive officer. We remain committed to investing in quality and providing the access and capacity needed to educate our countrys workforce to compete in the midst of a tough economy.
Business Highlights
Business, Technology, and Management Segment
DeVry University
DeVry University continued to report strong undergraduate enrollment growth, with new enrollments in the spring increasing 24.0 percent to 17,715 students, compared with 14,288 last year. Total student enrollment increased 25.6 percent to 66,909 students, compared with 53,259 in spring 2009.
For the January 2010 session, graduate coursetakers enrolled in masters degree programs at DeVry University and its Keller Graduate School of Management rose to 22,679, an increase of 16.5 percent over January 2009. For the March 2010 session, the number of graduate coursetakers was 22,343, an increase of 15.4 percent over prior year.
The total number of online undergraduate and graduate coursetakers in the March 2010 session increased 21.5 percent to 67,744 versus 55,745 in the same session a year ago.
DeVry University continued to make investments in academic quality and student outcomes during the quarter. It hired additional career service advisors and has accelerated the implementation of its successful Student Central concept, which brings all key services together in one place, and proactively supports students from the time they enroll to when they graduate. Student Central will be implemented in all DeVry University locations by the end of fiscal 2010.
Medical and Healthcare Segment
Ross University
In the January 2010 term, new students increased 14.4 percent to 699, compared to 611 students last year. Total students increased 8.0 percent to 4,669 compared to 4,323 students in the same term last year.
An element of the growth strategy at Ross University School of Medicine was the development of a clinical education center located in Freeport, Grand Bahama. The clinical site was expected to mitigate capacity constraints at the main campus in Dominica. However, the projected volume of Ross students studying in Freeport has not been realized due to factors including an unforeseen delay in the review process in California (one of four states requiring notification) and caution on the part of existing students considering Freeport. Accordingly, Ross is executing revised plans to add capacity in Dominica as it continues to work toward resolution of these matters at its Freeport location. The Freeport site remains a part of Ross long-term growth plans. These near-term challenges coupled with Ross dedication to academic quality will mean slowing new student enrollment for at least the upcoming May and September terms. Management remains confident in Ross long-term opportunities for growth.
Chamberlain College of Nursing
Chamberlain's new student enrollment in spring 2010 increased 75.4 percent to 2,168 students, compared to 1,236 in spring 2009. Total student enrollment rose 72.2 percent to 6,691 students compared with 3,885 during the same period last year.
Chamberlain received approvals by the boards of nursing in Virginia and Illinois for its new campuses in Crystal City, Va., and Chicago, which are scheduled to open in July 2010. Both are co-locations with DeVry University.
U.S. Education (Apollo College/Western Career College/Carrington Colleges)
New student enrollment at U.S. Education decreased 2.4 percent to 4,218 students, compared with 4,323 in spring 2009. New student enrollment was impacted by the recovering economy, internal execution issues and capacity limitations as U.S. Education prepares to open new locations in the coming months. Total enrollment increased 9.9 percent to a record 12,009 students, compared with 10,928 for the same period last year.
In March, Western Career College and Apollo College announced that they will be renamed Carrington College California and Carrington College, respectively. The name change takes effect on July 1, 2010. All 19 campuses will bear the Carrington name within California and throughout the Western U.S.
Professional Education Segment
Becker Professional Education
Results for this segment continue to be relatively flat. Nevertheless, Becker continues to execute on its long-term growth strategy. During the quarter, Becker signed an agreement that makes its full array of CFA exam preparation offerings, including live classroom courses, available to CFA candidates in Switzerland. Becker is now a trusted partner to 97 of the top 100 accounting firms and 15 of the top 20 CFA Societies around the world.
Other Educational Services Segment
DeVry Brasil (Fanor/Ruy Barbosa/Area1)
For the March 2010 term, new students decreased 5.9 percent to 2,718, compared to 2,887 students last year driven by volatility in graduate school enrollments and delays in new program rollouts. Total students increased 0.4 percent to 11,789 compared to 11,742 students in the same term last year. During the quarter, Fanors Fortaleza campus prepared for the launch in the coming semester of two new programs in environmental engineering and physical education, while Ruy Barbosa prepared to launch five new bachelors degree programs, including nursing, physiotherapy and nutrition, this coming semester. In addition, for the second year in a row, Ruy Barbosa was named the number one school in Salvador and number one among all private institutions in the country based on academic outcomes on the OAB exam, which is equivalent to the bar exam in the U.S.
Balance Sheet/Cash Flow
For the first nine months of fiscal 2010, DeVry generated $481.3 million of operating cash flow, driven by the continuation of strong operating results and working capital management. As of March 31, 2010, cash, marketable securities and investment balances totaled $501.7 million and outstanding borrowings were $44.8 million.
Share Repurchase Plan
During the quarter, DeVry initiated its third share repurchase program, repurchasing $6.4 million of common stock at an average cost of $63.37 per share.
Conclusion
We will continue to invest in our programs, services and infrastructure to help our students succeed, said Hamburger. With 32 million more Americans expected to be insured by 2014 and employment figures showing early signs of recovery, our schools are well-positioned at the intersection of these two trends to help high school students and working adults obtain the skills they need to achieve their career aspirations.

Selected Operating Data
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information and Supplemental Reconciliation Schedule
DeVry executed certain real estate transactions in the three and nine month periods ended March 31, 2009, which resulted in significant lease termination charges and/or losses on the sale of facilities. The following table illustrates the effects of the real estate transactions on DeVrys earnings. Management believes that the non-GAAP disclosure of net income and earnings per share provides investors with useful supplemental information regarding the underlying business trends and performance of DeVrys ongoing operations and is useful for period-over-period comparisons of such operations given the discrete nature of these real estate transactions. DeVry uses these supplemental financial measures internally in its budgeting process. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, DeVrys reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table reconciles these items to the relevant GAAP information (in thousands, except per share data):
