Item 7.01         Regulation FD Disclosure
On August 6, 2010, DeVry Inc. announced that it had received a request for information from the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions relating to the Committee's ongoing hearings relating to private-sector colleges receiving Title IV financial aid. The request seeks information to more accurately understand how DeVrys institutions use Federal resources, including how they recruit and enroll students, set program price or tuition, determine financial aid including private or institutional loans, track attendance, handle withdrawal of students and return of Title IV dollars and manage compliance with the requirement that no more than 90% of revenues come from Title IV dollars. The request also seeks an understanding of the number of students who complete or graduate from programs offered by DeVrys institutions, how many of those students find new work in their educational area, the debt levels of students enrolling and completing programs and how DeVry tracks and manages the number of students who risk default within the cohort default rate window.
In furtherance of this, the Committee has requested that DeVry provide information about a broad spectrum of its business, including detailed information relating to financial results, management, operations, personnel, recruiting, enrollment, graduation, student withdrawals, receipt of Title IV funds, institutional accreditation, regulatory compliance and other matters. DeVry intends to cooperate with the Committee and to work with the Committee to provide the requested information in a manner that does not compromise its sensitive proprietary operating and other information.
The Committee has requested that DeVry produce a portion of the specified information by August 26, 2010 and the remainder of the information by September 16, 2010.
