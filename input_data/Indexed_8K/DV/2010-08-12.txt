DeVry also reported enrollment results at DeVry University, including its Keller Graduate School of Management (KGSM), Chamberlain College of Nursing, Ross University, and the Carrington Colleges Group (formerly Apollo College and Western Career College).

Net income increased 93 percent to $71.6 million.

Business Highlights
Business, Technology, and Management Segment
DeVry University
DeVry University continued to achieve solid undergraduate enrollment growth with new summer enrollments increasing 9.9 percent to 20,935 compared to 19,057 last year. Total student enrollments were up 22 percent to 68,290 students versus 55,979 in the prior year.
Total graduate coursetakers including Keller Graduate School of Management totaled 22,103 in May 2010, up 17.4 percent compared to the same period in 2009. In July 2010 total coursetakers increased 17.6 percent to 21,165 from the prior year.
The total number of online undergraduate and graduate coursetakers was a record 70,088 in July 2010, an increase of 24.4 percent over July 2009.
Medical and Healthcare Segment
Ross University
Ross University School of Medicine (RUSM) continues to work to address capacity issues, in Dominica and through its Freeport location. In Dominica, its efforts are focused on making investments that enhance academic quality while opening up additional capacity. At the same time, RUSM is working with the Medical Board of California (MBC) to secure final approval for the Freeport location. RUSM expects its application to be considered at the MBCs next meeting in November.
As previously announced, RUSM is temporarily moderating new enrollment growth while these initiatives are completed. As a result, new student enrollment decreased 39.5 percent to 340 in the May 2010 term at Ross Universitys medical and veterinary medical schools, while total student enrollment rose to 4,542 students, an increase of 2.1 percent over the May 2009 term. Both figures were in-line with managements outlook for the term.
Chamberlain College of Nursing
Chamberlain's new student enrollment in summer 2010 increased 55.1 percent to 2,416 students, compared to 1,558 students in summer 2009. Total student enrollment rose 65.2 percent to 7,108 students compared with 4,302 during the same period last year.
In July 2010, Chamberlain opened two new campuses in Arlington, Va., and Chicago, which are co-locations with DeVry University. It has submitted applications for a new location in Houston to be opened in spring 2011, pending approvals.
Chamberlain will launch a Registered Nurse (RN) to Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) program beginning in fall 2010.
Carrington Colleges Group
On June 30, Apollo College and Western Career College were renamed Carrington College and Carrington College California, respectively. The new names personify the quality programs each institution is known for and help current and prospective students better understand the relationship between these schools and the programs they offer.

New student enrollment for the four month period ending July 31 at the Carrington Colleges declined 2.7 percent to 4,291 compared with 4,411 last year. Total enrollment increased 5.5 percent to 11,234 students, compared with 10,644 on July 31 last year. New student enrollments during the period were impacted by a decline in inquiry volume in advance of the name change. However, inquiries are up versus prior year since the renaming took effect.
Eight out of nine eligible Carrington College campuses qualified for Honor Roll status during a reaffirmation of accreditation by the Accrediting Council of Independent Colleges and Schools (ACICS). In October 2010, Carrington College California will open a new campus in Pomona, Calif., which is a co-location with DeVry University.
Professional Education Segment
Becker Professional Education
Beckers revenues grew 8.9 percent during the quarter and 0.8 percent for the year in spite of the continued softness in hiring in the accounting and financial services fields. Becker continued to expand its relationships with key accounting and financial partners and remains well-positioned for long-term growth.
During the quarter, Becker made a significant investment in the largest redevelopment effort of its course materials since 2003. This was done in preparation for changes in the 2011 CPA exam.
As previously announced, John Roselli will become president of Becker effective October 1, succeeding Thomas Vucinic, who is retiring after a long and distinguished career with the organization.
Other Educational Services Segment
DeVry Brasil
During the quarter, DeVry Brasil focused on further enhancing the quality of its student programs and services in the areas of academic support, tutoring, and student finance. DeVry Brasil made significant investments in its facilities and is looking at additional facility expansion opportunities in 2011.
Advanced Academics
Advanced Academics continued to make investments in its long term growth during the quarter despite ongoing budgetary issues in many of the school districts it serves. The impact of these state cutbacks along with the ongoing investments in its academic quality led to an operating loss during the quarter. It recently signed agreements with school districts in New York, Arizona, and Texas, for programs which will be rolled out during the coming year.
New Organizational Structure
Effective October 1, Steve Riehs will become president of a new organizational structure within DeVry, which will include Advanced Academics, Becker Professional Education, DeVry Brasil and International Business Development.
Balance Sheet/Cash Flow
For fiscal 2010, DeVry generated $391.5 million of operating cash flow, primarily driven by the continuation of strong operating results. As of June 30, 2010, cash, marketable securities and investment balances totaled $323.4 million with no outstanding debt.
Share Repurchase Plan
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, DeVry repurchased 321,521 shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $19.0 million, or $59.09 per share. As of June 30, 2010, 422,021 shares of DeVry stock have been purchased as part of the current program for a total of $25.4 million at an average cost of $60.11 per share.
DeVrys board of directors has authorized a fourth share repurchase program, which allows the company to buy back up to $50 million of its common stock through June 30, 2012. The new program will commence upon completion of the existing $50 million program.
Conclusion
In fiscal 2011, we will continue to build upon the investments we made last year in academic quality and student services, said Hamburger. These investments will further enhance the strong value propositions of our schools in the years to come and help us to achieve our vision of becoming the leading global provider of career-oriented educational services.

Certain statements contained in this release concerning DeVry's future performance, including those statements concerning DeVry's expectations or plans, may constitute forward-looking statements subject to the Safe Harbor Provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements generally can be identified by phrases such as DeVry Inc. or its management "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "foresees," "forecasts," "estimates" or other words or phrases of similar import. Actual results may differ materially from those projected or implied by these forward-looking statements. Potential risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause results to differ are described more fully in Item 1A, "Risk Factors," in DeVry's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending June 30, 2009 and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 26, 2009

Selected Operating Data
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information and Supplemental Reconciliation Schedule
DeVry executed certain real estate transactions in fiscal year 2009, which resulted in significant lease termination charges. Also, DeVry recorded a litigation settlement reserve in fiscal year 2009. The following table illustrates the effects of the real estate transactions and litigation reserve on DeVrys earnings. Management believes that the non-GAAP disclosure of net income and earnings per share provides investors with useful supplemental information regarding the underlying business trends and performance of DeVrys ongoing operations and are useful for period-over-period comparisons of such operations given the discrete nature of the real estate transactions and litigation settlement reserve. DeVry uses these supplemental financial measures internally in its budgeting process. However, the non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, DeVrys reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table reconciles these items to the relevant GAAP information (in thousands, except per share data):
Summer 2010 Enrollment Results
