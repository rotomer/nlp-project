Enrollments at DeVry University, Keller Graduate School of Management and Chamberlain College of Nursing were in-line with previously announced expectations. However, new student enrollment at the Carrington Colleges declined more than anticipated in October and November as the result of fewer adult students entering into programs driven by lower inquiry volume and conversion. To address this issue, Carrington is in the process of shifting its focus from brand awareness associated with the recent name change to more direct response communications. Carrington is also making additional investments in its website interface and admissions processes to better serve prospective students.
"In the coming years, the strong demand for quality education will continue to growin the United States and around the world. DeVry provides a key part of the solution by providing capacity and access so our students can achieve their educational and career goals, said Daniel Hamburger, president and chief executive officer of DeVry Inc. While we experienced lower demand at some of our colleges during this enrollment period, we remain well-positioned through our diverse family of schools and programs should these trends continue. We have strategies in place to address areas where we can improve and remain confident in our ability to meet our long term performance goals.
DeVry will report financial results for its fiscal 2011 second quarter after the close of the market on Jan. 25, 2011, with a conference call to follow at 3:30 p.m. Central Standard Time.
