Exhibit 99.1
DeVry Inc. Announces Third-Quarter 2011 Results
DOWNERS GROVE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 26, 2011--DeVry Inc. (NYSE:DV), a global provider of educational services, today reported results for its fiscal 2011 third-quarter and nine-month period ended March 31, 2011. DeVrys performance was driven by its unwavering focus on academic quality and continued solid execution of its growth and diversification strategy.
Significant academic quality and student services accomplishments this quarter:
Implemented a partnership with CareerBuilder to provide graduates of DeVry Universitys Keller Graduate School of Management with career services
Received AVMA accreditation at Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine
Appointed Joseph Flaherty, MD, as dean of Ross University School of Medicine
Financial Results for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2011:
Revenues increased 12 percent to $562.7 million
Net income increased 14 percent to $92.9 million
Diluted earnings per share increased 18 percent to $1.32
Financial Results for the Nine Months Ended March 31, 2011:
Revenues rose 16 percent to $1,635.6 million
Net income increased 22 percent to $255.2 million
Diluted earnings per share increased 25 percent to $3.60
Our diversification strategy and focus on enhancing academic quality to support long term growth continue to serve us well, said Daniel Hamburger, DeVrys president and chief executive officer. Total enrollment growth across our family of degree-granting schools was 7.6 percent in the spring. While Carrington and DeVry University undergraduate new student enrollments experienced softness during this period, strong growth within Chamberlain, Keller and DeVry Brasil helped to offset the weakness. This demonstrates the value of our diversification strategy and allows DeVry to continue to make investments in the quality of its academic programs and services.
Business Highlights
Business, Technology, and Management Segment
DeVry University
DeVry University reported new undergraduate enrollment of 14,981, a 15.4 percent decline compared with 17,715 last year. Total student enrollment increased 5.9 percent to 70,863 students, compared with 66,909 in spring 2010.
For the January 2011 session, graduate coursetakers enrolled in masters degree programs at DeVry University and its Keller Graduate School of Management rose to 24,784, an increase of 9.3 percent over January 2010. For the March 2011 session, the number of graduate coursetakers was 24,406, an increase of 9.2 percent over prior year.
The total number of online undergraduate and graduate coursetakers in the March 2011 session increased 15.7 percent to 78,366 versus 67,744 in the same session a year ago.
To underscore its commitment to becoming the leading career university, during the quarter DeVry University implemented a new partnership with CareerBuilder, which will provide its Keller graduates with career services, including access to a personal career coach.

In addition to its accreditation from the St. Christopher & Nevis Accreditation Board, Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine received an additional accreditation by the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) during the quarter. This milestone achievement is representative of the quality of the schools program. Further, it allows graduates to sit for licensure to practice veterinary medicine in the United States or Canada without first completing a special foreign graduate examination.

Chamberlain recently announced the launch of its Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) Informatics Specialty Track, which is designed to prepare students to utilize Electronic Health Records technology.
