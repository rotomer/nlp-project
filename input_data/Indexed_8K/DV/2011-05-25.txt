On May 23, 2011, DeVry Inc. (DeVry) issued a press release announcing that its Board of Directors (the Board) had declared a semi-annual dividend on DeVrys common stock of $0.12 per share, payable on July 12, 2011, to common stockholders of record as of June 20, 2011. The policy of the Board is that any payment of dividends will be at the discretion of the Board and will be dependent on the earnings and financial requirements of DeVry and other factors as the Board deems relevant.  
In addition, DeVry announced the Board authorized a sixth share repurchase program, which allows DeVry to buy back up to $100 million of its common stock through June 30, 2013. This new repurchase program is to commence upon completion of the existing $50 million program. The timing and amount of any repurchase will be determined by management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. These repurchases may be made through the open market, including block purchases, or in privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. The buyback will be funded through available cash balances and/or borrowings, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.  
The full text of this press release is included in Exhibit 99.1 in this Form 8-K.
