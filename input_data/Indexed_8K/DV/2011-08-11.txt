Revenues increased 8 percent to $546.7 million
Net income increased 5 percent to $75.2 million

Recently we have been experiencing a challenging external environment characterized by a prolonged tough economy and new regulatory changes. We believe that by remaining focused on our strategy of quality and diversification, we will return to a long-term growth trend.
Segment Highlights
Business, Technology and Management Segment
DeVry University
New undergraduate enrollments for the summer period at DeVry University decreased 25.6 percent to 15,566 compared to 20,935 last year. Total undergraduate student enrollments were down 5.8 percent to 64,317 students versus 68,290 in the prior year. Following an extended period of double digit new undergraduate student enrollment growth, some reversion to more historical levels of growth was expected. Also, employee distractions caused by the roll out of new processes related to the implementation of new regulations governing the education sector likely had a near-term negative impact on performance. Enrollment has been most impacted by the prolonged economic downturn and continued high unemployment, which has led some potential students to defer or refrain from making the commitment to enroll in college.
DeVry Universitys growth plan includes investing in its strong brand, and in new programs, new locations, and student services. It anticipates offering a new bachelors degree in healthcare administration in the fall, as well as opening three to five locations in fiscal 2012.
Total graduate coursetakers including Keller Graduate School of Management totaled 23,802 in May 2011, up 7.7 percent compared to the same period in 2010. In July 2011 total coursetakers increased 1.9 percent to 21,576 from the prior year. Throughout fiscal 2011, Keller has been investing in brand awareness, and earlier in the year launched its first ever combined DeVry University/Keller branding campaign, as part of its celebration of DeVry Universitys 80 anniversary.
th
The total number of online undergraduate and graduate coursetakers was 69,617 in July 2011, a decrease of 0.7 percent compared to July 2010.
Medical and Healthcare Segment
On August 4, 2011, DeVry announced the acquisition of the American University of the Caribbean (AUC). AUC is a leading international provider of medical degrees with a campus based in St. Maarten. The acquisition further positions DeVry as the leader in international medical education. AUC is one of only three Caribbean-based medical schools whose students are eligible for Title IV financial aid (Ross University School of Medicine is also one of the three).
Ross University
In the May 2011 term, new students increased 37.9 percent to 469, compared to 340 students last year. Total students rose 6.2 percent to 4,825 compared to 4,542 students in the same term last year.
Ross University School of Medicine continues to make investments to enhance academic quality and to add capacity. It is in the process of completing campus master plans to build out capacity to support anticipated enrollment increases. In May 2011, Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine recorded the highest enrollment in its history.
Chamberlain College of Nursing
Chamberlain's new student enrollment in summer 2011 increased 16.1 percent to 2,805 students, compared to 2,416 students in summer 2010. Total student enrollment rose 40 percent to 9,954 students compared with 7,108 during the same period last year.
Chamberlain continues to make investments in new locations, programs and services. It has submitted applications for new locations in Indianapolis and Atlanta to be opened in spring 2012, pending approvals. To enhance student services, during the quarter Chamberlain hired Dr. William Cowling as vice president of academic affairs and Karilyn Van Oosten as director of strategic alliances.
Carrington Colleges Group
New student enrollment at Carrington declined 33.6 percent to 2,850 compared with 4,291 last year. Total student enrollment decreased 25.6 percent to 8,363 from 11,234 students in the prior year. In addition to the regulatory changes and economic factors noted above, new student enrollments during the period were negatively impacted by transition issues from the Carrington name change. Carrington is executing a performance improvement plan that centers on enhancing students academic experience, optimizing its marketing process, new programs and new locations.
An example of enhancing students academic experience in the quarter at Carrington was its SimLink Experience now operational in its Pomona, Calif.; Mesa, Ariz.; and Albuquerque, N.M. locations. Carrington anticipates opening its new Dallas location in the second half of fiscal 2012.
TM
On July 1, 2011, Rob Paul succeeded George Montgomery as president of Carrington Colleges Group.
International, K-12 and Professional Education Segment
DeVry has realigned its financial reporting segments to better conform to its organizational structure and strategic focus. The two largest segments, Business, Technology & Management and Medical & Healthcare, remained unchanged and represent the two U.S. postsecondary educational segments. Professional Education and Other Educational Services segments have been combined into the new International, K-12 and Professional Education segment. This segment is led by Steve Riehs and represents the educational institutions outside of U.S. postsecondary education.
DeVry Brasil
During the quarter, DeVry Brasil continued to focus on enhancing the quality of its student programs and services. DeVry Brasil made significant investments in a new building at the Ruy Barbosa location in Salvador and broke ground on a new campus in Sao Luis. Its performance benefitted from the 16 percent increase in total enrollment reported last quarter.
Advanced Academics
Advanced Academics (AAI) continued to expand its geographical footprint during the quarter, adding school districts in Texas and New York. AAI also recently received authorization from Arizona to become a state-wide program.
Becker Professional Education
Beckers revenues grew 9 percent during the quarter, benefitting from the recent acquisition of ATC International (ATC). Revenue for the full year increased 11 percent. In addition, performance at Becker in the quarter was driven by preparation for the CPA Exam to be offered in five new international locations beginning in August. Becker is well-positioned to support candidates preparing for the exam in these new locations through long-term, local partnerships. Integration of ATC is proceeding smoothly and will enhance Beckers position in preparing students for international accreditation exams in the accounting field.
Balance Sheet/Cash Flow
For fiscal 2011, DeVry generated $ 407.9 million of operating cash flow, primarily driven by the continuation of strong operating results. As of June 30, 2011, cash, marketable securities and investment balances totaled $449.7 million with no outstanding debt.
Share Repurchase Plan
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, DeVry repurchased 518,317 shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $28.2 million, or $54.39 per share. DeVry also completed its fifth stock repurchase program of $50 million and began executing its sixth program, authorized for $100 million.
