Exhibit 99.1
DeVry Inc. Announces First-Quarter 2012 Results
DOWNERS GROVE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 25, 2011--DeVry Inc. (NYSE:DV), a global provider of educational services, today reported financial results for its fiscal 2012 first-quarter ended Sept. 30, 2011. DeVry also reported enrollment results at DeVry Medical International, DeVry Brasil, and graduate coursetakers at DeVry University/Keller Graduate School of Management. DeVry continues its unwavering focus on academic quality, successful student outcomes, and execution of its growth and diversification strategy.
Significant Accomplishments this quarter include:
Acquisition and ongoing integration of AUC
State approval of two new Chamberlain College of Nursing locations and approval from the Illinois Board of Higher Education for a doctorate of nursing practitioner program
Appointment of Dr. Andrew Jeon as president of DeVry Medical International
Three Months Ended Sept. 30, 2011:
Revenues decreased 0.5 percent to $519 million.
Net income decreased 21.9 percent to $57 million.
Diluted earnings per share decreased 19.4 percent to $0.83.
DeVry University undergraduate and Carrington Colleges Group continue to face the same headwinds as many other institutions across our countrys educational system. Poor economic conditions and persistent unemployment continued to impact results, coupled with adjustments associated with new regulations, said Daniel Hamburger, DeVrys president and chief executive officer. We continue to experience enrollment growth at DeVry University graduate, Chamberlain, Ross, AUC, DeVry Brasil, and Advanced Academics. This diversification helped to mitigate the declines, and resulted in total enrollment of about 123,000 students across all DeVry institutions, a decrease of less than one percent. Going forward, we will continue to invest in academic quality, execute on our diversification strategy, and control costs across our organization.
Organizational Highlights
Business, Technology and Management Segment
DeVry University
For the September 2011 session, total graduate coursetakers at DeVry University, including its Keller Graduate School of Management, increased 2.3 percent to 23,937 versus 23,389 for the same period in 2010.
Despite the continued tough job market, 87.3 percent of DeVry Universitys June 2010, October 2010 and February 2011 graduates in the active job market were employed in their fields of study within six months of graduation at an average salary of $42,645. These statistics include graduates of associate and bachelors degree programs and those who were already employed in their field of study.
DeVry University continues to mitigate the effects of this challenging environment by prudently controlling costs, while strategically investing in new programs and locations, services to better serve students, and employee training to improve the collegiate experience for our students. We will also continue to provide advisors with additional training to improve the enrollment experience for prospective students.
Medical and Healthcare Segment
DeVry Medical International
Andrew Jeon, M.D., MBA, was appointed president of DeVry Medical International, which includes Ross University School of Medicine, Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine and the American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine.
In the 2011 September term for DeVry Medical International, new students increased 22.9 percent to 853, compared to 694 students on a pro forma basis for prior year term. Total students increased 6.3 percent to 6,082 compared to 5,723 students in the same term last year.
DeVry continues to integrate AUC into its family of institutions under the leadership of its dean, Dr. Bruce Kaplan. AUCs new student enrollment for the September 2011 term was 192 students versus 204 in the prior year period. AUCs total student enrollment for the September term was 1,226 students in 2011 and 1,156 students in 2010.
Chamberlain College of Nursing
During the quarter, Chamberlain received state Board of Nursing approvals to open locations in Indianapolis and Atlanta in spring 2012, pending Higher Learning Commission (HLC) approval. We also continue to focus on expanding our programs and received approval from the Illinois Board of Higher Education for a doctorate in nursing practitioner (DNP) program, pending HLC approval.
Carrington Colleges Group
Carrington remains focused on executing its turnaround plan, which includes optimizing our marketing approach to emphasize the development of internally-generated inquiries. In addition, Carrington is employing new and more efficient student outreach efforts through our recently opened student contact center, and through implementation of new training to help advisors further engage with prospective students. We are also carefully reducing costs where possible while maintaining academic quality.
International, K-12, and Professional Education Segment
Becker Professional Education
Becker continues to focus on expanding its international platform. During the quarter, we continued to integrate ATC International, and signed an agreement with GE China to provide our CPA Exam Review course to General Electric employees in the Peoples Republic of China.
DeVry Brasil
For the September 2011 term, new students increased 29.2 percent to 3,033, compared to 2,347 students last year. Total students increased 17.8 percent to 14,099 compared to 11,972 students in the same term last year. DeVry Brasil continues to expand our curriculum and invest in student services, new programs, and new campus locations.
Balance Sheet/Cash Flow
For the first quarter, DeVry generated $186.6 million of operating cash flow, with our operating performance augmented by strong working capital management. As of Sept. 30, 2011, cash, marketable securities and investment balances totaled $325.3 million and there were no outstanding borrowings.
Share Repurchase Plan
During the quarter, DeVry repurchased 1,007,207 shares of our common stock under our sixth repurchase program at a cost of approximately $44.5 million, or $44.13 per share.
Conclusion
We are confident that what we are seeing now is a near-term discontinuity in the long-term growth trend. Our confidence is bolstered by the fundamental need for career-focused education both in the United States and in emerging markets, and by the strong value proposition we offer our students, added Hamburger.
