Item 7.01         Regulation FD Disclosure.
On November 3, 2011, DeVry Inc. (DeVry) issued a press release announcing that its Board of Directors (the Board) had declared a semi-annual dividend on DeVrys common stock of $0.15 per share, payable on January 10, 2012, to common stockholders of record as of December 8, 2011. The policy of the Board is that any payment of dividends will be at the discretion of the Board and will be dependent on the earnings and financial requirements of DeVry and other factors as the Board deems relevant.
In addition, DeVry announced the Board authorized a seventh share repurchase program, which allows DeVry to buy back up to $100 million of its common stock through December 31, 2013. This new repurchase program is to commence upon completion of the existing $100 million program. The timing and amount of any repurchase will be determined by management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. These repurchases may be made through the open market, including block purchases, or in privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. The buyback will be funded through available cash balances and/or borrowings, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
The full text of this press release is included in Exhibit 99.1 in this Form 8-K.
