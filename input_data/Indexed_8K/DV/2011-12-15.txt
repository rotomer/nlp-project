(c)           On June 8, 2011, DeVry Inc. (DeVry) filed a Current Report on Form 8-K to report that Richard M. Gunst, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of DeVry had informed DeVry of his decision to retire from DeVry and that Mr. Gunst would continue in his role while DeVry conducted an internal and external search for his successor and as long as necessary to ensure a smooth transition of duties.  As a result of the appointment of a new Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of DeVry, as described further below, Mr. Gunst will no longer be an officer of DeVry.  Mr. Gunst will continue as an employee of DeVry on an interim basis until February 3, 2011 and his employment agreement with DeVry will terminate on such date.
On December 14, 2011, DeVry announced that the Board of Directors of DeVry had appointed Timothy J. Wiggins, 55, to serve as Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, effective January 3, 2012.  Prior to joining DeVry Mr. Wiggins was the executive vice president and chief financial officer of Tellabs, Inc., which he joined in 2003.  In that role, he was responsible for leading all aspects of Tellabs global finance functions, including accounting, treasury, audit, financial planning and analysis, risk management and investor relations.
Mr. Wiggins was not selected pursuant to any arrangement or understanding between him and any other person.

There are no family relationships between Mr. Wiggins and any of DeVrys other directors, executive officers or persons nominated or chosen by DeVry to become directors or executive officers.
 
On December 14, 2011, DeVry entered into an Executive Employment Agreement (the Employment Agreement) with Mr. Wiggins.  The Employment Agreement provides for, among other things, the following:
 (i)           Mr. Wiggins initial base salary may be increased annually by DeVrys Chief Executive Officer in coordination with the Compensation Committee of DeVrys Board of Directors (the Compensation Committee) but may not be decreased, except in the case of an across-the-board percentage reduction in base salaries.
(ii)           Mr. Wiggins will be eligible for annual equity awards, as determined by DeVry, DeVrys Board of Directors and/or the Compensation Committee, under DeVrys equity award plans.
(iii)           Mr. Wiggins will be eligible to receive an annual cash incentive payment under DeVrys Management Incentive Program (MIP) based on a percentage of Mr. Wiggins base salary upon the achievement of specific organization-wide and personal performance goals that will be determined each fiscal year by Mr. Wiggins direct supervisor and/or the Compensation Committee.
 
(iv)           Mr. Wiggins will be eligible to participate in the health and welfare benefit plans and any qualified and/or non-qualified retirement plans of DeVry.
 (v)           Mr. Wiggins employment with DeVry will end upon the earlier of (A) Mr. Wiggins death or Permanent Disability (as defined in the Employment Agreement), (B) Mr. Wiggins resignation at any time with or without Good Reason (as defined in the Employment Agreement) or (C) termination by DeVry at any time with or without Cause (as defined in the Employment Agreement).
(vi)           If (A) Mr. Wiggins employment with DeVry is terminated by DeVry without Cause or by Mr. Wiggins with Good Reason and (B) Mr. Wiggins executes a legally effective Release (as defined in the Employment Agreement) and complies with the terms of the Employment Agreement and the Release, Mr. Wiggins will be entitled to the following benefits:
          
 
 
 
 
 
      
      
(vii)           If (A) Mr. Wiggins employment with DeVry is terminated by DeVry without Cause or by Mr. Wiggins with Good Reason during a Change in Control Period (as defined in the Employment Agreement) and (B) Mr. Wiggins executes a legally effective Release (as defined in the Employment Agreement) and complies with the terms of the Employment Agreement and Release, Mr. Wiggins will be entitled to the following benefits:
(1)           Accrued Benefits, payable no later than 30 days after the Termination Date;
(3)           
24 months of continued health benefit plan coverage at active employee rates following the Termination Date; and
(viii)           If Mr. Wiggins employment is terminated during a Change in Control Period (A) for Cause, (B) by reason of Mr. Wiggins resignation without Good Reason or (C) by reason of Mr. Wiggins death or Permanent Disability, DeVry shall provide Mr. Wiggins or Mr. Wiggins estate or beneficiaries, as appropriate, with Accrued Benefits, payable within 30 days following Mr. Wiggins Termination Date, and DeVry shall have no other severance obligations under the Employment Agreement.
(ix)           Mr. Wiggins is subject to a non-compete and non-solicitation period following the end of Mr. Wiggins employment of (A) 24 months if termination occurs with Good Reason or without Cause during a Change in Control Period or (B) 18 months in the case of any other termination.
 This description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Executive Employment Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1.
In connection with the signing of his Employment Agreement, subject to DeVrys policies with respect to equity grants and insider trading, Mr. Wiggins will receive (1) a cash signing bonus of $20,000 and (2), a one-time grant of equity-based compensation with a total estimated value of $1,100,000.  This one-time grant is comprised of (i) time-based restricted stock units that vest ratably over four years from the date of grant, commonly referred to by DeVry as full-value shares, with an estimated value of $800,000; (ii) stock options with an estimated value of $210,000 that vest ratably over four years from the date of grant; and (iii) performance-based restricted stock units that vest on the third anniversary of the grant date, commonly referred to by DeVry as performance shares, with an estimated value of $90,000.
Mr. Wiggins will be paid a base salary at an annualized rate of $400,000.  Additionally, he will be eligible at the end of DeVrys fiscal 2012 year for a prorated incentive payment under DeVrys MIP targeted at 60% of his base salary with a maximum payout opportunity of 200% of his MIP target.

The existence of any claim or cause of action by the Executive against DeVry, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, will not constitute a defense to the enforcement by DeVry of the provisions of Sections 10, 11, 12 or this Section 13, which Sections will be enforceable notwithstanding the existence of any breach by DeVry.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive will not be prohibited from pursuing such claims or causes of action against DeVry.  The Executive consents to DeVry notifying any future employer of the Executive of the Executive's obligations under Sections 10, 11, 12 and this Section 13 of this Agreement.

(f)
   
 
Upon the Executives written request, the CEO may, in the CEOs sole discretion, permit the Executive to engage in certain work or activity that is otherwise prohibited by this Agreement, if and only if the Executive first provides the CEO with written evidence satisfactory to the CEO, including assurances from any new employer of the Executive, that the contribution of Executives knowledge to that work or activity will not cause the Executive to disclose, base judgment upon, or use DeVrys trade secrets or other Confidential Information.  The Executive shall not engage in such work or activity unless and until the Executive receives written consent from the CEO.
 
(g)
   
 
Neither the CEOs consent under Section 13(f) nor DeVrys failure to seek enforcement of any restrictive covenant under this Agreement shall be deemed a consent or waiver by DeVry of any subsequent breach of this Agreement by the Executive and DeVry shall have the right to seek enforcement of this Agreement against the Executive for any breach not specifically consented to in writing by the CEO or DeVry.
