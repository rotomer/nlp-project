Exhibit 99.1

Chamberlain established campuses in Atlanta and Indianapolis; sought approvals to open a Tinley Park, Ill., campus in fiscal 2013

Financial Results for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2012:
Revenues decreased 4 percent to $540.8 million
Net income declined 28 percent to $67.1 million
Diluted earnings per share decreased 24 percent to $1.00

While this was a challenging quarter, we continued to execute on our five-point performance improvement plan, which includes reducing costs at DeVry University and Carrington Colleges, said Daniel Hamburger, DeVrys president and chief executive officer. Our strong financial position enables us to aggressively pursue our plan without sacrificing quality or foregoing opportunities for targeted investments. In the quarter, we made promising investments in high growth areas of our organization, namely the expansion of Chamberlain into two new markets and the additions of Faculdade Boa Viagem and Falcon Physician Review to our family of institutions.
Business Highlights
Business, Technology, and Management Segment
DeVry University
DeVry University reported new undergraduate student enrollment of 12,025, a 19.7 percent decline compared with 14,981 last year. Total student enrollment decreased 15.1 percent to 60,196 students, compared with 70,863 in spring 2011.
For the January 2012 session, the number of graduate coursetakers enrolled in masters degree programs at DeVry University and its Keller Graduate School of Management was 24,029, a decrease of 3.0 percent versus January 2011. For the March 2012 session, the number of graduate coursetakers was 23,366, a decline of 4.3 percent from prior year.
The total number of online undergraduate and graduate coursetakers in the March 2012 session decreased 13.1 percent to 68,083 versus 78,366 in the same session a year ago.
Enrollment results were impacted by a focus on adjusting to new regulations and prolonged unemployment, which continued to affect consumer confidence.
Medical and Healthcare Segment
DeVry Medical International
In the January 2012 term, new students decreased 20.5 percent to 601, compared to a very strong 756 students last year. Total students increased 1.0 percent to 6,024 compared to 5,965 students in the same term last year. The decline in new student enrollment is largely a result of capacity constraints at Ross University School of Medicine. Ross expects new student enrollment to increase in the May term reflecting the continued strong demand for medical education.
Chamberlain College of Nursing
Chamberlain's new student enrollment in spring 2012 increased 2.8 percent to 2,933 students, compared to 2,852 in spring 2011. Total student enrollment rose 19.9 percent to 11,867 students compared with 9,897 during the same period last year.
Chamberlains newly established Atlanta location has experienced exceptionally strong interest from applicants for the first classes at that location.
Carrington Colleges Group
New student enrollment at Carrington decreased 30.9 percent to 2,254 compared with 3,261 in spring 2011. Total enrollment decreased 28.4 percent to 7,309 students, compared with 10,206 for the same period last year. Carrington continues to make progress on its turnaround plan, which includes increasing its student recruiting effectiveness, aligning its cost structure, and enhancing academic quality.
Professional Education Segment
Becker Professional Education
In April, Becker announced its acquisition of Falcon Physician Reviews, a leading provider of comprehensive review programs for physicians preparing for the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) and the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination (COMLEX). The transaction expands Beckers exam preparation services into the growing healthcare field.
Becker announced recently that 100 percent of the 2010 Elijah Watt Sells Award winners prepared for the exam with Beckers CPA Exam Review. Since the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) began recognizing the Elijah Watt Sells Award recipients nationally in 2005, 66 of the 74 winners have prepared with Beckers CPA Exam Review.
The Elijah Watt Sells Award is presented to the 10 CPA candidates, who, on their first attempt, achieve the highest cumulative scores for all four sections of the Uniform CPA Examination within a calendar year. In 2010 several candidates received identical cumulative scores, resulting in a tie and increasing the number of award recipients to 19.
Other Educational Services Segment
DeVry Brasil
In February, DeVry Brasil announced it had acquired Faculdade Boa Viagem, adding another quality institution to its growing family of schools in northeastern Brazil.
For the spring 2012 term, new students increased 46.1 percent to 5,599, compared to 3,833 students for prior year term. Total students increased 55.6 percent to 21,297 compared to 13,688 students in the same term last year, driven by strong demand and the acquisition of FBV.
Balance Sheet/Cash Flow
For the first nine months of fiscal 2012, DeVry generated $355.1 million of operating cash flow. As of March 31, 2012, cash, marketable securities and investment balances totaled $332.1 million and there were no outstanding borrowings.
Share Repurchase Plan
During the quarter, a total of 863,369 shares were repurchased under the organizations seventh repurchase program for approximately $32.1 million, at an average cost of $37.21 per share.

Selected Operating Data
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information and Supplemental Reconciliation Schedule
During the second quarter of fiscal year 2012, DeVry recorded impairment charges related to its Carrington Colleges reporting unit. Also, DeVry recorded a gain from the sale of Beckers Stalla CFA review operations. The following table illustrates the effects of the impairment charges and gain on sale of assets on DeVrys results. Management believes that the disclosure of non-GAAP net income and earnings per share provides investors with useful supplemental information regarding the underlying business trends and performance of DeVrys ongoing operations and is useful for period-over period comparisons of such operations given the discrete nature of the impairment charges and gain on the sale of assets. DeVry uses these supplemental financial measures internally in its management and budgeting processes. However, the non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, DeVrys reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table reconciles these items to the relevant GAAP information (in thousands, except per share data):
