Exhibit 99.1
DeVry Inc. Previews Fourth-Quarter 2012 Results
DOWNERS GROVE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 23, 2012--DeVry Inc. (NYSE:DV), a global provider of educational services, today announced that it anticipates reporting revenue for its fiscal fourth quarter ending June 30, 2012, between $500 million and $510 million. Total operating costs and expenses in the quarter are anticipated to be between $465 million and $475 million, which is expected to produce earnings per share in the range of $0.43 to $0.46, before discrete items.
Recent factors impacting managements expectations for the fourth quarter include:
A shortfall in revenue from the increased use of scholarships awarded to students in DeVry Universitys May and July classes; student enrollments in the quarter were in line with DeVry Universitys expectations
Higher than anticipated operating costs in the fourth quarter including increased spending on inquiry generation and instructional costs
An accrual resulting from a now-resolved servicing issue related to DeVry Universitys administration of its Federal Perkins loan program
DeVry also anticipates reporting the following discrete items in the fourth quarter:
A non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of approximately $19 million for Advanced Academics (after tax of approximately $18 million or approximately $0.28 per share)
A pre-tax restructuring charge of approximately $7 million related to workforce reductions (after tax approximately $4 million or approximately $0.07 per share)
While we are disappointed with this quarters results, we are optimistic about mid- and long- term growth in higher education, said Daniel Hamburger, DeVrys president and chief executive officer. We are executing a plan to improve DeVrys near term performance. The most important elements of the plan are to align our cost structure with our enrollment levels, to regain enrollment growth, and to make targeted investments to drive future growth.
New enrollments for the summer term at DeVry University are expected to decrease approximately 15 to 17 percent compared to last years term  a sequential improvement compared to a decline of nearly 20 percent in the spring term. Carrington Colleges Group is also expected to experience a slowing rate of decline in new enrollments for the three month period ending June 30, with new students decreasing between 19 and 21 percent versus a decline of nearly 31 percent reported in the spring.
In response to continued softness in enrollment, DeVry is eliminating approximately 570 positions across its institutions, inclusive of both the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and the first quarter of fiscal 2013. DeVry will continue to execute on its cost reduction program and remains committed to achieving at least $50 million of cost savings in fiscal 2013, primarily at DeVry University and Carrington Colleges Group. Total operating costs and expenses at these institutions are expected to be down in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 both on a year over year and sequential basis and down for the full year. Total first quarter DeVry operating costs and expenses are expected to be down slightly on a sequential basis, even as growth investments continue at DeVrys healthcare and international institutions.
During the fourth quarter, revenue at Advanced Academics was significantly below managements expectations. DeVry has updated its near- and long- term projections, which resulted in a lower estimated fair market value for Advanced Academics. This lower valuation is expected to result in a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of approximately $19 million.
The revenue, cost and enrollment estimates provided are preliminary and unaudited. DeVry will report results for its fiscal 2012 fourth-quarter and full-year and summer enrollment on August 9, 2012, at 3:30 p.m. CDT (4:30 p.m. EDT). The conference call will be led by Daniel Hamburger, president and chief executive officer, Tim Wiggins, chief financial officer, and Pat Unzicker, vice president of finance.
