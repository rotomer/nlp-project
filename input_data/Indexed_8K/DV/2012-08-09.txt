Selected Operating Data
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information and Supplemental Reconciliation Schedule
During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, DeVry recorded an impairment charge related to its Advanced Academics reporting unit. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2012, DeVry recorded an impairment charge related to its Carrington Colleges reporting unit. Also, DeVry recorded a gain from the sale of Beckers Stalla CFA review operations. The following table illustrates the effects of the impairment charges and gain on sale of assets on DeVrys results. Management believes that the disclosure of non-GAAP net income and earnings per share provides investors with useful supplemental information regarding the underlying business trends and performance of DeVrys ongoing operations and is useful for period-over period comparisons of such operations given the discrete nature of the impairment charges and gain on the sale of assets. DeVry uses these supplemental financial measures internally in its management and budgeting processes. However, the non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, DeVrys reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table reconciles these items to the relevant GAAP information (in thousands, except per share data):
