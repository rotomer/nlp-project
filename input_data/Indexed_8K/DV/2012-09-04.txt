Exhibit 99.1
DeVry Acquires Faculdade do Vale do Ipojuca
Strengthening DeVrys strong position in the fast-growing northeast Brazilian market
DOWNERS GROVE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--September 4, 2012--DeVry Inc. (NYSE:DV), a global provider of educational services, today announced that it has acquired Faculdade do Vale do Ipojuca (FAVIP), which is located in the state of Pernambuco. FAVIP currently has approximately 5,000 students and offers more than 30 undergraduate and graduate programs at two campuses located in Caruaru, the states second largest city. The institutions largest programs are in the areas of law, business, psychology and nutrition. FAVIP is one of the fastest growing institutions in the region.
FAVIP will become a part of DeVry Brasil, which currently operates Faculdades Fanor located in Fortaleza; AREA1 and Ruy Barbosa, both located in the city of Salvador; and FBV located in the city of Recife. Together these five institutions currently provide services to about 27,000 students and offer 29 undergraduate and 39 graduate programs, focusing on the areas of business, health, law and engineering.
Northeast Brazil is the fastest growing region of the country. With GDP growth of 5.1 percent, the regions employers have an overwhelming need for skilled workers. Private-sector institutions play a vital role in meeting this need, educating over half the regions college students. Through the ongoing investments made in new programs, services and facilities, DeVry Brasil is well-positioned to meet the growing needs of this region.
Brazil is a dynamic and growing country that provides significant growth opportunities for our organization, said Daniel Hamburger, president and chief executive officer of DeVry Inc. While our focus remains on returning DeVry University and the Carrington Colleges to growth, we are prudently investing in targeted opportunities that position us well in high growth areas of the world.
The transaction will bring many benefits to the students and faculty of FAVIP, including sharing best practices with DeVry Brasil, investments in infrastructure and technology education, access to virtual libraries and research databases, and subsidized English language courses. Students will also have access to exchange programs and academic projects with students from the United States and other countries where DeVry has a presence.
