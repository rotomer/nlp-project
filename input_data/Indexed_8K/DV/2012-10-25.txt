Item 2.05         Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
On October 23, 2012, DeVry made the decision to consolidate administrative offices in the Chicagoland area. As a result, the company owned facility in Wood Dale, Illinois will be closed in December 2012 and employees will be re-located to other facilities in the area. The Wood Dale facility will be held as available for sale. DeVry anticipates recording a non-cash restructuring charge of $9 to $10 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 for a write-down to fair market value of this asset
