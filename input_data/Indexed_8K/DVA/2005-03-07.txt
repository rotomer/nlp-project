Item 8.01. Other Events.
 
On March 4, 2005, DaVita Inc. (the "Company") received a subpoena from the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Missouri in St. Louis. The subpoena requires production of a wide range of documents relating to the Company's operations, including documents related to, among other things, pharmaceutical and other services provided to patients, relationships with pharmaceutical companies, financial relationships with physicians and joint ventures. The subpoena covers the period from December 1, 1996 through the present. The subject matter of this subpoena significantly overlaps with the subject matter of the investigation being conducted by the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The Company intends to meet with representatives of the government to discuss the scope of the subpoena and the production of responsive documents. The Company intends to cooperate with the government's investigation. The subpoena has been issued in connection with a joint civil and criminal investigation. To the knowledge of the Company, no proceedings have been initiated against the Company at this time, although it is not possible to predict whether or when proceedings might be initiated or when these matters may be resolved. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against the Company, exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and criminal penalties.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
