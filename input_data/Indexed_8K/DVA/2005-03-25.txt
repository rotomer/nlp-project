% senior notes due 2013 (the "Senior Notes") and an indenture (the "Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture" and, together with the Senior Notes Indenture, the "Indentures") with The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, under which the Company issued $850,000,000 aggregate principal amount at maturity of its 7

/
4
% senior subordinated notes due 2015 (the "Senior Subordinated Notes" and, together with the Senior Notes, the "Notes"). Each of the Company's direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries that have guaranteed other senior indebtedness of the Company (the "Guarantors") have guaranteed the Notes.
 
The Notes were sold in private placement transactions, have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be offered or sold absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.
 
The Company used the net proceeds of the offering along with approximately $46 million in cash to repay all outstanding amounts under the term loan portions of its senior secured credit facilities.
 
The Senior Notes will mature on March 15, 2013. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2005. The Company may redeem some of or all the Senior Notes at any time on or after March 15, 2009 at redemption prices of 103.313% and 101.656% of the principal amount thereof if the redemption occurs during the 12-month periods beginning on March 15 of the years 2009 and 2010, respectively, and at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof on and after March 15, 2011, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. In addition, prior to March 15, 2008, the Company may redeem up to 35% of the Senior Notes with the proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price of 106.625% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes to be redeemed.
 
The Senior Subordinated Notes will mature on March 15, 2015. Interest on the Senior Subordinated Notes is payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2005. The Company may redeem some of or all the Senior Subordinated Notes at any time on or after March 15, 2010 at redemption prices of 103.625%, 102.417% and 101.208% of the principal amount thereof if the redemption occurs during the 12-month periods beginning on March 15 of the years 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively, and at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof on and after March 15, 2013, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. In addition, prior to March 15, 2008, the Company may redeem up to 35% of the Senior Subordinated Notes with the proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price of 107.250% of the principal amount of the Senior Subordinated Notes to be redeemed.
If the Company experiences a change of control, it will be required to offer to purchase the Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
 
The Senior Notes are unsecured senior obligations of the Company and will rank equally in right of payment with all its existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness. The guarantees of the Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Guarantors and will rank equally in right of payment with all the existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness of the Guarantors. The Senior Notes and the guarantees of the Senior Notes will be effectively subordinated to the Company's and the Guarantors' existing and future secured indebtedness, including the Company's obligations under its senior secured credit facility and the Guarantors' guarantees of the senior secured credit facility. The Senior Subordinated Notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations of the Company and will be subordinated to all their existing and future senior indebtedness, including the Senior Notes. The guarantees of the Senior Subordinated Notes are unsecured and will be subordinated to all existing and future senior obligations of the Guarantors, including their guarantees of the Senior Notes.
 
The Indentures include covenants that limit the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to, among other things: incur additional debt; pay dividends on their capital stock or repurchase their capital stock; make certain investments; enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates; limit dividends or other payments by their restricted subsidiaries to the Company; use assets as security in other transactions; and sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies. The restricted covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications set forth in the Indentures.
 
The Indentures provide for customary events of default, including failure to make required payments; failure to comply with certain agreements or covenants; failure to pay, or acceleration of, certain other material indebtedness; certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency; and failure to pay certain judgments. An event of default under the Indentures will allow either the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then-outstanding Senior Notes or Senior Subordinated Notes to accelerate, or in certain cases, will automatically cause the acceleration of, the amounts due under the Senior Notes or the Senior Subordinated Notes.
 
The foregoing description of the Senior Notes, the Senior Subordinated Notes and the Indentures is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Indentures (including the form of senior subordinated notes and the senior discount notes attached thereto), copies of which are filed as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2, respectively, to this report.
 
Pursuant to a Registration Rights Agreement dated March 22, 2005 among the Company, the Guarantors and the initial purchasers relating to the Senior Notes (the "Senior Registration Rights Agreement"), the Company and the Guarantors are obligated to file and use their reasonable best efforts to cause to become effective a registration statement with respect to an offer to exchange the Senior Notes for other freely tradable notes issued by the Company and that are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and have substantially identical terms as the Senior Notes. Pursuant to a Registration Rights Agreement dated March 22, 2005 among the Company, the Guarantors and the initial purchasers relating to
the Senior Subordinated Notes (the "Senior Subordinated Registration Rights Agreement" and together with the Senior Registration Rights Agreement, the "Registration Rights Agreements"), the Company and the Guarantors are obligated to file and use their reasonable best efforts to cause to become effective a registration statement with respect to an offer to exchange the Senior Subordinated Notes for other freely tradable notes issued by the Company and that are registered with the SEC and have substantially identical terms as the Senior Subordinated Notes. Each of the Registration Rights Agreements provides that if the Company is not able to effect the applicable exchange offer, the Company will file with the SEC and use its reasonable best efforts to cause to become effective a shelf registration statement relating to the resales of the Senior Notes or the Senior Subordinated Notes, as applicable. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreements, the Company will be obligated to pay additional interest on the Senior Notes or the Senior Subordinated Notes, as applicable, if it does not complete the related exchange offer within 395 days after March 22, 2005 or, if required, the related registration statement is not declared effective within 395 days after March 22, 2005.

To permit registrations of transfers and exchanges, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate Notes at the Registrar's or co-Registrar's request. No service charge shall be imposed upon the Company, the Trustee or any Agent for any registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
 
The Registrar or co-Registrar shall not be required to register the transfer of or exchange of any Note (i) during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the mailing of a notice of redemption of Notes and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing, (ii) selected for redemption in whole or in part pursuant to Article Three, except the unredeemed portion of any Note being redeemed in part, and (iii) during a Change of Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer if such Note is validly tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer and not validly withdrawn.
 
Any Holder of a beneficial interest in a Global Note shall, by acceptance of such beneficial interest, agree that transfers of beneficial interests in such Global Notes may be effected only through a book-entry system maintained by the Holder of such Global Note (or its agent), and that ownership of a beneficial interest in the Note shall be required to be reflected in a book-entry system.
 
 
If a mutilated Note is surrendered to the Trustee or if the Holder of a Note claims that the Note has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, the Company shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a replacement Note if the Trustee's requirements are met. Such Holder must provide an indemnity bond or other indemnity, sufficient in the judgment of both the Company and the Trustee, to protect the Company, the Trustee or any Agent from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Note is replaced. The Company may charge such Holder for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in replacing a Note pursuant to this Section 2.07, including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel and of the Trustee.
 
Every replacement Note is an additional obligation of the Company and every replacement Note Guarantee shall constitute an additional obligation of the Guarantor thereof.
 
 
Notes outstanding at any time are all the Notes that have been authenticated by the Trustee except those cancelled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation and those described in this Section as not outstanding. A Note does not cease to be outstanding because the Company, the Guarantors or any of their respective Affiliates holds the Note (subject to the provisions of Section 2.09).
 
If a Note is replaced pursuant to Section 2.07 (other than a mutilated Note surrendered for replacement), it ceases to be outstanding unless a Responsible Officer of the Trustee
 
receives proof satisfactory to it that the replaced Note is held by a purchaser. A mutilated Note ceases to be outstanding upon surrender of such Note and replacement thereof pursuant to Section 2.07. If the principal amount of any Note is considered paid under Section 4.01, it ceases to be outstanding and interest ceases to accrue. If on a Redemption Date or the Maturity Date the Trustee or Paying Agent (other than the Company or an Affiliate thereof) holds U.S. Legal Tender or U.S. Government Obligations sufficient to pay all of the principal and interest due on the Notes payable on that date, then on and after that date such Notes cease to be outstanding and interest on them ceases to accrue.

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of Notes have concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, Notes owned by the Company or any of its Affiliates shall be disregarded, except that, for the purposes of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in conclusively relying on any such direction, waiver or consent, only Notes that a Responsible Officer of the Trustee actually knows are so owned shall be disregarded.
 
 
Until definitive Notes are ready for delivery, the Company may prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate temporary Notes. Temporary Notes shall be substantially in the form of definitive Notes but may have variations that the Company considers appropriate for temporary Notes. Without unreasonable delay, the Company shall prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate definitive Notes in exchange for temporary Notes. Until such exchange, temporary Notes shall be entitled to the same rights, benefits and privileges as definitive Notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as the Notes are represented by a Global Note, such Global Note may be in typewritten form.
 
 
The Company at any time may deliver Notes to the Trustee for cancellation. The Registrar and the Paying Agent shall forward to the Trustee any Notes surrendered to them for transfer, exchange or payment. The Trustee, or at the direction of the Trustee, the Registrar or the Paying Agent (other than the Company or a Subsidiary), and no one else, shall cancel and, at the written direction of the Company, shall dispose of all Notes surrendered for transfer, exchange, payment or cancellation in accordance with its customary procedures. Subject to Section 2.07, the Company may not issue new Notes to replace Notes that it has paid or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation. If the Company or any Guarantor shall acquire any of the Notes, such acquisition shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the Indebtedness represented by such Notes unless and until the same are surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation pursuant to this Section 2.11.
 
 
If the Company defaults in a payment of interest on the Notes, it shall, unless the Trustee fixes another record date pursuant to Section 6.10, pay the defaulted interest, plus (to the extent lawful) any interest payable on the defaulted interest, in any lawful manner. The
 
Company may pay the defaulted interest to the persons who are Holders on a subsequent special record date, which date shall be the fifteenth day next preceding the date fixed by the Company for the payment of defaulted interest or the next succeeding Business Day if such date is not a Business Day. At least 15 days before any such subsequent special record date, the Company shall mail to each Holder, with a copy to the Trustee, a notice that states the subsequent special record date, the payment date and the amount of defaulted interest, and interest payable on such defaulted interest, if any, to be paid.
 
 
The Company in issuing the Notes may use a "CUSIP" number, and if so, the Trustee shall use the CUSIP number in notices of redemption or exchange as a convenience to Holders; , , that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness or accuracy of the CUSIP number printed in the notice or on the Notes, and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Notes. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee in writing of any change in the CUSIP numbers.

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this Section 4.10:
 
(1) subject to clause (2) below, in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this Section 4.10, the Company, in its sole discretion, will be permitted to classify such item of Indebtedness on the date of Incurrence, or later reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness in any manner that complies with this Section 4.10, and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of such clauses;
 
(2) (x) all Indebtedness Incurred or outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities on the date of this Indenture or at the time of the closing of the Acquisition and (y) all other Indebtedness Incurred to finance the Acquisition (or otherwise Incurred in connection with the Acquisition, or in anticipation or contemplation thereof), whether Incurred under the Senior Credit Facilities or otherwise, shall be deemed Incurred under the Senior Credit Facilities on the Issue Date under clause (1) of "Permitted Indebtedness" and not the Coverage Ratio Exception or any of the other clauses under "Permitted Indebtedness";
 
(3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit relating to, Indebtedness which is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included as long as Incurred by a Person that could have Incurred such Indebtedness;
 
(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit are Incurred pursuant to the Senior Credit Facilities and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to the first or second paragraph above and the letters of credit relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;
 
(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor, will be equal to the greater of its voluntary or involuntary liquidation preference and its maximum fixed repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium);
 
(6) Indebtedness permitted by this Section 4.10 need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this Section 4.10 permitting such Indebtedness;
 
(7) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined in accordance with GAAP;
 
(8) the principal amount of any Indebtedness outstanding in connection with a Qualified Receivables Transaction is the Receivables Transaction Amount relating to such Qualified Receivables Transaction (which amount shall not include dispositions of self-pay receivables in the ordinary course of business, which the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries believes in good faith cannot be paid in full); and
 
(9) for purposes of clarity, except as set forth in clause (2) above, Indebtedness may be Incurred under the Senior Credit Facilities pursuant to the Coverage Ratio Exception and clauses (1), (2) (with respect to Guarantees) and (17) of the definition of "Permitted Indebtedness" so long as the borrowing thereunder is permitted to be Incurred pursuant to those provisions.
 
Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness and the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this Section 4.10. The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (i) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and (ii) the principal amount or the greater of the voluntary or involuntary liquidation preference and the maximum fixed repurchase price thereof, together with any interest thereon that is more than 30 days past due, in the case of any other Indebtedness.
 
In addition, the Company will not permit any of its Unrestricted Subsidiaries to Incur any Indebtedness or issue any shares of Disqualified Stock, other than Non-Recourse Debt. If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under this Section 4.10, the Company shall be in Default of this Section 4.10).
 
For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit Indebtedness; provided that if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-dominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-dominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 4.10, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur pursuant to this Section 4.10 shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in
 
which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.
 
 
The Company will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, Incur any Indebtedness that is or purports to be by its terms (or by the terms of any agreement governing such Indebtedness) subordinated to any other Indebtedness of the Company or of such Subsidiary Guarantor, as the case may be, unless such Indebtedness is also by its terms (or by the terms of any agreement governing such Indebtedness) made expressly subordinate to the Notes or the Note Guarantee of such Subsidiary Guarantor with respect to the Notes, to the same extent and in the same manner as such Indebtedness is subordinated to such other Indebtedness of the Company or such Subsidiary Guarantor, as the case may be.
 
For purposes of the foregoing, no Indebtedness will be deemed to be subordinated or junior in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or secured by a junior priority lien or by virtue of the fact that the holders of such Indebtedness have entered into intercreditor agreements or similar arrangements giving one or more of such holders priority over the other holders in the collateral held by them.
 
 
The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to:
 
(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution (whether made in cash, securities or other property) on or in respect of its Capital Stock (including any payment in connection with any merger or consolidation involving the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) except:
 
 
 
(2) purchase, redeem, retire or otherwise acquire for value any Capital Stock of the Company or any direct or indirect parent of the Company held by Persons other than the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than in exchange for Capital Stock of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock));
 
(3) purchase, repurchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value, prior to scheduled maturity, scheduled repayment or scheduled sinking fund payment,
 
any Subordinated Obligations or Guarantor Subordinated Obligations (other than (x) such Subordinated Obligations or Guarantor Subordinated Obligations purchased in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in each case due within one year of the date of purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement and (y) such Subordinated Obligations or Guarantor Subordinated Obligations held by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary); or
 
(4) make any Restricted Investment in any Person
 
(any such dividend, distribution, purchase, redemption, repurchase, defeasance, other acquisition, retirement or Restricted Investment referred to in clauses (1) through (4) shall be referred to herein as a ""), if at the time the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary makes such Restricted Payment:
Restricted Payment
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
which amount in each case under this clause (iv) was included in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments; , that no amount will be included under clause (iv)(A) of this paragraph to the extent it is already included in Consolidated Net Income.
provided, however
 
The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:
 
(1) the payment of any dividend within 60 days after the date of declaration of such dividend if the dividend would have been permitted on the date of declaration;
 
(2) if no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the acquisition, retirement, defeasance or purchase of any shares of Capital Stock of the Company either (i) solely in exchange for shares of Capital Stock of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock) or (ii) through the application of the net proceeds of a substantially concurrent sale for cash (other than to a Subsidiary of the Company) of shares of Capital Stock of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock) ( that such net proceeds shall not be applied toward the Restricted Payments Basket);
provided
 
(3) if no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the acquisition, making of any principal payment, redemption, defeasance or other retirement of any Subordinated Obligations either (i) solely in exchange for shares of Capital Stock of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock), (ii) through the application of net proceeds of a substantially concurrent sale for cash (other than to a Subsidiary of the Company) of (a) shares of Capital Stock of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock) ( that such net proceeds shall not be applied toward the Restricted Payments Basket) or (b) Refinancing Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred pursuant to Section 4.10, (iii) upon a Change of Control or in connection with an Asset Disposition to the extent required by the agreement governing such Subordinated Obligations but only if the Company shall have complied with Sections 4.09 and 4.15, as applicable, and purchased all Notes validly tendered pursuant to the relevant offer prior to redeeming such Subordinated Obligations or (iv) to the extent such Subordinated Obligations constitutes Acquired Indebtedness not Incurred in connection with or in anticipation or contemplation of the underlying acquisition or merger;
provided
 
(4) so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, repurchases by the Company of Common Stock of the Company from officers, directors and employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their authorized representatives upon the death, disability or termination of employment of such employees or termination of their seat on the board of the Company, in an aggregate amount not to exceed $10.0 million in any calendar year;
 
(5) repurchases of Capital Stock deemed to occur upon exercise of stock options, warrants or other convertible securities if such Capital Stock represents a portion of the exercise price thereof;
 
(6) so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, payments to holders of the Company's Capital Stock in lieu of issuance of fractional shares of its Capital Stock or to dissenting shareholders if required by applicable law;
 
(7) the distribution of Capital Stock of an Unrestricted Subsidiary of the Company to holders of Capital Stock of the Company; and
 
(8) additional Restricted Payments not to exceed $150.0 million in the aggregate since the Issue Date.
 
The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the Fair Market Value on the date of such Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. If the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary makes a Restricted Payment which, at the time of the making of such Restricted Payment, would in the good faith determination of the Company be permitted under the provisions of this Indenture, such Restricted Payment shall be deemed to have been made in compliance with this Indenture notwithstanding any subsequent adjustments or restatements made in good faith to the Company's financial statements.
 
 
The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) of any nature whatsoever against any assets or property of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (including Capital Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries), whether owned on the date of this Indenture or acquired after that date, which Lien secures Indebtedness or trade payables, unless contemporaneously therewith:
 
(1) in the case of any Lien securing an obligation that ranks pari passu with the Notes or a Note Guarantee, effective provision is made to secure the Notes or such Note Guarantee, as the case may be, at least equally and ratably with or prior to such obligation with a Lien on the same collateral; and
 
(2) in the case of any Lien securing an obligation that is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or a Note Guarantee, effective provision is made to secure the Notes or such Note Guarantee, as the case may be, with a Lien on the same collateral that is prior to the Lien securing such subordinated obligation;
 
in each case, for so long as such obligation is secured by such Lien.
 
 
The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:
 
(1) pay dividends or make any other distributions on its Capital Stock or pay any Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (it being understood that the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on Common Stock shall not be deemed a restriction on the ability to make distributions on Capital Stock);
 
(2) make any loans or advances to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (it being understood that the subordination of loans or advances made to the Company or
 
any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed a restriction on the ability to make loans or advances); or
 
(3) transfer any of its property or assets to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (it being understood that such transfers shall not include any type of transfer described in clause (1) or (2) above).
 
The preceding provisions will not prohibit:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset Disposition unless:
 
(1) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (both cash and non-cash) equal to not less than the Fair Market Value (such Fair Market Value to be determined on the date of contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition) of the shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition;
 
(2) at least 75% of the consideration from such Asset Disposition received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents or Replacement Assets. For purposes of this clause (2), each of the following shall be deemed to be cash:
 
 
 
(3) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition:

provided
however
 
, that clauses (1) and (2) above shall not apply with respect to any Permitted Divestiture.
provided, further
 
On the 366th day after an Asset Disposition (or such earlier date, if any, as the Board of Directors of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary determines that the Net Available Cash will not be applied in accordance with clause (3)(a) of the first paragraph of this Section 4.15), if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $35.0 million, the Company will be required to make an offer ("") to all Holders of Notes and, to the extent required by the terms of other Senior Indebtedness, to all holders of other Senior Indebtedness outstanding with similar provisions requiring the Company to make an offer to purchase such Senior Indebtedness with the proceeds from any Asset Disposition ("") to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Notes to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and Pari Passu Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth herein or the agreements governing the Pari Passu Notes, as applicable, in each case in integral multiples of $1,000. To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Pari Passu Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is

Upon completion of such Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.
 
Each Asset Disposition Offer will remain open for a period of 20 Business Days following its commencement, except to the extent that a longer period is required by applicable law (the "").

(8) that, if the aggregate principal amount of Notes surrendered by Holders exceeds the Asset Disposition Offer Amount, the Company shall select the Notes to be purchased on a basis (with such adjustments as may be deemed appropriate by the Company so that only Notes in denominations of $1,000, or integral multiples thereof, shall be purchased);

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Company will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment, on a basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Notes and Pari Passu Notes or portions of such Notes and Pari Passu Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Notes and Pari Passu Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, in each case in integral multiples of $1,000.

The Company or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than five Business Days after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder of Notes or holder or lender of Pari Passu Notes, as the case may be, an amount equal to the purchase price of the Notes or Pari Passu Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such holder or lender, as the case may be, and accepted by the Company for purchase, and the Company will promptly issue a new Note, and the Trustee, upon delivery of an Officers' Certificate from the Company, will authenticate and mail or deliver such new Note to such Holder, in a principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Note surrendered; that each such new Note will be in a principal amount of $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000. In addition, the Company will take any and all other actions required by the
pro rata
provided
 
agreements governing the Pari Passu Notes. Any Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered by the Company to the Holder thereof. The Company will publicly announce the results of the Asset Disposition Offer on or promptly following the Asset Disposition Purchase Date.
 
In the event of the transfer of substantially all (but not all) of the property and assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries as an entirety to a Person in a transaction permitted under Article 5, which transaction does not constitute a Change of Control, the successor company shall be deemed to have sold the properties and assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries not so transferred for purposes of this Section 4.15, and shall comply with the provisions of this Section 4.15 with respect to such deemed sale as if it were an Asset Disposition. In addition, the Fair Market Value of such properties and assets of the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries deemed to be sold shall be deemed to be Net Available Cash for purposes of this Section 4.15.
 
The Company will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Rule 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this Section 4.15. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this Section 4.15, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this Indenture by virtue of any conflict.
 
 
The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter into or conduct any transaction (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Company (an "") unless:
Affiliate Transaction
 
(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction are no less favorable, taken as a whole, to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable transaction at the time of such transaction in arm's-length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and
 
(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate consideration in excess of $15.0 million, the terms of such transaction have been approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company and by a majority of the members of such Board of Directors having no personal stake in such transaction, if any (and such majority or majorities, as the case may be, determines that such Affiliate Transaction satisfies the criteria in clause (1) above).
 
The preceding paragraph will not apply to:
 
(1) any Restricted Payment (other than a Restricted Investment) permitted to be made pursuant to Section 4.12;
 
(2) any issuance of securities, or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, employment agreements and other
 
compensation arrangements, options to purchase Capital Stock of the Company, stock purchase, ownership or option plans, long-term incentive plans, stock appreciation rights plans, participation plans or similar employee benefits plans provided on behalf of directors, officers, consultants and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, in each case, as approved by the Board of Directors of the Company;
 
(3) loans or advances to employees, consultants, officers or directors in the ordinary course of business of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (including for travel, entertainment, moving or relocation) or Guarantees in respect thereof or otherwise made on their behalf (including payment on any such Guarantees) made in compliance with applicable law but in any event not to exceed $10.0 million in the aggregate outstanding (without giving effect to the forgiveness of any such loan) at any one time with respect to all loans or advances made since the Issue Date;
 
(4) any transaction between the Company and a Restricted Subsidiary or between Restricted Subsidiaries, and Guarantees issued by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary for the benefit of the Company, a Restricted Subsidiary and/or a Special Purpose Licensed Entity, as the case may be, in accordance with Sections 4.10 and 4.13;
 
(5) the payment of reasonable and customary fees to directors, and indemnity provided on behalf of, directors, officers, employees or consultants, of the Company or any of its subsidiaries; and
 
(6) the performance of obligations of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries under the terms of any agreement to which the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is a party as of or on the Issue Date, as these agreements may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended or renewed from time to time; , that any future amendment, modification, supplement, extension or renewal entered into after the Issue Date will be permitted to the extent that its terms are not more materially disadvantageous, taken as a whole, to the Holders of the Notes than the terms of the agreements in effect on the Issue Date.
provided, however
 
 
The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, engage in any other business that is not a Permitted Business.
 
 
Notwithstanding that the Company may not be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, to the extent permitted by the Exchange Act, the Company will file with the SEC, and make available to the Trustee and the registered Holders of the Notes, the annual reports and the information, documents and other reports (or copies of such portions of any of the foregoing as the SEC may by rules and regulations prescribe) that are specified in Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act within the time periods specified therein or in the relevant forms. In the event that the Company is not permitted to file such reports, documents and information with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act, the Company will
 
nevertheless make available such Exchange Act information to the Trustee and Holders of Notes as if the Company were subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act within the time periods specified therein.
 
If the Company has designated any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the preceding paragraph shall include a reasonably detailed presentation, (a) in the footnotes to the financial statements and (b) in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries.
 
In addition, the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors will make available to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of such Holders, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act so long as the Notes are not freely transferable under the Securities Act. For purposes of this Section 4.18, the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors will be deemed to have furnished the reports to the Trustee and the Holders of Notes as required by this Section 4.18 if they have filed such reports with the SEC via the EDGAR filing system and such reports are publicly available.
 
Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee's receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Company's compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officers' Certificates).
 
 
The Company will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to Guarantee the payment of any Indebtedness of the Company or any Indebtedness of any other Restricted Subsidiary (other than a Guarantee by a Foreign Subsidiary of Indebtedness of a Foreign Subsidiary), unless such Restricted Subsidiary simultaneously executes and delivers a supplemental indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will unconditionally Guarantee, on a joint and several basis, the full and prompt payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes and all other obligations under this Indenture on a senior basis; that, (A) if the Notes or, if the issuer of the Indebtedness being Guaranteed is a Subsidiary Guarantor, its Note Guarantee is subordinated in right of payment to such Indebtedness, the Note Guarantee to be issued shall be subordinated to such Restricted Subsidiary's Guarantee with respect to such Indebtedness substantially to the same extent as the Notes or the Note Guarantees, as the case may be, is subordinated to such Indebtedness under this Indenture and (B) if such Indebtedness is by its express terms subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or a Note Guarantee, any Guarantee of such Restricted Subsidiary with respect to such Indebtedness shall be subordinated in right of payment to such Restricted Subsidiary's Note Guarantee substantially to the same extent as such Indebtedness is subordinated to the Notes or the Note Guarantees, as the case may be.
provided
 
The obligations of a Subsidiary Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent its Note Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under applicable law.
 
Thereafter, such Restricted Subsidiary shall be a Guarantor for all purposes of this Indenture.
 
Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, any Note Guarantee of a Subsidiary Guarantor will provide by its terms that it will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged under the circumstances set forth in Section 11.05. The form of the Note Guarantee is attached hereto as .
Exhibit E
 
 
 
 
The Company will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all its assets to, any Person, :
unless
 
(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the "") will be a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any State of the United States or the District of Columbia and the Successor Company (if not the Company) will expressly assume, by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Company under the Notes, this Indenture and the Registration Rights Agreement;
Successor Company
 
(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor Company as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;
 
(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction and any related financing, the Successor Company would be able to Incur at least an additional $1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the Coverage Ratio Exception;
 
(4) each Subsidiary Guarantor (unless it is the other party to the transactions above, in which case clause (1) shall apply) shall have by supplemental indentures confirmed that its Note Guarantee shall apply to such Person's obligations in respect of this Indenture and the Notes and its obligations under the Registration Rights Agreement shall continue to be in effect; and
 
(5) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indentures (if any) comply with this Indenture.
 
For purposes of this Section 5.01, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Company, which properties and assets, if held by the Company instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company.
 
The predecessor Company will be released from its obligations under this Indenture and the Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company under this Indenture, but, in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the predecessor Company will not be released from the obligation to pay the principal of and interest on the Notes.
 
Notwithstanding the preceding clause (3), (x) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to the Company, (y) the Company may merge with an Affiliate incorporated solely for the purpose of reincorporating the Company in another jurisdiction and (z) the Company may consolidate with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to a Subsidiary Guarantor.
 
In addition, the Company will not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor to consolidate with or merge with or into any Person (other than another Subsidiary Guarantor or the Company) and will not permit the conveyance, transfer or lease of substantially all of the assets of any Subsidiary Guarantor to any Person (other than another Subsidiary Guarantor or the Company) :
unless
 
(1) (a) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person will be a corporation, partnership, trust or limited liability company organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any State of the United States or the District of Columbia and such Person (if not such Subsidiary Guarantor) will expressly assume, by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, all the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under its Note Guarantee; (b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the resulting, surviving or transferee Person or any Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by such Person or such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default of Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; and (c) the Company will have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indentures comply with this Indenture; or
 
(2) the transaction is made in compliance with Section 4.15.
 
 
 
 
Each of the following is an Event of Default (each an ""):
Event of Default
 
(1) default in any payment of interest on any Note when due, continued for 30 days;
 
(2) default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, on any Note when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase or redemption, upon declaration or otherwise;

(4) failure by the Company to comply for 30 days after written notice with any of its obligations under the covenants described under Sections 4.09 through 4.19 (in each case, other than a failure to purchase Notes, which will constitute an Event of Default under clause (2) above);
 
(5) failure by the Company to comply for 60 days after written notice with its other agreements contained in this Indenture;
 
(6) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries), other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists or is created after the date of this Indenture, which default:
 
(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at final maturity of such Indebtedness prior to the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (""); or
payment default
 
(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the "");
cross-acceleration provision
 
and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates $50.0 million or more;
 
(7) (a) the Company or a Significant Subsidiary, pursuant to or within the meaning of any Bankruptcy Law:
 
(i) commences a voluntary case or proceeding;
 
(ii) consents to the entry of judgment, decree or order for relief against it in an involuntary case or proceeding;
 
(iii) consents to the appointment of a Custodian of it or for any substantial part of its property;
 
(iv) makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors;
 
(v) consents to or acquiesces in the institution of a bankruptcy or an insolvency proceeding against it;
 
(vi) takes any corporate action to authorize or effect any of the foregoing; or
 
(vii) takes any comparable action under any foreign laws relating to insolvency; or
 
(b) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any Bankruptcy Law that:
 
(i) is for relief in an involuntary case against the Company or a Significant Subsidiary pursuant to or within the meaning of any Bankruptcy Law;
 
(ii) appoints a Custodian for all or substantially all of the property of the Company or a Significant Subsidiary pursuant to or within the meaning of any Bankruptcy Law; or
 
(iii) orders the winding up or liquidation of the Company or a Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary pursuant to or within the meaning of any Bankruptcy Law;
 
and in the case of each of (i), (ii) and (iii) such order, decree or relief remains unstayed and in effect for 60 days;
 
(8) failure by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary to pay the uninsured portion of final judgments aggregating in excess of $50.0 million, which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days (the "");
judgment default provision
 
(9) any Note Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect (except as contemplated by the terms of this Indenture) or is declared null and void in a judicial proceeding or any Subsidiary Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary or group of Subsidiary Guarantors that taken together as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries would constitute a
 
Significant Subsidiary denies or disaffirms its obligations under this Indenture or its Note Guarantee.
 
However, a default under clauses (4) and (5) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Company of the default and the Company does not cure such default within the time specified in clauses (4) and (5) of this paragraph after receipt of such notice.
 
The foregoing shall constitute Events of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of Default and whether it is voluntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body.
 
 
If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default with respect to the Company of the type described in clause (7) of Section 6.01) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Company, or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes by notice to the Company and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable immediately.
 
In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (6) of Section 6.01 has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (6) of Section 6.01 shall be remedied or cured by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary or waived by the holders of the relevant Indebtedness within 60 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest on the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived.
 
If an Event of Default with respect to the Company described in clause (7) of Section 6.01 occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.
 
 
If a Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy by proceeding at law or in equity to collect the payment of principal of or interest on the Notes or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Notes or this Indenture.
 
The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Notes or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or
 
any Noteholder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon a Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Default. No remedy is exclusive of any other remedy. All available remedies are cumulative to the extent permitted by law.
 
 
The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes by notice to the Trustee may (a) waive, by their consent (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes), an existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences, except a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on a Note, and (b) rescind any such acceleration with respect to the Notes and its consequences if (1) rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, other than the nonpayment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes that have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived. When a Default or Event of Default is waived, it is deemed cured, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default or impair any consequent right.
 
 
The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on it. Subject to Section 7.01, however, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with any law or this Indenture, that the Trustee determines may be unduly prejudicial to the rights of another Noteholder, or that may involve the Trustee in personal liability; that the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction.
provided
 
In the event the Trustee takes any action or follows any direction pursuant to this Indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled to indemnification against any loss or expense caused by taking such action or following such direction.
 
 
Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to this Indenture or the Notes :
unless
 
(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;
 
(2) Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy;
 
(3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense;
 
(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity; and
 
(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.
 
A Noteholder may not use this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of another Noteholder or to obtain a preference or priority over such other Noteholder (it being understood that the Trustee does not have an affirmative duty to ascertain whether or not such actions or forbearances are unduly prejudicial to such Noteholders).
 
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest on a Note, on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Note, or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of the Holder.
 
 
If a Default in payment of principal or interest specified in Section 6.01(1) or (2) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Company or any other obligor on the Notes for the whole amount of principal and accrued interest and fees remaining unpaid, together with interest on overdue principal and, to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest on overdue installments of interest, in each case at the rate borne by the Notes and such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.
per annum
 
 
The Trustee may file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and the Noteholders allowed in any judicial proceedings relating to the Company, its creditors or its property and shall be entitled and empowered to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same, and any Custodian in any such judicial proceedings is hereby authorized by each Noteholder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Noteholders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agent and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Noteholder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Notes or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Noteholder in any such
 
proceeding. The Trustee shall be entitled to participate as a member of any official committee of creditors in the matters as it deems necessary or advisable.
 
 
If the Trustee collects any money or property pursuant to this Article Six, it shall pay out the money or property in the following order:
 
First: to the Trustee for amounts due under Section 7.07;
 
Second: to Holders for interest accrued on the Notes, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on the Notes for interest;
 
Third: to Holders for principal amounts due and unpaid on the Notes, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on the Notes for principal; and
 
Fourth: to the Company or, if applicable, the Guarantors, as their respective interests may appear.
 
The Trustee, upon prior notice to the Company, may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to Noteholders pursuant to this Section 6.10.
 
 
In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant. This Section 6.11 does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder pursuant to Section 6.07, or a suit by a Holder or Holders of more than 10% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes.
 
 
 
 
(a) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs.
 
(b) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default:
 
(1) The Trustee need perform only those duties as are specifically set forth herein or in the TIA and no duties, covenants, responsibilities or obligations shall be implied in this Indenture against the Trustee.
 
(2) In the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates (including Officers' Certificates) or opinions (including Opinions of Counsel) furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture. However, in the case of any such certificates or opinions which by any provision hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall examine the certificates and opinions to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture (but need not confirm or investigate the accuracy of mathematical calculations or other facts stated therein).
 
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Trustee may not be relieved from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that:
 
(1) This paragraph does not limit the effect of paragraph (b) of this Section 7.01.
 
(2) The Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer, unless it is proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts.
 
(3) The Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in accordance with a direction received by it pursuant to Section 6.05.
 
(d) No provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or to take or omit to take any action under this Indenture or take any action at the request or direction of Holders if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds is not assured to it.
 
(e) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture that in any way relates to the Trustee is subject to this Section 7.01.
 
(f) The Trustee shall not be liable for interest on any money received by it except as the Trustee may agree in writing with the Company. Money held in trust by the Trustee need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
 
(g) In the absence of bad faith, negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Trustee, the Trustee shall not be responsible for the application of any money by any Paying Agent other than the Trustee.
 
 
Subject to Section 7.01:
 
(a) The Trustee may rely conclusively on any document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper Person. The Trustee need not investigate any fact or matter stated in the document.
 
(b) Before the Trustee acts or refrains from acting, it may require an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, which shall conform to the provisions of Section 12.05. The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in reliance on such certificate or opinion.
 
(c) The Trustee may act through its attorneys and agents and shall not be responsible for the misconduct or negligence of any agent or attorney (other than an agent who is an employee of the Trustee) appointed with due care.
 
(d) The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith which it reasonably believes to be authorized or within its rights or powers.

(f) The Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request, order or direction of any of the Holders pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture, unless such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be incurred therein or thereby.
 
(g) The Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate (including any Officers' Certificate), statement, instrument, opinion (including any Opinion of Counsel), notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, or other paper or document, but the Trustee, in its discretion, may make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit.

(k) The rights, privileges, protections, immunities and benefits given to the Trustee, including, without limitation, its right to be indemnified, are extended to, and shall be enforceable by, the Trustee in each of its capacities hereunder, and to each agent, custodian and other Person employed to act hereunder.
 
(l) In no event shall the Trustee be responsible or liable for special, indirect, or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including, but not limited to, loss of profit) irrespective of whether the Trustee has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.
 
(m) The Trustee may request that the Company deliver a certificate, the form of which is included in Exhibit F hereto, setting forth the names of individuals and/or titles of officers authorized at such time to take specified actions pursuant to this Indenture.
 
 
The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Notes and may otherwise deal with the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. Any Agent may do the same with like rights. However, the Trustee must comply with Sections 7.10 and 7.11.
 
 
The Trustee shall not be responsible for and makes no representation as to the validity or adequacy of this Indenture or the Notes, it shall not be accountable for the Company's use of the proceeds from the Notes, and it shall not be responsible for any statement of the Company in this Indenture or any document issued in connection with the sale of Notes or any statement in the Notes other than the Trustee's certificate of authentication. The Trustee makes no representations with respect to the effectiveness or adequacy of this Indenture.
 
 
If a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee receives actual notice of such Default, the Trustee shall mail to each Noteholder notice of the uncured Default within 90 days after such Default occurs. Except in the case of a Default in payment of principal of, or interest on, any Note, including an accelerated payment and the failure to make payment on the Change of Control Payment Date pursuant to a Change of Control Offer or the Asset Disposition Purchase Date pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer, the Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as the Board of Directors, the executive committee, or a trust committee of directors and/or Responsible Officers, of the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interest of the Noteholders.
 
 
Within 60 days after each May 15 beginning with May 15, 2005, the Trustee shall, to the extent that any of the events described in TIA  313(a) occurred within the previous twelve months, but not otherwise, mail to each Noteholder a brief report dated as of such date that complies with TIA  313(a). The Trustee also shall comply with TIA  313(b), 313(c) and 313(d).

The Company shall notify the Trustee if the Notes become listed on any securities exchange or of any delisting thereof and the Trustee shall comply with TIA  313(d).
 
 
The Company shall pay to the Trustee from time to time such compensation as the Company and the Trustee shall from time to time agree in writing for its services hereunder. The Trustee's compensation shall not be limited by any law on compensation of a trustee of an express trust. The Company shall reimburse the Trustee upon request for all reasonable disbursements, expenses and advances (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) incurred or made by it in addition to the compensation for its services, except any such disbursements, expenses and advances as may be attributable to the Trustee's negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.

The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of any claim asserted against the Trustee or any of its agents, employees, officers, stockholders and directors for which it may seek indemnity. The Company may, subject to the approval of the Trustee (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), defend the claim and the Trustee shall cooperate in the defense. The Trustee and its agents, employees, officers, stockholders and directors subject to the claim may have one firm of separate counsel and the Company shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel; , , that the Company will not be required to pay such fees and expenses if, subject to the approval of the Trustee (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), it assumes the Trustee's defense and there is no conflict of interest between the Company and the Trustee and its agents, employees, officers, stockholders and directors subject to the claim in connection with such defense as reasonably determined by the Trustee. The Company need not pay for any settlement made without its written consent. The Company need

however
 
not reimburse any expense or indemnify against any loss or liability to the extent incurred by the Trustee through its negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.
 
To secure the Company's payment obligations in this Section 7.07, the Trustee shall have a senior claim prior to the Notes against all money or property held or collected by the Trustee, in its capacity as Trustee.
 
When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after a Default specified in Section 6.01(7) occurs, such expenses and the compensation for such services shall be paid to the extent allowed under any Bankruptcy Law.
 
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.07 shall survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or the appointment of a successor Trustee.
 
 
The Trustee may resign at any time by so notifying the Company in writing. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may remove the Trustee by so notifying the Company and the Trustee and may appoint a successor Trustee. The Company may remove the Trustee if:
 
(1) the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10;
 
(2) the Trustee is adjudged a bankrupt or an insolvent;
 
(3) a receiver or other public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property; or
 
(4) the Trustee becomes incapable of acting.
 
If the Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy exists in the office of Trustee for any reason, the Company shall notify each Holder of such event and shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee. Within one year after the successor Trustee takes office, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes may appoint a successor Trustee to replace the successor Trustee appointed by the Company.
 
A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company. Immediately after that, the retiring Trustee shall transfer, after payment of all sums then owing to the Trustee pursuant to Section 7.07, all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee, subject to the Lien provided in Section 7.07, the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture. A successor Trustee shall mail notice of its succession to each Noteholder.
 
If a successor Trustee does not take office within 60 days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee, the Company or the Holders of at least 10% in principal
 
amount of the outstanding Notes may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee at the expense of the Company.
 
If the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10, any Noteholder may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee.
 
Notwithstanding replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this Section 7.08, the Company's obligations under Section 7.07 shall continue for the benefit of the retiring Trustee.
 
 
If the Trustee consolidates with, merges or converts into, or transfers all or substantially all of its corporate trust business to, another corporation or national association, the resulting, surviving or transferee corporation without any further act shall, if such resulting, surviving or transferee corporation or national association is otherwise eligible hereunder, be the successor Trustee; that such corporation or national association shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article Seven.
provided
 
 
This Indenture shall always have a Trustee who satisfies the requirement of TIA  310(a)(1), 310(a)(2) and 310(a)(5). The Trustee shall have a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 as set forth in its most recent published annual report of condition. In addition, if the Trustee is a corporation included in a bank holding company system, the Trustee, independently of the bank holding company, shall meet the capital requirements of TIA  310(a)(2). The Trustee shall comply with TIA  310(b); , , that there shall be excluded from the operation of TIA  310(b)(1) any indenture or indentures under which other securities, or certificates of interest or participation in other securities, of the Company are outstanding, if the requirements for such exclusion set forth in TIA  310(b)(1) are met. The provisions of TIA  310 shall apply to the Company and any other obligor of the Notes.
provided
however
 
 
The Trustee, in its capacity as Trustee hereunder, shall comply with TIA  311(a), excluding any creditor relationship listed in TIA  311(b). A Trustee who has resigned or been removed shall be subject to TIA  311(a) to the extent indicated.
 
 
 
 
This Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect (except as to rights of registration of transfer or exchange of Notes, which shall survive until all Notes have been cancelled) as to all outstanding Notes when either:
 
(1) all the Notes that have been authenticated and delivered (except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes which have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment U.S. Legal Tender has been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Company and thereafter repaid to the Company or discharged from this trust) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, or
 
(2) (a) all Notes not delivered to the Trustee for cancellation otherwise (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable, or may be called for redemption, within one year or (iii) have been called for redemption pursuant to the redemption provisions of this Indenture and the Notes and, in any case, the Company has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds, in trust solely for the benefit of the Holders, U.S. Legal Tender, U.S. Government Obligations or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient (without consideration of any reinvestment of interest) to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness (including all principal and accrued interest) on the Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation,
 
(b) the Company has paid all sums payable by it under this Indenture,
 
(c) the Company has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or on the date of redemption, as the case may be, and
 
(d) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent providing for or relating to the termination of the Company's obligations under the Notes and this Indenture have been complied with. Such Opinion of Counsel shall also state that such satisfaction and discharge does not result in a default under the Senior Credit Agreement or any other material instrument then known to such counsel that binds the Company or any Significant Subsidiary.
 
Subject to the next sentence and notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph, the Company's obligations in Sections 2.05, 2.06, 2.07, 2.08, 4.01, 4.02, 4.03 (with respect to the Company only), 7.07, 8.05 and 8.06 shall survive until the Notes are no longer outstanding pursuant to the last paragraph of Section 2.08. After the Notes are no longer outstanding, the Company's obligations in Sections 7.07, 8.05 and 8.06 shall survive.
 
After such delivery or irrevocable deposit, the Trustee upon request shall acknowledge in writing the discharge of the Company's obligations under the Notes and this Indenture except for those surviving obligations specified above.
 
 
(a) The Company may, at its option by Board Resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company, at any time, elect to have either the Legal Defeasance option or the Covenant Defeasance option in paragraph (b) below be applied to all outstanding Notes upon compliance with the conditions set forth in Section 8.03.
 
(b) Subject to Sections 8.02(c) and 8.03, the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors at any time may terminate (i) all their obligations under the Notes and this Indenture (""), and after giving effect to such Legal Defeasance, any omission to comply with such obligations shall no longer constitute a Default or Event of Default or (ii) their obligations under Sections 4.09 through 4.19 and clause (3) of the first paragraph of Section 5.01, and the Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by reason of any reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply with such covenants shall no longer constitute a Default or an Event of Default under Sections 6.01 (6), (7) (with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries), (8) and (9) and the limitations contained in clause (3) of the first paragraph of Section 5.01 and the events specified in such Sections shall no longer constitute an Event of Default (clause (ii) being referred to as ""), but except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and the Notes shall be unaffected thereby. The Company may exercise its Legal Defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its Covenant Defeasance option.
Legal Defeasance
Covenant Defeasance
 
If the Company exercises its Legal Defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default and the Note Guarantees in effect at such time shall terminate. If the Company exercises its Covenant Defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified under Sections 6.01(4), (5), (6), (7) (with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries), (8) or (9) or because of failure to comply with clause (3) of the first paragraph of Section 5.01.
 
Upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein and upon request of the Company, the Trustee shall acknowledge in writing the discharge of those obligations that the Company terminates.
 
(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 8.01(a) and (b), the Company's obligations under Sections 2.02 through 2.11, 4.01 through 4.04, 4.06, 4.08, 6.07, 7.07 and 7.08 and in this Article Eight shall survive until the Notes have been paid in full. After the Notes have been paid in full, the Company's obligations under Sections 7.07, 8.04 and 8.05 shall survive.
 
 
The following shall be the conditions to the application of either the Legal Defeasance option as the Covenant Defeasance option hereof to the outstanding Notes:
 
In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:
 
(1) the Company must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, cash in U.S. Legal Tender, U.S. Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the outstanding Notes on the Stated Maturity or on the applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and the Company must specify whether the Notes are being defeased to maturity or to a particular redemption date;
 
(2) in the case of an election of Legal Defeasance, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that (a) the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling or (b) since the date of this Indenture, there has been a change in the applicable federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, the Holders of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;
 
(3) in the case of an election of Covenant Defeasance, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that the Holders of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;
 
(4) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing either: (a) on the date of such deposit (other than a Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to such deposit), or (b) insofar as Events of Default from bankruptcy or insolvency events are concerned, at any time in the period ending on the 91st day after the date of deposit; that such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, shall be deemed to have occurred on the date of such deposit, subject to an Event of Default from bankruptcy or insolvency within such 91-day period;
provided
 
(5) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any material agreement or instrument (other than this Indenture) to which the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is bound;
 
(6) the Company must deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Company with the intent of preferring the Holders of Notes over the other creditors of the Company with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors of the Company or others; and
 
(7) the Company must deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that all conditions precedent relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance have been complied with.
 
 
The Trustee or Paying Agent shall hold in trust U.S. Legal Tender and U.S. Government Obligations deposited with it pursuant to this Article Eight, and shall apply the deposited U.S. Legal Tender and the money from U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with this Indenture to the payment of principal of and interest on the Notes. The Trustee shall be under no obligation to invest said U.S. Legal Tender and U.S. Government Obligations except as it may agree with the Company.
 
The Company shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the U.S. Legal Tender and U.S. Government Obligations deposited pursuant to Section 8.03 or the principal and interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of the outstanding Notes.
 
Anything in this Article Eight to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon the Company's request any U.S. Legal Tender and U.S. Government Obligations held by it as provided in Section 8.03 which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, are in excess of the amount thereof that would then be required to be deposited to effect an equivalent Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.
 
 
Subject to this Article Eight, the Trustee and the Paying Agent shall promptly pay to the Company upon request any excess U.S. Legal Tender and U.S. Government Obligations held by them at any time and thereupon shall be relieved from all liability with respect to such money. The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall pay to the Company upon request any money held by them for the payment of principal or interest that remains unclaimed for two years; that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any payment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once in a newspaper of general circulation in the City of New York or mail to each Holder entitled to such money notice that such money remains unclaimed and that after a date specified therein which shall be at least 30 days from the date of such publication or mailing any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company. After payment to the Company, Holders entitled to such money must look to the Company for payment as general creditors unless an applicable law designates another Person.
provided
 
 
If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any U.S. Legal Tender and U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with this Article Eight by reason of any legal proceeding or by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, the Company's obligations under this Indenture and the Notes shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to this Article Eight until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such U.S. Legal Tender and U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with this Article Eight; that if the Company has made any payment of interest on or principal of any Notes because of the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Notes to receive such payment from the U.S. Legal Tender and U.S. Government Obligations held by the Trustee or Paying Agent.
provided
 
 
 
 
Subject to Section 9.03, the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee, together, may amend or supplement this Indenture, the Notes or the Note Guarantees without notice to or consent of any Noteholder:
 
(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency;
 
(2) provide for the assumption by a successor corporation of the obligations of the Company under this Indenture or the assumption by a corporation, partnership, trust or limited liability company of the obligations of a Subsidiary Guarantor under this Indenture;
 
(3) provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes ( that the uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code, or in a manner such that the uncertificated Notes are described in Section 163(f) (2) (B) of the Code);
provided
 
(4) add Guarantees with respect to the Notes or release a Subsidiary Guarantor in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Indenture;
 
(5) secure the Notes;
 
(6) add to the covenants of the Company for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any right or power conferred upon the Company;
 
(7) make any change that does not materially adversely affect the rights of any Holder;
 
(8) comply with any requirement of the SEC in connection with the qualification of this Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act;
 
(9) provide for the issuance of exchange securities which shall have terms substantially identical in all respects to the Notes (except that the transfer restrictions contained in the Notes shall be modified or eliminated as appropriate) and which shall be treated, together with any outstanding Notes, as a single class of securities;
 
(10) release a Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under its Note Guarantee or this Indenture in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Indenture; or
 
(11) provide for the appointment of a successor trustee; provided that such successor trustee is otherwise qualified and eligible to act as such under the terms of this Indenture;
 
that the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel and an Officers' Certificate, each stating that such amendment or supplement complies with the provisions of this Section 9.01.
provided
 
 
(a) Subject to Sections 6.07 and 9.03, the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee, together, with the written consent of the Holder or Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes, may amend or supplement this Indenture, the Notes or the Note Guarantees, without notice to any other Noteholders. Subject to Sections 6.07 and 9.03, the Holder or Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes may waive compliance with any provision of this Indenture, the Notes or the Note Guarantees without notice to any other Noteholders.
 
(b) Notwithstanding Section 9.02(a), without the consent of each Holder of an outstanding Note affected, no amendment, supplement or waiver may, among other things:
 
(1) reduce the amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment;
 
(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any Note;
 
(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Note;
 
(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Note or change the time at which any Note may be redeemed as described in Section 5 or Section 6 of the Notes, whether through an amendment or waiver of provisions in the covenants, definitions or otherwise;
 
(5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Note;
 
(6) impair the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on such Holder's Notes on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such Holder's Notes;
 
(7) make any change in the amendment provisions which require each Holder's consent or in the waiver provisions;
 
(8) make any change the ranking of Notes or the Note Guarantees that adversely affects the rights of any Holder of Notes;
 
(9) release any Subsidiary Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Note Guarantee, except as permitted by this Indenture; or
 
(10) make any change in the preceding amendment and waiver provisions.
 
(c) It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, supplement or waiver but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.
 
(d) After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 9.02 becomes effective, the Company shall mail to the Holders affected thereby a notice briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any failure of the Company to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such amendment, supplement or waiver.
 
 
 
From the date on which this Indenture is qualified under the TIA, every amendment, waiver or supplement of this Indenture, the Notes or the Note Guarantees shall comply with the TIA as then in effect.
 
 
Until an amendment, waiver or supplement becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder is a continuing consent by the Holder and every subsequent Holder of a Note or portion of a Note that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Note, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Note. However, any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent as to his Note or portion of his Note by notice to the Trustee or the Company received before the date on which such amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective. An amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective in accordance with the terms thereof (or if silent as to effectiveness, on the date on which the Trustee receives an Officers' Certificate certifying that the Holders of the requisite principal amount of Notes have consented (and not theretofore revoked such consent) to such amendment, supplement or waiver ) and thereafter binds every Holder.
 
The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to consent to any amendment, supplement or waiver which record date shall be at least 30 days prior to the first solicitation of such consent. If a record date is fixed, then notwithstanding the last sentence of the immediately preceding paragraph, those Persons who were Holders at such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only those Persons, shall be entitled to revoke any consent previously given, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date. No such consent shall be valid or effective for more than 90 days after such record date. The Company shall inform the Trustee in writing of the fixed record date if applicable.
 
After an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, it shall bind every Noteholder, unless it makes a change described in any of clauses (1) through (11) of Section 9.02(b), in which case, the amendment, supplement or waiver shall bind only each Holder of a Note who has consented to it and every subsequent Holder of a Note or portion of a Note that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Note; that any such waiver shall not impair or affect the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest on a Note, on or after the respective due dates therefor, or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates without the consent of such Holder.
provided
 
 
If an amendment, supplement or waiver changes the terms of a Note, the Company may require the Holder of the Note to deliver it to the Trustee. The Company shall provide the Trustee with an appropriate notation on the Note about the changed terms and cause the Trustee to return it to the Holder at the Company's expense. Alternatively, if the Company or the Trustee so determines, the Company in exchange for the Note shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a new Note that reflects the changed terms. Failure to make the appropriate notation or issue a new Note shall not affect the validity and effect of such amendment, supplement or waiver.
 
 
The Trustee shall execute any amendment, supplement or waiver authorized pursuant to this Article Nine; that the Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, execute any such amendment, supplement or waiver which affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture. The Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and shall be fully protected in conclusively relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel and an Officers' Certificate each stating that the execution of any amendment, supplement or waiver authorized pursuant to this Article Nine is authorized or permitted by this Indenture and constituted the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with its terms. Such Opinion of Counsel shall be at the expense of the Company.
provided
 
 
 
 
 
 
Subject to the provisions of this Article Eleven, each of the Guarantors hereby, jointly and severally, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, on a senior subordinated basis to each Holder of a Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, irrespective of the validity and enforceability of this Indenture, the Notes or the obligations of the Company or any other Guarantors to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder: (a) (x) the due and punctual payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes when and as the same shall become due and payable, whether at maturity, upon redemption or repurchase, by acceleration or otherwise, (y) the due and punctual payment of interest on the overdue principal and (to the extent permitted by law) interest, if any, on the Notes and (z) the due and punctual payment and performance of all other obligations of the Company and all other obligations of the other Guarantors (including under the Note Guarantees), in each case, to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder (including amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07 hereof), all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof (collectively, the ""); and (b) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Notes or any of such other obligations, the due and punctual payment and performance of Guarantee Obligations in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at maturity, upon redemption or repurchase, by acceleration or otherwise. Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed, or failing performance of any other obligation of the Company to the Holders under this Indenture or under the Notes, for whatever reason, each Guarantor shall be obligated to pay, or to perform or cause the performance of, the same immediately. A Default under this Indenture or the Notes shall constitute an event of default under the Note Guarantees, and shall entitle the Holders of Notes to accelerate the obligations of the Guarantors thereunder in the same manner and to the same extent as the obligations of the Company.
Guarantee Obligations
 
Each of the Guarantors hereby agrees that (to the fullest extent permitted by law) its obligations hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Notes or this Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder of the Notes with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, any release of any other Guarantor, the recovery of any judgment against the Company, any action to enforce the same, whether or not a Note Guarantee is affixed to any particular Note, or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a Guarantor. Each of the Guarantors hereby waives (to the fullest extent permitted by law) the benefit of diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever and covenants that its Note
 
Guarantee shall not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in the Notes, this Indenture and this Note Guarantee. This Note Guarantee is a guarantee of payment and not of collection. If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Company or to any Guarantor, or any custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to the Company or such Guarantor, any amount paid by the Company or such Guarantor to the Trustee or such Holder, this Note Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and effect. Each Guarantor further agrees (to the fullest extent permitted by law) that, as between it, on the one hand, and the Holders of Notes and the Trustee, on the other hand, (a) subject to this Article Eleven, the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article Six for the purposes of this Note Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby, and (b) in the event of any acceleration of such obligations as provided in Article Six hereof, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for the purpose of this Note Guarantee.
 
 
 
Each Guarantor, and by its acceptance of Notes, each Holder, hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such parties that the Note Guarantee of such Guarantor not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to any Note Guarantee. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Trustee, the Holders and the Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the obligations of such Guarantor under its Note Guarantee and this Article Eleven shall be limited to the maximum amount as will, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Guarantor that are relevant under such laws, and after giving effect to any collections from, rights to receive contribution from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Guarantor under this Article Eleven, result in the obligations of such Guarantor under its Note Guarantee not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.
 
 
To further evidence its Note Guarantee set forth in Section 11.01, each Guarantor hereby agrees that a notation of such Note Guarantee, substantially in the form of hereto, shall be endorsed on each Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee. Such Note Guarantee shall be executed on behalf of each Guarantor by either manual or facsimile signature of one Officer or other person duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of each Guarantor who shall have been duly authorized to so execute by all requisite corporate action. The validity and enforceability of any Note Guarantee shall not be affected by the fact that it is not affixed to any particular Note.
Exhibit E
 
Each of the Guarantors hereby agrees that its Note Guarantee set forth in Section 11.01 shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to endorse on each Note a notation of such Note Guarantee.
 
If an Officer of a Guarantor whose signature is on this Indenture or a Note Guarantee no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Note on which such Note Guarantee is endorsed or at any time thereafter, such Guarantor's Note Guarantee of such Note shall nevertheless be valid.
 
The delivery of any Note by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof hereunder, shall constitute due delivery of any Note Guarantee set forth in this Indenture on behalf of each Guarantor.
 
 
A Subsidiary Guarantor shall be released from its obligations under its Note Guarantee and its obligations under this Indenture and the Registration Rights Agreement:
 
(1) in the event of a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor, by way of merger, consolidation or otherwise, or a sale or other disposition of all of the equity interests of such Subsidiary Guarantor then held by the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries;
 
(2) if such Subsidiary Guarantor is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or otherwise ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary, in each case in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture, upon effectiveness of such designation or when it first ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary, respectively; or
 
(3) if such Subsidiary Guarantor no longer Guarantees any other Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company (other than if such Subsidiary Guarantor no longer Guarantees any other Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company as a result of payment under any Guarantee of any such Indebtedness by any Subsidiary Guarantor); provided that a Subsidiary Guarantor shall not be permitted to be released from its Note Guarantee if it is an obligor with respect to Indebtedness that would not, under the Section 4.10, be permitted to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor;
 
, , in either case that any such termination shall occur only to the extent that all obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under all of its Guarantees of any Indebtedness of the Company or any Indebtedness of any other Guarantor shall also terminate upon such release and none of its Equity Interests are pledged for the benefit of any holder of any Indebtedness of the Company or any Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company.
provided
however
 
The Trustee shall execute an appropriate instrument prepared by the Company evidencing the release of a Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under its Note Guarantee upon receipt of a request by the Company or such Guarantor accompanied by an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel certifying as to the compliance with this Section 11.05;
 
, , that the legal counsel delivering such Opinion of Counsel may rely as to matters of fact on one or more Officers' Certificates of the Company.
provided
however
 
Except as set forth in Articles Four and Five and this Section 11.05, nothing contained in this Indenture or in any of the Notes shall prevent any consolidation or merger of a Guarantor with or into the Company or another Guarantor or shall prevent any sale or conveyance of the property of a Guarantor as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to the Company or another Guarantor.
 
 
Until this Indenture is discharged and all of the Notes are discharged and paid in full, each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives and agrees not to exercise any claim or other rights which it may now or hereafter acquire against the Company that arise from the existence, payment, performance or enforcement of the Company's obligations under the Notes or this Indenture and such Guarantor's obligations under this Note Guarantee and this Indenture, in any such instance including, without limitation, any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution, indemnification, and any right to participate in any claim or remedy of the Holders against the Company, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity, or under contract, statute or common law, including, without limitation, the right to take or receive from the Company, directly or indirectly, in cash or other assets or by set-off or in any other manner, payment or security on account of such claim or other rights. If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor in violation of the preceding sentence and any amounts owing to the Trustee or the Holders of Notes under the Notes, this Indenture, or any other document or instrument delivered under or in connection with such agreements or instruments, shall not have been paid in full, such amount shall have been deemed to have been paid to such Guarantor for the benefit of, and held in trust for the benefit of, the Trustee or the Holders and shall forthwith be paid to the Trustee for the benefit of itself or such Holders to be credited and applied to the obligations in favor of the Trustee or the Holders, as the case may be, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of this Indenture. Each Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive direct and indirect benefits from the financing arrangements contemplated by this Indenture and that the waiver set forth in this Section 11.06 is knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.
 
 
Each Guarantor agrees to make immediate payment to the Trustee on behalf of the Holders of all Guarantee Obligations owing or payable to the respective Holders upon receipt of a demand for payment therefor by the Trustee to such Guarantor in writing.
 
 
Each payment to be made by a Guarantor hereunder in respect of the Guarantee Obligations shall be payable in the currency or currencies in which such Guarantee Obligations are denominated, and shall be made without set-off, counterclaim, reduction or diminution of any kind or nature.
 
 
The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are and shall be absolute and unconditional and any monies or amounts expressed to be owing or payable by each Guarantor hereunder which may not be recoverable from such Guarantor on the basis of a Guarantee shall be recoverable from such Guarantor as a primary obligor and principal debtor in respect thereof.
 
 
The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall be continuing and shall remain in full force and effect until all such obligations have been paid and satisfied in full. Each Guarantor agrees with the Trustee that it will from time to time deliver to the Trustee suitable acknowledgments of this continued liability hereunder and under any other instrument or instruments in such form as counsel to the Trustee may reasonably request and as will prevent any action brought against it in respect of any default hereunder being barred by any statute of limitations now or hereafter in force and, in the event of the failure of a Guarantor so to do, it hereby irrevocably appoints the Trustee the attorney and agent of such Guarantor to make, execute and deliver such written acknowledgment or acknowledgments or other instruments as may from time to time become necessary or reasonably advisable, in the judgment of the Trustee on the advice of counsel, to fully maintain and keep in force the liability of such Guarantor hereunder.
 
 
The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be satisfied, reduced or discharged solely by the payment of such principal, premium, if any, interest, fees and other monies or amounts as may at any time prior to discharge of this Indenture pursuant to Article Eight be or become owing or payable under or by virtue of or otherwise in connection with the Notes or this Indenture.
 
 
The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall continue to be effective or shall be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment which would otherwise have reduced the obligations of any Guarantor hereunder (whether such payment shall have been made by or on behalf of the Company or by or on behalf of a Guarantor) is rescinded or reclaimed from any of the Holders upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of the Company or any Guarantor or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made. If demand for, or acceleration of the time for, payment by the Company or any other Guarantor is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of the Company or such Guarantor, all such Indebtedness otherwise subject to demand for payment or acceleration shall nonetheless be payable by each Guarantor as provided herein.
 
 
Subject to Section 11.05, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected, impaired or diminished in any way by any act, omission, matter or thing whatsoever, occurring before, upon or after any demand for payment
 
hereunder (and whether or not known or consented to by any Guarantor or any of the Holders) which, but for this provision, might constitute a whole or partial defense to a claim against any Guarantor hereunder or might operate to release or otherwise exonerate any Guarantor from any of its obligations hereunder or otherwise affect such obligations, whether occasioned by default of any of the Holders or otherwise, including, without limitation:
 
(a) any limitation of status or power, disability, incapacity or other circumstance relating to the Company or any other Person, including any insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization, readjustment, composition, dissolution, winding-up or other proceeding involving or affecting the Company or any other Person;
 
(b) any irregularity, defect, unenforceability or invalidity in respect of any indebtedness or other obligation of the Company or any other Person under this Indenture, the Notes or any other document or instrument;
 
(c) any failure of the Company or any other Guarantor, whether or not without fault on its part, to perform or comply with any of the provisions of this Indenture, the Notes or any Note Guarantee, or to give notice thereof to a Guarantor;
 
(d) the taking or enforcing or exercising or the refusal or neglect to take or enforce or exercise any right or remedy from or against the Company or any other Person or their respective assets or the release or discharge of any such right or remedy;
 
(e) the granting of time, renewals, extensions, compromises, concessions, waivers, releases, discharges and other indulgences to the Company or any other Person;
 
(f) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, any of the Notes, or any other amendment, variation, supplement, replacement or waiver of, or any consent to departure from, any of the Notes or this Indenture, including, without limitation, any increase or decrease in the principal amount of or premium, if any, or interest on any of the Notes;
 
(g) any change in the ownership, control, name, objects, businesses, assets, capital structure or constitution of the Company or a Guarantor;
 
(h) any merger or amalgamation of the Company or a Guarantor with any Person or Persons;
 
(i) the occurrence of any change in the laws, rules, regulations or ordinances of any jurisdiction by any present or future action of any governmental authority or court amending, varying, reducing or otherwise affecting, or purporting to amend, vary, reduce or otherwise affect, any of the Guarantee Obligations or the obligations of a Guarantor under its Note Guarantee; and
 
(j) any other circumstance, including release of a Guarantor pursuant to Section 11.05 (other than by complete, irrevocable payment) that might otherwise constitute
 
a legal or equitable discharge or defense of the Company under this Indenture or the Notes or of a Guarantor in respect of its Note Guarantee hereunder.
 
 
Without in any way limiting the provisions of Section 11.01, each Guarantor hereby waives (to the fullest extent permitted by law) notice of acceptance hereof, notice of any liability of any Guarantor hereunder, notice or proof of reliance by the Holders upon the obligations of any Guarantor hereunder, and diligence, presentment, demand for payment on the Company, protest, notice of dishonor or non-payment of any of the Guarantee Obligations, or other notice or formalities to the Company or any Guarantor of any kind whatsoever.
 
 
Neither the Trustee nor any other Person shall have any obligation to enforce or exhaust any rights or remedies against the Company or any other Person or any property of the Company or any other Person before the Trustee is entitled to demand payment and performance by any or all Guarantors of their liabilities and obligations under their Note Guarantees or under this Indenture.
 
 
The Holders, without releasing, discharging, limiting or otherwise affecting in whole or in part the obligations and liabilities of any Guarantor hereunder and without the consent of or notice to any Guarantor, may
 
(a) grant time, renewals, extensions, compromises, concessions, waivers, releases, discharges and other indulgences to the Company or any other Person;
 
(b) take or abstain from taking security or collateral from the Company or from perfecting security or collateral of the Company;
 
(c) release, discharge, compromise, realize, enforce or otherwise deal with or do any act or thing in respect of (with or without consideration) any and all collateral, mortgages or other security given by the Company or any third party with respect to the obligations or matters contemplated by this Indenture or the Notes;
 
(d) accept compromises or arrangements from the Company;
 
(e) apply all monies at any time received from the Company or from any security upon such part of the Guarantee Obligations as the Holders may see fit or change any such application in whole or in part from time to time as the Holders may see fit; and
 
(f) otherwise deal with, or waive or modify their right to deal with, the Company and all other Persons and any security as the Holders or the Trustee may see fit.
 
 
If any Guarantor fails to pay in accordance with Section 11.07 hereof, the Trustee may proceed in its name as trustee hereunder in the enforcement of the Note Guarantee of any such Guarantor and such Guarantor's obligations thereunder and hereunder by any remedy provided by law, whether by legal proceedings or otherwise, and to recover from such Guarantor the obligations.
 
 
No amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Indenture relating to any Guarantor or consent to any departure by any Guarantor or any other Person from any such provision will in any event be effective unless it is signed by such Guarantor and the Trustee.
 
 
Each Guarantor hereby acknowledges communication of the terms of this Indenture and the Notes and consents to and approves of the same.
 
 
Each Guarantor shall pay on demand by the Trustee any and all costs, fees and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees) incurred by the Trustee, its agents, advisors and counsel or any of the Holders in enforcing any of their rights under any Note Guarantee.
 
 
No Note Guarantee shall operate by way of merger of any of the obligations of a Guarantor under any other agreement, including, without limitation, this Indenture. No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising, on the part of the Trustee or the Holders, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or under this Indenture or the Notes, shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or under this Indenture or the Notes preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges in the Note Guarantee and under this Indenture, the Notes and any other document or instrument between a Guarantor and/or the Company and the Trustee are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privilege provided by law.
 
 
Subject to Section 11.05, without prejudice to the survival of any of the other obligations of each Guarantor hereunder, the obligations of each Guarantor under Section 11.01 shall survive the payment in full of the Guarantee Obligations and shall be enforceable against such Guarantor without regard to and without giving effect to any defense, right of offset or counterclaim available to or which may be asserted by the Company or any Guarantor.
 
 
The obligations of each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee and this Indenture are in addition to and not in substitution for any other obligations to the Trustee or to any of the Holders in relation to this Indenture or the Notes and any guarantees or security at any time held by or for the benefit of any of them.
 
 
Any provision of this Article Eleven which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate the remaining provisions and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction unless its removal would substantially defeat the basic intent, spirit and purpose of this Indenture and this Article Eleven.
 
 
Each Note Guarantee shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each Guarantor and the Trustee and the other Holders and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except that no Guarantor may assign any of its obligations hereunder or thereunder.
 
 
 
 
If any provision of this Indenture limits, qualifies, or conflicts with another provision which is required or deemed to be included in this Indenture by the TIA, such required or deemed provision shall control. If any provision of this Indenture modifies or excludes any provision of the TIA that may be so modified or excluded, the latter provision shall be deemed to apply to this Indenture as so modified or excluded, as the case may be.

Such Holder must provide an indemnity bond or other indemnity, sufficient in the judgment of both the Company and the Trustee, to protect the Company, the Trustee or any Agent from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Note is replaced. The Company may charge such Holder for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in replacing a Note pursuant to this Section 2.07, including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel and of the Trustee.

Notes outstanding at any time are all the Notes that have been authenticated by the Trustee except those cancelled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation and those described in this Section as not outstanding. A Note does not cease to be outstanding because the Company, the Guarantors or any of their respective Affiliates holds the Note (subject to the provisions of Section 2.09).
 
If a Note is replaced pursuant to Section 2.07 (other than a mutilated Note surrendered for replacement), it ceases to be outstanding unless a Responsible Officer of the Trustee receives proof satisfactory to it that the replaced Note is held by a purchaser. A mutilated Note ceases to be outstanding upon surrender of such Note and replacement thereof pursuant to Section 2.07. If the principal amount of any Note is considered paid under Section 4.01, it ceases to be outstanding and interest ceases to accrue. If on a Redemption Date or the Maturity Date the Trustee or Paying Agent (other than the Company or an Affiliate thereof) holds U.S. Legal Tender or U.S. Government Obligations sufficient to pay all of the principal and interest due on the Notes payable on that date, then on and after that date such Notes cease to be outstanding and interest on them ceases to accrue.

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of Notes have concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, Notes owned by the Company or any of its
 
Affiliates shall be disregarded, except that, for the purposes of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in conclusively relying on any such direction, waiver or consent, only Notes that a Responsible Officer of the Trustee actually knows are so owned shall be disregarded.
 
 
Until definitive Notes are ready for delivery, the Company may prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate temporary Notes. Temporary Notes shall be substantially in the form of definitive Notes but may have variations that the Company considers appropriate for temporary Notes. Without unreasonable delay, the Company shall prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate definitive Notes in exchange for temporary Notes. Until such exchange, temporary Notes shall be entitled to the same rights, benefits and privileges as definitive Notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as the Notes are represented by a Global Note, such Global Note may be in typewritten form.
 
 
The Company at any time may deliver Notes to the Trustee for cancellation. The Registrar and the Paying Agent shall forward to the Trustee any Notes surrendered to them for transfer, exchange or payment. The Trustee, or at the direction of the Trustee, the Registrar or the Paying Agent (other than the Company or a Subsidiary), and no one else, shall cancel and, at the written direction of the Company, shall dispose of all Notes surrendered for transfer, exchange, payment or cancellation in accordance with its customary procedures. Subject to Section 2.07, the Company may not issue new Notes to replace Notes that it has paid or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation. If the Company or any Guarantor shall acquire any of the Notes, such acquisition shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the Indebtedness represented by such Notes unless and until the same are surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation pursuant to this Section 2.11.
 
 
If the Company defaults in a payment of interest on the Notes, it shall, unless the Trustee fixes another record date pursuant to Section 6.10, pay the defaulted interest, plus (to the extent lawful) any interest payable on the defaulted interest, in any lawful manner. The Company may pay the defaulted interest to the persons who are Holders on a subsequent special record date, which date shall be the fifteenth day next preceding the date fixed by the Company for the payment of defaulted interest or the next succeeding Business Day if such date is not a Business Day. At least 15 days before any such subsequent special record date, the Company shall mail to each Holder, with a copy to the Trustee, a notice that states the subsequent special record date, the payment date and the amount of defaulted interest, and interest payable on such defaulted interest, if any, to be paid.
 
 
The Company in issuing the Notes may use a "CUSIP" number, and if so, the Trustee shall use the CUSIP number in notices of redemption or exchange as a convenience to Holders; , , that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to

the correctness or accuracy of the CUSIP number printed in the notice or on the Notes, and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Notes. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee in writing of any change in the CUSIP numbers.
 
 
Prior to 11:00 a.m. New York City time on each Interest Payment Date, Maturity Date, Redemption Date, Change of Control Payment Date and Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Company shall have deposited with the Paying Agent in immediately available funds money sufficient to make cash payments, if any, due on such Interest Payment Date, Maturity Date, Redemption Date, Change of Control Payment Date and Asset Disposition Purchase Date, as the case may be, in a timely manner which permits the Paying Agent to remit payment to the Holders on such Interest Payment Date, Maturity Date, Redemption Date, Change of Control Payment Date and Asset Disposition Purchase Date, as the case may be.

(1) subject to clause (2) below, in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this Section 4.10, the Company, in its sole discretion, will be permitted to classify such item of Indebtedness on the date of Incurrence, or later reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness in any manner that complies with this Section 4.10, and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of such clauses;
 
(2) (x) all Indebtedness Incurred or outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities on the date of this Indenture or at the time of the closing of the Acquisition and (y) all other Indebtedness Incurred to finance the Acquisition (or otherwise Incurred in
 
connection with the Acquisition, or in anticipation or contemplation thereof), whether Incurred under the Senior Credit Facilities or otherwise, shall be deemed Incurred under the Senior Credit Facilities on the Issue Date under clause (1) of "Permitted Indebtedness" and not the Coverage Ratio Exception or any of the other clauses under "Permitted Indebtedness";
 
(3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit relating to, Indebtedness which is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included as long as Incurred by a Person that could have Incurred such Indebtedness;
 
(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit are Incurred pursuant to the Senior Credit Facilities and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to the first or second paragraph above and the letters of credit relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;
 
(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor, will be equal to the greater of its voluntary or involuntary liquidation preference and its maximum fixed repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium);
 
(6) Indebtedness permitted by this Section 4.10 need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this Section 4.10 permitting such Indebtedness;
 
(7) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined in accordance with GAAP;
 
(8) the principal amount of any Indebtedness outstanding in connection with a Qualified Receivables Transaction is the Receivables Transaction Amount relating to such Qualified Receivables Transaction (which amount shall not include dispositions of self-pay receivables in the ordinary course of business, which the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries believes in good faith cannot be paid in full); and
 
(9) for purposes of clarity, except as set forth in clause (2) above, Indebtedness may be Incurred under the Senior Credit Facilities pursuant to the Coverage Ratio Exception and clauses (1), (2) (with respect to Guarantees) and (17) of the definition of "Permitted Indebtedness" so long as the borrowing thereunder is permitted to be Incurred pursuant to those provisions.
 
Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness and the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this Section 4.10. The amount of any Indebtedness
 
outstanding as of any date shall be (i) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and (ii) the principal amount or the greater of the voluntary or involuntary liquidation preference and the maximum fixed repurchase price thereof, together with any interest thereon that is more than 30 days past due, in the case of any other Indebtedness.
 
In addition, the Company will not permit any of its Unrestricted Subsidiaries to Incur any Indebtedness or issue any shares of Disqualified Stock, other than Non-Recourse Debt. If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under this Section 4.10, the Company shall be in Default of this Section 4.10).
 
For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit Indebtedness; provided that if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-dominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-dominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 4.10, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur pursuant to this Section 4.10 shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.
 
 
The Company will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, Incur any Indebtedness that is or purports to be by its terms (or by the terms of any agreement governing such Indebtedness) senior in right of payment to the Notes or the Note Guarantee of such Subsidiary Guarantor with respect to the Notes and subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Company or of such Subsidiary Guarantor, as the case may be.
 
For purposes of the foregoing, no Indebtedness will be deemed to be subordinated or junior in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or secured by a junior priority lien or by virtue of the fact that the holders of such Indebtedness have entered into intercreditor agreements or similar arrangements giving one or more of such holders priority over the other holders in the collateral held by them.
 
 
The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to:
 
(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution (whether made in cash, securities or other property) on or in respect of its Capital Stock (including any payment in connection with any merger or consolidation involving the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) except:
 
 
 
(2) purchase, redeem, retire or otherwise acquire for value any Capital Stock of the Company or any direct or indirect parent of the Company held by Persons other than the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than in exchange for Capital Stock of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock));
 
(3) purchase, repurchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value, prior to scheduled maturity, scheduled repayment or scheduled sinking fund payment, any Subordinated Obligations or Guarantor Subordinated Obligations (other than (x) such Subordinated Obligations or Guarantor Subordinated Obligations purchased in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in each case due within one year of the date of purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement and (y) such Subordinated Obligations or Guarantor Subordinated Obligations held by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary); or
 
(4) make any Restricted Investment in any Person
 
(any such dividend, distribution, purchase, redemption, repurchase, defeasance, other acquisition, retirement or Restricted Investment referred to in clauses (1) through (4) shall be referred to herein as a ""), if at the time the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary makes such Restricted Payment:
Restricted Payment
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
which amount in each case under this clause (iv) was included in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments; , that no amount will be included under clause (iv)(A) of this paragraph to the extent it is already included in Consolidated Net Income.
provided,
however
 
The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:
 
(1) the payment of any dividend within 60 days after the date of declaration of such dividend if the dividend would have been permitted on the date of declaration;
 
(2) if no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the acquisition, retirement, defeasance or purchase of any shares of Capital Stock of the Company either (i) solely in exchange for shares of Capital Stock of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock) or (ii) through the application of the net proceeds of a substantially concurrent sale for cash (other than to a Subsidiary of the Company) of shares of Capital Stock of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock) ( that such net proceeds shall not be applied toward the Restricted Payments Basket);
provided
 
(3) if no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the acquisition, making of any principal payment, redemption, defeasance or other retirement of any Subordinated Obligations either (i) solely in exchange for shares of Capital Stock of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock), (ii) through the application of net proceeds of a substantially concurrent sale for cash (other than to a Subsidiary of the Company) of (a) shares of Capital Stock of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock) ( that such net proceeds shall not be applied toward the Restricted Payments Basket) or (b) Refinancing Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred pursuant to Section 4.10, (iii) upon a Change of Control or in connection with an Asset Disposition to the extent required by the agreement governing such Subordinated Obligations but only if the Company shall have complied with Sections 4.09 and 4.15, as applicable, and purchased all Notes validly tendered pursuant to the relevant offer prior to redeeming such Subordinated Obligations or (iv) to the extent such Subordinated Obligations constitutes
provided
 
Acquired Indebtedness not Incurred in connection with or in anticipation or contemplation of the underlying acquisition or merger;
 
(4) so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, repurchases by the Company of Common Stock of the Company from officers, directors and employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their authorized representatives upon the death, disability or termination of employment of such employees or termination of their seat on the board of the Company, in an aggregate amount not to exceed $10.0 million in any calendar year;
 
(5) repurchases of Capital Stock deemed to occur upon exercise of stock options, warrants or other convertible securities if such Capital Stock represents a portion of the exercise price thereof;
 
(6) so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, payments to holders of the Company's Capital Stock in lieu of issuance of fractional shares of its Capital Stock or to dissenting shareholders if required by applicable law;
 
(7) the distribution of Capital Stock of an Unrestricted Subsidiary of the Company to holders of Capital Stock of the Company; and
 
(8) additional Restricted Payments not to exceed $150.0 million in the aggregate since the Issue Date.
 
The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the Fair Market Value on the date of such Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. If the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary makes a Restricted Payment which, at the time of the making of such Restricted Payment, would in the good faith determination of the Company be permitted under the provisions of this Indenture, such Restricted Payment shall be deemed to have been made in compliance with this Indenture notwithstanding any subsequent adjustments or restatements made in good faith to the Company's financial statements.
 
 
The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) of any nature whatsoever against any assets or property of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (including Capital Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries), whether owned on the date of this Indenture or acquired after that date, which Lien secures Indebtedness or trade payables, unless contemporaneously therewith:
 
(1) in the case of any Lien securing an obligation that ranks pari passu with the Notes or a Note Guarantee, effective provision is made to secure the Notes or such
 
Note Guarantee, as the case may be, at least equally and ratably with or prior to such obligation with a Lien on the same collateral; and
 
(2) in the case of any Lien securing an obligation that is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or a Note Guarantee, effective provision is made to secure the Notes or such Note Guarantee, as the case may be, with a Lien on the same collateral that is prior to the Lien securing such subordinated obligation;
 
in each case, for so long as such obligation is secured by such Lien.
 
 
The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:
 
(1) pay dividends or make any other distributions on its Capital Stock or pay any Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (it being understood that the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on Common Stock shall not be deemed a restriction on the ability to make distributions on Capital Stock);
 
(2) make any loans or advances to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (it being understood that the subordination of loans or advances made to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed a restriction on the ability to make loans or advances); or
 
(3) transfer any of its property or assets to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (it being understood that such transfers shall not include any type of transfer described in clause (1) or (2) above).
 
The preceding provisions will not prohibit:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset Disposition unless:
 
(1) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (both cash and non-cash) equal to not less than the Fair Market Value (such
 
Fair Market Value to be determined on the date of contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition) of the shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition;
 
(2) at least 75% of the consideration from such Asset Disposition received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents or Replacement Assets. For purposes of this clause (2), each of the following shall be deemed to be cash:
 
 
 
(3) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition:
 
 
 
 
 
, , that pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with clause (a) or clause (b) above, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness or otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by this Indenture;
provided
however
 
, that clauses (1) and (2) above shall not apply with respect to any Permitted Divestiture.
provided,
further
 
On the 396th day after an Asset Disposition (or such earlier date, if any, as the Board of Directors of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary determines that the Net Available Cash will not be applied in accordance with clause (3)(a) of the first paragraph of this Section 4.15), if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds not used to purchase Senior Notes and Senior Pari Passu Notes pursuant to a Senior Asset Disposition Offer (such balance, "") exceeds $35.0 million, the Company will be required to make an offer ("") to all Holders of Notes and, to the extent required by the terms of other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness, to all holders of other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness outstanding with similar provisions requiring the Company to make an offer to purchase such Senior Subordinated Indebtedness with the proceeds from any Asset Disposition ("") to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Notes to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and Pari Passu Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth herein or the agreements governing the Pari Passu Notes, as applicable, in each case in integral multiples of $1,000. To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Pari Passu Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Company may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to other covenants contained in this Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes surrendered by Holders thereof and other Pari Passu Notes surrendered by holders or lenders of such Pari Passu Notes, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Trustee shall select the Notes and Pari Passu Notes to be purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and Pari Passu Notes. Upon completion of such Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

Each Asset Disposition Offer will remain open for a period of 20 Business Days following its commencement, except to the extent that a longer period is required by applicable law (the "").

Upon the commencement of an Asset Disposition Offer, the Company shall send, by first class mail, a notice to the Trustee and to each Holder at its registered address. The notice shall contain all instructions and materials necessary to enable such Holder to tender Notes pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer. Any Asset Disposition Offer shall be made to all Holders. The notice, which shall govern the terms of the Asset Disposition Offer, shall state:
 
(1) that the Asset Disposition Offer is being made pursuant to this Section 4.15;
 
(2) the Asset Disposition Offer Amount and the Asset Disposition Purchase Date;
 
(3) that any Notes not tendered or accepted for payment shall continue to accrete or accrue interest;
 
(4) that, unless the Company defaults in making such payment, any Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer shall cease to accrete or accrue interest after the Asset Disposition Purchase Date;
 
(5) that Holders electing to have a Note purchased pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer may only elect to have all of such Note purchased and may not elect to have only a portion of such Note purchased;
 
(6) that Holders electing to have a Note purchased pursuant to any Asset Disposition Offer shall be required to surrender the Note, with the form entitled "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" on the reverse of the Notes completed, or transfer by book-entry transfer, to the Company, a depository, if appointed by the Company, or the Paying Agent at the address specified in the notice at least three days before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date;
 
(7) that Holders shall be entitled to withdraw their election if the Company, the Depository or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, receives, not later than the second business day prior to the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, a notice setting forth the name of the Holder, the principal amount of the Note the Holder delivered for purchase and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing his election to have such Note purchased;
 
(8) that, if the aggregate principal amount of Notes surrendered by Holders exceeds the Asset Disposition Offer Amount, the Company shall select the Notes to be purchased on a basis (with such adjustments as may be deemed appropriate by the Company so that only Notes in denominations of $1,000, or integral multiples thereof, shall be purchased);
pro rata
 
(9) that Holders whose Notes were purchased only in part shall be issued new Notes equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered (or transferred by book-entry transfer); and
 
(10) all other procedures, if any, determined by the Company, consistent with this Indenture, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Notes purchased in the Asset Disposition Offer.
 
If the Asset Disposition Purchase Date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related Interest Payment Date, any accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name a Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders who tender Notes pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer.
 
On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Company will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment, on a basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Notes and Pari Passu Notes or portions of such Notes and Pari Passu Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Notes and Pari Passu Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, in each case in integral multiples of $1,000. The Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that such Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Company in accordance with the terms of this Section 4.15 and, in addition, the Company will deliver all certificates and notes required, if any, by the agreements governing the Pari Passu Notes. The Company or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than five Business Days after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder of Notes or holder or lender of Pari Passu Notes, as the case may be, an amount equal to the purchase price of the Notes or Pari Passu Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such holder or lender, as the case may be, and accepted by the Company for purchase, and the Company will promptly issue a new Note, and the Trustee, upon delivery of an Officers' Certificate from the Company, will authenticate and mail or deliver such new Note to such Holder, in a principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Note surrendered; that each such new Note will be in a principal amount of $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000. In addition, the Company will take any and all other actions required by the agreements governing the Pari Passu Notes. Any Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered by the Company to the Holder thereof. The Company will publicly announce the results of the Asset Disposition Offer on or promptly following the Asset Disposition Purchase Date.

In the event of the transfer of substantially all (but not all) of the property and assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries as an entirety to a Person in a transaction permitted under Article 5, which transaction does not constitute a Change of Control, the successor company shall be deemed to have sold the properties and assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries not so transferred for purposes of this Section 4.15, and shall comply with the provisions of this Section 4.15 with respect to such deemed sale as if it were an Asset Disposition. In addition, the Fair Market Value of such properties and assets of the Company or its
 
Restricted Subsidiaries deemed to be sold shall be deemed to be Net Available Cash for purposes of this Section 4.15.
 
The Company will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Rule 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this Section 4.15. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this Section 4.15, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this Indenture by virtue of any conflict.
 
 
The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter into or conduct any transaction (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Company (an "") unless:
Affiliate Transaction
 
(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction are no less favorable, taken as a whole, to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable transaction at the time of such transaction in arm's-length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and
 
(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate consideration in excess of $15.0 million, the terms of such transaction have been approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company and by a majority of the members of such Board of Directors having no personal stake in such transaction, if any (and such majority or majorities, as the case may be, determines that such Affiliate Transaction satisfies the criteria in clause (1) above).
 
The preceding paragraph will not apply to:
 
(1) any Restricted Payment (other than a Restricted Investment) permitted to be made pursuant to Section 4.12;
 
(2) any issuance of securities, or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, employment agreements and other compensation arrangements, options to purchase Capital Stock of the Company, stock purchase, ownership or option plans, long-term incentive plans, stock appreciation rights plans, participation plans or similar employee benefits plans provided on behalf of directors, officers, consultants and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, in each case, as approved by the Board of Directors of the Company;

(5) the payment of reasonable and customary fees to directors, and indemnity provided on behalf of, directors, officers, employees or consultants, of the Company or any of its subsidiaries; and
 
(6) the performance of obligations of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries under the terms of any agreement to which the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is a party as of or on the Issue Date, as these agreements may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended or renewed from time to time; , that any future amendment, modification, supplement, extension or renewal entered into after the Issue Date will be permitted to the extent that its terms are not more materially disadvantageous, taken as a whole, to the Holders of the Notes than the terms of the agreements in effect on the Issue Date.
provided,
however
 
 
The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, engage in any other business that is not a Permitted Business.
 
 
Notwithstanding that the Company may not be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, to the extent permitted by the Exchange Act, the Company will file with the SEC, and make available to the Trustee and the registered Holders of the Notes, the annual reports and the information, documents and other reports (or copies of such portions of any of the foregoing as the SEC may by rules and regulations prescribe) that are specified in Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act within the time periods specified therein or in the relevant forms. In the event that the Company is not permitted to file such reports, documents and information with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act, the Company will nevertheless make available such Exchange Act information to the Trustee and Holders of Notes as if the Company were subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act within the time periods specified therein.
 
If the Company has designated any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the preceding paragraph shall include a reasonably detailed presentation, (a) in the footnotes to the financial statements and (b) in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries.
 
In addition, the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors will make available to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of such Holders, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act so long as the Notes are not freely transferable under the Securities Act. For purposes of this Section 4.18, the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors will be deemed to have furnished the reports to the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes as required by this Section 4.18 if they have filed such reports with the SEC via the EDGAR filing system and such reports are publicly available.
 
Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee's receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Company's compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officers' Certificates).
 
 
The Company will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to Guarantee the payment of any Indebtedness of the Company or any Indebtedness of any other Restricted Subsidiary (other than a Guarantee by a Foreign Subsidiary of Indebtedness of a Foreign Subsidiary), unless such Restricted Subsidiary simultaneously executes and delivers a supplemental indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will unconditionally Guarantee, on a joint and several basis, the full and prompt payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes and all other obligations under this Indenture on a senior subordinated basis; that, (A) if the Notes or, if the issuer of the Indebtedness being Guaranteed is a Subsidiary Guarantor, its Note Guarantee is subordinated in right of payment to such Indebtedness, the Note Guarantee to be issued shall be subordinated to such Restricted Subsidiary's Guarantee with respect to such Indebtedness substantially to the same extent as the Notes or the Note Guarantees, as the case may be, is subordinated to such Indebtedness under this Indenture and (B) if such Indebtedness is by its express terms subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or a Note Guarantee, any Guarantee of such Restricted Subsidiary with respect to such Indebtedness shall be subordinated in right of payment to such Restricted Subsidiary's Note Guarantee substantially to the same extent as such Indebtedness is subordinated to the Notes or the Note Guarantees, as the case may be.
provided
 
The obligations of a Subsidiary Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent its Note Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under applicable law.
 
Thereafter, such Restricted Subsidiary shall be a Guarantor for all purposes of this Indenture.
 
Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, any Note Guarantee of a Subsidiary Guarantor will provide by its terms that it will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged under the circumstances set forth in Section 11.05. The form of the Note Guarantee is attached hereto as .

Successor Company
 
(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor Company as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;
 
(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction and any related financing, the Successor Company would be able to Incur at least an additional $1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the Coverage Ratio Exception;

(5) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indentures (if any) comply with this Indenture.
 
For purposes of this Section 5.01, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Company, which properties and assets, if held by the Company instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company.
 
The predecessor Company will be released from its obligations under this Indenture and the Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every
 
right and power of, the Company under this Indenture, but, in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the predecessor Company will not be released from the obligation to pay the principal of and interest on the Notes.

unless
 
(1) (a) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person will be a corporation, partnership, trust or limited liability company organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any State of the United States or the District of Columbia and such Person (if not such Subsidiary Guarantor) will expressly assume, by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, all the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under its Note Guarantee; (b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the resulting, surviving or transferee Person or any Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by such Person or such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default of Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; and (c) the Company will have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indentures comply with this Indenture; or

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at final maturity of such Indebtedness prior to the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (""); or
payment default
 
(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the "");
cross-acceleration provision

However, a default under clauses (4) and (5) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Company of the default and the Company does not cure such default within the time specified in clauses (4) and (5) of this paragraph after receipt of such notice.
 
The foregoing shall constitute Events of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of Default and whether it is voluntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body.
 
 
If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default with respect to the Company of the type described in clause (7) of Section 6.01) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Company, or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes by notice to the Company and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable immediately.
 
In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (6) of Section 6.01 has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (6) of Section 6.01 shall be remedied or cured by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary or waived by the holders of the relevant Indebtedness within 60 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest on the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived.
 
If an Event of Default with respect to the Company described in clause (7) of Section 6.01 occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.
 
 
If a Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy by proceeding at law or in equity to collect the payment of principal of or interest on the Notes or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Notes or this Indenture.
 
The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Notes or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Noteholder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon a Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Default. No remedy is exclusive of any other remedy. All available remedies are cumulative to the extent permitted by law.
 
 
The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes by notice to the Trustee may (a) waive, by their consent (including, without limitation, consents obtained
 
in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes), an existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences, except a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on a Note, and (b) rescind any such acceleration with respect to the Notes and its consequences if (1) rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, other than the nonpayment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes that have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived. When a Default or Event of Default is waived, it is deemed cured, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default or impair any consequent right.
 
 
The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on it. Subject to Section 7.01, however, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with any law or this Indenture, that the Trustee determines may be unduly prejudicial to the rights of another Noteholder, or that may involve the Trustee in personal liability; that the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction.
provided
 
In the event the Trustee takes any action or follows any direction pursuant to this Indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled to indemnification against any loss or expense caused by taking such action or following such direction.
 
 
Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to this Indenture or the Notes :
unless
 
(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;
 
(2) Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy;
 
(3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense;
 
(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity; and
 
(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.
 
A Noteholder may not use this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of another Noteholder or to obtain a preference or priority over such other Noteholder (it being understood that the Trustee does not have an affirmative duty to ascertain whether or not such actions or forbearances are unduly prejudicial to such Noteholders).
 
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest on a Note, on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Note, or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of the Holder.
 
 
If a Default in payment of principal or interest specified in Section 6.01(1) or (2) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Company or any other obligor on the Notes for the whole amount of principal and accrued interest and fees remaining unpaid, together with interest on overdue principal and, to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest on overdue installments of interest, in each case at the rate borne by the Notes and such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.
per annum
 
 
The Trustee may file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and the Noteholders allowed in any judicial proceedings relating to the Company, its creditors or its property and shall be entitled and empowered to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same, and any Custodian in any such judicial proceedings is hereby authorized by each Noteholder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Noteholders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agent and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Noteholder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Notes or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Noteholder in any such proceeding. The Trustee shall be entitled to participate as a member of any official committee of creditors in the matters as it deems necessary or advisable.
 
 
If the Trustee collects any money or property pursuant to this Article Six, it shall pay out the money or property in the following order:
 
First: to the Trustee for amounts due under Section 7.07;
 
Second: to Holders for interest accrued on the Notes, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on the Notes for interest;
 
Third: to Holders for principal amounts due and unpaid on the Notes, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on the Notes for principal; and
 
Fourth: to the Company or, if applicable, the Guarantors, as their respective interests may appear.
 
The Trustee, upon prior notice to the Company, may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to Noteholders pursuant to this Section 6.10.
 
 
In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant. This Section 6.11 does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder pursuant to Section 6.07, or a suit by a Holder or Holders of more than 10% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes.
 
 
 
 
(a) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs.

upon certificates (including Officers' Certificates) or opinions (including Opinions of Counsel) furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture. However, in the case of any such certificates or opinions which by any provision hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall examine the certificates and opinions to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture (but need not confirm or investigate the accuracy of mathematical calculations or other facts stated therein).
 
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Trustee may not be relieved from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that:
 
(1) This paragraph does not limit the effect of paragraph (b) of this Section 7.01.
 
(2) The Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer, unless it is proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts.
 
(3) The Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in accordance with a direction received by it pursuant to Section 6.05.

(e) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture that in any way relates to the Trustee is subject to this Section 7.01.
 
(f) The Trustee shall not be liable for interest on any money received by it except as the Trustee may agree in writing with the Company. Money held in trust by the Trustee need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
 
(g) In the absence of bad faith, negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Trustee, the Trustee shall not be responsible for the application of any money by any Paying Agent other than the Trustee.
 
 
Subject to Section 7.01:
 
(a) The Trustee may rely conclusively on any document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper Person. The Trustee need not investigate any fact or matter stated in the document.
 
(b) Before the Trustee acts or refrains from acting, it may require an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, which shall conform to the provisions of Section 12.05. The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in reliance on such certificate or opinion.

The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Notes and may otherwise deal with the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. Any Agent may do the same with like rights. However, the Trustee must comply with Sections 7.10 and 7.11.
 
 
The Trustee shall not be responsible for and makes no representation as to the validity or adequacy of this Indenture or the Notes, it shall not be accountable for the Company's use of the proceeds from the Notes, and it shall not be responsible for any statement of the Company in this Indenture or any document issued in connection with the sale of Notes or any statement in the Notes other than the Trustee's certificate of authentication.

Such Opinion of Counsel shall also state that such satisfaction and discharge does not result in a default under the Senior Credit Agreement or any other material instrument then known to such counsel that binds the Company or any Significant Subsidiary.
 
Subject to the next sentence and notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph, the Company's obligations in Sections 2.05, 2.06, 2.07, 2.08, 4.01, 4.02, 4.03 (with respect to the Company only), 7.07, 8.05 and 8.06 shall survive until the Notes are no longer outstanding pursuant to the last paragraph of Section 2.08. After the Notes are no longer outstanding, the Company's obligations in Sections 7.07, 8.05 and 8.06 shall survive.
 
After such delivery or irrevocable deposit, the Trustee upon request shall acknowledge in writing the discharge of the Company's obligations under the Notes and this Indenture except for those surviving obligations specified above.
 
 
(a) The Company may, at its option by Board Resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company, at any time, elect to have either the Legal Defeasance option or the Covenant Defeasance option in paragraph (b) below be applied to all outstanding Notes upon compliance with the conditions set forth in Section 8.03.
 
(b) Subject to Sections 8.02(c) and 8.03, the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors at any time may terminate (i) all their obligations under the Notes and this Indenture (""), and after giving effect to such Legal Defeasance, any omission to comply with such obligations shall no longer constitute a Default or Event of Default or (ii) their obligations under Sections 4.09 through 4.19 and clause (3) of the first paragraph of Section 5.01, and the Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by reason of any reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply with such covenants shall no longer constitute a Default or an Event of Default under Sections 6.01 (6), (7) (with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries), (8) and (9) and the limitations contained in clause (3) of the first paragraph of Section 5.01 and the events specified in such Sections shall no longer constitute an Event of Default (clause (ii) being referred to as ""), but except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and the Notes shall be unaffected thereby. The Company may exercise its Legal Defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its Covenant Defeasance option.
Legal Defeasance
Covenant Defeasance
 
If the Company exercises its Legal Defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default and the Note Guarantees in effect at such time shall terminate. If the Company exercises its Covenant Defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified under Sections 6.01(4), (5), (6), (7) (with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries), (8) or (9) or because of failure to comply with clause (3) of the first paragraph of Section 5.01.
 
Upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein and upon request of the Company, the Trustee shall acknowledge in writing the discharge of those obligations that the Company terminates.
 
(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 8.01(a) and (b), the Company's obligations under Sections 2.02 through 2.11, 4.01 through 4.04, 4.06, 4.08, 6.07, 7.07 and 7.08 and in this Article Eight shall survive until the Notes have been paid in full. After the Notes have been paid in full, the Company's obligations under Sections 7.07, 8.04 and 8.05 shall survive.
 
 
The following shall be the conditions to the application of either the Legal Defeasance option as the Covenant Defeasance option hereof to the outstanding Notes:
 
In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:
 
(1) the Company must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, cash in U.S. Legal Tender, U.S. Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the outstanding Notes on the Stated Maturity or on the
 
applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and the Company must specify whether the Notes are being defeased to maturity or to a particular redemption date;
 
(2) in the case of an election of Legal Defeasance, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that (a) the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling or (b) since the date of this Indenture, there has been a change in the applicable federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, the Holders of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;
 
(3) in the case of an election of Covenant Defeasance, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that the Holders of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;
 
(4) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing either: (a) on the date of such deposit (other than a Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to such deposit), or (b) insofar as Events of Default from bankruptcy or insolvency events are concerned, at any time in the period ending on the 91st day after the date of deposit; that such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, shall be deemed to have occurred on the date of such deposit, subject to an Event of Default from bankruptcy or insolvency within such 91-day period;
provided
 
(5) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any material agreement or instrument (other than this Indenture) to which the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is bound;
 
(6) the Company must deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Company with the intent of preferring the Holders of Notes over the other creditors of the Company with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors of the Company or others; and
 
(7) the Company must deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that all conditions precedent relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance have been complied with.
 
 
The Trustee or Paying Agent shall hold in trust U.S. Legal Tender and U.S. Government Obligations deposited with it pursuant to this Article Eight, and shall apply the deposited
 
U.S. Legal Tender and the money from U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with this Indenture to the payment of principal of and interest on the Notes. The Trustee shall be under no obligation to invest said U.S. Legal Tender and U.S. Government Obligations except as it may agree with the Company.
 
The Company shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the U.S. Legal Tender and U.S. Government Obligations deposited pursuant to Section 8.03 or the principal and interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of the outstanding Notes.
 
Anything in this Article Eight to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon the Company's request any U.S. Legal Tender and U.S. Government Obligations held by it as provided in Section 8.03 which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, are in excess of the amount thereof that would then be required to be deposited to effect an equivalent Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.
 
 
Subject to this Article Eight, the Trustee and the Paying Agent shall promptly pay to the Company upon request any excess U.S. Legal Tender and U.S. Government Obligations held by them at any time and thereupon shall be relieved from all liability with respect to such money. The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall pay to the Company upon request any money held by them for the payment of principal or interest that remains unclaimed for two years; that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any payment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once in a newspaper of general circulation in the City of New York or mail to each Holder entitled to such money notice that such money remains unclaimed and that after a date specified therein which shall be at least 30 days from the date of such publication or mailing any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company. After payment to the Company, Holders entitled to such money must look to the Company for payment as general creditors unless an applicable law designates another Person.
provided
 
 
If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any U.S. Legal Tender and U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with this Article Eight by reason of any legal proceeding or by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, the Company's obligations under this Indenture and the Notes shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to this Article Eight until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such U.S. Legal Tender and U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with this Article Eight; that if the Company has made any payment of interest on or principal of any Notes because of the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Notes to receive such payment from the U.S. Legal Tender and U.S. Government Obligations held by the Trustee or Paying Agent.
provided
 
 
 
 
 
Subject to Section 9.03, the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee, together, may amend or supplement this Indenture, the Notes or the Note Guarantees without notice to or consent of any Noteholder:
 
(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency;
 
(2) provide for the assumption by a successor corporation of the obligations of the Company under this Indenture or the assumption by a corporation, partnership, trust or limited liability company of the obligations of a Subsidiary Guarantor under this Indenture;
 
(3) provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes ( that the uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code, or in a manner such that the uncertificated Notes are described in Section 163(f) (2) (B) of the Code);
provided
 
(4) add Guarantees with respect to the Notes or release a Subsidiary Guarantor in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Indenture;
 
(5) secure the Notes;
 
(6) add to the covenants of the Company for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any right or power conferred upon the Company;
 
(7) make any change that does not materially adversely affect the rights of any Holder;
 
(8) comply with any requirement of the SEC in connection with the qualification of this Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act;
 
(9) provide for the issuance of exchange securities which shall have terms substantially identical in all respects to the Notes (except that the transfer restrictions contained in the Notes shall be modified or eliminated as appropriate) and which shall be treated, together with any outstanding Notes, as a single class of securities;
 
(10) release a Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under its Note Guarantee or this Indenture in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Indenture;
 
(11) make any change in the subordination provision of this Indenture or the Notes that would limit or terminate the benefits available to any holder of Senior Indebtedness
 
of the Company or a holder of Guarantor Senior Indebtedness (or any Representative thereof) under such subordination provisions; or
 
(12) provide for the appointment of a successor trustee; provided that such successor trustee is otherwise qualified and eligible to act as such under the terms of this Indenture;
 
that the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel and an Officers' Certificate, each stating that such amendment or supplement complies with the provisions of this Section 9.01.
provided
 
 
(a) Subject to Sections 6.07 and 9.03, the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee, together, with the written consent of the Holder or Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes, may amend or supplement this Indenture, the Notes or the Note Guarantees, without notice to any other Noteholders. Subject to Sections 6.07 and 9.03, the Holder or Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes may waive compliance with any provision of this Indenture, the Notes or the Note Guarantees without notice to any other Noteholders.
 
(b) Notwithstanding Section 9.02(a), without the consent of each Holder of an outstanding Note affected, no amendment, supplement or waiver may, among other things:
 
(1) reduce the amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment;
 
(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any Note;
 
(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Note;
 
(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Note or change the time at which any Note may be redeemed as described in Section 5 or Section 6 of the Notes, whether through an amendment or waiver of provisions in the covenants, definitions or otherwise;
 
(5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Note;
 
(6) impair the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on such Holder's Notes on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such Holder's Notes;
 
(7) make any change in the amendment provisions which require each Holder's consent or in the waiver provisions;
 
(8) make any change to Article Ten or Section 11.02 or the ranking of Notes or the Note Guarantees that adversely affects the rights of any Holder of Notes;
 
(9) release any Subsidiary Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Note Guarantee, except as permitted by this Indenture; or
 
(10) make any change in the preceding amendment and waiver provisions.
 
(c) It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, supplement or waiver but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.
 
(d) After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 9.02 becomes effective, the Company shall mail to the Holders affected thereby a notice briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any failure of the Company to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such amendment, supplement or waiver.
 
 
No amendment may be made to the subordination provisions of this Indenture or the Notes that adversely affects the rights of any holder of Senior Indebtedness or Guarantor Senior Indebtedness then outstanding unless the holders of such Senior Indebtedness or Guarantor Senior Indebtedness (or any group or representative thereof authorized to give a consent) consent to such change.
 
 
From the date on which this Indenture is qualified under the TIA, every amendment, waiver or supplement of this Indenture, the Notes or the Note Guarantees shall comply with the TIA as then in effect.
 
 
Until an amendment, waiver or supplement becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder is a continuing consent by the Holder and every subsequent Holder of a Note or portion of a Note that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Note, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Note. However, any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent as to his Note or portion of his Note by notice to the Trustee or the Company received before the date on which such amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective. An amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective in accordance with the terms thereof (or if silent as to effectiveness, on the date on which the Trustee receives an Officers' Certificate certifying that the Holders of the requisite principal amount of Notes have consented (and not theretofore revoked such consent) to such amendment, supplement or waiver ) and thereafter binds every Holder.
 
The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to consent to any amendment, supplement or waiver which record date shall be at least 30 days prior to the first solicitation of such consent. If a record date is fixed, then notwithstanding the last sentence of the immediately preceding paragraph, those
 
Persons who were Holders at such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only those Persons, shall be entitled to revoke any consent previously given, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date. No such consent shall be valid or effective for more than 90 days after such record date. The Company shall inform the Trustee in writing of the fixed record date if applicable.
 
After an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, it shall bind every Noteholder, unless it makes a change described in any of clauses (1) through (11) of Section 9.02(b), in which case, the amendment, supplement or waiver shall bind only each Holder of a Note who has consented to it and every subsequent Holder of a Note or portion of a Note that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Note; that any such waiver shall not impair or affect the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest on a Note, on or after the respective due dates therefor, or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates without the consent of such Holder.
provided
 
 
If an amendment, supplement or waiver changes the terms of a Note, the Company may require the Holder of the Note to deliver it to the Trustee. The Company shall provide the Trustee with an appropriate notation on the Note about the changed terms and cause the Trustee to return it to the Holder at the Company's expense. Alternatively, if the Company or the Trustee so determines, the Company in exchange for the Note shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a new Note that reflects the changed terms. Failure to make the appropriate notation or issue a new Note shall not affect the validity and effect of such amendment, supplement or waiver.
 
 
The Trustee shall execute any amendment, supplement or waiver authorized pursuant to this Article Nine; that the Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, execute any such amendment, supplement or waiver which affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture. The Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and shall be fully protected in conclusively relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel and an Officers' Certificate each stating that the execution of any amendment, supplement or waiver authorized pursuant to this Article Nine is authorized or permitted by this Indenture and constituted the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with its terms. Such Opinion of Counsel shall be at the expense of the Company.
provided
 
 
 
 
 
Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company, for itself and its successors, and each Holder, by his or her acceptance of Notes, agrees that the payment of all Obligations owing to the Holders in respect of the Notes is subordinated, to the extent and in the manner provided in this Article Ten, to the prior payment in full in cash or Cash Equivalents, or such payment duly provided for to the satisfaction of the holders of Senior Indebtedness, of all Obligations due in respect of Senior Indebtedness (including the Obligations with respect to the Senior Credit Facilities and the Senior Notes, whether outstanding on the Issue Date or thereafter Incurred). Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article Ten to the contrary, payments and distributions (A) of Permitted Junior Securities and (B) made relating to the Notes from the trust established pursuant to Article Eight shall not be so subordinated in right of payment, so long as, with respect to (B), (i) the conditions specified in Article Eight (without any waiver or modification of the requirement that the deposits pursuant thereto do not conflict with the terms of the Senior Credit Facilities and the Senior Notes or any other Senior Indebtedness) are satisfied on the date of any deposit pursuant to said trust and (ii) such payments and distributions did not violate the provisions of this Article Ten or Section 11.02 of this Indenture when made.
 
This Article Ten shall constitute a continuing offer to all Persons who become holders of, or continue to hold, Senior Indebtedness, and such provisions are made for the benefit of the holders of Senior Indebtedness and such holders are made obligees hereunder and any one or more of them may enforce such provisions.
 
 
(a) If any default occurs and is continuing in the payment when due, whether at maturity, upon any redemption, by declaration or otherwise, of any principal of, interest on, unpaid drawings for letters of credit issued in respect of, or fees with respect to, any Senior Indebtedness (a ""), then no payment or distribution of any kind or character shall be made by or on behalf of the Company or any other Person on its or their behalf with respect to any Obligations on or relating to the Notes or to acquire any of the Notes for cash or assets or otherwise.
Payment Default
 
(b) If any other event of default (other than a Payment Default) occurs and is continuing with respect to any Designated Senior Indebtedness (as such event of default is defined in the instrument creating or evidencing such Designated Senior Indebtedness) permitting the holders of such Designated Senior Indebtedness then outstanding to accelerate the maturity thereof (a "") and if the Representative for the respective issue of Designated Senior Indebtedness gives notice of the Non-Payment Default to the Trustee stating that such notice is a payment blockage notice (a ""), then during the period (the "") beginning upon the delivery of such Payment Blockage Notice and ending on the earlier of (1) 179 days after the date on which the applicable Payment
Non-payment Default
Payment Blockage Notice
Payment Blockage Period
 
Blockage Notice is received, (2) the date on which all such Non-Payment Defaults have been cured or waived or cease to exist and (3) the date on which the Trustee receives notice thereof from the Representative for the respective issue of Designated Senior Indebtedness terminating the Payment Blockage Period, neither the Company nor any other Person on its behalf shall (x) make any payment of any kind or character with respect to any Obligations on or with respect to the Notes or (y) acquire any of the Notes for cash or assets or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, there shall be a period of at least 181 consecutive days in each 360-day period when no Payment Blockage Notice is in effect. For all purposes of this Section 10.02(b), no Non-Payment Default which existed or was continuing on the date of the commencement of any Payment Blockage Period with respect to the Designated Senior Indebtedness shall be, or be made, the basis for the commencement of a second Payment Blockage Period by the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness whether or not within a period of 360 consecutive days, unless such Non-Payment Default shall have been cured or waived for a period of not less than 90 consecutive days. Any subsequent action, or any breach of any financial covenants for a period ending after the date of delivery of such Payment Blockage Notice that, in either case, would give rise to a Non-Payment Default pursuant to any provisions under which a Non-Payment Default previously existed or was continuing shall constitute a new Non-Payment Default for this purpose.
 
(c) The foregoing Sections 10.02(a) and (b) shall not apply to payments and distributions (A) of Permitted Junior Securities and (B) made relating to the Notes from the trust established pursuant to Article Eight, so long as, with respect to (B), (i) the conditions specified in Article Eight (without any waiver or modification of the requirement that the deposits pursuant thereto do not conflict with the terms of the Senior Credit Facilities, Senior Notes or any other Senior Indebtedness) are satisfied on the date of any deposit pursuant to said trust and (ii) such payments and distributions did not violate the provisions of this Article Ten when made.
 
(d) In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment shall be received by the Trustee or any Holder when such payment is prohibited by the foregoing provisions of this Section 10.02, such payment shall be held in trust for the benefit of, and shall be paid over or delivered to, the holders of Senior Indebtedness ( to such holders on the basis of the respective amount of Senior Indebtedness held by such holders) or their respective Representatives, as their respective interests may appear. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely on information regarding amounts outstanding on the Senior Indebtedness, if any, received from the holders of the Senior Indebtedness (or their Representatives).
pro rata
 
Nothing contained in this Article Ten shall limit the right of the Trustee or the Holders of Notes to take any action to accelerate the maturity of the Notes pursuant to Section 6.02 or to pursue any rights or remedies hereunder; that all Senior Indebtedness thereafter due or declared to be due shall first be paid in full in cash or Cash Equivalents, or such payment duly provided for to the satisfaction of the holders of such Senior Indebtedness, before the Holders are entitled to receive any payment of any kind or character with respect to Obligations on the Notes.
provided
 
 
(a) Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, assets or securities, to creditors upon any total or partial liquidation, dissolution, winding-up, reorganization, assignment for the benefit of creditors or marshaling of assets and liabilities of the Company or in a bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, receivership or other similar proceeding relating to the Company or its assets, whether voluntary or involuntary, all Obligations due or to become due upon all Senior Indebtedness shall first be paid in full in cash or Cash Equivalents, or such payment duly provided for to the satisfaction of the holders of Senior Indebtedness, before any payment or distribution of any kind or character is made on account of any Obligations on or relating to the Notes, or for the acquisition of any of the Notes for cash or assets or otherwise. Upon any such dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganization, receivership or similar proceeding, any payment or distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, assets or securities, to which the Holders of the Notes or the Trustee under this Indenture would be entitled, except for the provisions hereof, shall be paid by the Company or by any receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other Person making such payment or distribution, or by the Holders or by the Trustee under this Indenture if received by them, directly to the holders of Senior Indebtedness ( to such holders on the basis of the respective amounts of Senior Indebtedness held by such holders) or their respective Representatives, or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any of such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued, as their respective interests may appear, for application to the payment of Senior Indebtedness remaining unpaid until all such Senior Indebtedness has been paid in full in cash or Cash Equivalents, or such payment duly provided for to the satisfaction of the holders of such Senior Indebtedness, after giving effect to any concurrent payment, distribution or provision therefor to or for the holders of Senior Indebtedness.
pro rata
 
(b) To the extent any payment of Senior Indebtedness (whether by or on behalf of the Company, as proceeds of security or enforcement of any right of setoff or otherwise) is declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be paid to any receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other similar Person under any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, fraudulent conveyance or similar law, then, if such payment is recovered by, or paid over to, such receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other similar Person, the Senior Indebtedness or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be deemed to be reinstated and outstanding as if such payment had not occurred.
 
It is further agreed that any diminution (whether pursuant to court decree or otherwise, including without limitation for any of the reasons described in the preceding sentence) of the Company's obligation to make any distribution or payment pursuant to any Senior Indebtedness, except to the extent such diminution occurs by reason of the repayment (which has not been disgorged or returned) of such Senior Indebtedness in cash or Cash Equivalents, or such payment duly provided for to the satisfaction of the holders of such Senior Indebtedness, shall have no force or effect for purposes of the subordination provisions contained in this Article Ten, with any turnover of payments as otherwise calculated pursuant to this Article Ten to be made as if no such diminution had occurred.
 
(c) In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment or distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, assets or securities, shall be received by any Holder when such payment or distribution is prohibited by this Section 10.03, such payment or distribution shall be held in trust for the benefit of, and shall be paid over or delivered to, the holders of Senior Indebtedness (to such holders on the basis of the respective amount of Senior Indebtedness held by such holders) or their respective Representatives, or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any of such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued, as their respective interests may appear, for application to the payment of Senior Indebtedness remaining unpaid until all such Senior Indebtedness has been paid in full in cash or Cash Equivalents, or such payment duly provided for to the satisfaction of the holders of such Senior Indebtedness, after giving effect to any concurrent payment, distribution or provision therefor to or for the holders of such Senior Indebtedness.
pro rata
 
(d) The consolidation of the Company with, or the merger of the Company with or into, another Person or the liquidation or dissolution of the Company following the conveyance or transfer of all or substantially all of its assets, to another Person upon the terms and conditions provided in Article Five hereof and as long as permitted under the terms of the Senior Indebtedness shall not be deemed a dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or reorganization for the purposes of this Section if such other Person shall, as a part of such consolidation, merger, conveyance or transfer, assume the Company's obligations hereunder in accordance with Article Five hereof.
 
 
Nothing contained in this Article Ten or elsewhere in this Indenture shall prevent (i) the Company, except under the conditions described in Sections 10.02 and 10.03, from making payments at any time for the purpose of making payments of principal of and interest on the Notes, or from depositing with the Trustee any moneys for such payments, or (ii) in the absence of actual knowledge by the Trustee that a given payment would be prohibited by Section 10.02 or 10.03, the application by the Trustee of any moneys deposited with it for the purpose of making such payments of principal of, and interest on, the Notes to the Holders entitled thereto unless at least two Business Days prior to the date upon which such payment would otherwise become due and payable a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have actually received the written notice provided for in the first sentence of Section 10.02(b) or in Section 10.07 ( that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Holders receiving any payments made in contravention of Section 10.02 and/or 10.03 (and the respective such payments) shall otherwise be subject to the provisions of Section 10.02 and Section 10.03). The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or reorganization of the Company, although any delay or failure to give any such notice shall have no effect on the subordination provisions contained herein.
provided
 
 
Subject to the payment in full in cash or Cash Equivalents, or such payment duly provided for to the satisfaction of holders of such Senior Indebtedness, of all Senior Indebtedness, the Holders of the Notes shall be subrogated to the rights of the holders of Senior Indebtedness
 
to receive payments or distributions of cash, assets or securities of the Company applicable to the Senior Indebtedness until the Notes shall be paid in full; and, for the purposes of such subrogation, no such payments or distributions to the holders of the Senior Indebtedness by or on behalf of the Company, or by or on behalf of the Holders by virtue of this Article Ten, which otherwise would have been made to the Holders shall, as between the Company and the Holders, be deemed to be a payment by the Company to or on account of the Senior Indebtedness, it being understood that the provisions of this Article Ten are and are intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Holders, on the one hand, and the holders of Senior Indebtedness, on the other hand.
 
 
Nothing contained in this Article Ten or elsewhere in this Indenture or in the Notes is intended to or shall impair, as among the Company, its creditors other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness, and the Holders, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay to the Holders the principal of and any interest on the Notes as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with their terms, or is intended to or shall affect the relative rights of the Holders and creditors of the Company other than the holders of the Senior Indebtedness, nor shall anything herein or therein prevent the Holder of any Note or the Trustee on its behalf from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under this Indenture, subject to the rights, if any, in respect of cash, assets or securities of the Company received upon the exercise of any such remedy.
 
 
The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any fact known to the Company which would prohibit the making of any payment to or by the Trustee in respect of the Notes pursuant to the provisions of this Article Ten, although any delay or failure to give any such notice shall have no effect on the subordination provisions contained herein. Regardless of anything to the contrary contained in this Article Ten or elsewhere in this Indenture, the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of any default or event of default with respect to any Senior Indebtedness or of any other facts which would prohibit the making of any payment to or by the Trustee unless and until the Trustee shall have received notice in writing from the Company, or from a holder of Senior Indebtedness or a Representative therefor and, prior to the receipt of any such written notice, the Trustee shall be entitled to assume (in the absence of actual knowledge to the contrary) that no such facts exist. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely on the delivery to it of any notice pursuant to this Section 10.07 to establish that such notice has been given by a holder of Senior Indebtedness (or a trustee thereof).
 
In the event that the Trustee determines in good faith that any evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior Indebtedness to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article Ten, the Trustee may request such Person to furnish evidence to the satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amounts of Senior Indebtedness held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and any other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Article Ten, and if such evidence is not furnished the Trustee may defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment.
 
 
Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Company referred to in this Article Ten, the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Article Seven hereof, and the Holders of the Notes shall be entitled to conclusively rely upon any order or decree made by any court of competent jurisdiction in which any insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganization or similar case or proceeding is pending, or upon a certificate of the receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, assignee for the benefit of creditors, agent or other person making such payment or distribution, delivered to the Trustee or the Holders of the Notes, for the purpose of ascertaining the persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the holders of the Senior Indebtedness and other Indebtedness of the Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article Ten.
 
 
The Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Article Ten with respect to any Senior Indebtedness which may at any time be held by it in its individual or any other capacity to the same extent as any other holder of Senior Indebtedness and nothing in this Indenture shall deprive the Trustee or any such agent of any of its rights as such holder.
 
With respect to the holders of Senior Indebtedness, the Trustee undertakes to perform or to observe only such of its covenants and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Article Ten, and no implied covenants or obligations with respect to the holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee. The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Indebtedness.
 
Whenever a distribution is to be made or a notice given to holders or owners of Senior Indebtedness, the distribution may be made and the notice may be given to their Representative, if any.
 
 
No right of any present or future holders of any Senior Indebtedness to enforce subordination as provided herein shall at any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of the Company or by any act or failure to act, in good faith, by any such holder, or by any noncompliance by the Company with the terms of this Indenture, regardless of any knowledge thereof which any such holder may have or otherwise be charged with.
 
Without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing paragraph, the holders of Senior Indebtedness may, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of or notice to the Trustee, without incurring responsibility to the Trustee or the Holders of the Notes and without impairing or releasing the subordination provided in this Article Ten or the obligations hereunder of the Holders of the Notes to the holders of the Senior Indebtedness, do any one or
 
more of the following: (i) change the manner, place or terms of payment or extend the time of payment of, or renew or alter, Senior Indebtedness, or otherwise amend or supplement in any manner Senior Indebtedness, or any instrument evidencing the same or any agreement under which Senior Indebtedness is outstanding; (ii) sell, exchange, release or otherwise deal with any property pledged, mortgaged or otherwise securing Senior Indebtedness; (iii) release any Person liable in any manner for the payment or collection of Senior Indebtedness; and (iv) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the Company and any other Person.
 
 
Each Holder of Notes by its acceptance of them authorizes and expressly directs the Trustee on its behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate, as between the holders of Senior Indebtedness and the Holders of Notes, the subordination provided in this Article Ten, and appoints the Trustee its attorney-in-fact for such purposes, including, in the event of any dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or reorganization of the Company (whether in bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, reorganization or similar proceedings or upon an assignment for the benefit of credits or otherwise) tending towards liquidation of the business and assets of the Company, the filing of a claim for the unpaid balance of its Notes and accrued interest in the form required in those proceedings.
 
If the Trustee does not file a proper claim or proof of debt in the form required in such proceeding prior to 30 days before the expiration of the time to file such claim or claims, then the holders of the Senior Indebtedness or their Representative are or is hereby authorized to have the right to file and are or is hereby authorized to file an appropriate claim for and on behalf of the Holders of said Notes. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee or the holders of Senior Indebtedness or their Representative to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Notes or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee or the holders of Senior Indebtedness or their Representative to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.
 
 
The failure to make a payment on account of principal of or interest on the Notes by reason of any provision of this Article Ten will not be construed as preventing the occurrence of an Event of Default.
 
 
Nothing in this Article Ten will apply to amounts due to the Trustee (other than payments of Obligations owing to Holders in respect of Notes) pursuant to other sections of this Indenture.
 
 
 
 
 
Subject to the provisions of this Article Eleven, each of the Guarantors hereby, jointly and severally, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, on a senior subordinated basis to each Holder of a Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, irrespective of the validity and enforceability of this Indenture, the Notes or the obligations of the Company or any other Guarantors to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder: (a) (x) the due and punctual payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes when and as the same shall become due and payable, whether at maturity, upon redemption or repurchase, by acceleration or otherwise, (y) the due and punctual payment of interest on the overdue principal and (to the extent permitted by law) interest, if any, on the Notes and (z) the due and punctual payment and performance of all other obligations of the Company and all other obligations of the other Guarantors (including under the Note Guarantees), in each case, to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder (including amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07 hereof), all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof (collectively, the ""); and (b) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Notes or any of such other obligations, the due and punctual payment and performance of Guarantee Obligations in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at maturity, upon redemption or repurchase, by acceleration or otherwise. Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed, or failing performance of any other obligation of the Company to the Holders under this Indenture or under the Notes, for whatever reason, each Guarantor shall be obligated to pay, or to perform or cause the performance of, the same immediately. A Default under this Indenture or the Notes shall constitute an event of default under the Note Guarantees, and shall entitle the Holders of Notes to accelerate the obligations of the Guarantors thereunder in the same manner and to the same extent as the obligations of the Company.
Guarantee Obligations
 
Each of the Guarantors hereby agrees that (to the fullest extent permitted by law) its obligations hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Notes or this Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder of the Notes with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, any release of any other Guarantor, the recovery of any judgment against the Company, any action to enforce the same, whether or not a Note Guarantee is affixed to any particular Note, or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a Guarantor. Each of the Guarantors hereby waives (to the fullest extent permitted by law) the benefit of diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever and covenants that its Note Guarantee shall not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in the Notes, this Indenture and this Note Guarantee. This Note Guarantee is a guarantee of payment and not of collection. If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Company or to any Guarantor, or any custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar
 
official acting in relation to the Company or such Guarantor, any amount paid by the Company or such Guarantor to the Trustee or such Holder, this Note Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and effect. Each Guarantor further agrees (to the fullest extent permitted by law) that, as between it, on the one hand, and the Holders of Notes and the Trustee, on the other hand, (a) subject to this Article Eleven, the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article Six for the purposes of this Note Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby, and (b) in the event of any acceleration of such obligations as provided in Article Six hereof, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for the purpose of this Note Guarantee.
 
 
The obligations of each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee pursuant to this Article Eleven shall be junior and subordinated to the prior payment in full in cash or Cash Equivalents, or such payment duly provided for to the satisfaction of the holders of such Guarantor Senior Indebtedness, of the Guarantor Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor on the same basis as the Notes are junior and subordinated to Senior Indebtedness of the Company. For the purposes of the foregoing sentence, the Trustee and the Holders shall have the right to receive and/or retain payments by any of the Guarantors only at such times as they may receive and/or retain payments in respect of the Notes pursuant to this Indenture, including Article Ten hereof.
 
 
Each Guarantor, and by its acceptance of Notes, each Holder, hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such parties that the Note Guarantee of such Guarantor not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to any Note Guarantee. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Trustee, the Holders and the Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the obligations of such Guarantor under its Note Guarantee and this Article Eleven shall be limited to the maximum amount as will, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Guarantor that are relevant under such laws, and after giving effect to any collections from, rights to receive contribution from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Guarantor under this Article Eleven, result in the obligations of such Guarantor under its Note Guarantee not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.
 
 
To further evidence its Note Guarantee set forth in Section 11.01, each Guarantor hereby agrees that a notation of such Note Guarantee, substantially in the form of hereto, shall be endorsed on each Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee. Such Note Guarantee shall be executed on behalf of each Guarantor by either manual or facsimile signature of one Officer or other person duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of each Guarantor who shall have been duly authorized to so execute by all requisite corporate action. The
Exhibit E
 
validity and enforceability of any Note Guarantee shall not be affected by the fact that it is not affixed to any particular Note.
 
Each of the Guarantors hereby agrees that its Note Guarantee set forth in Section 11.01 shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to endorse on each Note a notation of such Note Guarantee.
 
If an Officer of a Guarantor whose signature is on this Indenture or a Note Guarantee no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Note on which such Note Guarantee is endorsed or at any time thereafter, such Guarantor's Note Guarantee of such Note shall nevertheless be valid.
 
The delivery of any Note by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof hereunder, shall constitute due delivery of any Note Guarantee set forth in this Indenture on behalf of each Guarantor.
 
 
A Subsidiary Guarantor shall be released from its obligations under its Note Guarantee and its obligations under this Indenture and the Registration Rights Agreement:
 
(1) in the event of a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor, by way of merger, consolidation or otherwise, or a sale or other disposition of all of the equity interests of such Subsidiary Guarantor then held by the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries;
 
(2) if such Subsidiary Guarantor is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or otherwise ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary, in each case in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture, upon effectiveness of such designation or when it first ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary, respectively; or
 
(3) if such Subsidiary Guarantor no longer Guarantees any other Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company (other than if such Subsidiary Guarantor no longer Guarantees any other Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company as a result of payment under any Guarantee of any such Indebtedness by any Subsidiary Guarantor); provided that a Subsidiary Guarantor shall not be permitted to be released from its Note Guarantee if it is an obligor with respect to Indebtedness that would not, under the Section 4.10, be permitted to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor;
 
, , in either case that any such termination shall occur only to the extent that all obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under all of its Guarantees of any Indebtedness of the Company or any Indebtedness of any other Guarantor shall also terminate upon such release and none of its Equity Interests are pledged for the benefit of any holder of any Indebtedness of the Company or any Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company.
provided
however
 
The Trustee shall execute an appropriate instrument prepared by the Company evidencing the release of a Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under its Note Guarantee upon receipt of a request by the Company or such Guarantor accompanied by an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel certifying as to the compliance with this Section 11.05; , , that the legal counsel delivering such Opinion of Counsel may rely as to matters of fact on one or more Officers' Certificates of the Company.
provided
however
 
Except as set forth in Articles Four and Five and this Section 11.05, nothing contained in this Indenture or in any of the Notes shall prevent any consolidation or merger of a Guarantor with or into the Company or another Guarantor or shall prevent any sale or conveyance of the property of a Guarantor as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to the Company or another Guarantor.
 
 
Until this Indenture is discharged and all of the Notes are discharged and paid in full, each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives and agrees not to exercise any claim or other rights which it may now or hereafter acquire against the Company that arise from the existence, payment, performance or enforcement of the Company's obligations under the Notes or this Indenture and such Guarantor's obligations under this Note Guarantee and this Indenture, in any such instance including, without limitation, any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution, indemnification, and any right to participate in any claim or remedy of the Holders against the Company, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity, or under contract, statute or common law, including, without limitation, the right to take or receive from the Company, directly or indirectly, in cash or other assets or by set-off or in any other manner, payment or security on account of such claim or other rights. If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor in violation of the preceding sentence and any amounts owing to the Trustee or the Holders of Notes under the Notes, this Indenture, or any other document or instrument delivered under or in connection with such agreements or instruments, shall not have been paid in full, such amount shall have been deemed to have been paid to such Guarantor for the benefit of, and held in trust for the benefit of, the Trustee or the Holders and shall forthwith be paid to the Trustee for the benefit of itself or such Holders to be credited and applied to the obligations in favor of the Trustee or the Holders, as the case may be, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of this Indenture. Each Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive direct and indirect benefits from the financing arrangements contemplated by this Indenture and that the waiver set forth in this Section 11.06 is knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.
 
 
Each Guarantor agrees to make immediate payment to the Trustee on behalf of the Holders of all Guarantee Obligations owing or payable to the respective Holders upon receipt of a demand for payment therefor by the Trustee to such Guarantor in writing.
 
 
Each payment to be made by a Guarantor hereunder in respect of the Guarantee Obligations shall be payable in the currency or currencies in which such Guarantee Obligations are denominated, and shall be made without set-off, counterclaim, reduction or diminution of any kind or nature.
 
 
The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are and shall be absolute and unconditional and any monies or amounts expressed to be owing or payable by each Guarantor hereunder which may not be recoverable from such Guarantor on the basis of a Guarantee shall be recoverable from such Guarantor as a primary obligor and principal debtor in respect thereof.
 
 
The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall be continuing and shall remain in full force and effect until all such obligations have been paid and satisfied in full. Each Guarantor agrees with the Trustee that it will from time to time deliver to the Trustee suitable acknowledgments of this continued liability hereunder and under any other instrument or instruments in such form as counsel to the Trustee may reasonably request and as will prevent any action brought against it in respect of any default hereunder being barred by any statute of limitations now or hereafter in force and, in the event of the failure of a Guarantor so to do, it hereby irrevocably appoints the Trustee the attorney and agent of such Guarantor to make, execute and deliver such written acknowledgment or acknowledgments or other instruments as may from time to time become necessary or reasonably advisable, in the judgment of the Trustee on the advice of counsel, to fully maintain and keep in force the liability of such Guarantor hereunder.
 
 
The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be satisfied, reduced or discharged solely by the payment of such principal, premium, if any, interest, fees and other monies or amounts as may at any time prior to discharge of this Indenture pursuant to Article Eight be or become owing or payable under or by virtue of or otherwise in connection with the Notes or this Indenture.
 
 
The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall continue to be effective or shall be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment which would otherwise have reduced the obligations of any Guarantor hereunder (whether such payment shall have been made by or on behalf of the Company or by or on behalf of a Guarantor) is rescinded or reclaimed from any of the Holders upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of the Company or any Guarantor or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made. If demand for, or acceleration of the time for, payment by the Company or any other Guarantor is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of the Company or such
 
Guarantor, all such Indebtedness otherwise subject to demand for payment or acceleration shall nonetheless be payable by each Guarantor as provided herein.
 
 
Subject to Section 11.05, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected, impaired or diminished in any way by any act, omission, matter or thing whatsoever, occurring before, upon or after any demand for payment hereunder (and whether or not known or consented to by any Guarantor or any of the Holders) which, but for this provision, might constitute a whole or partial defense to a claim against any Guarantor hereunder or might operate to release or otherwise exonerate any Guarantor from any of its obligations hereunder or otherwise affect such obligations, whether occasioned by default of any of the Holders or otherwise, including, without limitation:
 
(a) any limitation of status or power, disability, incapacity or other circumstance relating to the Company or any other Person, including any insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization, readjustment, composition, dissolution, winding-up or other proceeding involving or affecting the Company or any other Person;
 
(b) any irregularity, defect, unenforceability or invalidity in respect of any indebtedness or other obligation of the Company or any other Person under this Indenture, the Notes or any other document or instrument;
 
(c) any failure of the Company or any other Guarantor, whether or not without fault on its part, to perform or comply with any of the provisions of this Indenture, the Notes or any Note Guarantee, or to give notice thereof to a Guarantor;
 
(d) the taking or enforcing or exercising or the refusal or neglect to take or enforce or exercise any right or remedy from or against the Company or any other Person or their respective assets or the release or discharge of any such right or remedy;
 
(e) the granting of time, renewals, extensions, compromises, concessions, waivers, releases, discharges and other indulgences to the Company or any other Person;
 
(f) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, any of the Notes, or any other amendment, variation, supplement, replacement or waiver of, or any consent to departure from, any of the Notes or this Indenture, including, without limitation, any increase or decrease in the principal amount of or premium, if any, or interest on any of the Notes;
 
(g) any change in the ownership, control, name, objects, businesses, assets, capital structure or constitution of the Company or a Guarantor;
 
(h) any merger or amalgamation of the Company or a Guarantor with any Person or Persons;
 
(i) the occurrence of any change in the laws, rules, regulations or ordinances of any jurisdiction by any present or future action of any governmental authority or court amending, varying, reducing or otherwise affecting, or purporting to amend, vary, reduce or otherwise affect, any of the Guarantee Obligations or the obligations of a Guarantor under its Note Guarantee; and
 
(j) any other circumstance, including release of a Guarantor pursuant to Section 11.05 (other than by complete, irrevocable payment) that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of the Company under this Indenture or the Notes or of a Guarantor in respect of its Note Guarantee hereunder.
 
 
Without in any way limiting the provisions of Section 11.01, each Guarantor hereby waives (to the fullest extent permitted by law) notice of acceptance hereof, notice of any liability of any Guarantor hereunder, notice or proof of reliance by the Holders upon the obligations of any Guarantor hereunder, and diligence, presentment, demand for payment on the Company, protest, notice of dishonor or non-payment of any of the Guarantee Obligations, or other notice or formalities to the Company or any Guarantor of any kind whatsoever.
 
 
Neither the Trustee nor any other Person shall have any obligation to enforce or exhaust any rights or remedies against the Company or any other Person or any property of the Company or any other Person before the Trustee is entitled to demand payment and performance by any or all Guarantors of their liabilities and obligations under their Note Guarantees or under this Indenture.
 
 
The Holders, without releasing, discharging, limiting or otherwise affecting in whole or in part the obligations and liabilities of any Guarantor hereunder and without the consent of or notice to any Guarantor, may
 
(a) grant time, renewals, extensions, compromises, concessions, waivers, releases, discharges and other indulgences to the Company or any other Person;
 
(b) take or abstain from taking security or collateral from the Company or from perfecting security or collateral of the Company;
 
(c) release, discharge, compromise, realize, enforce or otherwise deal with or do any act or thing in respect of (with or without consideration) any and all collateral, mortgages or other security given by the Company or any third party with respect to the obligations or matters contemplated by this Indenture or the Notes;
 
(d) accept compromises or arrangements from the Company;
 
(e) apply all monies at any time received from the Company or from any security upon such part of the Guarantee Obligations as the Holders may see fit or change any such application in whole or in part from time to time as the Holders may see fit; and
 
(f) otherwise deal with, or waive or modify their right to deal with, the Company and all other Persons and any security as the Holders or the Trustee may see fit.
 
 
If any Guarantor fails to pay in accordance with Section 11.07 hereof, the Trustee may proceed in its name as trustee hereunder in the enforcement of the Note Guarantee of any such Guarantor and such Guarantor's obligations thereunder and hereunder by any remedy provided by law, whether by legal proceedings or otherwise, and to recover from such Guarantor the obligations.
 
 
No amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Indenture relating to any Guarantor or consent to any departure by any Guarantor or any other Person from any such provision will in any event be effective unless it is signed by such Guarantor and the Trustee.
 
 
Each Guarantor hereby acknowledges communication of the terms of this Indenture and the Notes and consents to and approves of the same.
 
 
Each Guarantor shall pay on demand by the Trustee any and all costs, fees and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees) incurred by the Trustee, its agents, advisors and counsel or any of the Holders in enforcing any of their rights under any Note Guarantee.
 
 
No Note Guarantee shall operate by way of merger of any of the obligations of a Guarantor under any other agreement, including, without limitation, this Indenture. No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising, on the part of the Trustee or the Holders, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or under this Indenture or the Notes, shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or under this Indenture or the Notes preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges in the Note Guarantee and under this Indenture, the Notes and any other document or instrument between a Guarantor and/or the Company and the Trustee are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privilege provided by law.
 
 
Subject to Section 11.05, without prejudice to the survival of any of the other obligations of each Guarantor hereunder, the obligations of each Guarantor under Section 11.01 shall survive the payment in full of the Guarantee Obligations and shall be enforceable against such Guarantor without regard to and without giving effect to any defense, right of offset or counterclaim available to or which may be asserted by the Company or any Guarantor.
 
 
The obligations of each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee and this Indenture are in addition to and not in substitution for any other obligations to the Trustee or to any of the Holders in relation to this Indenture or the Notes and any guarantees or security at any time held by or for the benefit of any of them.
 
 
Any provision of this Article Eleven which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate the remaining provisions and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction unless its removal would substantially defeat the basic intent, spirit and purpose of this Indenture and this Article Eleven.
 
 
Each Note Guarantee shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each Guarantor and the Trustee and the other Holders and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except that no Guarantor may assign any of its obligations hereunder or thereunder.
 
 
 
 
If any provision of this Indenture limits, qualifies, or conflicts with another provision which is required or deemed to be included in this Indenture by the TIA, such required or deemed provision shall control. If any provision of this Indenture modifies or excludes any provision of the TIA that may be so modified or excluded, the latter provision shall be deemed to apply to this Indenture as so modified or excluded, as the case may be.

Participation of Broker-Dealers in Exchange Offer
 
(a) The Staff has taken the position that any broker-dealer that receives Exchange Securities for its own account in the Exchange Offer in exchange for Securities that were acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making or other trading activities (a "") may be deemed to be an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Securities Act and must deliver a prospectus meeting the requirements of the Securities Act in connection with any resale of such Exchange Securities.
Participating Broker-Dealer
 
The Company and the Guarantors understand that it is the Staff's position that if the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement includes a plan of distribution containing a statement to the above effect and the means by which Participating Broker-Dealers may resell the Exchange Securities, without naming the Participating Broker-Dealers or specifying the amount of Exchange Securities owned by them, such Prospectus may be delivered by Participating Broker-Dealers to satisfy their prospectus delivery obligation under the Securities Act in connection with resales of Exchange Securities for their own accounts, so long as the Prospectus otherwise meets the requirements of the Securities Act.
 
(b) In light of the above, and notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company and the Guarantors agree to amend or supplement the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement for a period of up to 180 days after the last Exchange Date (as such period may be extended pursuant to Section 3(d) of this Agreement), if requested by the Initial Purchasers or by one or more Participating Broker-Dealers, in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of any Exchange Securities by Participating Broker-Dealers consistent with the positions of the Staff recited in Section 4(a) above. The Company and the Guarantors further agree that Participating Broker-Dealers shall be authorized to deliver such Prospectus during such period in connection with the resales contemplated by this Section 4, subject to the right of the Company to suspend use of any Prospectus pursuant to Section 3(c) hereof.
 
(c) The Initial Purchasers shall have no liability to the Company, any Guarantor or any Holder with respect to any request that they may make pursuant to Section 4(b) above.
 
5. .
Indemnification and Contribution
 
(a) The Company and each Guarantor, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Initial Purchaser and each Holder, their respective affiliates, directors and officers and each Person, if any, who controls any Initial Purchaser or any Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, legal fees and other expenses incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted, as such fees and expenses are incurred), joint or several, that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement or any Prospectus or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to any Initial Purchaser or information relating to any Holder furnished to the Company in writing through JPMorgan or any selling Holder expressly for use therein, that with respect to any such untrue statement in or omission from any preliminary prospectus relating to a Registration Statement, the indemnity agreement contained in this paragraph (a) shall not inure to the benefit of any Holder to the extent that the sale to the Person asserting any such loss, claim, damage or liability was an initial resale by such Holder and any such loss, claim, damage or liability of or with respect to such
provided
 
Holder results from the fact that both (i) a copy of the final Prospectus was not sent or given to such Person at or prior to the written confirmation or the sale of such Securities to such Person and (ii) the untrue statement in or omission from such preliminary prospectus was corrected in the final Prospectus relating to such Registration Statement unless, in either case, such failure to deliver the Prospectus was a result of non-compliance by the Company or any of the Guarantors with the provisions of Section 3 hereof.
 
(b) Each Holder agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers and the other selling Holders, the directors and officers of the Company and the Guarantors, each officer of the Company and the Guarantors who signed the Registration Statement and each Person, if any, who controls the Company, any of the Guarantors, any Initial Purchaser and any other selling Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Holder furnished to the Company in writing by such Holder expressly for use in any Registration Statement and any Prospectus.
 
(c) If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any Person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such Person (the "") shall promptly notify the Person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "") in writing; that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this Section 5 except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under this Section 5. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall be entitled to participate therein and to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified Indemnifying Person, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person. After notice from the Indemnifying Person to the Indemnified Person of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the Indemnifying Person shall not be liable to the Indemnified Person under this Section 5 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Person in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; , , that an Indemnified Person shall have the right to employ its own counsel in any such action, but the fees, expenses and other charges of such counsel for the Indemnified Person will be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the employment of counsel by the Indemnified Person has been authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Person, (ii) the Indemnified Person has reasonably concluded (based upon advice of counsel to the Indemnified Person) that there may be legal defenses available to it or other Indemnified Persons that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person, (iii) a conflict or potential conflict exists (based upon advice of counsel to the Indemnified Person) between the Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person (in which case the Indemnifying Person will not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the Indemnified Person) or (iv) the Indemnifying Person has not in fact employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person to assume the defense of such action within a reasonable time after receiving notice of the commencement of the action, in each of which cases the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel will be at the expense of the Indemnifying Person. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm (x) for any Initial Purchaser, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control Persons of such Initial Purchaser shall be designated in writing by JPMorgan, (y) for any Holder, its directors

and officers and any control Persons of such Holder shall be designated in writing by the Majority Holders and (z) in all other cases shall be designated in writing by the Company. Each Indemnified Person, as a condition to the agreements contained in this Section 5, shall use all reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Indemnifying Person in the defense of any such action or claim. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (A) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (B) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
 
(d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors from the offering of the Securities and the Exchange Securities, on the one hand, and by the Holders from receiving Securities or Exchange Securities registered under the Securities Act, on the other hand, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Holders on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Holders on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantors or by the Holders and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
(e) The Company, the Guarantors and the Holders agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 5 were determined by allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5, in no event shall a Holder be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities or Exchange Securities sold by such Holder exceeds the amount of any damages that such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No Person guilty of fraudulent

misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
 
(f) The remedies provided for in this Section 5 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies that may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.
 
(g) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 5 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Initial Purchasers or any Holder or any Person controlling any Initial Purchaser or any Holder, or by or on behalf of the Company or the Guarantors or the officers or directors of or any Person controlling the Company or the Guarantors, (iii) acceptance of any of the Exchange Securities and (iv) any sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement.

Holder results from the fact that both (i) a copy of the final Prospectus was not sent or given to such Person at or prior to the written confirmation or the sale of such Securities to such Person and (ii) the untrue statement in or omission from such preliminary prospectus was corrected in the final Prospectus relating to such Registration Statement unless, in either case, such failure to deliver the Prospectus was a result of non-compliance by the Company or any of the Guarantors with the provisions of Section 3 hereof.
 
(b) Each Holder agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers and the other selling Holders, the directors and officers of the Company and the Guarantors, each officer of the Company and the Guarantors who signed the Registration Statement and each Person, if any, who controls the Company, any of the Guarantors, any Initial Purchaser and any other selling Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Holder furnished to the Company in writing by such Holder expressly for use in any Registration Statement and any Prospectus.
 
(c) If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any Person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such Person (the "") shall promptly notify the Person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "") in writing; that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this Section 5 except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under this Section 5. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall be entitled to participate therein and to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified Indemnifying Person, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person. After notice from the Indemnifying Person to the Indemnified Person of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the Indemnifying Person shall not be liable to the Indemnified Person under this Section 5 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Person in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; , , that an Indemnified Person shall have the right to employ its own counsel in any such action, but the fees, expenses and other charges of such counsel for the Indemnified Person will be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the employment of counsel by the Indemnified Person has been authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Person, (ii) the Indemnified Person has reasonably concluded (based upon advice of counsel to the Indemnified Person) that there may be legal defenses available to it or other Indemnified Persons that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person, (iii) a conflict or potential conflict exists (based upon advice of counsel to the Indemnified Person) between the Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person (in which case the Indemnifying Person will not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the Indemnified Person) or (iv) the Indemnifying Person has not in fact employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person to assume the defense of such action within a reasonable time after receiving notice of the commencement of the action, in each of which cases the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel will be at the expense of the Indemnifying Person. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm (x) for any Initial Purchaser, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control Persons of such Initial Purchaser shall be designated in writing by JPMorgan, (y) for any Holder, its directors

and officers and any control Persons of such Holder shall be designated in writing by the Majority Holders and (z) in all other cases shall be designated in writing by the Company. Each Indemnified Person, as a condition to the agreements contained in this Section 5, shall use all reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Indemnifying Person in the defense of any such action or claim. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (A) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (B) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
 
(d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors from the offering of the Securities and the Exchange Securities, on the one hand, and by the Holders from receiving Securities or Exchange Securities registered under the Securities Act, on the other hand, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Holders on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Holders on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantors or by the Holders and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
(e) The Company, the Guarantors and the Holders agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 5 were determined by allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5, in no event shall a Holder be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities or Exchange Securities sold by such Holder exceeds the amount of any damages that such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No Person guilty of fraudulent
pro
rata
 
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
 
(f) The remedies provided for in this Section 5 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies that may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.
 
(g) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 5 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Initial Purchasers or any Holder or any Person controlling any Initial Purchaser or any Holder, or by or on behalf of the Company or the Guarantors or the officers or directors of or any Person controlling the Company or the Guarantors, (iii) acceptance of any of the Exchange Securities and (iv) any sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement.

The Initial Purchasers (in their capacity as Initial Purchasers) shall have no liability or obligation to the Company or the Guarantors with respect to any failure by a Holder to comply with, or any breach by any Holder of, any of the obligations of such Holder under this Agreement.
 
(e) Each Holder shall be a third party beneficiary to the agreements made hereunder (excluding those agreements made in Section 5 hereto) between the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, and shall have the right to enforce such agreements directly to the extent it deems such enforcement necessary or advisable to protect its rights or the rights of other Holders hereunder.

If any term, provision, covenant or restriction contained in this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable or against public policy, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions contained herein shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated. The Company, the Guarantors and the Initial Purchasers shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the invalid, void or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, void or unenforceable provisions.
