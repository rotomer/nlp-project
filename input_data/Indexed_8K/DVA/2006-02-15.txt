On February 15, 2006, DaVita Inc. issued a press release announcing its financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2005. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
 
The attached press release contains non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of Regulation G, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the Unites States, or GAAP. To supplement our consolidated financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, for all periods presented, we have used the following non-GAAP measures of (a) income from continuing operations excluding Medicare lab recoveries related to prior years' services (b) operating income excluding Medicare lab recoveries related to prior years' services, (c) operating cash flow excluding Medicare lab recoveries related to prior years' services and the tax benefit from stock option exercises, (d) free cash flow and free cash flow, excluding Medicare lab recoveries related to prior years' services, and tax benefit from stock option exercises, (e) operating revenue excluding Medicare lab recoveries related to prior years' services. We have also used "Consolidated EBITDA" as materially defined in our credit agreement effective October 5, 2005 for purposes of calculating a debt leverage ratio. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of our current and historical financial performance and compliance with the financial covenants contained in our current credit agreement by excluding certain revenue and expenses that may not be indicative of our normal operating results. In addition, because we have historically reported certain non-GAAP financial measures in our financial results that exclude certain non-recurring and unusual expenses and Medicare lab recoveries for prior years' services that can result in unusual fluctuations in our operating performance, we believe the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability in our financial reporting to prior periods for which these non-GAAP financial measures were previously reported. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered or used as a substitute for or superior to GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the attached press release.
 
The attached press release also contains forward-looking statements relating to our operating performance for 2006. All statements that do not concern historical facts are forward-looking statements. These statements involve substantial known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the press release and in the Company's SEC filings including its most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2005, and it's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004. The Company's forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to us, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise.
 
The information contained in this Form 8-K (including Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto) is being furnished and shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (The "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section and shall not be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

Outlook
 
We are revising our 2006 operating income guidance. Operating income is now projected to be in the $630-700 million range before the impact of FASB No. 123R related to stock option expensing. Our previous guidance was for operating income to be in the $600  670 million range. These projections and the underlying assumptions involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those described below and actual results may vary significantly from these current projections.
 
DaVita will be holding a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter and year end results for 2005 on February 15, 2006, at 12:00 PM Eastern Time. The dial in number is 800-399-4406. A replay of the conference call will be available on DaVita's official web page, www.davita.com, for the following 30 days.
 
This release contains forwardlooking statements, including statements related to our 2006 operating results. Factors which could impact future results include the uncertainties associated with governmental regulations, general economic and other market conditions, acquisitions and the risk factors set forth in the Company's SEC filings, including its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2005. The forward-looking statements should be considered in light of these risks and uncertainties.

Note 1: Calculation of the Leverage Ratio
 
Under the Company's credit agreement that was effective on October 5, 2005, the leverage ratio is defined as all funded debt plus the face amount of all letters of credit issued, minus cash and cash equivalents, divided by consolidated "EBITDA". The leverage ratio determines the interest rate margin payable by the Company under the Credit Agreement by establishing the margin over the base interest rate (LIBOR) that is applicable. The following Leverage Ratio was calculated using "Consolidated EBITDA" as defined in the Credit Agreement, except that pro forma incremental "EBITDA" relating to routine acquisitions is included in the calculation of "EBITDA" under the Credit Agreement. Such calculation is based on the last twelve-months of Consolidated "EBITDA", pro forma for the Gambro Healthcare acquisition and related divestitures.
 
 
In accordance with the Company's Credit Agreement, the Company's leverage ratio can not currently exceed 6.25 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2005, the Company was in compliance with its Credit Agreement.
 
 
1. Income from continuing operations, excluding Medicare lab recoveries related to prior years' services:
 
 
2. Operating income, excluding Medicare lab recoveries related to prior years' services:
 
 
3. Operating cash flow, excluding Medicare lab recoveries related to prior years' services, and tax benefit from stock option exercises:
 
 
 
4. Free cash flow and free cash flow, excluding Medicare lab recoveries related to prior years' services, and tax benefit from stock option exercises:
 
Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less non-development capital expenditures. We believe free cash flow is a useful adjunct to cash flow from operating activities and other measurements under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States since it is a meaningful measure of our ability to fund acquisition and development activities and meet our debt service requirements. Free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as an indicator of cash flows or as a measure of liquidity.
