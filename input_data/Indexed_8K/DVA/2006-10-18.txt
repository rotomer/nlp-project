Approval of an Amendment to the Forms of Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreement, the Form of Restricted Stock Units Agreement, and the Form of Stock Appreciation Rights Agreement
On October 12, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company approved an amendment to each of (i) the forms of Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreement for non-qualified stock option grants to employees under the 2002 Equity Compensation Plan (the "Plan") and the 1999 Non-Executive Officer and Non-Director Equity Compensation Plan, (ii) the form of Restricted Stock Units Agreement for restricted stock unit awards to employees under the Plan and (iii) the form of Stock Appreciation Rights Agreement for stock appreciation rights awards to employees under the Plan (collectively, the "Agreements"). The amendment to each of the Agreements provides that the participant's equity award shall automatically vest and become immediately exercisable or issuable in its entirety in connection with a change of control (as defined in the Agreements) in the event that the acquiror (as defined in the Agreements) does not assume, convert or replace the equity award or the participant's employment is terminated without cause (as defined in the Agreements) or terminated by the participant for good reason under certain circumstances, within twenty-four months of the change of control. The Agreements were also amended to limit the participant's relationships with competitors, suppliers and certain physician groups during the one year period following termination and to prohibit the participant from accepting employment or providing services where disclosure of confidential information would be inevitable because of the nature of the position.
 
(d) Exhibits.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

In Witness Whereof
 

Exhibit 10.3
Name:
Address:
SSN:
In recognition of your continuing contributions toward making DaVita the Greatest Dialysis Company the World has ever seen, and as a reward for your hard work and commitment to living our Mission and our Values, you have been granted this award (the "Award") of restricted stock units ("Restricted Stock Units" or "Units") under This award represents your right to receive shares of common stock of DaVita Inc. (the "Company"), subject to your fulfillment of the vesting conditions set forth in this agreement (the "Agreement").
DaVita's 2002 Equity Compensation Plan (the "Plan").
The terms of your Award are as set forth in this Agreement and in the Plan. The Plan is incorporated into this Agreement by reference, which means that this Agreement is limited by and subject to the terms of the Plan. In the event of a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the Plan, the terms of the Plan will control. Capitalized terms that are used here but that are not defined in this Agreement have the meanings given to them in the Plan. The most important terms of the Award are summarized as follows:
 
The terms set forth above, together with the terms and conditions attached, constitute one agreement.
Note: Please mark and initial any correction to the Name, SSN and/or Address shown on this page before returning a signed copy of this agreement to the Stock Plan Administrator
Upon each vesting date of the Award (each, a "Vesting Date"), one share of Common Stock will become issuable to you for each Restricted Stock Unit that vests on such Vesting Date (the "Shares"). After the Vesting Date, the Company will issue the Shares to you, after reducing the Shares by a number of shares (if any) that are sold to satisfy your tax withholding obligations. No fractional shares will be issued under this Agreement, even though such fractions may result if a portion of a share must be sold to pay your withholding taxes.
4. Conversion of Restricted Stock Units and Stock Issuance.
You must be an employee of the Company on a Vesting Date in order to receive the Shares then vesting. Thus, Restricted Stock Units will not continue to vest if your employment terminates for any reason, including in the event you die, become disabled, retire, or change status to that of an independent contractor. In those circumstances, you will forfeit your right to any Restricted Stock Units that would otherwise vest after the date on which your employment is terminated.
5. Termination of Employment.
You will not have any right to the Shares subject to your Award until they are actually issued to you.
6. Right to Shares.
7. Taxes.
You are ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed in connection with the Award, regardless of any action the Company or any of its Subsidiaries takes with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the Award. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries makes any representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant or vesting of the Award or the subsequent sale of Shares issuable pursuant to the Award. The Company and its Subsidiaries do not commit and are under no obligation to structure the Award to reduce or eliminate your tax liability. As a condition and term of this Award, no election under 83(b) of the United States Internal Revenue Code may be made by you or any other person with respect to all or any portion of the Award.
(a) Generally.
Prior to any event in connection with the Award (e.g., vesting) that the Company determines may result in any domestic or foreign tax withholding obligation, whether national, federal, state or local, including any social tax obligation (the "Tax Withholding Obligation"), you must arrange for the satisfaction of the minimum amount of such Tax Withholding Obligation in a manner acceptable to the Company. You may choose to satisfy your tax obligation in either of the following manners:
(b) Payment of Withholding Taxes.
(i)  Such Shares will be sold on the day the tax Withholding Obligation arises (e.g., a Vesting Date) or as soon thereafter as practicable. You will be responsible for all broker's fees and other costs of sale, and you agree to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from any losses, costs, damages, or expenses relating to any such sale. To the extent the proceeds of such sale exceed your Tax Withholding Obligation, the Company agrees to pay such excess in cash to you through payroll or otherwise as soon as practicable. You acknowledge that the Company or its designee is under no obligation to arrange for such sale at any particular price, and that the proceeds of any such sale may not be sufficient to satisfy your Tax Withholding Obligation. Accordingly, you agree to pay to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as soon as practicable, including through additional payroll withholding, any amount of Tax Withholding Obligation that is not satisfied by the sale of Shares described above.
By Sale of Shares.
