Outlook
We are revising the lower end of our 2006 operating income projection, therefore our new guidance for operating income is $690-$700 million excluding the valuation gain on the Product Supply Agreement. Our 2007 operating income is currently projected to be in the range of $680-$750 million. These projections and the underlying assumptions involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those described below and actual results may vary significantly from these current projections.

Note 1: Calculation of the Leverage Ratio
Under the Company's current credit agreement (Credit Agreement), the leverage ratio is defined as all funded debt plus the face amount of all letters of credit issued, minus cash and cash equivalents, divided by "Consolidated EBITDA". The leverage ratio determines the interest rate margin payable by the Company under the Credit Agreement by establishing the margin over the base interest rate (LIBOR) that is applicable. The following leverage ratio was calculated using "Consolidated EBITDA" as defined in the Credit Agreement. The calculation below is based on the last twelve-months of Consolidated "EBITDA", pro forma for the routine acquisitions that occurred during the period. The Company's management believes that the presentation of "Consolidated EBITDA" is useful to investors to enhance their understanding of the Company's leverage ratio under its Credit Agreement.
 
In accordance with the Company's Credit Agreement, the Company's leverage ratio can not exceed 6.0 to 1.0 as of September 30, 2006. At that date, the Company's leverage ratio did not exceed 6.0 to 1.0.
 
1. Income from continuing operations and net income excluding the valuation gain on the Product Supply Agreement:
We believe that income from continuing operations and net income excluding the valuation gain on the Product Supply Agreement enhances a user's understanding of our normal income from continuing operations and net income for these periods by providing a measure that is more meaningful because it excludes a non-recurring non-cash item that resulted from an amendment of the Product Supply Agreement and accordingly is more comparable to prior periods and indicative of consistent income from continuing operations and net income. This measure is not a measure of financial performance under United States generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to income from continuing operations and net income.
 
2. Operating income excluding the pre-tax valuation gain on the Product Supply Agreement:
We believe that operating income excluding the valuation gain on the Product Supply Agreement enhances a user's understanding of our normal operating income for these periods by providing a measure that is more meaningful because it excludes a non-recurring non-cash item that resulted from an amendment of the Product Supply Agreement and accordingly is more comparable to prior periods and indicative of consistent operating income items. This measure is not a measure of financial performance under United States generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income.
 
 
3. Operating cash flow, excluding the income tax payment on divested centers:
We believe that operating cash flow excluding the income tax payment on divested centers enhances a user's understanding of our normal operating cash flows for these periods by providing a measure that is more meaningful because it excludes non-recurring transactions that can cause unusual fluctuations in our operating cash flows and accordingly is more comparable to prior periods and indicative of consistent operating cash flow items. This measure is not a measure of financial performance under United States generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, as an indicator of cash flows or as a measure of liquidity.
 
 
 
4. Free cash flow and free cash flow, excluding the income tax payment on divested centers:
Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less expenditures for routine maintenance and information technology. We believe free cash flow is a useful adjunct to cash flow from operating activities and other measurements under United States generally accepted accounting principles, since it is a meaningful measure of our ability to fund acquisition and development activities and meet our debt service requirements. Free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under United States generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, as an indicator of cash flows or as a measure of liquidity.
