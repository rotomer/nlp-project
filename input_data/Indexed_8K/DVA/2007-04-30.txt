Note 1: Calculation of the Leverage Ratio
Under the Company's current Senior Secured Credit Facilities (Credit Agreement), the leverage ratio is defined as all funded debt plus the face amount of all letters of credit issued, minus cash and cash equivalents, divided by "Consolidated EBITDA". The leverage ratio determines the interest rate margin payable by the Company for its term loan A and revolving line of credit under the Credit Agreement by establishing the margin over the base interest rate (LIBOR) that is applicable. The following leverage ratio was calculated using "Consolidated EBITDA" as defined in the Credit Agreement. The calculation below is based on the last twelve months of "Consolidated EBITDA", pro forma for the routine acquisitions that occurred during the period. The Company's management believes that the presentation of "Consolidated EBITDA" is useful to investors to enhance their understanding of the Company's leverage ratio under its Credit Agreement.
 
In accordance with the Company's Credit Agreement, the Company's leverage ratio cannot exceed 5.75 to 1.0 as of March 31, 2007. At that date, the Company's leverage ratio did not exceed 5.75 to 1.0.
 
1. Operating cash flow, excluding the income tax payment on divested centers:
We believe that operating cash flow excluding the income tax payment on divested centers enhances a user's understanding of our normal operating cash flows for these periods by providing a measure that is more meaningful because it excludes non-recurring transactions that can cause unusual fluctuations in our operating cash flows and accordingly is more comparable to prior periods and indicative of consistent operating cash flow items. This measure is not a measure of financial performance under United States generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, as an indicator of cash flows or as a measure of liquidity.
 
 
 
2. Free cash flow and free cash flow, excluding the income tax payment on divested centers:
Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures for routine maintenance and information technology. We believe free cash flow and free cash flow excluding the income tax payment on divested centers are useful adjuncts to cash flow from operating activities and other measurements under United States generally accepted accounting principles, since free cash flow is a meaningful measure of our ability to fund acquisition and development activities and meet our debt service requirements and because free cash flow excluding the income tax payment on divested centers excludes a non-recurring transaction that can cause unusual fluctuations in our free cash flows and accordingly is more comparable to prior periods and indicative of consistent free cash items. Free cash flow and free cash flow excluding the income tax payment on divested centers are not measures of financial performance under United States generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, as an indicator of cash flows or as a measure of liquidity.
