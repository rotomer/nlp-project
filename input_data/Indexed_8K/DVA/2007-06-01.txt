On May 29, 2007, the stockholders of DaVita Inc. (the "Company") approved the amendment and restatement of the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"). The amended and restated ESPP was approved by the Board of Directors (the "Board") on March 2, 2007, subject to stockholder approval. The ESPP was amended and restated to increase the number of shares of common stock available for issuance by 800,001 shares and provide for electronic share accounts, thereby eliminating the requirement for the delivery of physical certificates. Electronic share accounts will facilitate the tracking of the disqualifying disposition of shares acquired under the plan. The foregoing description of the amended and restated ESPP is qualified in its entirety by reference to the amended and restated ESPP which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1.
In addition, on May 29, 2007, the stockholders of the Company approved the amendment and restatement of the Company's 2002 Equity Compensation Plan (the "2002 Plan"). The amended and restated 2002 Plan was approved by the Board on March 2, 2007, subject to stockholder approval. The 2002 Plan was amended and restated to (i) increase the number of shares of common stock available for issuance by 6,000,000 shares, (ii) eliminate certain share recycling provisions, (iii) change the amount by which share reserves are reduced by full value share awards from 2.75 times to 3.0 times the number of shares subject to the award, (iv) change the limit on the maximum number of shares of common stock that may be subject to awards granted to any single recipient in any consecutive twenty-four month period so that it applies only to awards of stock options and stock appreciation rights, and (v) provide additional exceptions from the three-year minimum vesting period generally applicable to grants of restricted stock units and other stock awards. The foregoing description of the amended and restated 2002 Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the amended and restated 2002 Plan which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2.
