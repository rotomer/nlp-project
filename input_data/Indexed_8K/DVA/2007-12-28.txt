On December 20, 2007, DaVita Inc. (the "Company") entered into a Dialysis Organization Agreement (the "Agreement") with Amgen USA Inc. ("Amgen") which sets forth the terms under which the Company and its affiliates will purchase Epoetin alfa ("Epogen"). Amgen is the sole supplier of Epogen which is used by the Company in the treatment of dialysis patients. The Agreement replaces in its entirety the Dialysis Organization Agreement, effective February 3, 2006, between the Company and Amgen which expires by its terms on December 31, 2007. The term of the Agreement commences January 1, 2008 and ends December 31, 2010.
The Agreement, among other things, provides for discount pricing and rebates for Epogen. Some of the rebates are subject to various qualification requirements for which the Company will be evaluated during the term of the Agreement. These qualification requirements are based on a variety of factors, including, process improvement targets and data submission.
The Agreement allows for termination by either party by prior written notice to the other party, and allows for modification or renegotiation in the event of a change in law or regulation.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
