On March 31, 2008, the Company entered into an employment agreement (the "Employment Agreement") effective February 13, 2008 with Mr. Whitney pursuant to which Mr. Whitney agreed to serve as the Company's Chief Financial Officer on a part-time basis, effective March 1, 2008. Mr. Whitney will receive an annual base salary of $500,000 and is eligible to receive a discretionary performance bonus up to $300,000 in an amount to be determined by the Company's Chief Executive Officer and/or the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.

This grant has a three and one-half year term from the date the shares of Common Stock are issued. The grant shall vest as follows: 116,667 shares of Common Stock shall vest on February 18, 2009, even if Mr. Whitney is no longer the Chief Financial Officer so long as Mr. Whitney is still employed by the Company and is working 25 hours per week; thereafter, so long as Mr. Whitney is either the Chief Financial Officer or working at least 25 hours per week for the Company, the remainder of the shares of Common Stock will vest each month, on a pro-rata basis, with the grant being fully vested on February 18, 2010.
Under the terms of the Employment Agreement, Mr. Whitney is an "at will" employee, which means that either Mr. Whitney or the Company may terminate his employment at any time and for any reason or no reason, subject to notice requirements; provided, that the Company cannot terminate Mr. Whitney without good cause prior to February 18, 2009.
The Employment Agreement contains certain provisions prohibiting Mr. Whitney from soliciting employees of the Company to work for any person and from soliciting any patient or customer of the Company to patronize any competing dialysis facility or from soliciting any patient, customer, supplier or physician to terminate their business relationship with the Company during the term of Mr. Whitney's employment and for the one-year period following the termination of his employment with the Company for any reason. In addition, Mr. Whitney has agreed to a confidentiality provision under the Employment Agreement.
