Note 1: Calculation of the Leverage Ratio
Under the Company's current Senior Secured Credit Facilities (Credit Agreement), the leverage ratio is defined as all funded debt plus the face amount of all letters of credit issued, minus cash and cash equivalents, divided by "Consolidated EBITDA". The leverage ratio determines the interest rate margin payable by the Company for its term loan A and revolving line of credit under the Credit Agreement by establishing the margin over the base interest rate (LIBOR) that is applicable. The following leverage ratio was calculated using "Consolidated EBITDA" as defined in the Credit Agreement. The calculation below is based on the last twelve months of "Consolidated EBITDA", pro forma for the routine acquisitions that occurred during the period. The Company's management believes the presentation of "Consolidated EBITDA" is useful to investors to enhance their understanding of the Company's leverage ratio under its Credit Agreement.
 
In accordance with the Company's Credit Agreement, the Company's leverage ratio cannot exceed 4.50 to 1.0 as of December 31, 2008. At that date the Company's leverage ratio did not exceed 4.50 to 1.0.
 
1. Net income excluding gains from insurance settlements, gains on the sale of investment securities and the valuation gain on the alliance and product supply agreement (the Product Supply Agreement):
We believe that net income excluding gains from insurance settlements, gains on the sale of investment securities and the valuation gain on the Product Supply Agreement enhances a user's understanding of our normal net income for these periods by providing a measure that is more meaningful because it excludes insurance settlement gains related to insurance proceeds from Hurricane Katrina and from a fire that destroyed one of our centers, as well as non-recurring gains on the sale of investment securities and a non-recurring non-cash item that resulted from the termination of our purchase obligation for dialysis machines from Gambro Renal Products Inc. under the Product Supply Agreement, and accordingly is more comparable to current and prior periods and indicative of consistent net income. This measure is not a measure of financial performance under United States generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to net income.
 
2. Operating income excluding pre-tax gains from insurance settlements and the pre-tax valuation gain on the Product Supply Agreement:
We believe that operating income excluding gains from insurance settlements and the valuation gain on the Product Supply Agreement enhances a user's understanding of our normal operating income for these periods by providing a measure that is more meaningful because it excludes insurance settlements gains related to insurance proceeds from Hurricane Katrina and from a fire that destroyed one of our centers and a non-recurring non-cash item that resulted from the termination of our purchase obligation for dialysis machines from Gambro Renal Products Inc. under the Product Supply Agreement, and accordingly is more comparable to current and prior periods and indicative of consistent operating income items. This measure is not a measure of financial performance under United States generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income.
 
 
 
3. Free cash flow
Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures for routine maintenance and information technology. We believe free cash flow is a useful adjunct to cash flow from operating activities and other measurements under United States generally accepted accounting principles, since free cash flow is a meaningful measure of our ability to fund acquisition and development activities and meet our debt service requirements. Free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under United States generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, as an indicator of cash flows or as a measure of liquidity.
