Item 8.01 Other Events.
In connection with a review of its executive compensation practices, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") of DaVita Inc. (the "Company") has determined that it will no longer enter into any new or materially amended agreements with its executives that include any excise tax gross-up provisions with respect to payments contingent upon a change in control. In unusual circumstances where the Compensation Committee believes that accommodations have to be made to recruit a new executive to the Company, limited reimbursement for taxes payable may be included in executives' contracts; but even in those circumstances, the excise tax gross-up provisions will be limited to payments triggered by both a change in control and termination of employment and will be subject to a three-year sunset provision. Executives who were entitled to receive the excise tax gross-up prior to January 1, 2009 will continue to be entitled to the excise tax gross-up.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
