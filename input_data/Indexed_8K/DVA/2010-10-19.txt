On October 1, 2010, DaVita Inc. (the "Company") commenced tender offers to purchase for cash (the "Tender Offers") any and all of its outstanding 6 5/8% Senior Notes due 2013 (the "2013 Notes") and 7 1/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015 (the "2015 Notes" and, together with the 2013 Notes, the "Existing Notes"). Concurrently with the Tender Offers, the Company solicited consents from the holders of the Existing Notes to amend the Existing Notes and related indentures.
On October 15, 2010, the Company announced that it had received consents from the holders of a majority in principal amount of each of the 2013 Notes and the 2015 Notes to amend certain terms of the indenture governing the 2013 Notes and the indenture governing the 2015 Notes. As a result, the Company, certain subsidiary guarantors and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. have entered into supplemental indentures implementing the amendments to the Existing Notes and the related indentures. The amendments have eliminated substantially all of the restrictive covenants and certain events of default from the Existing Notes and the indentures.
The foregoing description of the supplemental indentures is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete terms of the supplemental indentures, copies of which are filed herewith as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.
On October 15, 2010, the Company issued a press release titled "DaVita Inc. Announces Results as of Consent Payment Deadline and Execution of Supplemental Indentures Related to Its 6 5/8% Senior Notes Due 2013 and 7 1/4% Senior Subordinated Notes Due 2015." A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.

The supplemental indentures were executed after receipt of consents from the holders of a majority in principal amount of each series of Notes.
The amendments will eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants and certain events of default from the Notes and the Indentures.
The Consent Solicitations were commenced concurrently with the Company's tender offers to purchase for cash (the "Tender Offers" and, together with the Consent Solicitations, the "Offers") any and all of the Notes. As of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on October 15, 2010 (the "Consent Payment Deadline") $557,572,000 of 2013 Notes and $730,377,000 of 2015 Notes have been tendered pursuant to the Tender Offers.

Forward-Looking Statements
This release contains forward-looking statements, including statements related to anticipated refinancing transactions. Factors which could impact future results include the uncertainties associated with governmental regulations, general economic and other market conditions, competition, accounting estimates, the variability of our cash flows and the risk factors set forth in our SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the first quarter ended March 31, 2010 and the second quarter ended June 30, 2010 and subsequent quarterly reports filed on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements should be considered in light of these risks and uncertainties.
These risks and uncertainties include those relating to: the concentration of profits generated from commercial payor plans; continued downward pressure on average realized payment rates from commercial payors, which may result in the loss of revenue or patients; a reduction in the number of patients under higher-paying commercial plans; a reduction in government payment rates or changes to the structure of payments under the Medicare End Stage Renal Disease program or other government-based programs, including, for example, the implementation of a bundled payment rate system beginning January 2011 which will lower reimbursement for services we provide to Medicare patients, and the impact of health care reform legislation that was enacted in the United States in March 2010; changes in pharmaceutical or anemia management practice patterns, payment policies, or pharmaceutical pricing; our ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors; legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex government regulations; the resolution of ongoing investigations by various federal and state government agencies; continued increased competition from large and medium-sized dialysis providers that compete directly with us; and our ability to complete, integrate and successfully operate any businesses we may acquire.
We base our forward-looking statements on information currently available to us at the time of this release, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise.
