Loans made under the term facility and the revolving facility will bear interest at a rate based on LIBOR (which will, with respect to the term loan B facility, be subject to a floor of 1.50%) plus a margin.

The senior secured credit agreement contains financial and operating covenants. Financial covenants include a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio and a limitation on capital expenditures. Operating covenants include limitations on the Company's ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens on assets, make significant asset dispositions and investments and pay dividends.
All obligations under the senior secured credit agreement are, subject to certain exceptions, guaranteed by each of the Company's domestic subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of the tangible and intangible assets of the Company and such guarantors.

(18) Indebtedness arising under any cash pooling arrangement to the extent that the net value thereof (determined by subtracting the borrowings and other withdrawals therefrom from the amount of cash deposited therein) is positive (for purposes of clarity, it is understood and agreed that, if the net value of any cash pooling arrangement is negative, then any Indebtedness attributable to such negative balance shall not be permitted under this clause (18), but may be Incurred under the Coverage Ratio Exception or any other clause of "Permitted Indebtedness" to the extent permitted thereby); and

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this Section 4.10:
(1) subject to clause (2) below, in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this Section 4.10, the Company, in its sole discretion, will be permitted to classify such item of Indebtedness on the date of Incurrence and may later reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness in any manner that complies with this Section 4.10, and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of such paragraphs (or, in the case of the second paragraph of this Section 4.10, one of the clauses in such second paragraph);
(2) all Indebtedness Incurred or outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities on the Issue Date shall be deemed Incurred under the Senior Credit Facilities on the Issue Date under clause (1) of "Permitted Indebtedness" and not the Coverage Ratio Exception or any of the other clauses under "Permitted Indebtedness";
 
 
(3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit relating to, Indebtedness which is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included as long as Incurred by a Person that could have Incurred such Indebtedness;
(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit are Incurred pursuant to the Senior Credit Facilities and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to the first or second paragraph above and the letters of credit relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;
(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor, will be equal to the greater of its voluntary or involuntary liquidation preference and its maximum fixed repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium);
(6) Indebtedness permitted by this Section 4.10 need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this Section 4.10 permitting such Indebtedness;
(7) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined in accordance with GAAP; and
(8) the principal amount of any Indebtedness outstanding in connection with a Qualified Receivables Transaction is the Receivables Transaction Amount relating to such Qualified Receivables Transaction (which amount shall not include dispositions of self-pay receivables in the ordinary course of business, which the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries believes in good faith cannot be paid in full).
Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness and the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this Section 4.10. The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (i) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and (ii) the principal amount or, in the case of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock, the greater of the voluntary or involuntary liquidation preference and the maximum fixed repurchase price thereof, together with any interest thereon that is more than 30 days past due, in the case of any other Indebtedness.
In addition, the Company will not permit any of its Unrestricted Subsidiaries to Incur any Indebtedness or issue any shares of Disqualified Stock (other than Non-Recourse Debt and other than Indebtedness of a Receivables Subsidiary in respect of a Qualified Receivables Transaction). If on any date an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary outstanding at such time shall be deemed to be Incurred by a
 
Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under this Section 4.10, the Company shall be in default of this Section 4.10).
For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, or, in the case of revolving credit Indebtedness, the date such Indebtedness was first committed; that if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-dominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-dominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 4.10, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur pursuant to this Section 4.10 shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such refinanced Indebtedness and refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. In the event that any other provision (including, without limitation, any other covenant or any defined term) of this Indenture requires the calculation of the principal amount of any Indebtedness, such calculation shall, unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, be made in a manner consistent with the third paragraph, the fourth paragraph and this sixth paragraph of this Section 4.10, .

SECTION 4.11. .
Limitation on Layering
The Company will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, Incur any Indebtedness that is or purports to be by its terms (or by the terms of any agreement governing such Indebtedness) subordinated to any other Indebtedness of the Company or of such Subsidiary Guarantor, as the case may be, unless such Indebtedness is also by its terms (or by the terms of any agreement governing such Indebtedness) made expressly subordinate to the Notes or the Note Guarantee of such Subsidiary Guarantor with respect to the Notes, to the same extent and in the same manner as such Indebtedness is subordinated to such other Indebtedness of the Company or such Subsidiary Guarantor, as the case may be.
For purposes of the foregoing, no Indebtedness will be deemed to be subordinated or junior in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or secured by a junior priority lien or by virtue of the fact that the holders of such Indebtedness have entered into intercreditor agreements or similar arrangements giving one or more of such holders priority over the other holders in the collateral held by them.

provided, however
The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(2) make any loans or advances to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (it being understood that the subordination of loans or advances made to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed a restriction on the ability to make loans or advances); or

SECTION 6.05. .
Control by Majority

(3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit relating to, Indebtedness which is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included as long as Incurred by a Person that could have Incurred such Indebtedness;
(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit are Incurred pursuant to the Senior Credit Facilities and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to the first or second paragraph above and the letters of credit relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;
(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor, will be equal to the greater of its voluntary or involuntary liquidation preference and its maximum fixed repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium);
(6) Indebtedness permitted by this Section 4.10 need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this Section 4.10 permitting such Indebtedness;
(7) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined in accordance with GAAP; and
(8) the principal amount of any Indebtedness outstanding in connection with a Qualified Receivables Transaction is the Receivables Transaction Amount relating to such Qualified Receivables Transaction (which amount shall not include dispositions of self-pay receivables in the ordinary course of business, which the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries believes in good faith cannot be paid in full).
Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness and the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this Section 4.10. The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (i) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and (ii) the principal amount or, in the case of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock, the greater of the voluntary or involuntary liquidation preference and the maximum fixed repurchase price thereof, together with any interest thereon that is more than 30 days past due, in the case of any other Indebtedness.
In addition, the Company will not permit any of its Unrestricted Subsidiaries to Incur any Indebtedness or issue any shares of Disqualified Stock (other than Non-Recourse Debt and other than Indebtedness of a Receivables Subsidiary in respect of a Qualified Receivables Transaction). If on any date an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary outstanding at such time shall be deemed to be Incurred by a
 
Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under this Section 4.10, the Company shall be in default of this Section 4.10).
For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, or, in the case of revolving credit Indebtedness, the date such Indebtedness was first committed; that if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-dominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-dominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 4.10, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur pursuant to this Section 4.10 shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such refinanced Indebtedness and refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. In the event that any other provision (including, without limitation, any other covenant or any defined term) of this Indenture requires the calculation of the principal amount of any Indebtedness, such calculation shall, unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, be made in a manner consistent with the third paragraph, the fourth paragraph and this sixth paragraph of this Section 4.10, .

SECTION 4.11. .
Limitation on Layering
The Company will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, Incur any Indebtedness that is or purports to be by its terms (or by the terms of any agreement governing such Indebtedness) subordinated to any other Indebtedness of the Company or of such Subsidiary Guarantor, as the case may be, unless such Indebtedness is also by its terms (or by the terms of any agreement governing such Indebtedness) made expressly subordinate to the Notes or the Note Guarantee of such Subsidiary Guarantor with respect to the Notes, to the same extent and in the same manner as such Indebtedness is subordinated to such other Indebtedness of the Company or such Subsidiary Guarantor, as the case may be.
For purposes of the foregoing, no Indebtedness will be deemed to be subordinated or junior in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or secured by a junior priority lien or by virtue of the fact that the holders of such Indebtedness have entered into intercreditor agreements or similar arrangements giving one or more of such holders priority over the other holders in the collateral held by them.

(2) make any loans or advances to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (it being understood that the subordination of loans or advances made to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed a restriction on the ability to make loans or advances); or

Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock
The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset Disposition unless:

(5) that Holders electing to have a Note purchased pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer may only elect to have all of such Note purchased and may not elect to have only a portion of such Note purchased;
(6) that Holders electing to have a Note purchased pursuant to any Asset Disposition Offer shall be required to surrender the Note, with the form entitled "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" on the reverse of the Notes completed, or transfer by book-entry transfer, to the Company, a depository, if appointed by the Company, or the Paying Agent at the address specified in the notice at least three days before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date;

Underwriting Agreement
I am the Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of the Company and I am familiar with the proceedings to date with respect to the issuance and sale of the Notes and the issuance of the Guarantees. In this regard, I directly or through attorneys under my direction have examined such records, documents and questions of law, and satisfied myself as to such matters of fact, as I have considered relevant and necessary as a basis for this opinion.
Subject to the foregoing and the other matters set forth herein, it is my opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Notes and the Guarantees have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and the Guarantors, and when the Notes have been duly executed by the Company and authenticated by the Trustee and the Guarantees have been duly executed by the Guarantors, each in accordance with the provisions of the applicable Indenture, and delivered against payment therefor pursuant to the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, the Notes will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms and the Guarantees will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Guarantors, enforceable against the Guarantors in accordance with their terms.
With respect to enforcement, the above opinion is qualified to the extent enforcement of the Indentures, the Notes and the Guarantees may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting enforcement of creditors' rights or by general equity principles.
I have assumed (a) that the Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees (collectively, the "") have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the parties thereto other than the Company and the Guarantors, (b) that the Documents constitute legally valid and binding obligations of the parties thereto other than the Company and the Guarantors, enforceable against each of them in accordance with their respective terms, and (c) that the status of the Documents as legally valid and binding obligations of the parties is not affected by any (i) breaches of, or defaults under, agreements or instruments, (ii) violations of statutes, rules, regulations or court or governmental orders, or (iii) failures to obtain required consents, approvals or authorizations from, or make required registrations, declarations or filings with, governmental authorities.
Documents
For the purposes of this opinion, I have assumed that there will be no changes in the laws currently applicable to the Company or the Guarantors and the validity, legally binding character or enforceability of the Notes and the Guarantees, and that such laws will be the only laws applicable to the Company, the Guarantors, the Notes and the Guarantees. I have further assumed that neither the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the Company nor any of the equivalent organizational documents of any Guarantor will have been materially modified or amended.
I do not find it necessary for the purposes of this opinion to cover, and accordingly I express no opinion as to, the application of the securities or blue sky laws of the various states to the issuance or sales of the Notes and the issuance of the Guarantees.
This opinion is limited to the Act, the laws of the State of Ohio (for the specific purposes set forth below) and the Delaware General Corporation Law. I note that the Indentures, the Notes and the Guarantees are expressly governed by the laws of the State of New York and, for the purposes of rendering the opinion set forth above, I have assumed that the applicable substantive laws of the State of Ohio are substantially similar to those of the State of New York. I express no opinion and make no representation as to the appropriateness of such assumption.
I hereby consent to the filing of this opinion letter as an exhibit to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K dated October 20, 2010 and to all references to me included in or made a part of the Registration Statement. In giving such consent, I do not thereby admit that I am within the category of persons whose consent is required by Section 7 of the Act or the rules or regulations promulgated thereunder.

Each Pledgor acknowledges that any such private sales may be at prices and on terms less favorable to the Collateral Agent than those obtainable through a public sale without such restrictions (including a public offering made pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act), and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees that any such private sale shall not be deemed to have not been made in a commercially reasonable manner solely because it was conducted as a private sale, and that the Collateral Agent shall have no obligation to engage in public sales and no obligation to delay the sale of any Securities Collateral or Investment Property for the period of time necessary to permit the issuer thereof to register it for a form of public sale requiring registration under the Securities Act or under applicable state securities laws, even if such issuer would agree to do so.
Securities Act
 
 
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Pledgor shall, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, at the reasonable request of the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Collateral Agent, cause any registration, qualification statement or application under or compliance with any Federal or state securities law or laws to be prepared and filed with respect to all or any part of the Securities Collateral as soon as practicable and at the sole cost and expense of the Pledgors. Each Pledgor will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration to be effected (and be kept effective) and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such qualification and compliance to be effected (and be kept effective) as may be so requested and as would permit or facilitate the sale and distribution of such Securities Collateral including registration under the Securities Act (or any similar statute then in effect), appropriate qualifications under applicable blue sky or other state securities laws and appropriate compliance with all other requirements of any Governmental Authority. Each Pledgor shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Collateral Agent to be kept advised in writing as to the progress of each such registration, qualification or compliance and as to the completion thereof, shall furnish to the Collateral Agent such number of prospectuses, offering circulars or other documents incident thereto as the Collateral Agent from time to time may request, and shall indemnify and shall cause the issuer of the Securities Collateral to indemnify the Collateral Agent and all others participating in the distribution of such Securities Collateral against all claims, losses, damages and liabilities caused by any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained therein (or in any related registration statement, notification or the like) or by any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein (or in any related registration statement, notification or the like) a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading other than any such statement or omission made in reliance on, and in conformity with, written information provided to such Pledgor by Collateral Agent or any other participant in the distribution for inclusion therein.
(d) If the Collateral Agent determines to exercise its right to sell any or all of the Securities Collateral or Investment Property, upon written request, the applicable Pledgor shall from time to time furnish to the Collateral Agent all such information as the Collateral Agent may request in order to determine the number of securities included in the Securities Collateral or Investment Property which may be sold by the Collateral Agent as exempt transactions under the Securities Act and the rules of the SEC thereunder, as the same are from time to time in effect.
(e) Each Pledgor further agrees that a breach of any of the covenants contained in this will cause irreparable injury to the Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties, that the Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties have no adequate remedy at law in respect of such breach and, as a consequence, that each and every covenant contained in this shall be specifically enforceable against such Pledgor, and such Pledgor hereby waives and agrees not to assert any defenses against an action for specific performance of such covenants except for a defense that no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.

Within five (5) Business Days of written notice thereafter from the Collateral Agent, each Pledgor shall make available to the Collateral Agent, to the extent within such Pledgor's power and authority, such personnel in such Pledgor's employ on the date of the Event of Default as the Collateral Agent may reasonably designate to permit such Pledgor to continue, directly or indirectly, to produce, advertise and sell the products and services sold by such Pledgor under the registered Patents, Trademarks and/or Copyrights, and such persons shall be available to perform their prior functions on the Collateral Agent's behalf.
