This release contains forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements related to our 2011 and 2012 operating income, our 2011 operating cash flows and our 2011 expected effective tax rate attributable to DaVita Inc. Factors that could impact future results include the uncertainties associated with governmental regulations, general economic and other market conditions, competition, accounting estimates, the variability of our cash flows and the risk factors set forth in our SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, and subsequent quarterly reports to be filed on Form 10-Q.

We base our forward-looking statements on information currently available to us at the time of this release, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise.
This release contains non-GAAP financial measures. For reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, see the attached reconciliation schedules. For the reasons stated in the reconciliation schedules, we believe our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information for investors.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Note 1: Calculation of the Leverage Ratio
Under the Company's Senior Secured Credit Facilities (Credit Agreement), the leverage ratio is defined as all funded debt plus the face amount of all letters of credit issued, minus cash and cash equivalents, divided by "Consolidated EBITDA". The leverage ratio determines the interest rate margin payable by the Company for its Term Loan A and revolving line of credit under the Credit Agreement by establishing the margin over the base interest rate (LIBOR) that is applicable. The following leverage ratio was calculated using "Consolidated EBITDA" as defined in the Credit Agreement. The calculation below is based on the last twelve months of "Consolidated EBITDA", pro forma for routine acquisitions that occurred during the period. The Company's management believes the presentation of "Consolidated EBITDA" is useful to investors to enhance their understanding of the Company's leverage ratio under its Credit Agreement.
 
In accordance with the Credit Agreement, the Company's leverage ratio cannot exceed 4.25 to 1.0 as of March 31, 2011. At that date the Company's leverage ratio did not exceed 4.25 to 1.0.
1. Net income attributable to DaVita Inc. excluding after-tax debt refinancing and redemption charges and diluted earnings per share attributable to DaVita Inc. excluding after-tax debt refinancing and redemption charges.
We believe that net income attributable to DaVita Inc. excluding after-tax debt refinancing and redemption charges and diluted earnings per share attributable to DaVita Inc. excluding after-tax debt refinancing and redemption charges enhances a user's understanding of our normal net income attributable to DaVita Inc. and diluted earnings per share attributable to DaVita Inc. for these periods by providing a measure that is more meaningful because it excludes charges that resulted from the refinancing of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the redemption of the aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 6

% senior notes due 2013 and the aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 7

% senior subordinated notes 2015 and accordingly, is more comparable to prior periods and indicative of consistent net income attributable to DaVita Inc. and diluted earnings per share attributable to DaVita Inc. These measures are not measures of financial performance under United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to DaVita Inc. and diluted earnings per share attributable to DaVita Inc.
Net income attributable to DaVita Inc. excluding after-tax debt refinancing and redemption charges:
 
Diluted earnings per share attributable to DaVita Inc. excluding after-tax debt refinancing and redemption charges:
 
2. Effective Income Tax Rates
We believe that reporting the effective income tax rate attributable to DaVita Inc. enhances an investor's understanding of DaVita's effective income tax rate for the periods presented because it excludes noncontrolling owners' income that primarily relates to non-tax paying entities and accordingly is more comparable to prior periods presentations regarding DaVita's effective income tax rate and is more meaningful to an investor to fully understand the related income tax effects on DaVita Inc.'s operating results. This is not a measure under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to the effective income tax rate calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Effective income tax rate as compared to the effective income tax rate attributable to DaVita Inc. is as follows:
 
 
3. Free cash flow
Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less income distributions to noncontrolling interests and capital expenditures for routine maintenance and information technology. We believe free cash flow is a useful adjunct to cash flow from operating activities and other measurements under GAAP, since free cash flow is a meaningful measure of our ability to fund acquisition and development activities and meet our debt service requirements. In addition, free cash flow excluding income distributions to noncontrolling interests provides an investor with an understanding of free cash flows that are attributable to DaVita Inc. Free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, as an indicator of cash flows or as a measure of liquidity.
