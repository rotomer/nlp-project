Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.
The Company announced today that the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Colorado has opened a grand jury investigation that encompasses certain activities of the Company. The Company understands that the investigation is at a very preliminary stage, and while its precise scope is unclear, it appears to overlap, at least in part, with the Eastern District of Missouri and OIG Dallas matters previously disclosed by the Company. The Company intends to cooperate with the investigation.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
