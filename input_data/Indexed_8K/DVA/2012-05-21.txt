Reconciliations for Non-GAAP measures
Reconciliation for Non-GAAP measures
(unaudited)
Reconciliation of HealthCare Partners' Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization and excluding stock-based compensation expense)
We believe that adjusted EBITDA enhances a user's understanding of HealthCare Partners' income from operations for these
periods by presenting consistent operating income items that we believe provide another means of understanding HealthCare
Partners' operating performance excluding stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA also serves as a measure
of liquidity of HealthCare Partners in that it provides information about the ability of HealthCare Partners to generate cash
from operations. This measure is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an
alternative to operating income, net income or operating cash flow.
