Outlook
We are raising our operating income guidance for 2012 to now be in the range of $1,275 million to $1,325 million. Our previous operating income guidance for 2012 was in the range of $1,230 million to $1,310 million. These projections exclude any operating results associated with the proposed acquisition of HealthCare Partners as well as the legal proceeding contingency accrual and related expenses of $78 million. We also still expect our operating cash flows for 2012 to be in the range of $950 million to $1,050 million. These projections and the underlying assumptions involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those described below, and actual results may vary significantly from these current projections.
We will be holding a conference call to discuss our results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2012 on August 1, 2012 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time. The dial in number is (800) 399-4406. A replay of the conference call will be available on DaVita's official web page, , for the following 30 days.

This release contains forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements related to our guidance and expectations for our 2012 operating income, our 2012 operating cash flows and our 2012 effective tax rate attributable to DaVita Inc., the anticipated timing and closing of the HCP transaction and expected timing and impact of the Settlement. Factors that could impact future results include the uncertainties associated with governmental regulations, general economic and other market conditions, competition, accounting estimates, the variability of our cash flows and the risk factors set forth in our SEC filings, including our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 and subsequent quarterly reports to be filed on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements should be considered in light of these risks and uncertainties.
These risks and uncertainties include those relating to:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We base our forward-looking statements on information currently available to us at the time of this release, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise.
This release contains non-GAAP financial measures. For reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, see the attached reconciliation schedules. For the reasons stated in the reconciliation schedules, we believe our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information for investors.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Note 1: Calculation of the Leverage Ratio
Under the Company's Senior Secured Credit Facilities (Credit Agreement), the leverage ratio is defined as all funded debt plus the face amount of all letters of credit issued, minus cash and cash equivalents, divided by "Consolidated EBITDA". The leverage ratio determines the interest rate margin payable by the Company for its Term Loan A and revolving line of credit under the Credit Agreement by establishing the margin over the base interest rate (LIBOR) that is applicable. The following leverage ratio was calculated using "Consolidated EBITDA" as defined in the Credit Agreement. The calculation below is based on the last twelve months of "Consolidated EBITDA", pro forma for routine acquisitions that occurred during the period. The Company's management believes the presentation of "Consolidated EBITDA" is useful to investors to enhance their understanding of the Company's leverage ratio under its Credit Agreement.
 
In accordance with the Credit Agreement, the Company's leverage ratio cannot exceed 4.25 to 1.0 as of June 30, 2012. At that date the Company's leverage ratio did not exceed 4.25 to 1.0.
 
1. Net income attributable to DaVita Inc. excluding an after-tax legal proceeding contingency accrual and related expenses and an after-tax non-cash goodwill impairment charge and diluted earnings per share attributable to DaVita Inc. excluding an after-tax legal proceeding contingency accrual and related expenses and an after-tax non-cash goodwill impairment charge.
We believe that net income attributable to DaVita Inc. excluding an after-tax legal proceeding contingency accrual and related expenses and an after-tax non-cash goodwill impairment charge enhances a user's understanding of our normal net income attributable to DaVita Inc. and diluted earnings per share attributable to DaVita Inc. for these periods by providing a measure that is meaningful because it excludes an unusual charge for a legal proceeding contingency accrual that resulted from an agreement we reached in principle to settle federal program claims relating to our historical Epogen practices and also excludes a non-cash goodwill impairment charge that resulted from a decrease in the implied fair value of goodwill below its carrying amount associated with our infusion therapy business during the second quarter of 2011 and accordingly, is more comparable to prior periods and indicative of consistent net income attributable to DaVita Inc. and diluted earnings per share to DaVita Inc. These measures are not measures of financial performance under United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to DaVita Inc., and diluted earnings per share attributable to DaVita Inc.
Net income attributable to DaVita Inc. excluding an after-tax legal proceeding contingency accrual and related expenses and an after-tax non-cash goodwill impairment charge:
 
Diluted earnings per share attributable to DaVita Inc. excluding an after-tax legal proceeding contingency accrual and related expenses and an after-tax non-cash goodwill impairment charge:
 
 
2. Operating income excluding a pre-tax legal proceeding contingency accrual and related expenses and a pre-tax non-cash goodwill impairment charge.
We believe that operating income excluding a pre-tax legal proceeding contingency accrual and related expenses and a pre-tax non-cash goodwill impairment charge enhances a user's understanding of our normal operating income for these periods by providing a measure that is meaningful because it excludes an unusual charge for a legal proceeding contingency accrual that resulted from an agreement we reached in principle to settle federal program claims relating to our historical Epogen practices and also excludes a non-cash goodwill impairment charge that resulted from a decrease in the implied fair value of goodwill below its carrying amount associated with our infusion therapy business during the second quarter of 2011 and accordingly, is more comparable to prior periods and indicative of consistent operating income. This measure is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income.
Operating income excluding a pre-tax legal proceeding contingency accrual and related expenses and a pre-tax non-cash goodwill impairment charge:
 
 
3. Effective Income Tax Rates
We believe that reporting the effective income tax rate attributable to DaVita Inc. enhances an investor's understanding of DaVita's effective income tax rate for the periods presented because it excludes noncontrolling owners' income that primarily relates to non-tax paying entities and accordingly is more comparable to prior periods presentations regarding DaVita's effective income tax rate and is meaningful to an investor to fully understand the related income tax effects on DaVita Inc.'s operating results. This is not a measure under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to the effective income tax rate calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Effective income tax rate as compared to the effective income tax rate attributable to DaVita Inc. is as follows:
 
 
 
4. Free cash flow
Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less income distributions to noncontrolling interests and capital expenditures for routine maintenance and information technology. We believe free cash flow is a useful adjunct to cash flow from operating activities and other measurements under GAAP, since free cash flow is a meaningful measure of our ability to fund acquisition and development activities and meet our debt service requirements. In addition, free cash flow excluding income distributions to noncontrolling interests provides an investor with an understanding of free cash flows that are attributable to DaVita Inc. Free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, as an indicator of cash flows or as a measure of liquidity.
