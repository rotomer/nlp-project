Item 8.01. Other Events.
On August 7, 2012, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado against certain current and former directors and executives of DaVita Inc. (the "Company") and against the Company, as nominal defendant. The complaint alleges, among other things, that certain of the Company's current and past officers and directors breached fiduciary duties to the Company relating to the Company's previously disclosed agreement in principal to settle all allegations relating to claims arising out of the litigation filed in 2002 in the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Texas and other previously disclosed inquiries by the federal government and proceedings. Neither the Company nor the individual defendants have been served in this lawsuit.
