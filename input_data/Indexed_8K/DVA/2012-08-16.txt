Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have provided the indemnifying party with the proposed terms of settlement and shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by Section 8 hereof, the indemnifying party agrees that such party shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement or notified the indemnified party that it in good faith disputes whether it is obligated to indemnify the indemnified party with respect to such settlement or the fees and expenses of counsel. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment if any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or
Settlements.  
 
consent (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
SECTION 9.  .
Contribution
(a)          If the indemnification provided for in Section 8 is for any reason unavailable to an or otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party, as incurred, as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions or inaccuracies in the representations and warranties herein which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Securities, pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Guarantors, and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the front cover page of the Prospectus bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Notes as set forth on such cover. The relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact or any such inaccurate or alleged inaccurate representation or warranty relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, or the Underwriters, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
Contribution.
The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8(c), any legal or other fees or disbursements reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim.
The Company, the Guarantors and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 9. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting discount received by such Underwriter in connection with the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several, and not joint, in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments as set forth opposite their names in . For purposes of this Section 9, each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the
pro
rata
Schedule A
 
Company and/or a Guarantor, each officer of the Company and/or a Guarantor who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company and/or a Guarantor within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company and the respective Guarantors, as the case may be.
SECTION 10.  .
Default of One or More of the Several Underwriters
(a)        If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the several Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase the Notes that it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate principal amount of Notes which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated, severally, in the proportions that the principal amount of Notes to be purchased set forth opposite their respective names on bears to the aggregate principal amount of Notes set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as may be specified by the Representative with the consent of the non-defaulting Underwriters, to purchase the Notes which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date. If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase the Notes and the aggregate principal amount of Notes with respect to which such default occurs exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representative and the Company for the purchase of such Notes are not made within 48 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability of any party to any other party except that the provisions of Section 5, Section 7, Section 8, Section 9, Section 13 and Section 17 shall at all times be effective and shall survive such termination. In any such case either the Representative or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days in order that the required changes, if any, to the Registration Statement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or any other documents or arrangements may be effected. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" shall be deemed to include any person substituted for a defaulting Underwriter under this Section 10. Any action taken under this Section 10 shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
Schedule A
SECTION 11.  .
Termination of this Agreement
(a)        Prior to the Closing Date this Agreement may be terminated by the Representative by notice given to the Company if at any time (i) trading or quotation in any of the Company's securities shall have been suspended or limited by the Commission or by the New York Stock Exchange, or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited, or minimum or maximum prices shall have been generally established on any of such stock exchanges by the Commission or FINRA; (ii) a general banking moratorium shall have been declared by federal or New York authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States has occurred; (iii) in the judgment of the Representative there shall have occurred any Material Adverse Change; or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of national or international hostilities or any crisis or calamity, or any change in the United States or international financial markets, or any substantial change or development involving a prospective substantial change in United States' or international political, financial or economic conditions, as in the judgment of the Representative is material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to market the Securities in the manner and on the terms described in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or to enforce contracts for the sale of securities. Any termination pursuant to this Section 11 shall be without liability on the part of (a) the Company or any DaVita Guarantor to any Underwriter, except that the Company and the DaVita Guarantors shall be, jointly and severally, obligated to reimburse the expenses of the Representative and the Underwriters pursuant to Sections 5 and 7 hereof or (b) any Underwriter to the Company, except, in each case, as provided under Sections 8 and 9 hereof.
 
SECTION 12.  .
No Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility
(a)        The Company and each Guarantor acknowledge and agree that: (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement, including the determination of the public offering price of the Securities and any related discounts and commissions, is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company and such Guarantor, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other hand, and the Company and such Guarantor are capable of evaluating and understanding and understand and accept the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) in connection with each transaction contemplated hereby and the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is and has been acting solely as a principal and is not the financial advisor, agent or fiduciary of the Company, the Guarantors or any of their respective affiliates, stockholders, creditors or employees or any other party; (iii) no Underwriter has assumed or will assume an advisory, agency or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company or such Guarantor with respect to any of the transactions contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company or such Guarantor on other matters) and no Underwriter has any obligation to the Company or such Guarantor with respect to the offering contemplated hereby except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement; (iv) the several Underwriters and their respective affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Company and the Guarantors and that the several Underwriters have no obligation to disclose any of such interests by virtue of any advisory, agency or fiduciary relationship; and (v) the Underwriters have not provided any legal, accounting, regulatory or tax advice with respect to the offering contemplated hereby and the Company and the Guarantors have consulted their own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent they deemed appropriate.
This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company, the Guarantors and the several Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. The Company and each Guarantor hereby waive and release, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims that the Company or such Guarantor may have against the several Underwriters with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty.
SECTION 13.  .  The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company, of its officers and of the several Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any (A) investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, the officers or employees of any Underwriter, or any person controlling the Underwriter or (B) acceptance of the Securities and payment for them hereunder. The provisions of Section 5, Section 7, Section 8, Section 9, this Section 13 and Section 17 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.

Forward-Looking Statements
This release contains forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements related to the offering, the HCP Transaction and the anticipated uses of proceeds of the offering. Factors which could impact future results include the uncertainties associated with governmental regulations, general economic and other market conditions, competition, accounting estimates, the variability of our cash flows and the risk factors set forth in our SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the first quarter ended March 31, 2012 and the second quarter ended June 30, 2012 and subsequent quarterly reports filed on Form 10-Q and the registration statement filed on Form S-3 and the related Prospectus Supplement filed in connection with the offering of the Senior Notes. The forward-looking statements should be considered in light of these risks and uncertainties.
These risks and uncertainties include those relating to: the concentration of profits generated from commercial payor plans; continued downward pressure on average realized payment rates from commercial payors, which may result in the loss of revenue or patients; a reduction in the number of patients under higher-paying commercial plans; a reduction in government payment rates under the Medicare End Stage Renal Disease program or other government-based programs; the impact of health care reform legislation that was enacted in the U.S. in March 2010; changes in pharmaceutical or anemia management practice patterns, payment policies, or pharmaceutical pricing; our ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors; legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex government regulations; current or potential investigations by various governmental entities and related government or private-party proceedings; the impact of our agreement in principle to settle all allegations relating to claims arising out of the previously disclosed litigation filed in 2002 in the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Texas to resolve the federal program claims regarding EPO relating to historical EPO practices dating back to 1997; continued increased competition from large and medium-sized dialysis providers that compete directly with us; the emergence of new models of care introduced by the government or private sector, such as accountable care organizations, independent practice association and integrated delivery systems, and changing affiliation models for physicians, such as employment by hospitals, that may erode our patient base and reimbursement rates; our ability to complete any acquisitions, mergers or dispositions that we might be considering or announce, including the HCP Transaction, or integrate and successfully operate any business we may acquire; expansion of our operations and services to markets outside the U.S., or to businesses outside of dialysis.
 
We base our forward-looking statements on information currently available to us at the time of this release, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise.
