For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this Section 4.10:

(2) all Indebtedness Incurred or outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities on October 20, 2010 shall be deemed Incurred under the Senior Credit Facilities on October 20, 2010 under clause (1) of "Permitted Indebtedness" and not the Coverage Ratio Exception or any of the other clauses under "Permitted Indebtedness";
(3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit relating to, Indebtedness which is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included as long as Incurred by a Person that could have Incurred such Indebtedness;
(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit are Incurred pursuant to the Senior Credit Facilities and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to the first or second paragraph above and the letters of credit relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;
(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor, will be equal to the greater of its voluntary or involuntary liquidation preference and its maximum fixed repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium);
(6) Indebtedness permitted by this Section 4.10 need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this Section 4.10 permitting such Indebtedness;
(7) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined in accordance with GAAP; and
(8) the principal amount of any Indebtedness outstanding in connection with a Qualified Receivables Transaction is the Receivables Transaction Amount relating to such Qualified Receivables Transaction (which amount shall not include dispositions of self-pay receivables in the ordinary course of business, which the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries believes in good faith cannot be paid in full).
Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness and the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this Section 4.10.

In addition, the Company will not permit any of its Unrestricted Subsidiaries to Incur any Indebtedness or issue any shares of Disqualified Stock (other than Non-Recourse Debt and other than Indebtedness of a Receivables Subsidiary in respect of a Qualified Receivables Transaction). If on any date an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary outstanding at such time shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under this Section 4.10, the Company shall be in default of this Section 4.10).
 
For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, or, in the case of revolving credit Indebtedness, the date such Indebtedness was first committed; that if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-dominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-dominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 4.10, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur pursuant to this Section 4.10 shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such refinanced Indebtedness and refinancing Indebtedness are denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. In the event that any other provision (including, without limitation, any other covenant or any defined term) of this Indenture requires the calculation of the principal amount of any Indebtedness, such calculation shall, unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, be made in a manner consistent with the third paragraph, the fourth paragraph and this sixth paragraph of this Section 4.10, .

SECTION 4.11.    .
Limitation on Layering
The Company will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, Incur any Indebtedness that is or purports to be by its terms (or by the terms of any agreement governing such Indebtedness) subordinated to any other Indebtedness of the Company or of such Subsidiary Guarantor, as the case may be, unless such Indebtedness is also by its terms (or by the terms of any agreement governing such Indebtedness) made expressly subordinate to the Notes or the Note Guarantee of such Subsidiary Guarantor with respect to the Notes, to the same extent and in the same manner as such Indebtedness is subordinated to such other Indebtedness of the Company or such Subsidiary Guarantor, as the case may be.
For purposes of the foregoing, no Indebtedness will be deemed to be subordinated or junior in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or secured by a junior priority Lien or by virtue of the fact that the holders of such Indebtedness have entered into intercreditor agreements or similar arrangements giving one or more of such holders priority over the other holders in the collateral held by them.
SECTION 4.12.    .
Limitation on Restricted Payments

(3) purchase, repurchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value, prior to scheduled maturity, scheduled repayment or scheduled sinking fund payment, any Subordinated Obligations or Guarantor Subordinated Obligations (other than (x) such Subordinated Obligations or Guarantor Subordinated Obligations purchased in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in each case due within one year of the date of purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement and (y) such Subordinated Obligations or Guarantor Subordinated Obligations held by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary); or

which amount in each case under this clause (iv) was included in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments; , that no amount will be included under clause (iv)(A) of this paragraph to the extent it is already included in Consolidated Net Income.
provided, however
The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

provided
(4) so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, repurchases by the Company of Common Stock of the Company from officers, directors and employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their authorized representatives upon the death, disability or termination of employment of such employees or termination of their seat on the board of the Company, in an aggregate amount not to exceed $15.0 million in any calendar year;
