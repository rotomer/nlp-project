EXHIBIT 99 [DEVON ENERGY LETTERHEAD] NEWS RELEASE - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Investor contact: Zack Hager (405) 552-4526 Media contact: Brian Engel (405) 228-7750 DEVON ENERGY REPORTS RECORD 2002 OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION AND REVENUES; 278% RESERVE REPLACEMENT AT $7.18 PER BARREL OKLAHOMA CITY (February 6, 2003) - Devon Energy Corporation (AMEX: DVN, TSE: NSX) today reported record high oil and gas production and revenues for 2002. Devon also reported that reserve additions replaced 278 percent of its 2002 production of oil, gas and natural gas liquids at a cost of $7.18 per equivalent barrel. For the full year 2002, Devon reported net earnings of $104 million, or 61 cents per common share (61 cents per diluted common share). This compares to 2001 net earnings of $103 million, or 73 cents per common share (72 cents per diluted common share). For the fourth quarter of 2002, Devon reported net earnings of $84 million, or 52 cents per common share (52 cents per diluted common share). This compares to a net loss for the fourth quarter of 2001 of $518 million, or $4.13 per common share ($4.13 per diluted common share). NET EARNINGS EXCLUDING SPECIAL ITEMS For the full year 2002, Devon reported net earnings, excluding special items, of $549 million, or $3.49 per common share ($3.41 per diluted common share). For 2001, net earnings, excluding special items, were $660 million, or $5.09 per common share ($4.92 per diluted common share). For the fourth quarter of 2002, Devon reported net earnings, excluding special items, of $232 million, or $1.47 per common share ($1.42 per diluted common share). For the fourth quarter of 2001, net earnings, excluding special items, were $37 million, or 27 cents per common share (27 cents per diluted common share).
OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION UP 50 PERCENT Combined production of oil, gas and natural gas liquids climbed to 188 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe) in 2002. This is the highest production in Devon's history and 50 percent greater than the 126 MMBoe produced in 2001. The increase was driven by Devon's acquisitions of Anderson Exploration in October 2001 and Mitchell Energy in January 2002. Sales of oil, gas and natural gas liquids increased 19 percent to $3.3 billion in the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to 2001. The increase in sales was due to higher oil and gas production, partially offset by lower natural gas prices. The average price received for Devon's 2002 natural gas production decreased 27 percent to $2.80 per thousand cubic feet in 2002 from $3.84 per thousand cubic feet in 2001. The average price received for 2002 oil production increased one percent to $21.71 per barrel from $21.41 per barrel in 2001. The average price received for natural gas liquids was $14.05 per barrel in 2002, or 17 percent less than the $16.99 per barrel received in 2001. MIDSTREAM MARGINS SOAR WITH ACQUISITIONS With the Mitchell acquisition, Devon significantly expanded its midstream business, primarily gas transportation and processing. Marketing and midstream revenue increased to $999 million in 2002 from $71 million in 2001. Related marketing and midstream costs were $808 million in 2002 compared to $47 million a year ago. This resulted in a $191 million contribution to Devon's operating margins in 2002, a 696 percent increase over 2001. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS In 2002, Devon continued to focus its oil and gas operations outside North America by divesting all of its assets in Indonesia and Argentina. In addition, Devon entered into an agreement in December 2002 to sell its operations in Egypt. This transaction was completed during January 2003. In accordance with Statement of Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Devon was required to reclassify the assets, liabilities and results of its operations in these countries as discontinued operations for all accounting periods presented. Although both revenues and expenses for prior periods were reclassified, there was no impact upon previously reported net earnings. Included with the financial information that follows is a table of revenues, expenses and production categories and the amounts reclassified for each period presented. EXPENSES TRACK EXPANDED OPERATIONS Devon expanded its North American operations significantly with its acquisitions of Anderson and Mitchell. Accordingly, expenses in nearly every category increased in 2002. Lease operating expenses and transportation costs increased 41 percent from $550 million in 2001 to $775 million in 2002. However, on a unit of production basis, these expenses decreased from $4.37 per barrel of oil equivalent (Boe) in 2001 to $4.12 per Boe during 2002. This is a result of acquiring properties with lower unit operating costs and divesting some higher cost properties. 2
General and administrative expense increased 92 percent to $219 million in 2002. The increase includes a $13 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2002 for abandonment of office space resulting from the merger with Santa Fe Snyder during 2000. Also in the fourth quarter of 2002, Devon recorded a $3 million charge resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions concerning liabilities for post-employment benefits. Interest expense increased 142 percent to $533 million in 2002. The increase results from additional indebtedness undertaken to fund the cash portions of the Anderson and Mitchell acquisitions. Devon recorded $23 million of current income tax expense and $216 million of deferred income tax benefit in 2002 relating to continuing operations. This resulted in a total income tax benefit of $193 million or 144 percent of pre-tax loss. Excluding the tax effects of special items and property sales, income tax expense for the full year 2002 was $158 million. This is made up of current tax benefit of $16 million and deferred tax expense of $174 million. In the fourth quarter of 2002, Devon recorded current income tax benefit of $99 million and deferred tax expense of $78 million relating to continuing operations. This resulted in a total income tax benefit of $21 million or 28 percent of pre-tax earnings. Income tax expense for the fourth quarter of 2002, excluding the tax effects of special items and property sales, was $60 million. This is made up of a current tax benefit of $45 million and deferred tax expense of $105 million. RESERVE REPLACEMENT AND FINDING COSTS Devon's estimated proved oil and gas reserves at December 31, 2002, were 1,609 MMBoe compared to 1,472 MMBoe at December 31, 2001. Devon acquired 405 MMBoe in 2002, primarily through the Mitchell acquisition. The company added 142 MMboe through drilling (extensions and discoveries) and produced 188 MMboe. Revisions of prior estimates reduced reserves by 23 MMBoe. The majority of the revisions were due to higher oil and gas prices. Under international production sharing agreements, higher prices generally result in an earlier back-in by the government. This reduces the reserves retained by the producer. Price declines in the future could reverse this result. Total costs incurred in oil and gas property acquisition and exploration and development activities were $3.8 billion in 2002. This results in finding and development costs of $7.18 per Boe. Costs incurred for exploration and development activities included an estimated $480 million for the development of reserves classified as proved undeveloped at year-end 2001. Accordingly, Devon increased proved developed reserves to 73 percent of total proved reserves at year-end 2002. Estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2002, include 444 million barrels of oil, 5.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 192 million barrels of natural gas liquids. These proved reserves had an estimated pre-tax present value discounted at 10 percent of $15 billion. This compares to an estimated pre-tax present value of $7 billion as of December 31, 2001. The increase reflects larger reserve volumes and higher oil and gas prices at December 31, 2002. 3
RECONCILIATION OF SPECIAL ITEMS The following reconciliation lists special items for each of the periods reported. The reconciliation also includes the after-tax effects of each special item and the aggregate effect per diluted common share. Amortization of goodwill - Effective January 1, 2002, Devon adopted SFAS No. 142, under which goodwill is no longer amortized. In 2001, prior to adoption of SFAS No. 142, the company recorded a $34 million pre-tax expense ($34 million after tax) for amortization of goodwill. Abandonment of office space - In the fourth quarter of 2002, Devon recorded a $13 million pre-tax ($8 million after tax) charge for office rent expense. The charge relates to Devon's exit from office space previously occupied under a lease obligation assumed in the merger with Santa Fe Snyder in 2000. Expenses related to merger - In 2001, the company incurred severance costs of $1 million pre-tax ($1 million after tax). These costs relate to employees of Devon that were terminated in conjunction with the Anderson merger. 4
Reduction in carrying value of oil and gas properties - Devon recorded non-cash, full cost ceiling adjustments in the second quarter of 2002 and the fourth quarter of 2001 of $651 million pre-tax ($371 million after tax) and $892 million pre-tax ($542 million after tax), respectively. These charges resulted from application of the ceiling test as prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission for companies that follow the full cost method of accounting. Due to the volatility in oil and gas prices, it is possible that Devon will incur further reductions to the carrying value of its oil and gas properties in future periods. In the second and third quarters of 2001, Devon recorded pre-tax charges of $87 million ($69 million after tax) associated with Devon's decision to discontinue operations in Thailand, Malaysia, Qatar and Brazil. Foreign exchange effect - In 2002, the company recorded a $1 million pre-tax (zero after tax) gain attributable to changes in foreign currency-to-U.S. dollar exchange rates. In 2001, the company recorded an $11 million pre-tax ($8 million after tax) charge attributable to currency fluctuations. Devon will recognize either income or expense in future periods related to further fluctuations in foreign currency rates. Change in fair value of derivatives - Devon adopted SFAS No. 133 in 2001. SFAS No. 133 established new accounting procedures for derivative instruments. This resulted in pre-tax income in 2002 of $28 million ($17 million after tax). In 2001, the company recorded pre-tax expense of $2 million ($1 million after tax) attributable to derivative values. Impairment of ChevronTexaco common stock - In the fourth quarter of 2002, the company recorded a $205 million non-cash pre-tax charge ($128 million after tax) attributable to a decline in the value of 7.1 million ChevronTexaco common shares owned by Devon. Devon acquired these shares in its August 1999 acquisition of PennzEnergy Company. The shares are held for possible exchange for $760 million of exchangeable debentures also assumed by Devon in the PennzEnergy acquisition. The company initially recorded the shares at their market value at the closing date of the acquisition, which was $95.38 per share. Since then, the value of the shares on Devon's balance sheet has been adjusted to the applicable market value. Through September 30, 2002, any decreases in the value of the ChevronTexaco common shares were determined by Devon to be temporary, as defined by accounting rules. Therefore, the change in value was recorded directly to stockholders' equity and was not recorded in Devon's results of operations. Beginning in July 2002, the market value of ChevronTexaco common stock began what has ultimately become a significant decline. As a result of the continuation of the decline during the fourth quarter of 2002, Devon determined that the decline is other than temporary, as defined by accounting rules. The determination that a decline in value of the ChevronTexaco shares is temporary or other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors. Depending on the future performance of ChevronTexaco's common stock, Devon may be required to record additional non-cash charges in future periods. 5
Results of discontinued operations - In January 2003, Devon sold its Egyptian operations. The company recognized a $10 million pre-tax loss ($11 million after tax) in the fourth quarter of 2002 on the transaction including the effects of operations during the quarter. During 2002, Devon discontinued its Indonesian, Argentine and Egyptian operations. The company recognized a $31 million pre-tax gain ($31 million after tax) during 2002 on these discontinued operations. Additionally, the company recognized $23 million of pre-tax income ($14 million after tax) from operations prior to discontinuing these operations. During 2001, Devon recognized an $18 million pre-tax loss ($18 million after tax) and $56 million of pre-tax income ($31 million after tax) from operations in the fourth quarter and for the year, respectively, for these discontinued operations. Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle - Devon adopted SFAS No. 133 concerning accounting for derivative instruments on January 1, 2001. This resulted in a one-time $49 million after-tax gain from the cumulative effect of the change.
