- Devon Energy Corporation (AMEX: DVN, TSE:NSX) and Ocean Energy, Inc. (NYSE:OEI) announced today the completion of their merger. With the merger, Devon is the largest U.S.-based independent producer of oil and gas.
OKLAHOMA CITY and HOUSTON  April 25, 2003
     Shareholders of both companies overwhelmingly approved the transaction at special shareholder meetings earlier today. Over 98 percent of shares represented at both the Devon and Ocean meetings, which in each case represented a majority of the outstanding voting power, were voted in favor of the transaction.
     In the transaction, each Ocean common share was converted into 0.414 of a share of Devon common stock and Ocean became a subsidiary of Devon. Conversion requires issuance of approximately 74 million additional Devon common shares, resulting in total shares outstanding of approximately 231 million. The transaction is being accounted for as a purchase of Ocean by Devon.
     "This is a great day for Devon and our shareholders," said J. Larry Nichols, Devon's chairman and chief executive officer. "Our merger with Ocean brings us a wealth of talent and participation in a broad array of drill-bit growth opportunities in the Gulf of Mexico and abroad."
     "This merger gives Ocean shareholders valuable North American natural gas exposure and a stake in a company with the financial strength to accelerate our exploration and development activities," said James T. Hackett, president and chief operating officer of Devon. Mr. Hackett, formerly chairman, president and chief executive officer of Ocean, added that, "Devon's wells account for about four percent of the natural gas produced in the United States and Canada, and we are exploring for new oil and gas reserves in some of the world's most promising areas."
