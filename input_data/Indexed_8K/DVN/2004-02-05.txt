EXHIBIT 99.1
NEWS RELEASE
 Devon Energy Corporation (AMEX: DVN, TSX: NSX) today reported that net earnings climbed more than 1,500 percent, making 2003 the most profitable year in the company's history. Devon reported net earnings of $1.7 billion, or $8.32 per common share ($8.07 per diluted common share) for the year ended December 31, 2003. Devon's 2002 net earnings were $104 million, or 61 cents per diluted common share. A 21 percent increase in oil and natural gas production and sharply higher oil and gas prices drove the earnings increase.
OKLAHOMA CITY  February 5, 2004
     For the fourth quarter of 2003, the company reported net earnings of $543 million, or $2.32 per common share ($2.25 per diluted common share). These results included $218 million attributable to lower Canadian income tax rates partially offset by a $74 million after-tax reduction in the carrying value of miscellaneous international oil and gas properties. Devon reported net earnings of $84 million, or 52 cents per diluted common share in the fourth quarter of 2002.
Ocean Merger Topped a Year of Achievements
     The most significant event for the company in 2003 was the merger with Ocean Energy in April. The integration of the two companies was substantially accomplished by year-end. Devon also reported several notable operational accomplishments in 2003:
 
     "We hit our production growth targets and now Devon's oil and gas property base is delivering record volumes at a time when oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices are very healthy," said J. Larry Nichols, chairman and chief executive officer. "Numerous operating achievements accompanied our stellar financial results. High-impact exploration yielded significant discoveries and our marketing and midstream operations had its best year ever. Record earnings allowed us to fund our entire $2.5 billion drilling and facilities budget while generating more than $1 billion for debt retirement."
Oil and Gas Revenues Approach $6 Billion
     Combined sales of oil, gas and natural gas liquids increased 78 percent in the year ended December 31, 2003, to $5.9 billion. The increase was attributable to rising production and higher product prices.
     Devon increased production 21 percent to a record 228 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe) in 2003. The increase reflects Devon's larger producing base following the April 2003 merger with Ocean Energy and growth from development projects in North America, West Africa and China.
     The average price realized by Devon for its 2003 natural gas production increased 61 percent to $4.51 per thousand cubic feet from $2.80 per thousand cubic feet in 2002. Devon's average realized price for oil increased 18 percent to $25.63 per barrel in 2003 compared with $21.71 per barrel in 2002. The company's average realized price for natural gas liquids increased 33 percent to $18.65 per barrel in 2003, compared with $14.05 per barrel in 2002.
     Higher natural gas and natural gas liquids prices also led to increased marketing and midstream revenue. Marketing and midstream revenue increased to $1.5 billion in 2003, up from $1.0 billion in 2002. Total revenues, including marketing and midstream, climbed 70 percent in 2003, to $7.4 billion.
     Devon's merger with Ocean Energy in April 2003 significantly increased the size and scope of the company's operations. This is reflected in higher operating costs and expenses.
     Lease operating expenses increased 40 percent to $871 million. On a unit of production basis, lease operating expenses increased 16 percent to $3.83 per barrel of oil equivalent (Boe).
 
Higher lease fuel costs, chemicals costs and the effects of the strengthening Canadian dollar contributed to the increase in unit costs.
     Marketing and midstream operating costs for 2003 increased 45 percent to $1.2 billion. The increase in expenses was primarily a result of higher natural gas prices. The increase in costs was more than offset by a related increase in marketing and midstream revenue.
     Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense (DD&A) increased 48 percent in 2003, to $1.8 billion. The increase was driven by the increase in oil and gas production and by a higher DD&A rate. Devon's DD&A rate increased 22 percent in 2003, to $7.87 per Boe. The combined DD&A rate includes depreciation of Devon's midstream and corporate assets in addition to depletion of its oil and gas properties.
     General and administrative expense (G&A) also increased in 2003, by 40 percent to $307 million. G&A expense included $4 million related to personnel severance costs in the fourth quarter and $14 million attributable to office closings in previous quarters. G&A expense also included a $15 million non-cash charge related to changes in the value of obligations in certain compensation plans. This charge is offset by increases in other income and comprehensive earnings.
     Income tax expense in 2003 was $514 million, or 23 percent of pre-tax income. Of the total, $321 million was deferred income tax expense, not requiring the current use of cash. Full year and fourth quarter 2003 income tax expense included a $218 million deferred tax benefit attributable to prior years. This is the impact of a reduction in Canadian tax rates on deferred tax liabilities recorded at the beginning of 2003.
Cash Flow Before Balance Sheet Changes Doubles to $3.9 Billion
     Cash flow before balance sheet changes increased 102 percent to a record high $3.9 billion in 2003. Cash on hand climbed to $1.3 billion at year-end. The company expects to utilize the accumulated cash to retire long-term debt of $338 million in 2004 and $920 million in 2005.
Oil and Gas Reserves
     The company's estimated proved oil and gas reserves were 2,089 MMBoe at December 31, 2003. This is a 30 percent increase over year-end 2002 estimated proved reserves of 1,609 MMBoe. Devon acquired 556 MMBoe in 2003, predominately through its merger with Ocean Energy in April. Devon added another 188 MMBoe through successful drilling (discoveries and extensions). Oil and gas produced during 2003 decreased total proved reserves by 228 MMBoe, and revisions to prior estimates reduced the total by another 11 MMBoe. Devon also sold non-core properties in 2003 with associated proved reserves of 25 MMBoe. Natural gas is converted to its oil equivalent on the basis of six thousand cubic feet of gas to one barrel of oil.
     Proved reserves at December 31, 2003, are composed of 661 million barrels of crude oil, 7.3 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 209 million barrels of natural gas liquids. These quantities had a combined estimated pre-tax present value, discounted at 10 percent, of $23 billion. This compares to year-end 2002 estimated pre-tax discounted value of $15 billion.
     Proved developed reserves represented 76 percent of total proved reserves at year-end 2003. This compares to 73 percent of total proved reserves at December 31, 2002.
 
Items Excluded from Published Estimates
     Devon's reported net earnings include items of income and expense that are excluded by certain securities analysts in their published estimates of the company's financial results. Such items and their effects upon full year and fourth quarter 2003 reported earnings were as follows:
     In aggregate, these items increased 2003 net earnings by $199 million, or 95 cents per common share (91 cents per diluted common share). For the fourth quarter of 2003, the applicable items increased net earnings by $152 million, or 65 cents per common share (63 cents per diluted common share).

     The United States Securities and Exchange Commission has recently adopted new disclosure requirements for public companies such as Devon. One provision of these disclosure requirements concerns references to Non-GAAP financial measures. (GAAP refers to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.) Non-GAAP financial measures may be provided if the company explains the relevance of the information. The company must also reconcile the Non-GAAP financial Measure to related GAAP information. Cash flow before balance sheet changes is a Non-GAAP financial measure provided by Devon in this earnings release. Devon believes cash flow before balance sheet changes is relevant because it is a measure of cash available to fund the company's capital expenditures and to service its debt and other obligations. Cash flow before balance sheet changes is also important to certain financial analysts who provide estimates of Devon's quarterly financial results to investors.
