NEWS RELEASE
 Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) today reported net earnings for the quarter ended September 30, 2004, of $517 million, or $2.12 per common share ($2.07 per diluted common share). This is 26 percent greater than Devon's third quarter 2003 net earnings of $412 million, or $1.76 per common share ($1.71 per diluted common share). Higher realized prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids were primarily responsible for the increased earnings.
OKLAHOMA CITY  November 4, 2004
     For the nine months ended September 30, 2004, the company reported net earnings of $1.5 billion, or $6.25 per common share ($6.07 per diluted common share). For the nine months ended September 30, 2003, Devon reported net earnings of $1.2 billion, or $5.97 per common share ($5.76 per diluted common share).
     "Following another quarter of outstanding financial performance, we are delivering on the plans we unveiled in September," said J. Larry Nichols, chairman and chief executive officer. "Devon's shares are now trading on the New York Stock Exchange, and the stock will split two-for-one on November 15. We have already bought back 1.5 million shares and our non-core property divestiture program is under way."
Oil, Gas and NGL Sales Climb 15 Percent to $1.9 Billion
     Combined sales of oil, gas and natural gas liquids for the third quarter of 2004 were $1.9 billion, a 15 percent increase over the third quarter of 2003. Devon realized higher prices for all three energy products. Realized prices include the effect of hedges.
     Realized natural gas prices increased 16 percent to $5.17 per thousand cubic feet in the third quarter of 2004, compared with $4.47 per thousand cubic feet in 2003. The average third quarter realized oil price increased 16 percent to $29.19 per barrel in 2004 compared with $25.19 per barrel in 2003. The company's average realized price for natural gas liquids soared 46 percent in the third quarter of 2004, to $24.36 per barrel compared with $16.74 per barrel in the third quarter of 2003.
     Combined oil, gas and natural gas liquids production was 679 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (Boe) per day in the third quarter of 2004. This was two percent less than the 689 thousand Boe per day Devon produced in the third quarter of 2003. Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico reduced third quarter 2004 oil and gas production by approximately 4,600 Boe per day.
 
     Marketing and midstream revenues increased 22 percent in the third quarter of 2004, to $408 million. After $319 million of related expenses, Devon's marketing and midstream margin reached $89 million. This was an increase of 33 percent over the third quarter 2003 margin of $67 million. Higher realized prices for natural gas and natural gas liquids led to the improvement.
Discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico and Brazil Lead Operating Highlights
     Devon invested $620 million in drilling and facilities capital projects in the third quarter of 2004. These capital expenditures resulted in 487 successful wells. During the third quarter:
Free Cash Flow Funding Debt Reduction and Share Repurchase Program
     Cash flow before balance sheet changes was nearly $1.3 billion in the third quarter of 2004. Devon funded $747 million of capital expenditures and paid common and preferred dividends totaling $27 million in the quarter. This resulted in free cash flow of $497 million in the quarter. Cash on hand at September 30, 2004, was approximately $1.8 billion. A reconciliation of cash flow before balance sheet changes and free cash flow is presented later in this release.
     After retiring $972 million of debt in the first nine months of 2004, Devon's net debt to adjusted capitalization was 30 percent at September 30, 2004. This is down from 39 percent at December 31, 2003. Reconciliations for net debt and adjusted capitalization are found later in this release.
     On September 27, 2004, Devon announced plans to repurchase up to 10 percent, or approximately 25 million (50 million shares following the upcoming two-for-one split), of its outstanding common shares. Commencing in October, Devon began repurchasing shares. To date, the company has repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares at a total cost of approximately $111 million.
 
     Lease operating (LOE) and transportation expenses increased nine percent to $323 million in the third quarter of 2004 compared with the third quarter of 2003. Hurricane-related costs in the Gulf of Mexico, higher lease fuel costs, a stronger Canadian dollar and increased well workover activity contributed to this increase.
     Production taxes decreased 11 percent to $48 million in the third quarter of 2004. Third quarter 2004 production taxes were reduced by $22 million resulting from tax rate reductions for Barnett Shale wells in Texas. Of this amount, $4 million was applicable to the third quarter of 2004, $6 million was applicable to the first half of 2004 and $12 million was applicable to prior years.
     Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense (DD&A) increased 13 percent in the third quarter of 2004, to $572 million. The combined DD&A rate was $9.17 per Boe in the third quarter of 2004. Devon's combined DD&A rate includes depreciation of midstream and corporate assets in addition to depletion of oil and gas properties.
     General and administrative expenses decreased 26 percent, to $59 million in the third quarter of 2004. The decrease is reflective of overhead and personnel efficiencies realized since Devon merged with Ocean Energy in April 2003.
     Interest expense in the third quarter of 2004 decreased nine percent to $109 million compared with the third quarter of 2003. The decrease in interest expense was driven by Devon's repayment of $972 million of debt in 2004.
     Third quarter 2004 income tax expense was $300 million, or 37 percent of pre-tax earnings. Of the total, $132 million was deferred income tax expense, not requiring the current use of cash. Income taxes represented 33 percent of pre-tax earnings in the third quarter of 2003. The higher 2004 rate is largely attributable to increased pre-tax earnings.
Items Excluded from Published Estimates
     Devon's reported net earnings include items of income and expense that are typically excluded by securities analysts in their published estimates for the company's financial results. Such items and their effects upon third quarter 2004 reported earnings were as follows:
In aggregate, these items decreased third quarter 2004 earnings by $12 million, or five cents per common share (four cents per diluted common share).

     The United States Securities and Exchange Commission requires public companies such as Devon to reconcile Non-GAAP (GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles) financial measures to related GAAP measures. Cash flow before balance sheet changes, free cash flow and net debt are Non-GAAP financial measures. Devon believes cash flow before balance sheet changes is relevant because it is a measure of cash available to fund the company's capital expenditures, dividends and to service its debt. Devon believes free cash flow is relevant because it is a measure of cash available to service debt. Cash flow before balance sheet changes and free cash flow are also used by certain securities analysts as a measure Devon's financial results.
     Devon believes that using net debt, defined as debt less cash and the debentures exchangeable into shares of ChevronTexaco common stock, for the calculation of total capitalization provides a better measure than using debt. Management believes that because cash can be used to repay indebtedness, netting cash against debt provides a clearer picture of the future demands on cash to repay debt. Furthermore, included in Devon's indebtedness are $0.7 billion of debentures that are exchangeable into 14.2 million shares of ChevronTexaco common stock owned outright by Devon. Since these shares are being held by Devon exclusively to satisfy the related indebtedness, Devon believes that netting the value of the debentures provides a clearer picture of the future demands on cash to repay debt. This methodology is also utilized by various lenders, rating agencies and securities analysts as a measure of Devon's indebtedness.
