EXHIBIT 99.1
 Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) today reported net earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2005, of $563 million, or $1.17 per common share ($1.14 per diluted common share). This is a 14 percent increase over Devon's first quarter 2004 net earnings of $494 million, or $1.03 per common share ($1.00 per diluted common share). Per-share amounts reflect a two-for-one stock split completed in November 2004.

Canadian Winter Drilling Leads Operating Highlights
     Devon drilled a total of 685 wells in the first quarter, with 56 percent of the wells concentrated in Canada.
 
Higher Prices Drive Oil and Gas Sales
     Devon's sales of oil, gas and natural gas liquids increased six percent to $1.9 billion in the quarter ended March 31, 2005. The increase was driven by higher realized prices for all products.
     Combined oil, gas and natural gas liquids production averaged 660 thousand Boe per day in the quarter ended March 31, 2005. This was a six percent decrease from the average rate of 703 thousand Boe per day in 2004. Properties in North America that Devon is divesting accounted for the majority of the first quarter production decline. The divestiture properties produced 27 thousand Boe per day less in the first quarter of 2005 than in the first quarter of 2004. Outside North America, Devon's share of oil production from the Zafiro field in Equatorial Guinea also declined. In accordance with contract terms, Devon's share of production from Zafiro was reduced in April 2004. Devon's Zafiro production was about 17 thousand barrels per day less in the first quarter of 2005 compared to the first quarter of 2004.
     Devon's realized natural gas prices increased nine percent to $5.50 per thousand cubic feet in the first quarter of 2005, compared with $5.05 per thousand cubic feet in 2004. Average realized oil prices increased 24 percent to $34.47 per barrel in 2005, compared with $27.78 per barrel in 2004. The company's average realized price for natural gas liquids improved 23 percent in 2005 to $24.30 per barrel, compared with $19.78 per barrel in 2004.
     Marketing and midstream revenues and expenses of $416 million and $331 million, respectively, for 2005 were essentially flat with 2004. This resulted in a marketing and midstream margin of $85 million. In the first quarter of 2005, Devon closed a sale of non-core midstream assets. This sale resulted in a $150 million gain that was recorded in other income.
Higher Costs Reflect Sector Inflation
     Increased levels of activity throughout the exploration and production industry are reflected by rising costs. Devon's lease operating expenses increased 12 percent to $348 million in the first quarter of 2005. Unit lease operating expenses increased 21 percent to $5.85 per Boe. Increases in ad valorem taxes, well workover expenses, power, fuel and repairs and maintenance costs, in addition to the compounding effect of the weaker U.S. dollar, drove the increase in unit costs.
     Production taxes increased 25 percent to $78 million in the first quarter of 2005. Higher oil and gas revenues and a $9 million retroactive adjustment to prior years' taxes as a result of recent regulatory rulings contributed to the increase.
     Depreciation, depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties increased less than one percent in 2005, to $541 million. General and administrative expenses decreased 24 percent, to $58 million in 2005.
     Income tax expense was $350 million, or 38 percent of pre-tax earnings in 2005 compared to $282 million, or 36 percent in 2004. Included in 2005 current income taxes are additional taxes for the planned repatriation of foreign earnings and gains on sales of assets. These items are described further in the "Items Excluded from Published Estimates" section of this release.
 
Cash Flow Before Balance Sheet Changes Exceeds $1 billion
     Cash flow before balance sheet changes was $1.1 billion in the first quarter of 2005. Cash and marketable securities on hand rose to $2.5 billion as of March 31, 2005. Approximately $1.6 billion of this amount is earmarked for debt repayments through 2006. A reconciliation of cash flow before balance sheet changes, which is a non-GAAP measure, is provided in this release.
     Devon's net debt to adjusted capitalization was 26 percent at March 31, 2005. This compares to 36 percent at March 31, 2004. Reconciliations of net debt and adjusted capitalization, which are non-GAAP measures, are also provided in this release.
Divestiture Results Exceed Target; Stock Repurchase Program Ahead of Schedule
     Devon issued a separate release today describing the results of its non-core oil and gas properties divestiture program. Purchase and sale agreements have been signed for all of the selected U.S. and Canadian assets offered for sale. Gross and after-tax proceeds from the divestitures are expected at $2.3 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. After-tax proceeds were originally estimated at $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion.
     In October 2004, Devon commenced a program to repurchase up to 10 percent, or 50 million shares, of its common stock. As of March 31, 2005, Devon had repurchased approximately 18 million shares at a total cost of $746 million. The company now anticipates completing the stock repurchase program by September 30, 2005, approximately six months earlier than previously estimated.
Items Excluded from Published Estimates
     Devon's reported net earnings include items of income and expense that are typically excluded by securities analysts in their published estimates for the company's financial results. Such items and their effects upon first quarter 2005 reported earnings were as follows:
     The following table summarizes the effects of these items on earnings and income taxes. Included in the table are the tax effects of oil and gas property divestitures that had no effect on net earnings.
 
(in millions)
     In aggregate, these items increased 2005 net earnings by $8 million, or two cents per common share (two cents per diluted share). These items and their associated tax effects decreased cash flow before balance sheet changes by $141 million.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DATA
 
     The United States Securities and Exchange Commission requires public companies such as Devon to reconcile Non-GAAP (GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles) financial measures to related GAAP measures. Cash flow before balance sheet changes and net debt are Non-GAAP financial measures. Devon believes cash flow before balance sheet changes is relevant because it is a measure of cash available to fund the company's capital expenditures, dividends and to service its debt. Cash flow before balance sheet changes is also used by certain securities analysts as a measure of Devon's financial results.

RECONCILIATION TO GAAP INFORMATION
     Devon believes that using net debt, defined as debt less cash and the debentures exchangeable into shares of ChevronTexaco common stock, for the calculation of net debt to adjusted capitalization provides a better measure than using debt. Management believes that because cash can be used to repay indebtedness, netting cash against debt provides a clearer picture of the future demands on cash to repay debt. Also, included in Devon's indebtedness are $696 million of debentures exchangeable into 14.2 million shares of ChevronTexaco common stock owned outright by Devon. Since these shares, with a market value of $827 million as of March 31, 2005, are being held by Devon exclusively to satisfy the related indebtedness, Devon believes netting the value of the debentures provides a clearer picture of future demands on cash to repay debt. This methodology is also utilized by various lenders, rating agencies and securities analysts as a measure of Devon's indebtedness.
