          The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") in accordance with the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (collectively, the "Act"), a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-156025), including a prospectus (the "Base Prospectus") relating to certain securities to be issued from time to time by the Company.

The registration statement, as amended to the date of this Agreement, including the information, if any, deemed pursuant to Rule 430A, 430B or 430C

The Company and each Significant Subsidiary is duly qualified and in good standing as a foreign corporation, partnership or other entity authorized to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified would not,

     (n) None of the Company or any Significant Subsidiary is (A) in violation of its charter, bylaws or other constitutive documents, (B) in default (or, with notice or lapse of time or both, would be in default) in the performance or observance of any obligation, agreement, covenant or condition contained in any bond, debenture, note, indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan or credit agreement, or other evidence of indebtedness, or any lease, license, franchise agreement, authorization, permit, certificate or other agreement or instrument to which any of them is a party or by which any of them is bound or to which any of their assets or properties is subject (collectively, "Agreements and Instruments"), or (C) in violation of any law, statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order or decree of any domestic or foreign court with jurisdiction over any of them or any of their assets or properties or other governmental or regulatory authority, agency or other body, that, in the case of clauses (B) and (C) herein, would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. There exists no condition that, with notice, the passage of time or otherwise, would constitute a default by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary under any such document or instrument or result in the imposition of any penalty or the acceleration of any indebtedness, other than penalties, defaults or conditions that would not have a Material Adverse Effect.
     (o) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Operative Documents, including the consummation of the offer and sale of the Notes, does not or will not violate, conflict with or constitute a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or a default under (or an event that with notice or the lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default), or require consent under, or result in the creation or imposition of a lien, charge or encumbrance on any property or assets of the Company or any Significant Subsidiary or an acceleration of any indebtedness of the Company or any Significant Subsidiary pursuant to, (i) the charter, bylaws or other constitutive documents of the Company or any Significant Subsidiary, (ii) any Agreements and Instruments, (iii) any law, statute, rule or regulation applicable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or their respective assets or properties or (iv) any judgment, order or decree of any domestic or foreign court or governmental agency or authority having jurisdiction over the Company or any Significant Subsidiary or its respective assets or properties that, in the case of clauses (ii) through (iv), would reasonably be expected, either individually or in the aggregate, (1) to have a Material Adverse Effect or (2) to interfere with or adversely affect the issuance of the Notes in any jurisdiction or adversely affect the consummation of the transactions contemplated by any of the Operative Documents. No consent, approval, authorization
 
or order of, or filing, registration, qualification, license or permit of or with, any court or governmental agency, body or administrative agency, domestic or foreign, is required to be obtained or made by the Company for the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Operative Documents, including the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated thereby, except (x) such as have been or will be obtained or made on or prior to the time of purchase in connection with the issuance of the Notes, (y) such as may be required under state securities or blue sky laws, or (z) those for which the failure to obtain would not reasonably be expected, either individually or in the aggregate, (1) to have a Material Adverse Effect or (2) to interfere with or adversely affect the issuance of the Notes in any jurisdiction or adversely affect the consummation of the transactions contemplated by any of the Operative Documents.

          8. : This Agreement shall become effective when the parties hereto have executed and delivered this Agreement.
Effective Date of Agreement; Termination
          The obligations of the several Underwriters hereunder shall be subject to termination by you at any time prior to the time of purchase, if prior to such time (i) the Company shall have failed, refused or been unable to perform in any material respect any agreement on its part to be performed under this Agreement when and as required, (ii) any other condition to the obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement to be fulfilled by the Company pursuant to Section 7 is not fulfilled when and as required in any material respect, (iii) trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq Global Market shall have been suspended or limitations or minimum prices shall have been established on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq Global Market, (iv) trading of any securities issued or guaranteed by the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (v) a general banking moratorium shall have been declared either by the United States or New York State authorities, or if there has

          If you elect to terminate this Agreement as provided in this Section 8, the Company shall be notified as provided for herein.
          If the sale to the Underwriters of the Notes, as contemplated by this Agreement, is not carried out by the Underwriters for any reason permitted under this Agreement or if such sale is not carried out because the Company shall be unable to comply and does not comply with any of the terms of this Agreement, the Company shall not be under any obligation or liability under this Agreement (except to the extent provided in Sections 4(k), 6 and 10 hereof), and the Underwriters shall be under no obligation or liability to the Company under this Agreement (except to the extent provided in Section 10 hereof) or to one another hereunder.
          9. : Subject to Sections 7 and 8, if any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to take up and pay for the Notes to be purchased by it hereunder (otherwise than for a reason sufficient to justify the termination of this Agreement under the provisions of Section 8 hereof) and if the aggregate principal amount of Notes which all Underwriters so defaulting shall have agreed but failed to take up and pay for does not exceed 10% of the total aggregate principal amount of Notes, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall take up and pay for (in addition to the aggregate number of Notes they are obligated to purchase pursuant to Section 1 hereof) the aggregate principal amount of Notes agreed to be purchased by all such defaulting Underwriters, as hereinafter provided. Such Notes shall be taken up and paid for by such non-defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters in such amount or amounts as you may designate with the consent of each Underwriter so designated, or in the event no such designation is made, such Notes shall be taken up and paid for by all non-defaulting Underwriters pro rata in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of Notes set opposite the names of such non-defaulting Underwriters in Schedule A.
Increase in Underwriters' Commitments
          Without relieving any defaulting Underwriter from its obligations hereunder, the Company agrees with the non-defaulting Underwriters that it will not sell any Notes hereunder unless all of the Notes are purchased by the Underwriters (or by substituted Underwriters selected by you with the approval of the Company or selected by the Company with your approval).
          If a new Underwriter or Underwriters are substituted by the Underwriters or by the Company for a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters in accordance with the foregoing provision, the Company or you shall have the right to postpone the time of purchase for a period not exceeding five business days in order that any necessary changes in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus and other documents may be effected.
 
          The term Underwriter as used in this Agreement shall refer to and include any Underwriter substituted under this Section 9 with like effect as if such substituted Underwriter had originally been named in Schedule A.
          If the aggregate principal amount of Notes which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed to purchase exceeds 10% of the total principal amount of Notes which all Underwriters agreed to purchase hereunder, and if neither the non-defaulting Underwriters nor the Company shall make arrangements within the five business day period stated above for the purchase of all the Notes which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed to purchase hereunder, this Agreement shall be terminated without further act or deed and without any liability on the part of the Company to any non-defaulting Underwriter and without any liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter to the Company. Nothing in this paragraph, and no action taken hereunder, shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
          10. : (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its partners, directors and officers, and any person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and the successors and assigns of all the foregoing persons (each, an "Underwriter Indemnified Party") from and against any loss, damage, expense, liability or claim (including the reasonable cost of investigation) which, jointly or severally, any such Underwriter Indemnified Party may incur under the Act, the Exchange Act, the common law or otherwise, insofar as such loss, damage, expense, liability or claim arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Time of Sale Information, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case except insofar as any such loss, damage, expense, liability or claim arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any such document in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing by or on behalf of any Underwriter through you to the Company expressly for use with reference to such Underwriter in such document or arises out of or is based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in connection with such information required to be stated in such document or necessary to make such statements not misleading.
Indemnity and Contribution
          (b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers and any person who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and the successors and assigns of all the foregoing persons (each, a "Company Indemnified Party") from and against any loss, damage, expense, liability or claim (including the reasonable cost of investigation) which, jointly or severally, any such Company Indemnified Party may incur under the Act,
 
the Exchange Act, the common law or otherwise, insofar as such loss, damage, expense, liability or claim arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Time of Sale Information, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission was made in reliance upon, and in conformity with, written information concerning the Underwriters that was furnished in writing to the Company by the Representatives, on behalf of the several Underwriters, specifically for use therein.
          (c) If any action, suit or proceeding (each, a "Proceeding") is brought against any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either subsection (a) or (b) of this Section 10, such person (the "Indemnified Party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing of the institution of such Proceeding and such Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense of such Proceeding, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party and payment of all fees and expenses; , , that the omission to so notify such Indemnifying Party shall not relieve such Indemnifying Party from any liability which it may have to such Indemnified Party or otherwise, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party has been prejudiced in any material respect by such omission to so notify. Such Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ its own counsel in any such case, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Party unless the employment of such counsel shall have been authorized in writing by such Indemnifying Party in connection with the defense of such Proceeding or such Indemnifying Party shall not have employed counsel to have charge of the defense of such Proceeding within 30 days of the receipt of notice thereof or such Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded upon written advice of counsel that there may be defenses available to it that are different from, additional to, or in conflict with those available to such Indemnifying Party (in which case such Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to direct that portion of the defense of such Proceeding on behalf of such Indemnified Party, but such Indemnifying Party may employ counsel and participate in the defense thereof but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnifying Party), in any of which events such reasonable fees and expenses shall be borne by such Indemnifying Party and paid as incurred (it being understood, however, that such Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel in any one Proceeding or series of related Proceedings together with reasonably necessary local counsel representing the Indemnified Parties who are parties to such Proceeding). An Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement of any such Proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with the written consent of such Indemnifying Party, such Indemnifying Party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless an Indemnified Party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement.
provided
however
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Party shall have requested an Indemnifying Party to reimburse such Indemnified Party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second sentence of this paragraph, then such Indemnifying Party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any Proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 business days after receipt by such Indemnifying Party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such Indemnifying Party shall not have reimbursed such Indemnified Party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement and (iii) such Indemnified Party shall have given such Indemnifying Party at least 30 days' prior notice of its intention to settle. An Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of any Indemnified Party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened Proceeding in respect of which such Indemnified Party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such Proceeding and does not include an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party.
          (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 10 is held to be unavailable to an Indemnified Party under subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 10 in respect of any losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims referred to therein, then each applicable Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Notes or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportion as the total proceeds from the offering (net of underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in this subsection shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending any Proceeding.
          (e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 10 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of
 
allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in subsection (d) above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 10, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes underwritten by such Underwriter and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damage which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriter's obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 10 are several in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments and not joint. The remedies provided for in this Section 10 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Party at law or in equity.
          (f) The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 10 and the covenants, warranties and representations of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, its partners, directors and officers or any person (including each partner, officer or director of such person) who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, or by or on behalf of the Company, its directors and officers or any person who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and shall survive the issuance and delivery of the Notes. In addition, the agreements contained in Sections 4(k), 6, 10, 11 and 13 shall survive the termination of this Agreement, including pursuant to Section 8. The Company and each Underwriter agree promptly to notify each other of the commencement of any Proceeding against it and, in the case of the Company, against any of the Company's officers or directors, in connection with the issuance and sale of the Notes, or in connection with the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus.
          11. : The Company and the Underwriters severally acknowledge that the statements with respect to the offer and sale of the Notes set forth in the third sentence of the third paragraph and in the fourth and fifth paragraphs in each case under the caption "Underwriting" in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus (to the extent such statements relate to the Underwriters) constitute the only information furnished in writing by the Underwriters expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, the Time of Sale Information, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus as such information is referred to in Sections 3 and 10 hereof.
