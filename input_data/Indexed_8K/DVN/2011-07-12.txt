The Company is filing the Base Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture as Exhibit 4.1 and Exhibit 4.2, respectively, to this report. By filing this report, the Company is causing these exhibits to be incorporated by reference herein.
The Notes are general obligations of the Company, which rank equally with all existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt of the Company.

The Indenture limits the ability of the Company to incur liens, consolidate, merge or sell its assets, in each case subject to certain qualifications set forth in the Indenture.
The 2016 Notes will mature on July 15, 2016. The 2021 Notes will mature on July 15, 2021. The 2041 Notes will mature on July 15, 2041. On or after the date that is one month prior to the maturity for the 2016 notes, three months prior to the maturity for the 2021 notes, or six months prior to the maturity for the 2041 notes, respectively, the Company may, at its option, redeem the 2016 notes, the 2021 notes or the 2041 notes, at any time, in whole or in part, at its option at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. At all other times, the Company may, at its option, redeem the Notes in whole or in part at a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the notes then outstanding to be redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) from the redemption date to the maturity date computed in accordance with the Indenture, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date.
The Notes were offered and sold pursuant to the Company's registration statement on Form S-3 filed on December 9, 2008 (File No. 333-156025), as amended by the Post-Effective Amendment No. 1 to Form S-3 filed on July 5, 2011.

     Whenever, subsequent to the receipt by the Trustee of any Board Resolution, Officer's Certificate, Opinion of Counsel or other document or instrument, a clerical, typographical or other inadvertent or unintentional error or omission shall be discovered therein, a new document or instrument may be substituted therefor in corrected form with the same force and effect as if originally filed in the corrected form and, irrespective of the date or dates of the actual execution and/or delivery thereof, such substitute document or instrument shall be deemed to have been executed and/or delivered as of the date or dates required with respect to the document or instrument for which it is substituted. Anything in this Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, if any such corrective document or instrument indicates that action has been taken by or at the request of the Company which could not have been taken had the original document or instrument not contained such error or omission, the action so taken shall not be invalidated or otherwise rendered ineffective but shall be and remain in full force and effect, (except to the extent that such action was a result of willful misconduct or bad faith or had or could be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Holders of any Debt Securities issued hereunder). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any Debt Securities issued under the authority of such defective document or instrument shall nevertheless be the valid obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits of this Indenture equally and ratably with all other Outstanding Debt Securities.
Section 1.04 .
Acts of Holders
     (a) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, election, waiver or other action provided by this Indenture to be made, given or taken by Holders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in person or by an agent duly appointed in writing or, alternatively, may be embodied in and evidenced by the record of Holders voting in favor thereof, either in person or by proxies duly appointed in writing, at any meeting of Holders duly called and held in accordance with the provisions of Article XIII, or a combination of such instruments and any such record. Except as
 
herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments or record or both are delivered to the Trustee and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Company. Such instrument or instruments and any such record (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments and so voting at any such meeting. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent, or of the holding by any Person of a Debt Security, shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Section 9.01) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Company, if made in the manner provided in this Section. The record of any meeting of Holders shall be proved in the manner provided in Section 13.06.
     (b) The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof or may be proved in any other manner which the Trustee and the Company deem sufficient. Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority.
     (c) The principal amount (except as otherwise contemplated in clause (y) of the proviso to the definition of Outstanding) and serial numbers of Debt Securities held by any Person, and the date of holding the same, shall be proved by the Debt Security Register.
     (d) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, election, waiver or other Act of a Holder shall bind every future Holder of the same Debt Security and the Holder of every Debt Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Debt Security.
     (e) Until such time as written instruments shall have been delivered to the Trustee with respect to the requisite percentage of principal amount of Debt Securities for the action contemplated by such instruments, any such instrument executed and delivered by or on behalf of a Holder may be revoked with respect to any or all of such Debt Securities by written notice by such Holder or any subsequent Holder, proven in the manner in which such instrument was proven.
     (f) Debt Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, authenticated and delivered after any Act of Holders may, and shall if required by the Trustee, bear a notation in form approved by the Trustee as to any action taken by such Act of Holders. If the Company shall so determine, new Debt Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Trustee and the Company, to such action may be prepared and executed by the Company and authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in exchange for Outstanding Debt Securities of such series or Tranche.
     (g) If the Company shall solicit from Holders any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, election, waiver or other Act, the Company may, at its option, fix in
 
advance a record date for the determination of Holders entitled to give such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, election, waiver or other Act, but the Company shall have no obligation to do so. If such a record date is fixed, such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, election, waiver or other Act may be given before or after such record date, but only the Holders of record at the close of business on the record date shall be deemed to be Holders for the purposes of determining whether Holders of the requisite proportion of the Outstanding Debt Securities have authorized or agreed or consented to such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, election, waiver or other Act, and for that purpose the Outstanding Debt Securities shall be computed as of the record date.
Section 1.05 .

     In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice to Holders by mail, then such notification as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder. In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders.
     Any notice required by this Indenture may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event otherwise to be specified therein, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.
     If Debt Securities of any series have been issued in whole or in part in the form of one or more Global Securities through DTC as Depositary, notice may be provided by delivery of such notice to DTC for posting through its "Legal Notice Service" (LENS) or a successor system thereof.

Depositary for the Debt Securities for such series shall no longer be eligible or in good standing under the Exchange Act, or other applicable statute or regulation, the Company shall appoint a successor Depositary with respect to such Global Security. If a successor Depositary for such Global Security is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of Debt Securities of such series in the form of definitive certificates in exchange for such Global Security, will authenticate and deliver Debt Securities of such series in the form of definitive certificates of like tenor and terms in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security in exchange for such Global Security.

If a Company Order pursuant to Section 3.03 is so delivered, any instructions by the Company with respect to such Global Security contained therein shall be in writing but need not be accompanied by or contained in an Officer's Certificate and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel.
          (5) The Depositary or, if there be one, its nominee, shall be the Holder of a Global Security for all purposes under this Indenture; and beneficial owners with respect to such Global Security shall hold their interests pursuant to applicable procedures of such Depositary.

     Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 3.01 with respect to any series of Debt Securities, or any Tranche thereof, the Debt Securities shall be executed on behalf of the Company by an Authorized Officer and may have the corporate seal of the Company affixed thereto or reproduced thereon attested by any other Authorized Officer. The signature of any or all of these officers on the Debt Securities may be manual or facsimile.
     Debt Securities bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at the time of execution Authorized Officers of the Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Debt Securities or did not hold such offices at the date of such Debt Securities.
     The Trustee shall authenticate and deliver Debt Securities of a series, for original issue, at one time or from time to time in accordance with the Company Order referred to below, upon receipt by the Trustee of:
     (a) the instrument or instruments establishing the form or forms and terms of such series, as provided in Sections 2.01 and 3.01;
     (b) a Company Order requesting the authentication and delivery of such Debt Securities and, to the extent that the terms of such Debt Securities shall not have been established in an indenture supplemental hereto or in a Board Resolution, or in an Officer's Certificate pursuant to a supplemental indenture or Board Resolution, all as contemplated by Sections 2.01 and 3.01, either (i) establishing such terms or (ii) in the case of Debt Securities of a series subject to a Periodic Offering, specifying procedures, acceptable to the Trustee, by which such terms are to be established, in either case in accordance with the instrument or instruments delivered pursuant to clause (a) above; and
     (c) the Debt Securities of such series, executed on behalf of the Company by an Authorized Officer.
     If the form or terms of the Debt Securities of any series have been established by or pursuant to a Board Resolution or an Officer's Certificate as permitted by Sections 2.01 or 3.01, the Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Debt Securities if the issuance of such Debt Securities pursuant to this Indenture will materially or adversely affect the Trustee's own rights,
 
duties or immunities under the Debt Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.
     Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 with respect to any series of Debt Securities, or any Tranche thereof, each Debt Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.
     Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 with respect to any series of Debt Securities, or any Tranche thereof, no Debt Security shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Debt Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee or its agent by manual signature, and such certificate upon any Debt Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Debt Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Debt Security shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder to the Company, or any Person acting on its behalf, but shall never have been issued and sold by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such Debt Security to the Debt Security Registrar for cancellation as provided in Section 3.09 together with a written statement (which need not comply with Section 1.02 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel) stating that such Debt Security has never been issued and sold by the Company, for all purposes of this Indenture such Debt Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits hereof.
Section 3.04 .
Temporary Debt Securities
     Pending the preparation of definitive Debt Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, the Company may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Debt Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Debt Securities in lieu of which they are issued, with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Debt Securities may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Debt Securities; provided, however, that temporary Debt Securities need not recite specific redemption, sinking fund, conversion or exchange provisions.
     Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 with respect to the Debt Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, after the preparation of definitive Debt Securities of such series or Tranche, the temporary Debt Securities of such series or Tranche shall be exchangeable, without charge to the Holder thereof, for definitive Debt Securities of such series or Tranche, upon surrender of such temporary Debt Securities at the office or agency of the Company maintained pursuant to Section 6.02 in a Place of Payment for such Debt Securities. Upon such surrender of temporary Debt Securities, the Company shall, except as aforesaid, execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor definitive Debt Securities of the same series and Tranche, of authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount.
 
     Until exchanged in full as hereinabove provided, temporary Debt Securities shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Debt Securities of the same series and Tranche and of like tenor authenticated and delivered hereunder.
Section 3.05 .
Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange
     The Company shall cause to be kept in each office designated pursuant to Section 6.02, with respect to the Debt Securities of each series or any Tranche thereof, a register (all registers kept in accordance with this Section being collectively referred to as the "Debt Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Debt Securities of such series or Tranche and the registration of transfer thereof. The Company shall designate one Person to maintain the Debt Security Register for the Debt Securities of each series on a consolidated basis, and such Person is referred to herein, with respect to such series, as the "Debt Security Registrar." Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company may designate one or more of its offices as an office in which a register with respect to the Debt Securities of one or more series, or any Tranche or Tranches thereof, shall be maintained, and the Company may designate itself the Debt Security Registrar with respect to one or more of such series. The Debt Security Register shall be open for inspection by the Trustee and the Company at all reasonable times.
     Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 with respect to the Debt Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Debt Security of such series or Tranche at the office or agency of the Company maintained pursuant to Section 6.02 in a Place of Payment for such series or Tranche, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Debt Securities of the same series and Tranche, of authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount.
     Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 with respect to the Debt Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, any Debt Security of such series or Tranche may be exchanged at the option of the Holder, for one or more new Debt Securities of the same series and Tranche, of authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Debt Securities to be exchanged at any such office or agency. Whenever any Debt Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Debt Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
     All Debt Securities delivered upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Debt Securities shall be valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Debt Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
     Every Debt Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company, the Trustee or the Debt Security Registrar) be duly endorsed or shall be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company, the Trustee or the Debt Security Registrar, as the case may be, duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
 
     Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 with respect to Debt Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, no service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Debt Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Debt Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 3.04, 4.06 or 12.05 not involving any transfer.
     The Company shall not be required to execute or to provide for the registration of transfer of or the exchange of (a) Debt Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, during a period of 15 days immediately preceding the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of the Debt Securities of such series or Tranche is to be given or (b) any Debt Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Debt Security being redeemed in part.
     In case a successor Company ("Successor Company") has executed an indenture supplemental hereto with the Trustee pursuant to Article XII, any of the Debt Securities authenticated or delivered pursuant to such transaction may, from time to time, at the request of the Successor Company, be exchanged for other Debt Securities executed in the name of the Successor Company with such changes in phraseology and form as may be appropriate, but otherwise identical to the Debt Securities surrendered for such exchange and of like principal amount; and the Trustee, upon Company Order of the Successor Company, shall authenticate and deliver the Debt Securities as specified in such order for the purpose of such exchange. If Debt Securities shall at any time be authenticated and delivered in any new name of a Successor Company pursuant to this Section 3.05 in exchange or substitution for or upon registration of transfer of any Debt Securities, such Successor Company, at the option of the Holders but without expense to them, shall provide for the exchange of all Debt Securities at the time Outstanding for Debt Securities authenticated and delivered in such new name.
     None of the Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent or the Debt Security Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests of a Global Security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.
Section 3.06 .
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Debt Securities
     If any mutilated Debt Security is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Debt Security of the same series and Tranche, and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
     If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (a) evidence to their satisfaction of the ownership of and the destruction, loss or theft of any Debt Security and (b) such security or indemnity as may be reasonably required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Debt Security is held by a Person purporting to be the owner of such Debt Security, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such
 
destroyed, lost or stolen Debt Security, a new Debt Security of the same series and Tranche, and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, in case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Debt Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Debt Security, pay such Debt Security.
     Upon the issuance of any new Debt Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other reasonable expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
     Every new Debt Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Debt Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Debt Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone other than the Holder of such new Debt Security, and any such new Debt Security shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Debt Securities of such series duly issued hereunder.
     The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Debt Securities.
Section 3.07 .
Payment of Interest and Additional Interest; Interest Rights Preserved
     Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 with respect to the Debt Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, interest and Additional Interest on any Debt Security which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Debt Security (or one or more Predecessor Debt Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest.
     Any interest on any Debt Security of any series which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the related Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (a) or (b) below:
     (a) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Debt Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Debt Securities) are registered at the close of business on a date (herein called a "Special Record Date") for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Debt Security of such series and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted
 
Interest as in this clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall promptly cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder of Debt Securities of such series at the address of such Holder as it appears in the Debt Security Register, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Debt Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Debt Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date.
     (b) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Debt Securities of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Debt Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
     Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section and Section 3.05, each Debt Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Debt Security shall carry the rights to interest (including any Additional Interest) accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Debt Security.
Section 3.08 .
Persons Deemed Owners
     Prior to due presentment of a Debt Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Debt Security is registered as the absolute owner of such Debt Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and premium, if any, and (subject to Sections 3.05 and 3.07) interest (including Additional Interest), if any, on such Debt Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Debt Security is overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
Section 3.09 .
Cancellation by Debt Security Registrar
     All Debt Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Debt Security Registrar, be delivered to the Debt Security Registrar and, if not theretofore canceled, shall be promptly canceled by the Debt Security Registrar. The Company may at any time deliver to the Debt Security Registrar for cancellation any Debt Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever or which the Company shall not have issued and sold, and all Debt Securities so delivered shall be promptly canceled by the Debt Security Registrar. No Debt Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Debt Securities canceled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All certificates representing canceled Debt Securities held by the Debt Security
 
Registrar shall be disposed of in accordance with the customary practices of the Debt Security Registrar at the time in effect, and the Debt Security Registrar shall not be required to destroy any such certificates. The Debt Security Registrar, if other than the trustee, shall promptly deliver a certificate of disposition with respect to such disposed certificates to the Trustee and the Company unless, by a Company Order, similarly delivered, the Company shall direct that canceled Debt Securities be returned to it. The Debt Security Registrar shall promptly deliver evidence of any cancellation of a Debt Security in accordance with this Section to the Trustee and the Company. If the Trustee is the entity acting as Debt Security Registrar, it shall promptly deliver to the Company a certificate of disposition with respect to any certificates disposed of and/or evidence of any cancellation of a Debt Security, in each case in accordance with this Section, if so requested by a Company Order.
Section 3.10 .
Computation of Interest
     Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 for Debt Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, interest on the Debt Securities of each series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
Section 3.11 .
Payment to be in Proper Currency
     In the case of the Debt Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, denominated in any currency other than Dollars or in a composite currency (the "Required Currency"), except as otherwise specified with respect to such Debt Securities as contemplated by Section 3.01, the obligation of the Company to make any payment of the principal thereof, or the premium or interest thereon, shall not be discharged or satisfied by any tender by the Company, or recovery by the Trustee, in any currency other than the Required Currency, except to the extent that such tender or recovery shall result in the Trustee timely holding the full amount of the Required Currency then due and payable. If any such tender or recovery is in a currency other than the Required Currency, the Trustee may take such actions as it considers appropriate to exchange such currency for the Required Currency. The costs and risks of any such exchange, including without limitation the risks of delay and exchange rate fluctuation, shall be borne by the Company, the Company shall remain fully liable for any shortfall or delinquency in the full amount of Required Currency then due and payable, and in no circumstances shall the Trustee be liable therefor except in the case of its negligence or willful misconduct.
Section 3.12 .
CUSIP Numbers
     The Company in issuing the Debt Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Debt Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Debt Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the "CUSIP" numbers.
 
Section 4.01 .
Applicability of Article
     Debt Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, which are redeemable before their Stated Maturity shall be redeemable in accordance with their terms and (except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 for Debt Securities of such series or Tranche) in accordance with this Article.
Section 4.02 .
Election to Redeem; Notice to Trustee
     The election of the Company to redeem any Debt Securities shall be evidenced by a Board Resolution and/or an Officer's Certificate. The Company shall, at least 30 days prior to the Redemption Date fixed by the Company (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the Trustee in writing of such Redemption Date and of the principal amount of such Debt Securities to be redeemed. In the case of any redemption of Debt Securities (a) prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of such Debt Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture or (b) pursuant to an election of the Company which is subject to a condition specified in the terms of such Debt Securities, the Company shall furnish the Trustee with an Officer's Certificate evidencing compliance with such restriction or condition.
Section 4.03 .
Selection of Debt Securities to be Redeemed
     If less than all the Debt Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, are to be redeemed, the particular Debt Securities to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee from the Outstanding Debt Securities of such series or Tranche not previously called for redemption, by such method as shall be provided for any particular series, or, in the absence of any such provision, by such method of random selection as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and which may, in any case, provide for the selection for redemption of portions (equal to the minimum authorized denomination for Debt Securities of such series or Tranche or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal amount of Debt Securities of such series or Tranche of a denomination larger than the minimum authorized denomination for Debt Securities of such series or Tranche; provided, however, that if, as indicated in an Officer's Certificate, the Company shall have offered to purchase all or any principal amount of the Debt Securities then Outstanding of any series, or any Tranche thereof, and less than all of such Debt Securities as to which such offer was made shall have been tendered to the Company for such purchase, the Trustee, if so directed by Company Order, shall select for redemption all or any principal amount of such Debt Securities which have not been so tendered.
     If the Debt Securities are then held in the form of a Global Security, the Trustee shall select Debt Securities to be redeemed in accordance with the customary procedures for the Depositary.
     The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company and the Debt Security Registrar in writing of the Debt Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any Debt Securities selected to be redeemed in part, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.
 
     For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Debt Securities shall relate, in the case of any Debt Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Debt Securities which has been or is to be redeemed.
Section 4.04 .
Notice of Redemption
     Notice of redemption shall be given in the manner provided in Section 1.06 to the Holders of the Debt Securities to be redeemed not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date (unless a shorter or longer period is acceptable to the Trustee).
     All notices of redemption shall state:
     (a) the Redemption Date,
     (b) the Redemption Price (or the method of calculating the Redemption Price),
     (c) if less than all the Debt Securities of any series or Tranche are to be redeemed, the identification of the particular Debt Securities to be redeemed and the portion of the principal amount of any Debt Security to be redeemed in part,
     (d) that on the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest (including Additional Interest), if any, to the Redemption Date, will become due and payable upon each such Debt Security to be redeemed and, if applicable and provided that the Redemption Price is received by the Paying Agent or Agents on or prior to the Redemption Date, that interest (including any Additional Interest) thereon will cease to accrue on and after said date,
     (e) the place or places where such Debt Securities are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest (including Additional Interest), if any, unless it shall have been specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 with respect to such Debt Securities that such surrender shall not be required,
     (f) that the redemption is for a sinking or other fund, if such is the case, and
     (g) such other matters as the Company shall deem desirable or appropriate (including CUSIP numbers with respect to such Debt Securities, if the Company shall so elect, in which event such notice of redemption may contain a disclaimer as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Debt Securities or on such notice of redemption).
     Unless otherwise specified with respect to any Debt Securities in accordance with Section 3.01, with respect to any notice of redemption of Debt Securities at the election of the Company, unless, upon the giving of such notice, such Debt Securities shall be deemed to have been paid in accordance with Section 7.02, such notice may state that such redemption shall be conditional upon the receipt by the Paying Agent or Agents for such Debt Securities, on or prior to the date fixed for such redemption, of money sufficient to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and interest (including Additional Interest), if any, on such Debt Securities and that if such money shall not have been so received such notice shall be of no force or effect and the Company shall
 
not be required to redeem such Debt Securities. In the event that such notice of redemption contains such a condition and such money is not so received, the redemption shall not be made and within a reasonable time thereafter notice shall be given, in the manner in which the notice of redemption was given, that such money was not so received and such redemption was not required to be made, and the Paying Agent or Agents for the Debt Securities otherwise to have been redeemed shall promptly return to the Holders thereof any of such Debt Securities which had been surrendered for payment upon such redemption.
     Notice of redemption of Debt Securities to be redeemed at the election of the Company, and any notice of non-satisfaction of a condition for redemption as aforesaid, shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the Debt Security Registrar in the name and at the expense of the Company. Notice of mandatory redemption of Debt Securities shall be given by the Debt Security Registrar in the name and at the expense of the Company.
Section 4.05 .
Debt Securities Payable on Redemption Date
     Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, and the conditions, if any, set forth in such notice having been satisfied, the Debt Securities or portions thereof so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein specified, and from and after such date (unless, in the case of an unconditional notice of redemption, the Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest (including Additional Interest), if any) such Debt Securities or portions thereof, if interest-bearing, shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any such Debt Security for redemption in accordance with such notice, such Debt Security or portion thereof shall be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest (including Additional Interest), if any, to the Redemption Date; provided, however, that no such surrender shall be a condition to such payment if so specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 with respect to such Debt Security; and provided, further, that except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 with respect to such Debt Security, any installment of interest on any Debt Security the Stated Maturity of which installment is on or prior to the Redemption Date shall be payable to the Holder of such Debt Security, or one or more Predecessor Debt Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the related Regular Record Date according to the terms of such Debt Security and subject to the provisions of Section 3.07.
Section 4.06 .
Debt Securities Redeemed in Part
     Upon the surrender of any Debt Security which is to be redeemed only in part at a Place of Payment therefor (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing), the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Debt Security, without service charge, a new Debt Security or Debt Securities of the same series and Tranche, of any authorized denomination requested by such Holder and of like tenor and in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Debt Security so surrendered.
 
Section 5.01 .
Applicability of Article
     The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to any sinking fund for the retirement of the Debt Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 for Debt Securities of such series or Tranche.
     The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of Debt Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment," and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of Debt Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment." If provided for by the terms of Debt Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, the cash amount of any sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section 5.02. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of Debt Securities of the series or Tranche in respect of which it was made as provided for by the terms of such Debt Securities.
Section 5.02 .
Satisfaction of Sinking Fund Payments with Debt Securities
     The Company (a) may deliver to the Trustee Outstanding Debt Securities (other than any previously called for redemption) of a series or Tranche in respect of which a mandatory sinking fund payment is to be made and (b) may apply as a credit Debt Securities of such series or Tranche which have been redeemed either at the election of the Company pursuant to the terms of such Debt Securities or through the application of permitted optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of such Debt Securities, in each case in satisfaction of all or any part of such mandatory sinking fund payment; provided, however, that no Debt Securities shall be applied in satisfaction of a mandatory sinking fund payment if such Debt Securities shall have been previously so applied. Debt Securities so applied shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the Redemption Price specified in such Debt Securities for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such mandatory sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly.
Section 5.03 .
Redemption of Debt Securities for Sinking Fund
     Not less than 45 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for the Debt Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate specifying:
     (a) the amount of the next succeeding mandatory sinking fund payment for such series or Tranche;
     (b) the amount, if any, of the optional sinking fund payment to be made together with such mandatory sinking fund payment;
     (c) the aggregate sinking fund payment;
 
     (d) the portion, if any, of such aggregate sinking fund payment which is to be satisfied by the payment of cash; and
     (e) the portion, if any, of such aggregate sinking fund payment which is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting Debt Securities of such series or Tranche pursuant to Section 5.02 and stating the basis for such credit and that such Debt Securities have not previously been so credited, and the Company shall also deliver to the Trustee any Debt Securities to be so delivered.
     If the Company shall not have delivered such Officer's Certificate and, to the extent applicable, all such Debt Securities, on or prior to the 45th day prior to such sinking fund payment date, the sinking fund payment for such series or Tranche in respect of such sinking fund payment date shall be made entirely in cash in the amount of the mandatory sinking fund payment. Not less than 30 days before each such sinking fund payment date the Trustee shall select the Debt Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 4.03 and the Debt Security Registrar shall cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the Company in the manner provided in Section 4.04. Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Debt Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Sections 4.05 and 4.06.
Section 6.01 .

Maintenance of Office or Agency
     The Company shall maintain in each Place of Payment for the Debt Securities of each series, or any Tranche thereof, an office or agency where payment of such Debt Securities shall be made, where the registration of transfer or exchange of such Debt Securities may be effected and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of such Debt Securities and this Indenture may be served. The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of each such office or agency and prompt notice to the Holders of any such change in the manner specified in Section 1.06. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency in respect of Debt Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, payment of such Debt Securities shall be made, registration of transfer or exchange thereof may be effected and notices and demands in respect thereof may be served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and the Company hereby appoints the Trustee as its agent for all such purposes in any such event.
     The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies with respect to the Debt Securities of one or more series, or any Tranche thereof, for any or all of
 
the foregoing purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided, however, that, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 with respect to the Debt Securities of such series or Tranche no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency for such purposes in each Place of Payment for such Debt Securities in accordance with the requirements set forth above. The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee, and prompt notice to the Holders in the manner specified in Section 1.06, of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency.

Section 6.03 .
Money for Debt Securities Payments to be Held in Trust
     If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with respect to the Debt Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, it shall, on or before each due date of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest (including Additional Interest), if any, on any of such Debt Securities, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a sum sufficient to pay the principal and premium or interest (including Additional Interest) so becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided. The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee of any failure by the Company (or any other obligor on such Debt Securities) to make any payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest (including Additional Interest), if any, on such Debt Securities.
     Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for the Debt Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, it shall, on or before each due date of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest (including Additional Interest), if any, on such Debt Securities, deposit with such Paying Agents sums sufficient (without duplication) to pay the principal and premium or interest (including Additional Interest) so becoming due, such sum to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such principal, premium or interest (including Additional Interest), and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company shall promptly notify the Trustee of any failure by it so to act.
     The Company shall cause each Paying Agent for the Debt Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, other than the Company or the Trustee, to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent shall:
     (a) hold all sums held by it for the payment of the principal of and premium, if any, or interest (including Additional Interest), if any, on such Debt Securities in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided;
     (b) give the Trustee notice of any failure by the Company (or any other obligor upon such Debt Securities) to make any payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest (including Additional Interest), if any, on such Debt Securities; and
 
     (c) at any time during the continuance of any such default, upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums so held in trust by such Paying Agent and furnish to the Trustee such information as it possesses regarding the names and addresses of the Persons entitled to such sums.
     The Company may at any time pay, or by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent and, if so stated in a Company Order delivered to the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of Article VII; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such money.
     Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of and premium, if any, or interest (including Additional Interest), if any, on any Debt Security and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal and premium, if any, or interest (including Additional Interest) has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company on Company Request, or, if then held by the Company, shall be discharged from such trust; and, upon such payment or discharge, the Holder of such Debt Security shall, as an unsecured general creditor and not as a Holder of an Outstanding Debt Security, look only to the Company for payment of the amount so due and payable and remaining unpaid, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such payment to the Company, may at the expense of the Company cause to be mailed, on one occasion only, notice to such Holder that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such mailing, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be paid to the Company.

Section 6.05 .
Annual Officer's Certificate as to Compliance
     Within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company ending after the date hereof, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate which need not comply with Section 1.02, executed by the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer, the principal accounting officer or treasurer of the Company, stating whether, to such officer's knowledge, the Company is in compliance with all conditions and covenants under this Indenture.

     Any deposits with the Trustee referred to in Section 7.03 above shall be irrevocable (except to the extent provided in Sections 7.04 and 7.07) and shall be made under the terms of an escrow trust agreement. If any Outstanding Debt Securities of a series are to be redeemed prior to their Stated Maturity, whether pursuant to any optional redemption provisions or in accordance with any mandatory or optional sinking fund requirement, the applicable escrow trust agreement shall provide therefor and the Company shall make such arrangements as are satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company. The agreement shall provide that, upon satisfaction of any mandatory sinking fund payment requirements, whether by deposit of moneys, application of proceeds of deposited U.S. Government Obligations or, if permitted, by delivery of Debt Securities, the Trustee shall pay or deliver over to the Company as excess moneys pursuant to Section 7.04 all funds or obligations then held under the agreement and allocable to the sinking fund payment requirements so satisfied.
     If Debt Securities of a series with respect to which such deposits are made may be subject to later redemption at the option of the Company or pursuant to optional sinking fund payments, the applicable escrow trust agreement may, at the option of the Company, provide therefor. In the case of an optional redemption in whole or in part, such agreement shall require the Company to deposit with the Trustee on or before the date notice of redemption is given funds sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of the Debt Securities to be redeemed together with all unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date. Upon such deposit of funds, the Trustee shall pay or deliver over to the Company as excess funds pursuant to Section 7.04 all funds or obligations then held under such agreement and allocable to the Debt Securities to be redeemed. In the case of exercise of optional sinking fund payment rights by the Company, such agreement shall, at the option of the Company, provide that upon deposit by the Company with the Trustee of funds pursuant to such exercise the Trustee shall pay or deliver over to the Company as excess funds pursuant to Section 7.04 all funds or obligations then held under such agreement for such series and allocable to the Securities to be redeemed.

     (b) Subject to the provisions of the foregoing paragraph, any moneys which at any time shall be deposited by the Company or on its behalf with the Trustee or any other Paying Agent for the purpose of paying the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on any of the Securities shall be and are hereby assigned, transferred and set over to the Trustee or such other Paying Agent in trust for the respective Holders of the Debt Securities for the purpose for which such moneys shall have been deposited; but such moneys need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.

Securities of such series and premium, if payment of any thereof be in default, and interest (including Additional Interest) accrued thereon to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by the Holders). If an Event of Default due to default in the performance of any other of the covenants or warranties herein applicable to all Outstanding Debt Securities or an Event of Default specified in Section 8.01(d) or (e) shall have occurred and be continuing, either the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of all Debt Securities then Outstanding (considered as one class), and not the Holders of the Debt Securities of any one of such series, may declare the principal amount (or, if any of the Debt Securities are Discount Debt Securities, such portion of the principal amount of such Debt Securities as may be specified in the terms thereof as contemplated by Section 3.01) of all Debt Securities and premium, if payment of any thereof be in default, and interest accrued thereon to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by the Holders). As a consequence of each such declaration (herein referred to as a declaration of acceleration) with respect to Debt Securities of any series, the principal amount (or portion thereof in the case of Discount Debt Securities) of such Debt Securities, premium, if any, and interest (including Additional Interest) accrued thereon shall become due and payable immediately.
     With respect to a series of Debt Securities to which a credit enhancement is applicable, the applicable supplemental indenture may provide that the provider of such credit enhancement may, if default has occurred and is continuing with respect to such series, have all or any part of the rights with respect to remedies that would otherwise have been exercisable by the Holders of Debt Securities of that series.
     At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to Debt Securities of any series shall have been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due shall have been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Event or Events of Default giving rise to such declaration of acceleration shall, without further act, be deemed to have been waived, and such declaration and its consequences shall, without further act, be deemed to have been rescinded and annulled, if
     (a) the Company shall have paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay
     (1) all overdue interest on all Debt Securities of such series;
     (2) the principal of and premium, if any, on any Debt Securities of such series which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest and Additional Interest thereon at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Debt Securities;
     (3) any accrued Additional Interest on all Debt Securities of such series;
     (4) all amounts due to the Trustee under Section 9.07;
and
 
     (b) any other Event or Events of Default with respect to Debt Securities of such series, other than the non-payment of the principal of Debt Securities of such series which shall have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, shall have been cured or waived as provided in Section 8.13.
     No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
Section 8.03 .

     If an Event of Default described in clause (a) or (b) of Section 8.01 shall have occurred and be continuing, the Company shall, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the Holders of the Debt Securities of the series with respect to which such Event of Default shall have occurred, the whole amount then due and payable on such Debt Securities for principal and premium, if any, and interest, if any, and, to the extent permitted by law, (i) interest on premium, if any, (ii) interest on any overdue principal and (iii) Additional Interest, at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Debt Securities, and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover any amounts due to the Trustee under Section 9.07.
     If the Company shall fail to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree and may enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon such Debt Securities and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon such Debt Securities, wherever situated.
     If an Event of Default with respect to Debt Securities of any series shall have occurred and be continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Debt Securities of such series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.

     (c) No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct, except that prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default and after the curing or waiving of all Events of Default which may have occurred:

     (ii) in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Trustee, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon any certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; but, in the case of any such certificates or opinions that by any provision hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture (but need not to confirm or investigate the accuracy of any mathematical calculations or other facts stated therein).

     (e) The Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith, in accordance with any remedy available to the Trustee, or with the direction of the Holders of Debt Securities pursuant to Section 8.12, relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under this Indenture.

     (g) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Indenture to the contrary, the duties and responsibilities of the Trustee under this Indenture shall be subject to the protections, exculpations and limitations on liability afforded to the Trustee under the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act, including those provisions of such Act deemed by such Act to be included herein.
     (h) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section.
Section 9.02 .
Notice of Defaults

For the purpose of this Section, the term "default" means any event which is, or after notice or lapse of time, or both, would become, an Event of Default. The Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as a committee of its Responsible Officers in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interests of the Holders.

A successor to any co-trustee or separate trustee so resigned or removed may be appointed in the manner provided in this Section;
     (d) no co-trustee or separate trustee hereunder shall be personally liable by reason of any act or omission of the Trustee, or any other such trustee hereunder; and

Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Debt Securities by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent. Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the Company and shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States, any State or territory thereof or the District of Columbia or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section.
     Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency or corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be an Authenticating Agent, provided such corporation shall be otherwise eligible under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent.
     An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving 45 days written notice thereof to the Trustee and to the Company. The Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of an
 
Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time such Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent which shall be acceptable to the Company. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent. No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section.
     The Company agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to time reasonable compensation for its services under this Section.
     The provisions of Sections 3.08, 9.04 and 9.05 shall be applicable to each Authenticating Agent.
     If an appointment with respect to the Debt Securities of one or more series, or any Tranche thereof, shall be made pursuant to this Section, the Debt Securities of such series or Tranche may have endorsed thereon, in addition to the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an alternate certificate of authentication substantially in the following form:
     This is one of the Debt Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.

     If all of the Debt Securities of a series may not be originally issued at one time, and if the Trustee does not have an office capable of authenticating Debt Securities upon original issuance located in a Place of Payment where the Company wishes to have Debt Securities of such series authenticated upon original issuance, the Trustee, if so requested by the Company in writing (which writing need not comply with Section 1.02 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel), shall appoint, in accordance with this Section and in accordance with such procedures as shall be acceptable to the Trustee, an Authenticating Agent having an office in a Place of Payment designated by the Company with respect to such series of Debt Securities.

Delivery of such reports, information and documents by the Company to the Trustee is for informational purposes only, and the Trustee's receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Company's compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officer's Certificates).

Devon Energy Corporation 20 North Broadway Oklahoma City, OK 73102
Ladies and Gentlemen:
          We have acted as special counsel to Devon Energy Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 2.40% Senior Notes due July 15, 2016, $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 4.00% Senior Notes due July 15, 2021, and $1,250 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 5.60% Senior Notes due July 15, 2041 (collectively, the "Debt Securities"), to be issued under the Indenture, dated as of July 12, 2011 (the "Base Indenture"), as amended and supplemented by Supplemental Indenture No. 1, dated as of July 12, 2011 (the "Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"), between the Company and UMB Bank, National Association, as trustee for the Debt Securities (the "Trustee"). The Company entered into an underwriting agreement, dated as of July 5, 2011 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), with Goldman, Sachs & Co., Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and UBS Securities LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), relating to the sale by the Company to the Underwriters of the Debt Securities.
          This opinion is being furnished in accordance with the requirements of Item 601(b)(5) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").
          In rendering the opinion stated herein, we have examined and relied upon the following:
 
Devon Energy Corporation July 12, 2011 Page 2
          We have also examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such records of the Company and such agreements, certificates and receipts of public officials, certificates of officers or other representatives of the Company and others, and such other documents as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinions stated below.
          In our examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures including endorsements, the legal capacity and competency of all natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as facsimile, electronic, certified or photostatic copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such copies. As to any facts relevant to the opinions stated herein that we did not independently establish or verify, we have relied upon statements and representations of officers and other representatives of the Company and others and of public officials.
          We do not express any opinion with respect to the laws of any jurisdiction other than (i) the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and (ii) the laws of the State of
 
Devon Energy Corporation July 12, 2011 Page 3
New York that, in our experience, are normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Registration Statement and to the extent that judicial or regulatory orders or decrees or consents, approvals, licenses, authorizations, validations, filings, recordings or registrations with governmental authorities are relevant, to those required under such laws (all of the foregoing being referred to as "Opined on Law"), or as to the effect of any such non-Opined on Law on the opinions stated herein. The Indenture and the Note Certificates are referred to herein collectively as the "Transaction Documents."
          Based upon the foregoing and subject to the limitations, qualifications, exceptions and assumptions stated herein, we are of the opinion that when duly authenticated by the Trustee and issued and delivered by the Company against payment therefor in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture, the Debt Securities will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms under the laws of the State of New York.
          The opinion stated herein is subject to the following qualifications:
     (a) the opinions stated herein are limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer, preference and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in equity or at law);
     (b) except to the extent expressly stated in the opinions contained herein, we do not express any opinion with respect to the effect on the opinions stated herein of (i) the compliance or non-compliance of any party to any of the Transaction Documents with any laws, rules or regulations applicable to such party or (ii) the legal status or legal capacity of any such party to any of the Transaction Documents;
     (c) except to the extent expressly stated in the opinions contained herein, we have assumed that each of the Transaction Documents constitutes the valid and binding obligation of each party to such Transaction Document, enforceable against such party in accordance with its terms; and
     (d) to the extent that any opinion relates to the enforceability of the choice of New York law and choice of New York forum provisions contained in any Transaction Document, the opinions stated herein are rendered solely in reliance upon New York General Obligations Law sections 5-1401 and 5-1402 and Rule 327(b) of New York Civil Practice Law and Rules and are subject to the qualification that such enforceability may be limited by, in each case, the terms of such sections 5-1401 and 5-1402, as well as by principles of public policy, comity or constitutionality.
          In addition, in rendering the foregoing opinion we have assumed that neither the execution and delivery by the Company of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party nor the performance by the Company of its obligations under the Transaction Documents (i) constitutes or will constitute a violation of, or a default under, any lease, indenture, instrument or other agreement to which the Company or its property is subject, (ii) contravenes or will contravene any order or decree of any governmental authority to which the Company or its

property is subject, (iii) violates or will violate any law, rule or regulation to which the Company or its property is subject or (iv) requires the consent, approval, licensing or authorization of, or any filing, recording or registration with, any governmental authority under any law, rule or regulation of any jurisdiction.
          We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion with the Commission as an exhibit to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K, being filed on the date hereof, and incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement. We also hereby consent to the reference to our firm under the caption "Legal Matters" in the prospectus forming a part of the Registration Statement.
