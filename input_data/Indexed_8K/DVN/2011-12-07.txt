(e) On December 1, 2011, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Devon Energy Corporation (the "Company") granted two new types of awards to certain key employees, including the Company's executive officers, under the Company's 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan")Performance Restricted Stock ("PRS") and Performance Share Unit ("PSU") awards (together, the "Awards"). The aggregate dollar value of each participant's 2012 long-term incentive is composed of the following three types of equity awards: approximately one-third in the form of a non-qualified stock option award, one-third in the form of a PRS Award, and one-third in the form of a PSU Award. The terms of the Company's non-qualified stock option awards granted under the Plan are materially consistent with previously disclosed terms and are subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Company's standard form of non-qualified stock option agreement.
Performance Restricted Stock Awards
The PRS Award agreement provides that, if the cash flow performance goal is attained, the Award will vest in four equal installments as follows: 25% of the shares will vest upon completion of the performance period (January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012) and the Committee's certification of the attainment of the performance goal, with the balance of the Award to vest in three equal annual installments on the second, third, and fourth anniversaries of the grant date. When this goal was established, the Committee believed that it was challenging, yet achievable based on a review of the Company's performance and its business goals and objectives for the 2012 performance period. The Company has determined that the cash flow performance goal constitutes confidential information and will disclose it in the 2013 proxy once the performance period has been completed.
If the performance goal is not attained and certified as to attainment by the Committee, the Award will generally be forfeited in its entirety.Except as described below, in the event of a participant's termination of employment prior to the end of the performance period, any unvested portion of the PRS Award will be forfeited. In the event of a change in control (as defined in the Award agreement) or death of a participant during the performance period, regardless of whether the performance goal is achieved, the performance period will be deemed to end immediately prior to such event and the PRS Award will immediately vest. In the event of a participant's disability during the performance period, the Committee, in its discretion, may elect to vest all or a portion of the unvested PRS Award at the participant's employment termination date. If a participant's employment is terminated and the participant is entitled to a severance payment under certain, specified circumstances and the participant executes a release of claims against the Company, the PRS Award will vest (if the performance goal is attained). If a participant's termination occurs by reason of certain, specified retirement circumstances, the Committee may determine, in its sole discretion, that the PRS Award will continue to vest following the employment termination date in accordance with the applicable vesting schedule and as otherwise provided in the Award agreement, including requiring the participant to execute a non-disclosure agreement. The holder of a PRS Award has no right to vote or receive dividends upon the PRS Award until after completion of the performance period and the Committee's certification of attainment of the performance goal. If the Committee certifies that the performance goal has been attained, accrued dividends will be paid to the participant, except that any extraordinary dividends will only be paid if the Award fully vests.
Performance Share Unit Awards
The PSU Award agreement provides that vesting of the PSUs is dependent on the achievement of relative total shareholder return ("TSR") performance goals (as compared to a peer group of companies) over specified performance periods. 50% of the target PSU Award is subject to a two-year performance period (January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2013) and 50% of the target PSU Award is subject to a three-year performance period (January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2014). Each PSU represents one share of the Company's common stock. The companies comprising the TSR peer group are as follows: Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, Apache Corporation, Chesapeake Energy Corporation, Chevron Corporation, ConocoPhillips, EnCana Corporation, EOG Resources, Inc., Hess Corporation, Marathon Oil Corporation, Murphy Oil Corporation, Noble Energy, Inc., Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Pioneer Natural Resources Company and Talisman Energy, Inc.
The following chart describes at what levels the PSUs vest, if at all, based on the Company's TSR ranking relative to the peer companies for each of the two- and three-year performance periods.
 
If earned, the maximum amount pay-out of any PSU Award is two times the aggregate target Award amount. If a participant's employment terminates by reason of disability or under certain, specified retirement circumstances, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, determine that the PSUs will continue to vest following the termination date and the amount of the Award earned will be based on actual performance as determined by the Committee after the end of the performance period and, if termination is due to retirement, additional conditions may apply such as the participant's execution of a non-disclosure agreement. If a participant's employment is terminated and the participant is entitled to a severance payment under certain specified circumstances and the participant executes a release of claims against the Company, the PSUs will continue to vest following the termination date and the amount of the Award earned will be based on actual performance as determined by the Committee after the end of the performance period. In the event of a change of control (as defined in the Award agreement) or death, the PSU Award will become fully and immediately vested at a target award level. A participant will not have any voting rights with respect to the PSU Award. The PSUs will include dividend equivalent rights which will vest and be paid in cash to the participant at the same time and subject to the same conditions as the PSUs. Such dividend equivalent rights will be forfeited if the PSUs do not vest and are forfeited or canceled.
PRS and PSU Awards Granted to Certain Officers
The below chart details PRS and PSU Awards granted to each of the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and any other officer receiving an Award and included as a "named executive officer" in the Company's proxy statement filed on April 27, 2011 for its annual meeting held on June 8, 2011.

Re: Non-Disclosure Agreement
Ladies and Gentlemen:
This letter agreement is entered between Devon Energy Corporation (together with its subsidiaries and affiliates, the "Company") and the undersigned (the "Participant") in connection with that certain Performance Restricted Stock Award Agreement (the "Agreement") dated                 , 20    between the Company and the Participant. All capitalized terms used in this letter agreement shall have the same meaning ascribed to them in the Agreement unless specifically denoted otherwise.
The Participant acknowledges that, during the course of and in connection with the employment relationship between the Participant and the Company, the Company provided and the Participant accepted access to the Company's trade secrets and confidential and proprietary information, which included, without limitation, information pertaining to the Company's finances, oil and gas properties and prospects, compensation structures, business and litigation strategies and future business plans and other information or material that is of special and unique value to the Company and that the Company maintains as confidential and does not disclose to the general public, whether through its annual report and/or filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or otherwise (the "Confidential Information").
The Participant acknowledges that his position with the Company was one of trust and confidence because of the access to the Confidential Information, requiring the Participant's best efforts and utmost diligence to protect and maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information. Unless required by the Company or with the Company's express written consent, the Participant will not, during the term of this letter agreement, directly or indirectly, disclose to others or use for his own benefit or the benefit of another any of the Confidential Information, whether or not the Confidential Information is acquired, learned, attained or developed by the Participant alone or in conjunction with others.
The Participant agrees that, due to his access to the Confidential Information, the Participant would inevitably use and/or disclose that Confidential Information in breach of his confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations if the Participant worked in certain capacities or engaged in certain activities for a period of time following his employment with the Company, specifically in a position that involves (i) responsibility and decision-making authority or input at the executive level regarding any subject or responsibility, (ii) decision-making responsibility or input at any management level in
 
the Participant's individual area of assignment with the Company, or (iii) responsibility and decision-making authority or input that otherwise allows the use of the Confidential Information (collectively referred to as the "Restricted Occupation"). Therefore, except with the prior written consent of the Company, during the term of this letter agreement, the Participant agrees not to be employed by, consult for or otherwise act on behalf of any person or entity in any capacity in which he would be involved, directly or indirectly, in a Restricted Occupation. The Participant acknowledges that this commitment is intended to protect the Confidential Information and is not intended to be applied or interpreted as a covenant against competition.
The Participant further agrees that during the term of this letter agreement, the Participant will not, directly or indirectly on behalf of a person or entity or otherwise, (i) solicit any of the established customers of the Company or attempt to induce any of the established customers of the Company to cease doing business with the Company, or (ii) solicit any of the employees of the Company to cease employment with the Company.
This letter agreement shall become effective upon execution by the Participant and the Company and shall terminate on December 31, 20    .
[Note: Insert date that is the end of the calendar year of the letter agreement.]
If you agree to the above terms and conditions, please execute a copy of this letter agreement below and return a copy to me.
 
 
THE UNDERSIGNED HEREBY ACCEPTS AND AGREES TO THE TERMS SET FORTH ABOVE AS OF THIS     DAY OF         ,     .
 
 
I hereby certify that I am in full compliance with the covenants contained in that certain letter agreement (the "Agreement") dated as of         ,     between Devon Energy Corporation and me and have been in full compliance with such covenants at all times during the period ending                         ,     .
 
 

Exhibit 10.2
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Effective , you have been granted a target award of Performance Share Units ("Award") under the Devon Energy Corporation 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Each Performance Share Unit that vests entitles you to one share of Devon Energy Corporation (the "Company") Common Stock. The vesting of these Performance Share Units is dependent upon the Company's Total Shareholder Return ("TSR") over the specified Performance Periods. Fifty percent (50%) of the target Award is subject to a two-year Performance Period that begins and ends (the "20    -20     Performance Period") and 50% of the target Award is subject to a three-year Performance Period that begins and ends (the "20    -20     Performance Period"). The 20    -20     and 20    -20     Performance Periods may each be individually referred to as a "Performance Period." The maximum number of Performance Share Units that you can earn during each Performance Period will be calculated as follows: x 50% x 200%, with actual payout based on the performance level achieved by the Company with respect to the Performance Goal set forth on Schedule A.

General Vesting Terms
 
(c) If a Participant's Date of Termination occurs by reason of disability, Normal Retirement Date, Early Retirement Date, or other special circumstances (as determined by the Committee), and the Committee determines, in its sole and absolute discretion, that the Performance Share Units shall continue to vest following the Participant's Date of Termination, the Participant shall vest in the maximum number of Performance Share Units in which the Participant could vest, based on the actual level at which the Performance Goal is attained and certified for the Performance Period, as if the Participant remained in the employ of the Company through the end of the Performance Period, provided that, if the Participant is Retirement Eligible, such continued vesting shall be subject to the satisfaction of the conditions in Section 15 (except in the case of the Participant's disability).
(d) Performance Share Units shall continue to vest and the Participant shall vest in the maximum number of Performance Share Units in which the Participant could vest, based on the actual level at which the Performance Goal is attained and certified for the Performance Period, as if the Participant remained in the employ of the Company through the end of the Performance Period following the Participant's Date of Termination that occurs under circumstances in which the Participant is entitled to a severance payment from the Company, a Subsidiary, or an Affiliated Entity under (A) the Participant's employment agreement or severance agreement with the Company due to a termination of the Participant's employment by the Company without "cause" or by the Participant for "good reason" in accordance with the Participant's employment agreement or severance agreement or (B) the Devon Energy Corporation Severance Plan, provided that for a severance related termination, the Participant signs and returns to the Company a release of claims against the Company in a form prepared by the Company (the "Release") and such Release becomes effective.

Dividend Equivalents shall be credited to the bookkeeping account established on the records of the Company for the Participant and will vest and be paid in cash to the Participant at the same time, and subject to the same conditions, as are applicable to the underlying Performance Share Units.

2. . The Performance Goal is based on total shareholder return ("TSR"). TSR shall mean the rate of return stockholders receive through stock price changes and the assumed reinvestment of dividends over the Performance Period. Vesting will be based on the Company's TSR ranking relative to the TSR ranking of the Peer Companies (identified in Section 3(d) below). At the end of the Performance Period, the TSR for the Company, and for each Peer Company, shall be determined pursuant to the following formula:
Performance Goal
 
The result shall be rounded to the nearest hundredth of one percent (.01%).
(a) The term "Closing Average Share Value" means the average value of the common stock for the 30 trading days ending on the last day of the Performance Period, which shall be calculated as follows: (i) determine the closing price of the common stock on each trading date during 30-day period and (ii) average the amounts so determined for the 30-day period.
(b) The term "Opening Average Share Value" means the average value of the common stock for the 30 trading days preceding the start of the Performance Period, which shall be calculated as follows: (i) determine the closing price of the common stock on each trading date during the 30-day period and (ii) average the amounts so determined for the 30-day period.
(c) "Reinvested Dividends" shall be calculated by multiplying (i) the aggregate number of shares (including fractional shares) that could have been purchased during the Performance Period had each cash dividend paid on a single share during that period been immediately reinvested in additional shares (or fractional shares) at the closing selling price per share on the applicable dividend payment date by (ii) the average daily closing price per share calculated for the entire duration of the Performance Period.
(d) Each of the foregoing amounts shall be equitably adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and other similar events affecting the shares in question without the issuer's receipt of consideration.
 
3. . The Performance Share Units will vest based on the Company's relative TSR ranking in respect of the Performance Period as compared to the TSR ranking of the Peer Companies, in accordance with the following schedule:
Vesting Schedule
 
(a) The actual number of Performance Share Units that vest for each Performance Period may range from 0% to 200% multiplied by 50% of the target Award, with the actual percentage to be determined on the basis of the percentile level at which the Committee certifies that the Performance Goal has been attained in relation to the corresponding Performance Goal for Peer Companies for the Performance Period; provided however, that the maximum number of Performance Share Units that may become earned and vested during each Performance Period will be calculated as follows: %%TOTAL_SHARES_GRANTED%-% x 50% x 200%. The Committee retains sole discretion to reduce the vesting percentage (and thus the number of Performance Share Units that vest), including reduction to zero, without regard to the performance of the Company's TSR relative to the TSR of the Peer Companies.
(b) If the Company's final TSR value is equal to the TSR value of a Peer Company, the Committee shall assign the Company the higher ranking.
(c) In addition to the Company, the Peer Companies are Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, Apache Corporation, Chesapeake Energy Corporation, Chevron Corporation, ConocoPhillips, EnCana Corporation, EOG Resources, Inc., Hess Corporation, Marathon Oil Corporation, Murphy Oil Corporation, Noble Energy, Inc., Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Pioneer Natural Resources Company, and Talisman Energy, Inc.
(d) The Peer Companies will be subject to change as follows:
(i) In the event of a merger, acquisition or business combination transaction of a Peer Company, in which the Peer Company is the surviving entity and remains publicly traded, the surviving entity shall remain a Peer Company. Any entity involved in the transaction that is not the surviving company shall no longer be a Peer Company.
(ii) In the event of a merger, acquisition or business combination transaction of a Peer Company, a "going private" transaction or other event involving a Peer Company or the liquidation of a Peer Company, in each case where the Peer Company is not the surviving entity or is no longer publicly traded, the company shall no longer be a Peer Company.
 
(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a bankruptcy of a Peer Company where the Peer Company is not publicly traded at the end of the Performance Period, such company shall remain a Peer Company but shall be deemed to have a TSR of negative 100% (-100%).
(iv) If a Peer Company ceases to be a publicly traded company at any time during the Performance Period, such company will be replaced as a Peer Company by a company that has been pre-approved by the Committee as a replacement company, provided that each such replacement company satisfies the requirement to be a Peer Company throughout the Performance Period.
4. . Any fractional Performance Share Unit resulting from the vesting of the Performance Share Units in accordance with the Award Agreement shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number. Any portion of the Performance Share Units that does not vest as of the end of the Performance Period shall be forfeited as of the end of the Performance Period.
