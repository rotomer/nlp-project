Information Regarding Forward-Looking Estimates
This report includes our 2012 forward-looking estimates and associated forward-looking statements regarding our expectations and plans, as well as future events or conditions. Such forward-looking statements are based on our examination of historical operating trends, the information used to prepare our December 31, 2011 reserve reports and other data in our possession or available from third parties. Such statements are subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. Consequently, actual future results could differ materially from our expectations due to a number of factors, such as changes in the supply of and demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs and related products and services; exploration or drilling programs; political or regulatory events; general economic and financial market conditions; and other factors discussed in this report.
All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to Devon, or persons acting on its behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements. We assume no duty to update or revise our forward-looking statements based on new information, future events or otherwise.
Financial amounts related to our Canadian operations in the following tables have been converted to U.S. dollars using estimated average exchange rates of $1.00 U.S. dollar to $1.00 Canadian dollar.
Oil, Gas and NGL Production and Prices
We estimate that our combined oil, gas and NGL production will total 253 to 257 MMBoe (690 to 700 MBoepd). Set forth below are our estimates of oil, gas and NGL production.
 
We expect our floating prices for production from each of our operating areas to differ from the NYMEX price as set forth in the following table. The price for oil and the NGLs relationship to crude oil is determined using the monthly average of NYMEX settled prices on each trading day for benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude oil delivered at Cushing, Oklahoma. The NYMEX price for gas is determined using the first-of-month South Louisiana Henry Hub price index as published monthly in .
