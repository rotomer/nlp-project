The Company is filing the Supplemental Indenture as Exhibit 4.1 to this report. By filing this report, the Company is causing this exhibit to be incorporated by reference herein.
The Notes are general obligations of the Company, which rank equally with all existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt of the Company.

The Indenture limits the ability of the Company to incur liens, consolidate, merge or sell its assets, in each case subject to certain qualifications set forth in the Indenture.
The 2017 Notes will mature on May 15, 2017. The 2022 Notes will mature on May 15, 2022. The 2042 Notes will mature on May 15, 2042.

At all other times, the Company may, at its option, redeem the Notes in whole or in part at a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the notes then outstanding to be redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) from the redemption date to the maturity date computed in accordance with the Indenture, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date.

This Debt Security is one of the duly authorized series of Debt Securities designated on the face hereof, and the aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities to be issued under such series is initially limited to $750,000,000, subject to the Company's right to increase such limit as provided in the Indenture (except for Debt Securities authenticated and delivered upon transfer of, or in exchange for, or in lieu of other Debt Securities). All terms used in this Debt Security which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

Furthermore, provisions in the Indenture permit the Holders of not less than a majority of the aggregate principal amount, in certain instances, of the Outstanding Debt Securities of any series to waive, on behalf of all of the Holders of Debt Securities of such series, certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Debt Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Debt Security and other Debt Securities issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Debt Security.

This Debt Security is one of the duly authorized series of Debt Securities designated on the face hereof, and the aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities to be issued under such series is initially limited to $1,000,000,000, subject to the Company's right to increase such limit as provided in the Indenture (except for Debt Securities authenticated and delivered upon transfer of, or in exchange for, or in lieu of other Debt Securities). All terms used in this Debt Security which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

Furthermore, provisions in the Indenture permit the Holders of not less than a majority of the aggregate principal amount, in certain instances, of the Outstanding Debt Securities of any series to waive, on behalf of all of the Holders of Debt Securities of such series, certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Debt Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Debt Security and other Debt Securities issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Debt Security.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special counsel to Devon Energy Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the public offering of $750 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 1.875% Senior Notes due May 15, 2017, $1,000 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 3.250% Senior Notes due May 15, 2022, and $750 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 4.750% Senior Notes due May 15, 2042 (collectively, the "Debt Securities"), to be issued under the Indenture, dated as of July 12, 2011 (the "Base Indenture"), as amended and supplemented by Supplemental Indenture No. 2, dated as of May 14, 2012 (the "Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"), between the Company and UMB Bank, National Association, as trustee for the Debt Securities (the "Trustee"). The Company entered into an underwriting agreement, dated as of May 7, 2012 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), with Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), relating to the sale by the Company to the Underwriters of the Debt Securities.
This opinion is being furnished in accordance with the requirements of Item 601(b)(5) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").
In rendering the opinion stated herein, we have examined and relied upon the following:

In our examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures including endorsements, the legal capacity and competency of all natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as facsimile, electronic, certified or photostatic copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such copies.

We do not express any opinion with respect to the laws of any jurisdiction other than (i) the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and (ii) the laws of the State of New York that, in our experience, are normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Registration Statement and to the extent that judicial or regulatory orders or

(c) except to the extent expressly stated in the opinion contained herein, we have assumed that each of the Transaction Documents constitutes the valid and binding obligation of each party to such Transaction Document, enforceable against such party in accordance with its terms; and
(d) to the extent that the opinion relates to the enforceability of the choice of New York law and choice of New York forum provisions contained in any Transaction Document, the opinion stated herein is rendered solely in reliance upon New York General Obligations Law sections 5-1401 and 5-1402 and Rule 327(b) of New York Civil Practice Law and Rules and are subject to the qualification that such enforceability may be limited by, in each case, the terms of such sections 5-1401 and 5-1402, as well as by principles of public policy, comity or constitutionality.
