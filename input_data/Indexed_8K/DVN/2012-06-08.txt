At the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on June 6, 2012 (the "Annual Meeting"), the stockholders of Devon Energy Corporation (the "Company") approved the 2012 Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2012 Plan") and the 2012 Amendment to the 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "2009 Plan Amendment"). As described in the Company's 2012 Proxy Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 30, 2012 (the "2012 Proxy Statement"), the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") and/or a committee thereof previously approved the 2012 Plan and the 2009 Plan Amendment, in each case subject to stockholder approval.
2012 Plan
The 2012 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board (the "Compensation Committee") and provides for the grant of incentive cash bonuses that are intended to comply with Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Participation in the 2012 Plan is limited to employees who are selected for participation in the 2012 Plan by the Compensation Committee and (i) who hold the title or position of executive vice president or above or (ii) who are officers subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
Under the 2012 Plan, participants will be eligible to receive bonuses based upon the attainment of performance goals established by the Compensation Committee for a designated performance period that may range from a minimum period of 12 months to a maximum period of 36 months. The awards will be based on the achievement of one or more of the following performance goals: earnings; earnings per share (actual or targeted growth); earnings before interest and taxes; pretax earnings before interest, depreciation, amortization, exploration and abandonment costs; pretax operating earnings after interest expense and before incentives, service fees, and extraordinary or special items or operating income; revenues; sales; debt level; cost reduction targets; interest-sensitivity gap levels; cash flow (including but not limited to free cash flow, net cash flow, net cash flow before financing activities, cash flow from operations, increase in cash flow return); capital expenditures; weighted average cost of capital; debt/proved reserves; net income or gross income (including but not limited to income after capital costs and income before or after taxes); operating income; expense; working capital; operating or profit margin; pre-tax margin; contribution margin; return factors (including, but not limited to return on equity, capital employed, or investment; risk adjusted return on capital; return on investors' capital; return on average equity; return on assets; and return on net assets); book value; operating expenses (including, but not limited to lease operating expenses, severance taxes and other production taxes, gathering and transportation and general and administrative costs); unit costs; net borrowing, debt leverage levels, credit quality, or debt ratings; accomplishment of mergers, acquisitions, dispositions, or similar business transactions (including, but not limited to acquisition goals based on value of assets acquired or similar objectives); debt to debt plus stockholder equity; debt to EBIT or EBITDA; interest coverage; total stockholder return;
 
comparative stockholder return; market price per share; book value per share; net asset value per share; growth measures; debt to total capitalization ratio; asset quality levels; investments; economic value added; stock price appreciation; market capitalization; accounts receivables day sales outstanding; accounts receivables to sales; achievement of balance sheet or income statement objectives; market share; assets; asset sale targets; non-performing assets; satisfactory internal or external audits; improvement of financial ratings; charge-offs; regulatory compliance; employee retention/attrition rates; individual business objectives; risk management activities, corporate value measures which may be objectively determined (including ethics, compliance, environmental, diversity commitment, and safety); amount of the oil and gas reserves; costs of finding oil and gas reserves; reserve replacement ratio, reserve additions, or other reserve level measures; drilling results; natural gas and/or oil production, production and reserve growth; implementation or completion of critical projects or processes; production volume; sales volume; production efficiency; inventory to sales; and inventory turns. The Compensation Committee will determine the manner in which such performance goals are measured, which measurement may also be on the basis of the Company's performance relative to the performance of other entities or of any of the Company's business units or divisions or any parent or subsidiary entity, on an absolute basis, relative to internal business plans, or based on growth.
The maximum bonus payment that any one participant may receive under the 2012 Plan is limited to $5,000,000 in each 12-month period included within the applicable performance period. A participant will not be entitled to any bonus payment for a particular performance period if that participant's employment with the Company (or its subsidiaries) ceases for any reason prior to the end of that period. However, the Compensation Committee will have complete discretion to award a full or pro-rated bonus, based on the level at which the applicable performance goals are attained for the performance period, to a participant who ceases employee status prior to such payment date by reason of death or disability or in connection with an involuntary reduction in force. All bonuses under the 2012 Plan will be subject to any applicable clawback or recoupment policy of the Company.
The foregoing brief description of the 2012 Plan does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the 2012 Plan filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this report and incorporated by reference herein.
2009 Plan Amendment
The 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "2009 Plan") is an omnibus incentive plan that provides for the grant of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units, stock appreciation rights, and performance-based awards to eligible participants. The modifications to the 2009 Plan that are implemented by the 2009 Plan Amendment include the following:

Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year
At the Annual Meeting, the Company's stockholders approved an amendment (the "Special Meeting Charter Amendment") to the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the "Certificate of Incorporation") that adds a right permitting holders of record, who have continuously held in the aggregate for at least one year at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the voting power of the Company's outstanding capital stock, to call a special meeting of stockholders by written request filed with the Secretary of the Company, provided that such written request is made in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.

C.

(2) In the event of the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation, after distribution in full of the preferential amounts, if any (fixed in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph B of this Article IV), to be distributed to the holders of Preferred Stock by reason thereof, the holders of Common Stock shall, subject to the additional rights, if any (fixed in accordance with the
 
provisions of Paragraph B of this Article IV), of the holders of any outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, be entitled to receive all of the remaining assets of the Corporation, tangible and intangible, of whatever kind available for distribution to stockholders ratably in proportion to the number of shares of Common Stock held by them respectively.

No stockholder of the Corporation shall by reason of his holding shares of any class or series of stock of the Corporation have any preemptive or preferential right to purchase, acquire, subscribe for or otherwise receive any additional, unissued or treasury shares (whether now or hereafter acquired) of any class or series of stock of the Corporation now or hereafter to be authorized, or any notes, debentures, bonds or other securities convertible into or carrying any right, option or warrant to purchase, acquire, subscribe for or otherwise receive shares of any class or series of stock of the Corporation now or hereafter to be authorized, whether or not the issuance of any such shares, or such notes, debentures, bonds or other securities, would adversely affect the dividends or voting or other rights of such stockholder, and the Board may issue or authorize the issuance of shares of any class or series of stock of the Corporation, or any notes, debentures, bonds or other securities convertible into or carrying rights, options or warrants to purchase, acquire, subscribe for or otherwise receive shares of any class or series of stock of the Corporation, without offering any such shares of any such class, either in whole or in part, to the existing stockholders of any class.
E. Cumulative voting of shares of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation having voting rights is not permitted.
A. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be conducted and managed by, or under the direction of, the Board. The number of directors which shall constitute the entire Board shall not be less than three nor more than twenty, and shall be determined by resolution adopted by a majority of the entire Board. Except as otherwise provided pursuant to Article IV of this Certificate of Incorporation relating to additional directors elected by the holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock, no decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board shall shorten the term of any incumbent director.
 
B. All directors of the Corporation shall be of one class and shall be elected annually. Each director shall serve for a term ending at the next following annual meeting of stockholders, and until such director's successor shall have been duly elected and qualified, subject to his earlier death, disqualification, resignation or removal.
C. Except as otherwise provided for or fixed pursuant to the provisions of Article IV relating to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect additional directors, and subject to the provisions hereof, newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors, and any vacancies on the Board resulting from death, resignation, disqualification, removal, or other cause, may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors then in office, even though less than a quorum of the Board.

D.

Except as otherwise provided by the Board in the resolution or resolutions establishing such series, whenever the holders of any series of Preferred Stock having such right to elect additional directors are divested of such right pursuant to the provisions of such stock, the terms of office of all such additional directors elected by the holders of such stock, or elected to fill any vacancies resulting from the death, resignation, disqualification or removal of such additional directors, shall forthwith terminate and the total and authorized number of directors of the Corporation shall be reduced accordingly.
A. Meetings of stockholders of the Corporation may be held within or without the State of Delaware, as the Bylaws of the Corporation may provide. Except as otherwise provided for or fixed pursuant to the provisions of Article IV relating to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, special meetings of stockholders of the Corporation may be called only (i) pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the then-authorized number of directors of the Corporation, (ii) if permitted by the Bylaws of the Corporation, by the Chairman of the Board or the President of the Corporation as and in the manner provided in the Bylaws of the Corporation, or (iii) by the Secretary of the Corporation upon receipt of the written request of one or more record holders owning, and having held continuously for a period of at least one year prior to the date such request is delivered, an aggregate of not less than 25% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote on the matter
 
or matters to be brought before the proposed special meeting, provided that such written request is made in accordance with and subject to the applicable requirements and procedures of the Bylaws of the Corporation, including any limitations on the stockholders' ability to request a special meeting set forth in the Bylaws of the Corporation. Special meetings of stockholders may not be called by any other person or persons or in any other manner. Elections of directors need not be by written ballot unless the Bylaws of the Corporation shall so provide.
B. In addition to the powers conferred on the Board by this Certificate of Incorporation and by the General Corporation Law, and without limiting the generality thereof, the Board is specifically authorized from time to time, by resolution of the Board without additional authorization by the stockholders of the Corporation, to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation, in such form and with such terms as the Board may determine, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Bylaws relating to (i) regulation of the procedure for submission by stockholders of nominations of persons to be elected to the Board, (ii) regulation of the attendance at annual or special meetings of the stockholders of persons other than holders of record or their proxies, (iii) regulation of the manner in which, and the circumstances under which, special meetings may be called by stockholders pursuant to Paragraph A of this Article VI and (iv) the regulation of the business that may properly be brought by a stockholder of the Corporation before an annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation.
Any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, and the ability of the stockholders of the Corporation to consent in writing to the taking of any action is hereby specifically denied.
A director of this Corporation shall not be liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the General Corporation Law as the same exists or may hereafter be amended. Any repeal or modification of the foregoing paragraph shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation existing hereunder with respect to any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or modification.
The Board, pursuant to the Bylaws of the Corporation or by resolution passed by a majority of the then-authorized number of directors, may designate any of their number to constitute an Executive Committee, which Executive Committee, to the fullest extent permitted by law and provided for in said resolution or in the Bylaws of the Corporation, shall have and may exercise all of the powers of the Board in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation, and shall have power to authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers that may require it.
 
A. The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture or other enterprise against expenses (including attorney's fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding, if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the Corporation and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not of itself create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the Corporation and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
B. The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another Corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including attorney's fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit, if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the Corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine, upon application, that despite the adjudication of liability, but in the view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the court shall deem proper.
C. Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director, officer, employee or agent to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized herein.
D. The Corporation may purchase (upon resolution duly adopted by the board of directors) and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
 
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability.
E. To the extent that a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit, or proceeding referred to herein or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith.
F. Every such person shall be entitled, without demand by him upon the Corporation or any action by the Corporation, to enforce his right to such indemnity in an action at law against the Corporation. The right of indemnification and advancement of expenses hereinabove provided shall not be deemed exclusive of any rights to which any such person may now or hereafter be otherwise entitled and specifically, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, shall not be deemed exclusive of any rights pursuant to statute or otherwise, of any such person in any such action, suit or proceeding to have assessed or allowed in his favor against the Corporation or otherwise, his costs and expenses incurred therein or in connection therewith or any part thereof.
 
In addition to any affirmative vote required by applicable law and in addition to any vote of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock provided for or fixed pursuant to the provisions of Article IV, any alteration, amendment, repeal or rescission (a "Change") of any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation must be approved by at least a majority of the then-authorized number of directors and by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding shares of Voting Stock, voting together as a single class. Subject to the provisions hereof, the Corporation reserves the right at any time, and from time to time, to amend, alter, repeal or rescind any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by law, and other provisions authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware at the time in force may be added or inserted, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by law; and all rights, preferences and privileges of whatsoever nature conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other persons whomsoever by and pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the rights reserved in this article.
 
In addition to any affirmative vote required by law, any Change of the Bylaws of the Corporation may be adopted either (i) by the Board by the affirmative vote of a least a majority of the then-authorized number of directors or (ii) by the stockholders by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding shares of Voting Stock, voting together as a single class.
 
For the purposes of this Certificate of Incorporation:
A. A "person" shall mean any individual, firm, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, trust, unincorporated organization or other entity.
B. "Voting Stock" means all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation that pursuant to or in accordance with this Certificate of Incorporation are entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of the Corporation, and each reference herein, where appropriate, to a percentage or portion of shares of Voting Stock shall refer to such percentage or portion of the voting power of such shares entitled to vote.

The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such person's conduct was unlawful.

Section 1
Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings other than Those by or in the Right of the Corporation
Subject to Section 3 of this Article VIII, the Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust employee benefit plan or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the

Section 2
Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings by or in the Right of the Corporation
 
extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
Any indemnification under this Article VIII (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made, with respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of such determination, (i) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, (ii) by a committee of such directors designated by a majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, (iii) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion or (iv) by the stockholders. Such determination shall be made, with respect to former directors and officers, by any person or persons having the authority to act on the matter on behalf of the Corporation. To the extent, however, that a present or former director or officer of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding described above, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the specific case.

For purposes of any determination under Section 3 of this Article VIII, a person shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe such person's conduct was unlawful, if such person's action is based on the records or books of account of the Corporation or another enterprise, or on information supplied to such person by the officers of the Corporation or another enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Corporation or another enterprise or on information or records given or reports made to the Corporation or another enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with reasonable care by the Corporation or another enterprise. The term "another enterprise" as used in this Section 4 shall mean any other corporation or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise of which such person is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent.

Section 4
Good Faith Defined
 
Notwithstanding any contrary determination in the specific case under Section 3 of this Article VIII and notwithstanding the absence of any determination thereunder, any director or officer may apply to the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware for indemnification to the extent otherwise permissible under Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VIII. The basis of such indemnification by a court shall be a determination by such court that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standards of conduct set forth in Section 1 or 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be. Neither a contrary determination in the specific case under Section 3 of this Article VIII nor the absence of any determination thereunder shall be a defense to such application or create a presumption that the director or officer seeking indemnification has not met any applicable standard of conduct. Notice of any application for indemnification pursuant to this Section 5 shall be given to the Corporation promptly upon the filing of such application. If successful, in whole or in part, the director or officer seeking indemnification shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such application.
. .
Section 5
Indemnification by a Court
Expenses incurred by a director or officer in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article VIII.
. .
Section 6
Expenses Payable in Advance
The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this Article VIII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under the Certificate of Incorporation, any Bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such person's official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, it being the policy of the Corporation that indemnification of the persons specified in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VIII shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by law. The provisions of this Article VIII shall not be deemed to preclude the indemnification of any person who is not specified in Section 1 or 2 of this Article VIII, but whom the Corporation has the power or obligation to indemnify under the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or otherwise.
. .
Section 7
Nonexclusivity of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses

. .
Section 8
Insurance
 
For purposes of this Article VIII, references to "the Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors or officers, so that any person who is or was a director or officer of such constituent corporation, or is or was a director or officer of such constituent corporation serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article VIII with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as such person would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued. For purposes of this Article VIII, references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at the request of the Corporation" shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director or officer with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation" as referred to in this Article VIII.
. .
Section 9
Certain Definitions

Section 10
Survival of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article VIII to the contrary, except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification (which shall be governed by Section 5 hereof), the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify any director or officer in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or consented to by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

Section 12
Indemnification of Employees and Agents
 
Without the necessity of entering into an express contract, the rights conferred upon directors and officers under this Article VIII with respect to indemnification and the advancement of expenses shall be deemed to be contractual rights upon which the directors and officers are presumed to have relied in determining to serve or to continue to serve in their capacity with the Corporation. The rights provided in this Article VIII shall be effective and legally enforceable to the same extent and as if provided for in a contract between the Corporation and each director or officer.

Indemnification
 
4.    . All Eligible Employees shall be covered by the Plan, except to the extent the Committee may elect to exclude one or more Eligible Employees from participation in a designated Performance Period.
Coverage
5.    .
Terms and Conditions of Bonus Awards
(a) . Payment of Bonuses shall be based solely on account of the attainment of one or more pre-established, objective Performance Goals over the designated Performance Period. The Committee shall establish one or more objective Performance Goals with respect to each Eligible Employee in writing not later than 90 days after the commencement of the Performance Period to which the Performance Goals relate or the date on which twenty-five percent (25%) of such Performance Period has been completed (or such other date as may be required or permitted under Section 162(m) of the Code), provided that the outcome of the Performance Goals must be substantially uncertain at the time of their establishment. Performance Goals shall be based solely on one or more of the business criteria described in the Section 6 and shall be weighted, equally or in such other proportion as the Committee shall determine at the time such Performance Goals are established, for purposes of determining the actual Bonus amounts that may become payable upon the attainment of those goals. For each Performance Goal, the Committee may establish one or more designated levels of attainment and set the Bonus potential for each Eligible Employee at each designated performance level. Alternatively, the Committee may establish a linear formula for determining the Bonus potential at various points of Performance Goal attainment. Under no circumstance, however, shall the aggregate Bonus potential for any participant for any Performance Period exceed the applicable maximum dollar amount set forth in Section 5(d).
Pre-Established Performance Goals
(b) . As soon as administratively practicable following the completion of the Performance Period, the Committee shall certify the actual levels at which the Performance Goal or Goals for that period have been attained and determine, on the basis of such certified levels, the actual Bonus amount to be paid to each Eligible Employee for that Performance Period. Such certification shall be final, conclusive and binding on the participant, and on all other persons, to the maximum extent permitted by law.
Committee Certification
(c) . The Committee, in determining the amount of the Bonus actually to be paid to an Eligible Employee, shall in no event award a Bonus in excess of the dollar amount determined on the basis of the Bonus potential established for the particular level at which each of the applicable Performance Goals for the Performance Period is attained. If the actual level of attainment is between two of the designated performance levels, the Bonus amounts will be interpolated on a straight-line basis between those two levels. In addition, the Committee shall have the discretion to reduce or eliminate the Bonus that would otherwise be payable with respect to one or more Performance Goals on the basis of the certified level of attained performance of those goals. In exercising its discretion to reduce the Bonus payable to any participant, the Committee may utilize such objective or subjective criteria as the Committee deems appropriate in its sole and absolute discretion. The Committee shall not waive any Performance Goal applicable to a participant's Bonus potential for a particular Performance Period, provided that, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, waive the Performance Goal for a particular Performance Period in the event of the participant's death or disability or under such circumstances as the Committee deems appropriate in the event a Change in Control should occur prior to the completion of that Performance Period. For purposes of the Plan, a Change in Control shall have the same definition as set forth in the Company's 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan (or any successor to that plan).
Committee Discretion
(d) . Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the maximum amount of any Bonus paid to a Covered Employee or other Eligible Employee under the Plan shall be limited to per each twelve (12)-month period (or portion thereof) included within the applicable Performance Period.
Individual Limitations on Awards
Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000)
 
(e) . Payment of such Bonus amounts shall be made as soon as administratively practicable thereafter, but in any event, no later than March 15 of the year following the year in which the Performance Period ends. No participant shall accrue any right to receive a Bonus award under the Plan unless that participant remains in Employee status until the payment date for that Bonus following the completion of the Performance Period. Accordingly, no Bonus payment shall be made to any participant who ceases Employee status prior to the payment date for that Bonus; provided, however, that the Committee shall have complete discretion to award a full or pro-rated Bonus, based on the level at which the applicable Performance Goals are attained for the Performance Period, to a participant who ceases Employee status prior to such payment date by reason of death or disability or in connection with an involuntary reduction in force. A participant may also defer the payment of the Bonus pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Company's Deferred Compensation Plan (or any successor plan) and in compliance with Section 409A of the Code.
Payment Date
(f) . To the extent required by applicable federal, state, local or foreign law, each employer shall withhold all applicable taxes from all Bonus amounts.

Transferability

Governing Law
 
 

Exhibit 10.2
ARTICLE I
PURPOSE
SECTION 1.1     The 2009 Devon Energy Corporation Long-Term Incentive Plan is established by Devon Energy Corporation (the "Company") to create incentives designed to provide meaningful share ownership opportunities that align Participants' long-term interests with those of our stockholders, emphasize long-term performance results, and promote retention of Participants. Toward these objectives, the Plan provides for the grant of Options, Restricted Stock Awards, Restricted Stock Units, Canadian Restricted Stock Units, Performance Units and SARs to Eligible Employees and the grant of Nonqualified Stock Options, SARs, Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Units to Eligible Directors, subject to the conditions set forth in the Plan. The Plan is designed to provide flexibility to meet the needs of the Company in a changing and competitive environment while minimizing dilution to the Company's stockholders. The Company does not intend to use all incentive vehicles at all times for each Participant but will selectively grant Awards to achieve long-term goals.
Purpose.
SECTION 1.2     The Plan was originally adopted by the Board on June 3, 2009. This amendment and restatement of the Plan was adopted by the Board on March 7, 2012, and will become effective as of that date, if this amendment and restatement of the Plan is approved by the stockholders of the Company by a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock present, or represented and entitled to vote at a meeting of the stockholders of the Company to be held on June 6, 2012 for such purpose. If this amendment and restatement of the Plan is not so approved at such meeting, then the 2009 Devon Energy Corporation Long-Term Incentive Plan as in effect immediately prior to March 7, 2012 shall remain in effect. The authority to issue Awards under the Plan will terminate on June 2, 2019 and the remaining terms of the Plan shall continue in effect until all matters relating to the payment of Awards and administration of the Plan have been settled.
Establishment.
SECTION 1.3     Subject to the limitations set forth in the Plan, Awards may be made under this Plan for a total of 47 million shares of Common Stock since the inception of the Plan. Shares of Common Stock covered by an Award under prior Devon Energy Corporation long-term incentive plans, including assumed plans, which are forfeited, cancelled, or expire after the Effective Date of this Plan shall be added to the shares of Common Stock authorized for issuance under this Plan. Any shares granted as Options or SARs shall be counted against this limit as one share for each share granted. Any shares granted under Awards other than Options or SARs shall be counted against this limit as 2.38 shares for each share granted. Provided further, that a maximum of 25.5 million shares of the total authorized under this SECTION 1.3 may be granted as Incentive Stock Options. The limitations of this SECTION 1.3 shall be subject to adjustment pursuant to ARTICLE XII. The number of shares that are subject to Options or other Awards outstanding at any time under the Plan shall not exceed the number of shares which then remain available for issuance under the Plan. The Company shall, at all times, reserve and keep available sufficient shares to satisfy the requirements of the Plan during the term of the Plan.
Shares Subject to the Plan.

The Committee may further authorize the establishment of an employee benefit trust (a "Canadian Employee Benefit Trust") for the purpose of holding the assets of the Canadian Employee Benefit Plan and shall appoint one or more persons who are residents of Canada to act as trustees of the Canadian Employee Benefit Trust.
Establishment
SECTION 8.2     The Committee may grant to Eligible Employees, Canadian Restricted Stock Units entitling such Eligible Employees to an interest in the assets of the Canadian Employee Benefit Trust in such form that it determines necessary to comply with applicable Canadian tax law requirements, subject to the terms of the Canadian Employee Benefit Plan and such other terms and conditions as it may determine. Each Award of Canadian Restricted Stock Units shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement and such Award Agreement shall contain the terms and conditions of the Award subject to the provisions of the Canadian Employee Benefit Plan. At the time of granting an Award of Canadian Restricted Stock Units, the Committee may authorize the Company or any of its Canadian Subsidiaries or Affiliated Entities to make cash contributions to the Canadian Employee Benefit Trust, with such contributions to be used as specified in the Canadian Employee Benefit Plan, including for the purpose of acquiring shares of Common Stock of the Company on the open market through the facilities of a stock exchange. The Committee shall designate, at the time of making any contribution in respect of a Participant, when the shares of Common Stock of the Company which are acquired with the contribution pursuant to the terms of the Canadian Employee Benefit Plan are to vest pursuant to the applicable Award Agreement, and shall inform the trustees of the same.
Grant of Awards and Contributions to Canadian Employee Benefit Trust.
SECTION 8.3     Subject to the specific provisions of the Canadian Employee Benefit Plan, upon completion of any purchases of shares of Common Stock of the Company by the trustees, the trustees shall immediately notionally allocate such shares to an account in respect of each Participant in proportion to the contributions received in respect of each Participant in the preceding month. The Trustees shall hold the shares in trust in the name of the trustee, until such time as: (i) the Canadian Restricted Stock Units granted to Participants are vested, in accordance with the vesting conditions designated by the Committee in the Award Agreement, or (ii) the Canadian Restricted Stock Units are forfeited by Eligible Employees as provided in the Canadian Employee Benefit Plan.
Holding of Shares of Common Stock in Trust.

Settlement in Stock.
 
Participants will not be entitled to receive cash in settlement of an Award of a Canadian Restricted Stock Unit. The Company, its Canadian Subsidiaries or Affiliated Entities, and the trustees may withhold from any amount payable to an Eligible Employee, either under the Canadian Employee Benefit Plan, or otherwise, such amount as may be necessary so as to ensure compliance with the applicable provisions of any federal, provincial or local law relating to the withholding of tax or other required deductions. For greater certainty and notwithstanding any other provision of the Canadian Employee Benefit Plan, all amounts payable to, or in respect of, a Participant under the Canadian Employee Benefit Plan shall be paid within three years following the end of the year in respect of which the Award of Canadian Restricted Stock Units was made.
(c) Prior to the date the shares of Common Stock are distributed by the trustees, Participants will have no rights to the shares of Common Stock and no rights as stockholders of the Company with respect to the shares of Common Stock held by the Canadian Employee Benefit Trust related to an Award. Title and all incidents of beneficial ownership of the shares of Common Stock will remain with the trustees while the shares are held in trust.
Rights of Stockholders.
(d) The Committee may authorize the Company or its Canadian Subsidiaries or Affiliated Entities to grant an additional Award to the Participant equal to the dividend that the Participant would have received had the Award been made with the underlying shares of Common Stock directly, rather than in Canadian Restricted Stock Units.
Additional Awards.

SECTION 10.2     SARs granted under the Plan shall be exercisable in whole or in installments and at such times as shall be provided by the Committee in the Award Agreement. The amount payable with respect to each SAR shall be equal in value to the excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the exercise date over the exercise price of the SAR.

Exercise and Payment.
SECTION 10.3     SARs may be granted in tandem with an Option, in which event, the Participant has the right to elect to exercise either the SAR or the Option. Upon the Participant's election to exercise one of these Awards, the other tandem award is automatically terminated. In the event a SAR is granted in tandem with an Incentive Stock Option, the Committee shall subject the SAR to restrictions necessary to ensure satisfaction of the requirements under Section 422 of the Code.

Establishment of Performance Goals
SECTION 11.4    . No Performance-Based Awards shall be payable to or vest with respect to, as the case may be, any Participant for a given period until the Committee certifies in writing that the objective performance goals (and any other material terms) applicable to such period have been satisfied.
Certification of Performance
SECTION 11.5    . With respect to any Awards intended to qualify as Performance-Based Awards, after establishment of a performance goal, the Committee shall not revise such performance goal to cause the goal to cease to meet the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code, except as otherwise determined by the Committee, and the Committee shall not increase the amount of compensation payable thereunder (as determined in accordance with Section 162(m) of the Code) upon the attainment of such performance goal. The Committee may reduce or eliminate the number of shares of Common Stock or the number of shares of Common Stock vested upon the attainment of such performance goal, based on such terms and conditions as the Committee deems appropriate. The Committee may make such changes to performance goals and Performance-Based Awards as the Committee deems appropriate in the event of a change in corporate capitalization, corporate transaction or other corporate event as permitted by Section 162(m), or as the Committee otherwise determines.
Modification of Performance-Based Awards
SECTION 11.6    .

Death, Disability or Other Circumstances
SECTION 11.8    . The Plan must be reapproved by the Company's stockholders no later than the first stockholders meeting that occurs in the fifth year following the year in which the stockholders previously approved the provisions of ARTICLE XI, if Performance-Based Awards are to be made under ARTICLE XI after the date of such stockholders meeting and if required by Section 162(m) of the Code.
Stockholder Approval for Performance-Based Awards
ARTICLE XII
STOCK ADJUSTMENTS
SECTION 12.1     In the event that the shares of Common Stock shall be changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares of stock or other securities of the Company or of another corporation (whether by reason of merger, consolidation, recapitalization, reclassification, stock split, combination of shares or otherwise), or if the number of such shares of Common Stock shall be increased through the payment of a stock dividend, or if rights or warrants to purchase securities of the Company shall be issued to holders of all outstanding Common Stock, then there shall be substituted for or added to each share available under and subject to the Plan (including those held in the Canadian Employee Benefit Trust), and each share theretofore appropriated under the Plan, the number and kind of shares of stock or other securities into which each outstanding share of Common Stock shall be so changed or for which each such share shall be exchanged or to which each such share shall be entitled, as the case may be, on a fair and equivalent basis in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 424 of the Code; provided, however, with respect to Options, in no such event will such adjustment result in a modification of any Option as defined in Section 424(h) of the Code. Any adjustments to Options or SARs shall be made in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, to the extent applicable. In the event there shall be any other change in the number or kind of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, or any stock or other securities into which the Common Stock shall have been changed or for which it shall have been exchanged, then if the Committee shall, in its sole discretion, determine that such change equitably requires an adjustment in the shares available under and subject to the Plan, the Award limits set forth in SECTION 4.1, or in any Award, theretofore granted, such adjustments shall be made in accordance with such determination, except that no adjustment of the number of shares of Common Stock available under the Plan or to which any Award relates that would otherwise be required shall be made unless and until such adjustment either by itself or with other adjustments not previously made would require an increase or decrease
Stock Adjustments.
 
of at least 1% in the number of shares of Common Stock available under the Plan or to which any Award relates immediately prior to the making of such adjustment (the "Minimum Adjustment"). Any adjustment representing a change of less than such minimum amount shall be carried forward and made as soon as such adjustment together with other adjustments required by this ARTICLE XII and not previously made would result in a Minimum Adjustment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any adjustment required by this ARTICLE XII which otherwise would not result in a Minimum Adjustment shall be made with respect to shares of Common Stock relating to any Award immediately prior to exercise, payment or settlement of such Award. No fractional shares of Common Stock or units of other securities shall be issued pursuant to any such adjustment, and any fractions resulting from any such adjustment shall be eliminated in each case by rounding downward to the nearest whole share.
ARTICLE XIII
GENERAL
SECTION 13.1     The Board may alter, suspend or terminate the Plan at any time. In addition, the Board may, from time to time, amend the Plan in any manner, but may not, without stockholder approval, adopt any amendment which would (i) increase the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock available under the Plan (except by operation of Article XI), (ii) materially modify the requirements as to eligibility for participation in the Plan, or (iii) materially increase the benefits to Participants provided by the Plan. The termination of the Plan shall not impair the power and authority of the Committee with respect to outstanding Awards. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, the Board may amend the Plan in such manner as it deems appropriate in the event of a change in applicable law or regulations.
Amendment or Termination of Plan.
SECTION 13.2     If an Eligible Employee's employment with the Company, a Subsidiary, or an Affiliated Entity terminates for a reason other than death, disability, retirement, or any approved reason, all unexercised, unearned, and/or unpaid Awards, including, but not by way of limitation, Awards earned, but not yet paid, all unpaid dividends and dividend equivalents, and all interest, if any, accrued on the foregoing shall be cancelled or forfeited, as the case may be, unless the Eligible Employee's Award Agreement provides otherwise. The Compensation Committee shall (i) determine what events constitute disability, retirement or termination for an approved reason for purposes of the Plan, and (ii) determine the treatment of a Participant under the Plan in the event of death, disability, retirement, or termination for an approved reason. The Committee shall also determine the method, if any, for accelerating the vesting or exercisability of any Awards, or providing for the exercise of any unexercised Awards in the event of an Eligible Employee's death, disability, retirement, or termination for an approved reason.
Termination of Employment; Termination of Service.
In the event an Eligible Director terminates service as a director of the Company, the unvested portion of any Award shall be forfeited unless otherwise accelerated pursuant to the terms of the Eligible Director's Award Agreement or by the Board. The Eligible Director shall have a period of three years following the date he ceases to be a director to exercise any Nonqualified Stock Options or SARS which are otherwise exercisable on his date of termination of service.
SECTION 13.3     Awards may be exercised during the lifetime of the Participant only by the Participant. More particularly (but without limiting the generality of the foregoing), an Award shall not be assigned, transferred (except as provided above), pledged or hypothecated in any way whatsoever, shall not be assigned by operation of law, and shall not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process. Any attempted assignment, transfer, pledge, hypothecation, or other disposition of the award contrary to the provisions hereof, shall be null and
Nontransferability of Awards.
 
void and without effect. However, in the event of a Participant's death, an Award may be transferred in accordance with the provisions of a Participant's will, the applicable laws of descent and distribution or, with respect to Awards other than Incentive Stock Options, a beneficiary designation that is in a form approved by the Committee and in compliance with the provisions of this Plan and the applicable Award Agreement.
SECTION 13.4     Unless otherwise paid by the Participant, the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of its Affiliated Entities shall be entitled to deduct from any payment under the Plan, regardless of the form of such payment, the amount of all applicable income and employment taxes required by law to be withheld with respect to such payment or may require the Participant to pay to it such tax prior to and as a condition of the making of such payment. In accordance with any applicable administrative guidelines it establishes, the Committee may, in its discretion, allow a Participant to pay the amount of taxes required by law to be withheld from an Award by (i) directing the Company to withhold from any payment of the Award a number of shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value on the date of payment equal to the amount of the required withholding taxes or (ii) delivering to the Company previously owned shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value on the date of payment equal to the amount of the required withholding taxes. However, any payment made by the Participant pursuant to either of the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii) shall not be permitted if it would result in an adverse accounting charge with respect to such shares used to pay such taxes unless otherwise approved by the Committee.
Withholding Taxes.
SECTION 13.5    of Notwithstanding any other provision in this Plan to the contrary, Awards granted under the Plan to any Eligible Employee or Eligible Director may, in the discretion of the Committee, provide in the Award Agreement that such Awards shall be immediately vested, fully earned and exercisable upon the occurrence of a Change in Control Event.
Change
Control.
SECTION 13.6     Subject to the limitations of ARTICLE IV, such as the prohibition on repricing of Options, the Committee may at any time unilaterally amend the terms of any Award Agreement, whether or not presently exercisable or vested, to the extent it deems appropriate. However, amendments which are materially adverse to the Participant shall require the Participant's consent.
Amendments to Awards.
SECTION 13.7     The Company shall use its best efforts to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission as soon as practicable following approval by the stockholders of the Company of the Plan as provided in SECTION 1.2 of the Plan, and keep continuously effectively, a Registration Statement on Form S-8 with respect to shares of Common Stock subject to Awards hereunder. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Plan to the contrary, the Company shall have no obligation to issue shares of Common Stock under this Plan prior to:
Regulatory Approval and Listings.
(a) the obtaining of any approval from, or satisfaction of any waiting period or other condition imposed by, any governmental agency which the Committee shall, in its sole discretion, determine to be necessary or advisable;
(b) the admission of such shares to listing on the stock exchange on which the Common Stock may be listed; and
(c) the completion of any registration or other qualification of such shares under any state or Federal law or ruling of any governmental body which the Committee shall, in its sole discretion, determine to be necessary or advisable.
SECTION 13.8    . The Committee may grant Awards to individual participants who are subject to the tax laws of nations other than the United States, which Awards may have terms and conditions as determined by the Committee as necessary to comply with applicable foreign laws. The Committee may take any action which it deems advisable to obtain approval of such Awards by
Foreign Laws
 
the appropriate foreign governmental entity; provided, however, that no such Awards may be granted pursuant to this SECTION 13.8 and no action may be taken which would result in a violation of the Exchange Act, the Code or any other applicable law.
SECTION 13.9    . All Awards granted under the Plan shall be subject to any applicable clawback or recoupment policies, share trading policies and other policies that may be implemented by the Board from time to time.
Company Policies
SECTION 13.10     Participation in the Plan shall not give any Eligible Employee any right to remain in the employ of the Company, any Subsidiary, or any Affiliated Entity. The Company or, in the case of employment with a Subsidiary or an Affiliated Entity, the Subsidiary or Affiliated Entity reserves the right to terminate any Eligible Employee at any time. Further, the adoption of this Plan shall not be deemed to give any Eligible Employee or any other individual any right to be selected as a Participant or to be granted an Award.
Right to Continued Employment.
SECTION 13.11     In the event of the death of a Participant, the portion of the Participant's Award with respect to which vesting dates have occurred shall be paid to the then surviving beneficiary designated by the Participant, and if there is no beneficiary then surviving or designated, then such benefits will automatically be paid to the estate of the Participant.
Beneficiary Designation.
SECTION 13.12     Each member of the Committee and each member of the Board shall be fully justified in relying or acting in good faith upon any report made by the independent public accountants of the Company and its Subsidiaries and upon any other information furnished in connection with the Plan by any person or persons other than himself or herself. In no event shall any person who is or shall have been a member of the Committee or of the Board be liable for any determination made or other action taken or any omission to act in reliance upon any such report or information or for any action taken, including the furnishing of information, or failure to act, if in good faith.
Reliance on Reports.
SECTION 13.13     Masculine pronouns and other words of masculine gender shall refer to both men and women. The titles and headings of the sections in the Plan are for the convenience of reference only, and in the event of any conflict, the text of the Plan, rather than such titles or headings, shall control.
Construction.
SECTION 13.14     The Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware except as superseded by applicable federal law.
Governing Law.
SECTION 13.15     If any provision of the Plan or any Award is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction or as to any Participant or Award, or would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to the applicable laws, or if it cannot be construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Committee, materially altering the intent of the Plan or the Award, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, Participant or Award and the remainder of the Plan and any such Award shall remain in full force and effect.
Severability.
SECTION 13.16     The Committee may refuse to issue or transfer any shares of Common Stock or other consideration under an Award if, acting in its sole discretion, it determines that the issuance or transfer of such shares or such other consideration might violate any applicable law or regulation or entitle the Company to recover the same under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, and any payment tendered to the Company by a Participant, other holder or beneficiary in connection with the exercise of such Award shall be promptly refunded to the relevant Participant, holder or beneficiary.
Other Laws.
 
SECTION 13.17    . The Plan is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, to the extent applicable. All Awards shall be construed and administered such that the Award either (A) qualifies for an exemption from the requirements of Section 409A of the Code or (B) satisfies the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. If a Award is subject to Section 409A of the Code, (I) distributions shall only be made in a manner and upon an event permitted under Section 409A of the Code, (II) payments to be made upon a termination of employment shall only be made upon a "separation from service" under Section 409A of the Code, (III) unless the Award specifies otherwise, each installment payment shall be treated as a separate payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Code, and (IV) in no event shall a participant, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year in which a distribution is made except in accordance with Section 409A of the Code. Any Award granted under the Plan that is subject to Section 409A of the Code and that is to be distributed to a key employee (as defined below) upon separation from service shall be administered so that any distribution with respect to such Award shall be postponed for six months following the date of the participant's separation from service, if required by Section 409A of the Code. If a distribution is delayed pursuant to Section 409A of the Code, the distribution shall be paid within 30 days after the end of the six-month period. If the participant dies during such six-month period, any postponed amounts shall be paid within 90 days of the participant's death. The determination of key employees, including the number and identity of persons considered key employees and the identification date, shall be made by the Committee or its delegate each year in accordance with Section 416(i) of the Code and the "specified employee" requirements of Section 409A of the Code.
Section 409A Considerations
Except as provided in the Canadian Employee Benefit Plan for the creation of the Canadian Employee Benefit Trust, neither the Plan nor an Award shall create or be construed to create a trust or separate fund of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Company and a Participant or any other person. To the extent that a Participant acquires the right to receive payments from the Company pursuant to an Award, such right shall be no greater than the right of any general unsecured creditor of the Company.
No Trust or Fund Created.
