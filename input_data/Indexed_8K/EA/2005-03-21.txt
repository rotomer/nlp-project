Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 March 21, 2005  Electronic Arts (NASDAQ: ERTS) today announced revised estimates for the Company's fiscal year ending March 31, 2005. The changes are primarily the result of lower than expected sales in both North America and in Europe.
REDWOOD CITY, CA
 
The Company now expects fiscal year 2005 net revenue to be between $3.100 and $3.125 billion, as compared to the Company's previous estimate of between $3.275 and $3.325 billion.
 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are now expected to be between $1.70 and $1.72 as compared to the Company's previous estimate of $1.90 to $1.95.
 
GAAP diluted earnings per share are now expected to be between $1.62 and $1.64  as compared to the Company's previous estimate of $1.82 to $1.87.
 
"These results are clearly disappointing," said Larry Probst, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "While our new releases are performing reasonably well, they have not been able to offset a significant falloff in catalog sales."
