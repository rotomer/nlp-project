Business Outlook
 
The following forward-looking statements reflect expectations as of November 1, 2005. Results may be materially different and are affected by many factors, such as consumer spending trends, the popular appeal of EA's products, development delays, current-generation and next-generation hardware availability, the seasonal and cyclical nature of the interactive entertainment industry, the overall economy, competition, changes in foreign exchange rates, EA's effective tax rate, and other factors detailed in this release and EA's annual and quarterly SEC filings.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Electronic Arts uses non-GAAP measures of operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share. These non-GAAP measures exclude the following items, including any related tax effect, from the Company's statement of operations:
 
 
In addition, the Company's non-GAAP results exclude the impact of one-time tax adjustments.
 
Other significant non-recurring items may occur from time to time that require an adjustment to these non-GAAP measures. When these items occur, the accounting impact will become a reconciling item between the GAAP results and these non-GAAP measures.
 
The Company believes that excluding these items is useful for illustrating and explaining operating results and comparisons to prior periods. Management considers these non-GAAP measures in its decision-making to facilitate more relevant operating comparisons.
 
A reconciliation of GAAP operating income to non-GAAP operating income; GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income; and GAAP diluted earnings per share to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is included as part of the supplemental disclosures to this release.
