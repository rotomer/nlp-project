Redwood City, California Headquarters Facilities  Phase One Lease
In February 1995, Electronic Arts Inc. (the "Company") entered into a build-to-suit lease ("Phase One Lease") with a third-party lessor for the Company's headquarters facilities in Redwood City, California ("Phase One Facilities"). The Phase One Facilities comprise a total of approximately 350,000 square feet and provide space for sales, marketing, administration and research and development functions. The Phase One Lease expires in January 2039, subject to early termination in the event the underlying financing between the lessor and its lenders is not extended. In July 2001, the lessor refinanced the Phase One Lease with Keybank National Association through July 2006. In May 2006, the lessor extended the loan financing underlying the Phase One Lease with its lenders through July 2007.
On May 14, 2007, the lessor extended the loan financing underlying the Phase One Lease through July 2008 by entering into the Third Omnibus Amendment among Electronic Arts Redwood LLC, as lessee, the Company, as guarantor, SELCO Service Corporation (doing business in California as "Ohio SELCO Service Corporation"), as lessor, various liquidity banks, The Bank of Nova Scotia, as documentation agent, and KeyBank National Association, as agent (the "Phase One Amendment"). The Phase One Amendment also modified the definition of "Consolidated EBITDAR," which is used in connection with the determination of the Company's compliance with certain financial covenants associated with the Phase One Lease.
The Company may request, on behalf of the lessor and subject to lender approval, an additional one-year extension of the loan financing between the lessor and the lenders. In the event the lessor's loan financing with the lenders is not extended, the Company may loan to the lessor approximately 90 percent of the financing, and require the lessor to extend the remainder through July 2009; otherwise the lease will terminate.
Subject to certain terms and conditions, the Company may purchase the Phase One Facilities or arrange for the sale of the Phase One Facilities to a third party. Pursuant to the terms of the Phase One Lease, the Company has an option to purchase the Phase One Facilities at any time for a purchase price of $132 million. In the event of a sale to a third party, if the sale price is less than $132 million, the Company will be obligated to reimburse the difference between the actual sale price and $132 million, up to a maximum of $117 million, subject to certain provisions of the Phase One Lease, as amended.
The Company accounts for the Phase One Lease arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 13, "", as amended.

Redwood City, California Headquarters Facilities  Phase Two Lease
In December 2000, the Company entered into a second build-to-suit lease ("Phase Two Lease") with Keybank National Association for a five and one-half year term beginning in December 2000 to expand the Company's Redwood City, California headquarters facilities and develop adjacent property ("Phase Two Facilities"). Construction of the Phase Two Facilities was completed in June 2002. The Phase Two Facilities comprise a total of approximately 310,000 square feet and provide space for sales, marketing, administration and research and development functions. In May 2006, the lessor extended the Phase Two Lease through July 2009, subject to early termination in the event the underlying loan financing between the lessor and its lenders is not extended. Concurrently with the extension of the lease, the lessor extended the loan financing underlying the Phase Two Lease with its lenders through July 2007.
On May 14, 2007, the lessor extended the loan financing underlying the Phase Two Lease through July 2008 by entering into a Third Omnibus Amendment among Electronic Arts Redwood LLC, as lessee, the Company, as guarantor, SELCO Service Corporation (doing business in California as "Ohio SELCO
Service Corporation"), as lessor, various liquidity banks, and KeyBank National Association, as agent ("Phase Two Amendment"). The Phase Two Amendment also modified the definition of "Consolidated EBITDAR," which is used in connection with the determination of the Company's compliance with certain financial covenants associated with the Phase Two Lease.
The Company may request, on behalf of the lessor and subject to lender approval, an additional one-year extension of the loan financing between the lessor and the lenders. In the event the lessor's loan financing with the lenders is not extended, the Company may loan to the lessor approximately 90 percent of the financing, and require the lessor to extend the remainder through July 2009, otherwise the lease will terminate.
Subject to certain terms and conditions, the Company may purchase the Phase Two Facilities or arrange for the sale of the Phase Two Facilities to a third party. Pursuant to the terms of the Phase Two Lease, the Company has an option to purchase the Phase Two Facilities at any time for a purchase price of $115 million. In the event of a sale to a third party, if the sale price is less than $115 million, the Company will be obligated to reimburse the difference between the actual sale price and $115 million, up to a maximum of $105 million, subject to certain provisions of the Phase Two Lease, as amended.
The Company accounts for the Phase Two Lease arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with SFAS No. 13, as amended.
