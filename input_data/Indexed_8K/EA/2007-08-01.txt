Exhibit 99.1
 August 1, 2007  Electronic Arts (NASDAQ: ERTS) today announced preliminary financial results for its fiscal first quarter ended June 30, 2007.
REDWOOD CITY, CA
(comparisons are to the quarter ended June 30, 2006)
Fiscal First Quarter Results
Net revenue for the quarter was $395 million, down four percent as compared with $413 million for the prior year. Beginning this quarter, EA no longer charges for hosting services related to certain online-enabled packaged goods games. As a result, the Company recognizes revenue from the sale of these games over the estimated hosting service period. This change resulted in a $36 million sequential increase in deferred net revenue as of June 30, 2007, which will be recognized in future periods.
Sales were driven by and .
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Command & Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars, The Sims 2 Pets, Need for Speed Carbon
The Sims 2
Gross profit for the quarter was $229 million, down seven percent year-over-year. Net loss for the quarter was $132 million as compared with a net loss of $81 million for the prior year. Diluted loss per share was $0.42 as compared with $0.26 for the prior year.
Non-GAAP diluted loss per share was $0.22 as compared with a non-GAAP loss per share of $0.12 for the prior year. (Please see Non-GAAP Financial Measures and reconciliation information included in this release.)
Trailing twelve month operating cash flow was $243 million as compared with $589 million a year ago. The Company ended the quarter with cash and short term investments of $2.2 billion.
"In the last three months we announced the reorganization of our business into four Labels and welcomed Kathy Vrabeck and Peter Moore to EA," said John Riccitiello, Chief Executive Officer. "I'm pleased that our team, structure and strategy are coming together quickly."
"Looking ahead, we have a strong slate," said Warren Jenson, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer. "In the balance of the fiscal year, we plan to launch our full EA SPORTS lineup, Need for Speed Pro Street, MySims, Medal of Honor Airborne and ten new properties, including Army of Two, The Simpsons, SKATE, Boogie and Rock Band."

Business Outlook
The following forward-looking statements, as well as those made above, reflect expectations as of August 1, 2007. Results may be materially different and are affected by many factors, such as: consumer demand for next-generation consoles and the ability of the console manufacturers to produce an adequate supply of consoles to meet that demand; consumer demand for games for prior-generation consoles, particularly the PlayStation2 computer entertainment system; the popular appeal of EA's products; development delays on EA's products; changes in foreign exchange rates; the impact of EA's reorganization on its operations; the overall global economy; competition in the industry; EA's effective tax rate and other factors detailed in this release and in EA's annual and quarterly SEC filings.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, Electronic Arts uses certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures used by Electronic Arts include: non-GAAP net revenue, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) and historical and estimated non-GAAP diluted earnings (loss) per share. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the following items from the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Electronic Arts may consider whether other significant non-recurring items that arise in the future should also be excluded in calculating the non-GAAP financial measures it uses.
Electronic Arts believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of the Company's core business, operating results or future outlook. Electronic Arts' management uses, and believes that investors benefit from referring to, these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the Company's operating results both as a consolidated entity and at the business unit level, as well as when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate comparisons of the Company's performance to prior periods.
 
In addition to the reasons stated above, which are generally applicable to each of the items Electronic Arts excludes from its non-GAAP financial measures, the Company believes it is appropriate to exclude certain items for the following reasons:
. When analyzing the operating performance of an acquired entity, Electronic Arts' management focuses on the total return provided by the investment (i.e., operating profit generated from the acquired entity as compared to the purchase price paid) without taking into consideration any allocations made for accounting purposes. Because the purchase price for an acquisition necessarily reflects the accounting value assigned to intangible assets (including acquired in-process technology and goodwill), when analyzing the operating performance of an acquisition in subsequent periods, the Company's management excludes the GAAP impact of acquired intangible assets to its financial results. Electronic Arts believes that such an approach is useful in understanding the long-term return provided by an acquisition and that investors benefit from a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the accounting expense associated with acquired intangible assets.
Amortization of Intangibles
In addition, in accordance with GAAP, Electronic Arts generally recognizes expenses for internally-developed intangible assets as they are incurred, notwithstanding the potential future benefit such assets may provide. Unlike internally-developed intangible assets, however, and also in accordance with GAAP, the Company generally capitalizes the cost of acquired intangible assets and recognizes that cost as an expense over the useful lives of the assets acquired (other than goodwill, which is not amortized, and acquired in-process technology, which is expensed immediately, as required under GAAP). As a result of their GAAP treatment, there is an inherent lack of comparability between the financial performance of internally-developed intangible assets and acquired intangible assets. Accordingly, Electronic Arts believes it is useful to provide, as a supplement to its GAAP operating results, a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles.
. Electronic Arts adopted SFAS 123(R), "" beginning in its fiscal year 2007. When evaluating the performance of its individual business units, the Company does not consider stock-based compensation charges. Likewise, the Company's management teams exclude stock-based compensation expense from their short and long-term operating plans. In contrast, the Company's management teams are held accountable for cash-based compensation and such amounts are included in their operating plans. Further, when considering the impact of equity award grants, Electronic Arts places a greater emphasis on overall shareholder dilution rather than the accounting charges associated with such grants.
Stock-Based Compensation
Share-Based Payment
Video game platforms have historically had a life cycle of four to six years, which causes the video game software market to be cyclical. The Company's management analyzes its business and operating performance in the context of these business cycles, comparing Electronic Arts' performance at similar stages of different cycles. For comparability purposes, Electronic Arts believes it is useful to provide a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes stock-based compensation in order to better understand the long-term performance of its core business.
Although Electronic Arts has engaged in various restructuring activities in the past, each has been a discrete, extraordinary event based on a unique set of business objectives. Each of these restructurings has been unlike its predecessors in terms of its operational implementation, business impact and scope. The Company does not engage in restructuring activities on a regular basis or in the ordinary course of business. As such, the Company believes it is appropriate to exclude restructuring charges from its non-GAAP financial measures.
Restructuring Charges.
Beginning in fiscal 2008, Electronic Arts is no longer able to objectively determine the fair value of the online hosting services included in certain of its packaged goods games and online content. As a result, the Company recognizes the revenue from the sale of these games and content over the estimated online service period. Although Electronic Arts will defer the recognition of a significant portion of its net revenue as a result of this change, there will be no adverse impact to its operating cash flow. Internally, Electronic Arts' management excludes the impact of the change in deferred net revenue related to packaged goods games and digital content in its non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating the Company's operating performance, when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods, and when assessing the performance of its management team. The Company believes that excluding the impact of the change in deferred net revenue from its operating results is important to facilitate an understanding of the cash characteristics of its business, as well as comparisons to prior periods during which the Company was able to objectively determine the fair value of online hosting services and not delay the recognition of significant amounts of net revenue related to online-enabled packaged goods.

Forward-Looking Statements
Some statements set forth in this release, including the estimates under the headings "Business Outlook" contain forward-looking statements that are subject to change. Statements including words such as "anticipate", "believe", "estimate" or "expect" and statements in the future tense are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or actual future results to differ materially from the expectations set forth in the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors which could cause the Company's results to differ materially from its expectations include the following: timely development and release of Electronic Arts' products; competition in the interactive entertainment industry; the Company's ability to successfully implement its reorganization; the consumer demand for, and the availability of an adequate supply of next-generation hardware units (including the Xbox 360 video game and entertainment system, the PLAYSTATION3 computer entertainment system and the Wii); consumer demand for software for prior-generation consoles, particularly the PlayStation 2; the Company's ability to predict consumer preferences among competing hardware platforms; consumer spending trends; the seasonal and cyclical nature of the interactive game segment; the Company's ability to manage expenses during fiscal year 2008; the Company's ability to attract and retain key personnel; changes in the Company's effective tax rates; adoption of new accounting regulations and standards; potential regulation of the Company's products in key territories; developments in the law regarding protection of the Company's products; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; the Company's ability to secure licenses to valuable entertainment properties on favorable terms; and other factors described in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2007. These forward-looking statements speak only as of August 1, 2007. Electronic Arts assumes no obligation and does not intend to update these forward-looking statements, including those made under the heading "Business Outlook". In addition, the financial results set forth in this release are estimates based on information currently available to Electronic Arts. While Electronic Arts believes these estimates are meaningful, they could differ from the actual amounts that Electronic Arts ultimately reports in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2007. Electronic Arts assumes no obligation and does not intend to update these estimates prior to filing its Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2007.
