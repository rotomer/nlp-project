Item 8.01    Other Events.
Today the Federal Trade Commission concluded its review of Electronic Arts Inc.'s ("EA's") proposed acquisition of Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. ("Take-Two") and closed the investigation.
As noted earlier this week, EA now requires due diligence to support any proposal to acquire Take-Two. While EA has the greatest respect for Take-Two's creative teams and products, EA can provide no assurance that any transaction will result.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
