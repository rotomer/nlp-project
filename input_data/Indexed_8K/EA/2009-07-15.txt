On July 13, 2009, Electronic Arts Inc. ("EA") completed the acquisition of its headquarters facilities in Redwood City, California pursuant to the terms of the loan financing agreements underlying the build-to-suit leases for the facilities. EA exercised its option to purchase the facilities concurrent with the maturity of those financing arrangements, which were extinguished by payment of the purchase price. The aggregate purchase price of the facilities was approximately $247 million in cash, which reflects the amount financed under the leases. The lease agreements with Key Bank National Association contained certain financial and other covenants, which are no longer applicable. The facilities comprise a total of approximately 660,000 square feet.
EA had accounted for the lease arrangements as operating leases in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 13, , as amended. Beginning in July 2009, EA will record the facilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheet and except for the fair value of the land acquired, will depreciate the underlying assets acquired on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. EA expects the purchase of the facilities will have a net positive financial impact on its fiscal year 2010 GAAP net income, but does not expect a significant financial impact on its non-GAAP net income.
