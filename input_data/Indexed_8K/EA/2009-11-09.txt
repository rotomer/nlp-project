On November 9, 2009, Electronic Arts Nederland B.V. ("EA Nederland"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Electronic Arts Inc. ("EA"), and the equity holders (the "Sellers") of Playfish Limited ("Playfish") entered into and closed a definitive agreement for the sale and purchase of Playfish (the "Purchase Agreement"), pursuant to which EA Nederland purchased all of the outstanding capital stock of Playfish. The consideration paid by EA Nederland consisted of: (i) approximately $275 million in cash and (ii) approximately $25 million in equity retention arrangements in the form of restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards to acquire EA common stock. In addition, the Sellers are entitled to additional variable cash consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of certain performance milestones through December 31, 2011. The additional consideration is limited to a maximum of $100 million.
EA has filed a copy of the Purchase Agreement as Exhibit 2.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. You are encouraged to read the Purchase Agreement for a more complete understanding of the transaction. The foregoing description of the Purchase Agreement is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Purchase Agreement, which is incorporated herein by reference.
The Purchase Agreement has been included to provide security holders with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about Playfish, EA or EA Nederland. The Purchase Agreement contains warranties of the parties thereto made to and solely for the benefit of each other. The assertions embodied in those warranties are qualified by information in a confidential disclosure letter that the parties have exchanged in connection with signing the Purchase Agreement. Moreover, certain warranties in the Purchase Agreement were used for the purpose of allocating risk, rather than establishing matters as facts. Accordingly, investors and security holders should not rely on the warranties as characterizations of the actual state of facts, since they were only made as of the date of the Purchase Agreement and are modified in important part by the underlying confidential disclosure letter.
 
On November 9, 2009, EA Nederland consummated the purchase of all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Playfish pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, as described in Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.
 
On November 9, 2009, EA issued a press release announcing its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2009. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. Neither the information in this Form 8-K nor the information in the press release shall be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
 
On November 6, 2009, EA management initiated a plan of restructuring (the "Plan") to narrow EA's product portfolio to provide greater focus on titles with higher margin opportunities. Under the Plan, EA anticipates (a) reducing its workforce by approximately 1,300 employees, (b) consolidating or closing various facilities, (c) eliminating certain titles, and (d) incurring IT and other costs to assist in reorganizing certain activities. EA expects the majority of these actions to be completed by March 31, 2010.
In connection with the Plan, EA anticipates incurring between approximately $130 million and $150 million in total costs, of which approximately $80 million to $90 million will result in future cash expenditures. Approximately $100 million to $120 million of these charges are expected to occur during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2010. These costs will consist primarily of severance and other employee-related costs (approximately $50 million to $60 million), facility closures costs (approximately $35
million), asset impairments (approximately $25 million to $35 million), and various other reorganizational costs (approximately $20 million).
The foregoing discussion of EA's plan of restructuring contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, including statements about EA's estimates and expectations regarding future restructuring charges, operating expenses and other costs are forward-looking. EA uses words such as "anticipate", "believe", "estimate", "expect", "intend" (and the negative of any of these terms), "future" and similar expressions to help identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to business and economic risks and reflect management's current estimates and expectations, and involve subjects that are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially from the expectations set forth in these forward-looking statements. EA will not necessarily update these forward-looking statements if they later turn out to be inaccurate. Risks and uncertainties that may affect EA's future results include, but are not limited to, those discussed above, under the heading "Risk Factors" in EA's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2009, and in other documents EA has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
On November 9, 2009, EA issued a press release in which it announced that it had acquired all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Playfish. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 Neither the information in Section 7.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K nor the information in the press release shall be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
 November 9, 2009  Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ: ERTS) today announced preliminary financial results for its second quarter ended September 30, 2009.
REDWOOD CITY, CA
(comparisons are to the quarter ended September 30, 2008)
Fiscal Second Quarter Results
GAAP net revenue for the quarter, which includes the impact of deferred net revenue adjustments, was $788 million as compared with $894 million for the prior year. During the quarter, EA had a net revenue deferral of $359 million related to certain online-enabled packaged goods and digital content as compared with $232 million in the second quarter of the prior year.
Non-GAAP net revenue for the quarter was a record $1.147 billion, up 2 percent as compared with $1.126 billion for the prior year. Revenues were above street expectations. Sales were driven by the launches of and .
FIFA 10, Madden NFL 10, The Beatles: Rock Band, Need for Speed SHIFT
NCAA Football 10
GAAP net loss for the quarter, including the impact of deferred net revenue, was $391 million as compared with a net loss of $310 million for the prior year. GAAP diluted loss per share was $1.21 as compared with GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.97 for the prior year.
Non-GAAP net income was $19 million as compared with a non-GAAP net loss of $20 million a year ago. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.06 as compared with a non-GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.06 for the prior year.
"EA is performing well, with quality, sales and segment share up so far this year," said John Riccitiello, Chief Executive Officer. "We are making tough calls to cut cost in targeted areas and investing more in our biggest games and digital businesses."
"We met our second quarter expectations and delivered a record quarter for revenue," said Eric Brown, Chief Financial Officer. Today we are announcing a significant cut in our operating expenses and the acquisition of a leader in social games, Playfish."
Acquisition of Playfish
EA has announced that it has acquired Playfish Limited, a leading social games company, for approximately $275 million in cash and approximately $25 million in equity retention arrangements. In addition, the sellers are entitled to up to an additional $100 million in consideration upon the achievement of certain performance milestones. The acquisition accelerates EA's growth in social entertainment and strengthens its focus on the transition to digital and social gaming.
Playfish will operate within EA Interactive, a division of EA focused on the web and wireless space. Playfish's industry-leading talent and critically acclaimed games join EA to capture the exciting opportunities for social gaming and networking across a mass-market audience.
Cost Reduction Plan
EA has announced a plan to narrow its product portfolio to provide greater focus on titles with higher margin opportunities.
This action will result in the closure of several facilities and a headcount reduction of approximately 1,500 positions, of which 1,300 are included in a restructuring plan. The majority of these actions will be completed by March 31, 2010. This plan will result in annual cost savings of at least $100 million and restructuring charges of $130 to $150 million.
EA remains committed to delivering high quality games for consumers and leading the industry in the growing digital direct gaming sector.
(comparisons are to the quarter ended September 30, 2008)
Highlights
 
Business Outlook
The following forward-looking statements, as well as those made above, reflect expectations as of November 9, 2009. Results may be materially different and are affected by many factors, including: development delays on EA's products; competition in the industry; the health of the economy in the U.S. and abroad and the related impact on discretionary consumer spending; changes in anticipated costs; expected savings and impact on EA's operations of the Company's cost reduction plan; consumer demand for console hardware and the ability of the console manufacturers to produce an adequate supply of consoles to meet that demand; changes in foreign exchange rates; the financial impact of the Playfish acquisition and potential future acquisitions by EA; the popular appeal of EA's products; EA's effective tax rate; and other factors detailed in this release and in EA's annual and quarterly SEC filings.
Fiscal Year Expectations  Ending March 31, 2010
 
The above fiscal 2010 expectations do not reflect the financial impact of the acquisition of Playfish Limited, which is expected to be roughly neutral to non-GAAP expectations and increase GAAP loss per share by $0.15 to $0.25, due primarily to acquisition-related tax expenses, deferred revenue adjustments, additional stock-based compensation, and amortization of intangible assets. These preliminary estimates are based on currently available information and are subject to change.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, Electronic Arts uses certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures used by Electronic Arts include: non-GAAP net revenue, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) and historical and estimated non-GAAP diluted earnings (loss) per share. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the following items, as applicable in a given reporting period, from the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations:
 
Electronic Arts may consider whether other significant non-recurring items that arise in the future should also be excluded in calculating the non-GAAP financial measures it uses.
Electronic Arts believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of the Company's core business, operating results or future outlook. Electronic Arts' management uses, and believes that investors benefit from referring to, these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the Company's operating results both as a consolidated entity and at the business unit level, as well as when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate comparisons of the Company's performance to prior periods.
In addition to the reasons stated above, which are generally applicable to each of the items Electronic Arts excludes from its non-GAAP financial measures, the Company believes it is appropriate to exclude certain items for the following reasons:
. When analyzing the operating performance of an acquired entity, Electronic Arts' management focuses on the total return provided by the investment (i.e., operating profit generated from the
Amortization of Intangibles
acquired entity as compared to the purchase price paid) without taking into consideration any allocations made for accounting purposes. Because the purchase price for an acquisition necessarily reflects the accounting value assigned to intangible assets (including acquired in-process technology and goodwill), when analyzing the operating performance of an acquisition in subsequent periods, the Company's management excludes the GAAP impact of acquired intangible assets to its financial results. Electronic Arts believes that such an approach is useful in understanding the long-term return provided by an acquisition and that investors benefit from a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the accounting expense associated with acquired intangible assets.
In addition, in accordance with GAAP, Electronic Arts generally recognizes expenses for internally-developed intangible assets as they are incurred, notwithstanding the potential future benefit such assets may provide. Unlike internally-developed intangible assets, however, and also in accordance with GAAP, the Company generally capitalizes the cost of acquired intangible assets and recognizes that cost as an expense over the useful lives of the assets acquired (other than goodwill, which is not amortized, and acquired in-process technology, which is expensed immediately, as required under GAAP). As a result of their GAAP treatment, there is an inherent lack of comparability between the financial performance of internally-developed intangible assets and acquired intangible assets. Accordingly, Electronic Arts believes it is useful to provide, as a supplement to its GAAP operating results, a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles.
Electronic Arts incurred significant legal, banking and other consulting fees related to the Company's proposed acquisition and related cash tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. On August 18, 2008, the Company allowed the tender offer to expire without purchasing any shares of Take-Two and, on September 14, 2008, the Company announced that it had terminated discussions with Take-Two. The costs incurred in connection with the abandoned proposal and tender offer were outside the ordinary course of business and were excluded by the Company when assessing the performance of its management team. As such, the Company believes it is appropriate to exclude such expenses from its non-GAAP financial measures.
Certain Abandoned Acquisition-Related Costs.
Electronic Arts is not able to objectively determine the fair value of the online service included in certain of its packaged goods and digital content. As a result, the Company recognizes the revenue from the sale of these games and content over the estimated online service period. In other transactions, at the date we sell the software product we have an obligation to provide incremental unspecified digital content in the future without an additional fee. In these cases, we account for the sale of the software product as a multiple element arrangement and recognize the revenue on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the game. Internally, Electronic Arts' management excludes the impact of the change in deferred net revenue related to packaged goods games and digital content in its non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating the Company's operating performance, when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods, and when assessing the performance of its management team. The Company believes that excluding the impact of the change in deferred net revenue from its operating results is important to (1) facilitate comparisons to prior periods during which the Company was able to objectively determine the fair value of the online service and not delay the recognition of significant amounts of net revenue related to online-enabled packaged goods and (2) understanding our operations because all related costs are expensed as incurred instead of deferred and recognized ratably.
Change in Deferred Net Revenue (Packaged Goods and Digital Content).
Adverse economic conditions, including the decline in the Company's market capitalization and expected financial performance, indicated that a potential impairment of goodwill existed during the three months ended December 31, 2008. As a result, the Company performed goodwill impairment tests for its reporting units and determined that goodwill related to its mobile reporting unit was impaired. As the Company excludes the GAAP impact of acquired intangible assets (such as goodwill) from its financial results when analyzing the operating performance of an acquisition in subsequent periods, Electronic Arts believes it is appropriate to exclude goodwill impairment charges from its non-GAAP financial measures.
Goodwill Impairment.
Loss on Lease Obligation and Facilities Acquisition. During the second quarter of fiscal 2010, Electronic Arts completed the acquisition of its headquarters facilities in Redwood City, California pursuant to the terms of the loan financing agreements underlying the build-to-suit leases for the facilities. These leases expired in July 2009, and had previously been accounted for as operating leases. The total amount paid under the terms of the leases was $247 million, of which $233 million related to the purchase price of the facilities and $14 million was for the loss on our lease obligation. In addition, Electronic Arts recorded a tax benefit of approximately $31 million, consisting of approximately $6 million related to the loss on our lease obligation, and a $25 million reduction in our valuation allowance due to the acquisition. As a result of this lease obligation and facility acquisition, on an after-tax basis, Electronic Arts incurred a positive net income effect of $17 million. Electronic Arts' management excluded the effect of this transaction when evaluating the Company's operating performance and when assessing the performance of its management team during this period and will continue to do so, when it plans, forecasts and analyzes future periods. 
. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, Electronic Arts amended an agreement with a content licensor. This amendment resulted in the termination of our rights to use the licensor's intellectual property in certain products and we incurred a related estimated loss of $38 million. This significant non-recurring loss is excluded from our Non-GAAP financial measures in order to provide comparability between periods. Further, the Company excluded this loss when evaluating its operating performance and the performance of its management team during this period and will continue to do so when it plans, forecasts and analyzes future periods.
Loss on Licensed Intellectual Property Commitment
From time to time, the Company makes strategic investments. Electronic Arts' management excludes the impact of any losses and gains on such investments when evaluating the Company's operating performance, when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods, and when assessing the performance of its management team. In addition, the Company believes that excluding the impact of such losses and gains on these investments from its operating results is important to facilitate comparisons to prior periods.
Losses (Gains) on Strategic Investments.
Although Electronic Arts has engaged in various restructuring activities in the past, each has been a discrete, extraordinary event based on a unique set of business objectives. Each of these restructurings has been unlike its predecessors in terms of its operational implementation, business impact and scope. As such, the Company believes it is appropriate to exclude restructuring charges from its non-GAAP financial measures.
Restructuring Charges.
. When evaluating the performance of its individual business units, the Company does not consider stock-based compensation charges. Likewise, the Company's management teams exclude stock-based compensation expense from their short and long-term operating plans. In contrast, the Company's management teams are held accountable for cash-based compensation and such amounts are included in their operating plans. Further, when considering the impact of equity award grants, Electronic Arts places a greater emphasis on overall shareholder dilution rather than the accounting charges associated with such grants.
Stock-Based Compensation
Video game platforms have historically had a life cycle of four to six years, which causes the video game software market to be cyclical. The Company's management analyzes its business and operating performance in the context of these business cycles, comparing Electronic Arts' performance at similar stages of different cycles. For comparability purposes, Electronic Arts believes it is useful to provide a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes stock-based compensation in order to better understand the long-term performance of its core business.
The Company uses a fixed, long-term projected tax rate of 28 percent internally to evaluate its operating performance, to forecast, plan and analyze future periods, and to assess the performance of its management team. Accordingly, the Company has applied the same 28 percent tax rate to its non-GAAP financial results.
Income Tax Adjustments.
In the financial tables below, Electronic Arts has provided a reconciliation of the most comparable GAAP financial measure to the historical non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release.
