Exhibit 10.1
The purpose of this Plan is to provide incentives to attract retain and motivate eligible persons whose present and potential contributions are important to the success of the Company, its Parent and Subsidiaries by offering them an opportunity to participate in the Company's future performance through awards of Options, Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, and Stock Appreciation Rights. Capitalized terms not defined in the text are defined in Section 24.

PURPOSE
2. .
SHARES SUBJECT TO THE PLAN
2.1 . Subject to Sections 2.2, 2.3 and 19, the aggregate number of Shares that have been reserved pursuant to this Plan is 120,865,000 Shares. Shares that are: (a) subject to issuance upon exercise of an Award but cease to be subject to such Award for any reason other than exercise of such Award; (b) subject to an Award granted hereunder but are forfeited; or (c) subject to an Award that otherwise terminates or is settled without Shares being issued shall revert to and again become available for issuance under the Plan in the same amount as such Shares were counted against the number of Shares reserved pursuant to Section 2.2. The following Shares shall not again become available for issuance under the Plan: (x) Shares that are not issued or delivered as a result of the net settlement of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right; (y) Shares that are used to pay the exercise price or withholding taxes related to an Award; or (z) Shares that are repurchased by the Company with the proceeds of an Option exercise. At all times the Company shall reserve and keep available a sufficient number of Shares as shall be required to satisfy the requirements of all outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights granted under this Plan and all other outstanding but unvested Awards granted under this Plan.
Number of Shares Available for Awards
2.2 . Shares covered by an award shall be counted as used as of the Grant Date. Any Shares that are subject to Awards of Options or SARs, granted on or after July 31, 2008, shall be counted against the aggregate number of Shares reserved as set forth in Section 2.1 as one (1) Share for every one (1) Share subject to an Award of Options or SARs. Any Shares that are subject to Awards other than Options or SARs, granted (a) on or after July 31, 2008 but prior to July 29, 2009, shall be counted against the number of Shares available for grant (as set forth in Section 2.1) as 1.82 Shares for every one (1) Share granted; and (b) on or after July 29, 2009, shall be counted against the number of Shares available for grant (as set forth in Section 2.1) as 1.43 Shares for every one (1) Share granted.
Share Usage
2.3 . In the event that the number of outstanding shares is changed by a stock dividend, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, subdivision, combination, reclassification or similar change in the capital structure of the Company without consideration, then (a) the number of Shares reserved for issuance under this Plan, (b) the Exercise Prices of and number of Shares subject to outstanding Awards, and (c) the number of Shares associated with other outstanding Awards, will be proportionately adjusted, subject to any required action by the Board or the stockholders of the Company and compliance with applicable securities laws; provided, however, that fractions of a Share will not be issued but will either be replaced by a cash payment equal to the Fair Market Value of such fraction of a Share or will be rounded up to the nearest whole Share, as determined by the Committee.
Adjustment of Shares
ISOs (as defined in Section 5 below) may be granted only to employees (including officers and directors who are also employees) of the Company or of a Parent or Subsidiary of the Company. All other Awards may be granted to employees and directors of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary of the Company. No person will be eligible to receive Awards covering more than 2,000,000 Shares in any fiscal year under this
3. .
ELIGIBILITY
 
Plan. For purposes of these limits, each Restricted Stock Unit settled in Shares (but not those settled in cash), shall be deemed to cover one Share. A person may be granted more than one Award under this Plan.
4. .
ADMINISTRATION
4.1. This Plan will be administered by the Committee or by the Board acting as the Committee. Subject to the general purposes, terms and conditions of this Plan, and to the direction of the Board, the Committee will have full power to implement and carry out this Plan. The Committee will have the authority to:
Committee Authority
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.2. Any determination made by the Committee with respect to any Award will be made in its sole discretion at the time of grant of the Award or, unless in contravention of any express term of this Plan or Award, at any later time, and such determination will be final and binding on the Company and on all persons having an interest in any Award under this Plan. The Committee may delegate to one or more officers of the Company the authority to (i) construe and interpret this Plan, any Award Agreement and any other agreement or document executed pursuant to this Plan, and (ii) grant an Award under this Plan to Participants who are not Insiders of the Company.
Committee Discretion
4.3. To the extent that Awards are granted hereunder as "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, the Plan shall be administered by a committee, which may be the Committee, of two or more "outside directors" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code. For purposes of qualifying grants of Awards as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code, the committee, in its discretion, may set restrictions based upon the achievement of performance goals. The performance goals shall be set by the committee on or before the latest date permissible to enable the Awards to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code. In granting Awards that are intended to qualify under Section 162(m) of the Code, the committee shall follow any procedures determined by it from time to time to be necessary or appropriate to ensure qualification of the Awards under Section 162(m) of the Code (e.g., in determining the performance goals).
Section 162(m)
The Committee may grant Options to eligible persons and will determine whether such Options will be Incentive Stock Options within the meaning of the Code ("ISO") or Nonqualified Stock Options ("NQSOs"), the number of Shares subject to the Option, the Exercise Price of the Option, the period during which the Option may be exercised, and all other terms and conditions of the Option, subject to the following:
5. .
OPTIONS
5.1 . Each Option granted under this Plan will be evidenced by an Award Agreement which will expressly identify the Option as an ISO or an NQSO ("Stock Option Agreement"), and
Form of Option Grant
 
will be in such form and contain such provisions (which need not be the same for each Participant) as the Committee may from time to time approve, and which will comply with and be subject to the terms and conditions of this Plan.
5.2 . The date of grant of an Option will be the date on which the Committee makes the determination to grant such Option, unless otherwise specified by the Committee. The Stock Option Agreement and a copy of this Plan will be delivered to the Participant within a reasonable time after the granting of the Option.
Date of Grant
5.3 .
Exercise Period; Performance Goals
(a) Options may be exercisable within the times or upon the events determined by the Committee as set forth in the Stock Option Agreement governing such Option; provided, however, that no Option will be exercisable after the expiration of ten (10) years from the date the Option is granted; and provided, further, that no ISO granted to a person who directly or by attribution owns more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or of any Parent or Subsidiary of the Company ("") will be exercisable after the expiration of five (5) years from the date the ISO is granted. The Committee also may provide for Options to become exercisable at one time or from time to time, periodically or otherwise, in such number of Shares or percentage of Shares as the Committee determines.
Ten Percent Stockholder
(b) Participant's ability to exercise Options shall be subject to such restrictions, if any, as the Committee may impose. These restrictions may be based upon completion of a specified number of years of service with the Company or a Subsidiary or upon completion of the performance goals as set out in advance in the Participant's individual Stock Option Agreement. Options may vary from Participant to Participant and between groups of Participants. Should the Committee elect to impose restrictions on an Option, the Committee shall: (a) determine the nature, length and starting date of any Performance Period for the Option; (b) select from among the Performance Factors to be used to measure performance goals, if any; and (c) determine the number of Shares subject to such Option. Prior to such Option becoming exercisable, the Committee shall determine the extent to which such Performance Factors have been met. Performance Periods may overlap and Participants may participate simultaneously with respect to Options that are subject to different Performance Periods and have different performance goals and other criteria.
5.4 . The Exercise Price of an Option will be determined by the Committee when the Option is granted and may be not less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date of grant; provided that the Exercise Price of any ISO granted to a Ten Percent Stockholder will not be less than 110% of the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date of grant. Payment for the Shares purchased may be made in accordance with Section 9 of this Plan.
Exercise Price
5.5 . Options may be exercised only by delivery to the Company of a written stock option exercise agreement (the "") in a form approved by the Committee (which need not be the same for each Participant), stating the number of Shares being purchased, the restrictions imposed on the Shares purchased under such Exercise Agreement, if any, and such representations and agreements regarding Participant's investment intent and access to information and other matters, if any, as may be required or desirable by the Company to comply with applicable securities laws, together with payment in full of the Exercise Price for the number of Shares being purchased.
Method of Exercise
Exercise Agreement
5.6 . Notwithstanding the exercise periods set forth in the Stock Option Agreement, exercise of an Option will always be subject to the following:
Termination
(a) If the Participant is Terminated for any reason except death or Disability, then the Participant may exercise such Participant's Options only to the extent that such Options would have been exercisable upon the Termination Date no later than three (3) months after the Termination Date (or such shorter or longer time period not exceeding five (5) years as may be determined by the Committee, with any exercise beyond three (3) months after the Termination Date deemed to be an NQSO), but in any event, no later than the expiration date of the Options.
 
(b) If the Participant is Terminated because of Participant's death or Disability (or the Participant dies within three (3) months after a Termination other than for Cause or because of Participant's Disability), then Participant's Options may be exercised only to the extent that such Options would have been exercisable by Participant on the Termination Date and must be exercised by Participant (or Participant's legal representative or authorized assignee) no later than twelve (12) months after the Termination Date (or such shorter or longer time period not exceeding five (5) years as may be determined by the Committee, with any such exercise beyond (a) three (3) months after the Termination Date when the Termination is for any reason other than the Participant's death or Disability, or (b) twelve (12) months after the Termination Date when the Termination is for Participant's death or Disability, deemed to be an NQSO), but in any event no later than the expiration date of the Options.
(c) Notwithstanding the provisions in paragraph 5.6(a) above, if a Participant is terminated for Cause, neither the Participant, the Participant's estate nor such other person who may then hold the Option shall be entitled to exercise any Option with respect to any Shares whatsoever, after termination of service, whether or not after termination of service the Participant may receive payment from the Company or Subsidiary for vacation pay, for services rendered prior to termination, for services rendered for the day on which termination occurs, for salary in lieu of notice, or for any other benefits. In the event that the Committee has delegated to one or more officers of the Company the authority set forth in Section 4.2 above and Participant has been notified that such officer or officers has made a determination that Participant has been terminated for Cause, Participant shall have five (5) business days (measured from the date he or she was first notified of such determination) to appeal such determination to the Committee. If Participant appeals to the Committee in a timely manner, the Committee shall give the Participant an opportunity to present to the Committee evidence on his or her behalf. If the Committee has not delegated to one or more officers of the Company the authority set forth in Section 4.2, and the Committee makes such Cause determination itself, such decision shall be deemed final and unappealable. For the purpose of this paragraph, termination of service shall be deemed to occur on the date when the Company or Subsidiary dispatches notice or advice to the Participant that his service is terminated.
5.7 . The Committee may specify a reasonable minimum number of Shares that may be purchased on any exercise of an Option, provided that such minimum number will not prevent Participant from exercising the Option for the full number of Shares for which it is then exercisable.
Limitations on Exercise
5.8 . The aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the date of grant) of Shares with respect to which ISO are exercisable for the first time by a Participant during any calendar year (under this Plan or under any other incentive stock option plan of the Company, Parent or Subsidiary of the Company) will not exceed $100,000. If the Fair Market Value of Shares on the date of grant with respect to which ISO are exercisable for the first time by a Participant during any calendar year exceeds $100,000, then the Options for the first $100,000 worth of Shares to become exercisable in such calendar year will be ISO and the Options for the amount in excess of $100,000 that become exercisable in that calendar year will be NQSOs. In the event that the Code or the regulations promulgated thereunder are amended after the Effective Date of this Plan to provide for a different limit on the Fair Market Value of Shares permitted to be subject to ISO, such different limit will be automatically incorporated herein and will apply to any Options granted after the effective date of such amendment.
Limitations on ISO
5.9 . The Committee may modify, extend or renew outstanding Options and authorize the grant of new Options, provided however, that (i) any such action may not, without the written consent of a Participant, impair any of such Participant's rights under any Option previously granted, (ii) any such action shall not extend the exercise period of the Option to a date later than the later of (a) the fifteenth day of the third month following the date on which the Option otherwise would have expired or (b) December 31 of the calendar year in which the Option would have otherwise expired, and (iii) the Committee may not reduce the Exercise Price of outstanding Options without the approval of the stockholders. Any outstanding ISO that is modified, extended, renewed or otherwise altered will be treated in accordance with Section 424(h) of the Code.
Modification, Extension or Renewal
 
5.10 . Notwithstanding any other provision in this Plan, no term of this Plan relating to ISO will be interpreted, amended or altered, nor will any discretion or authority granted under this Plan be exercised, so as to disqualify this Plan under Section 422 of the Code or, without the consent of the Participant affected, to disqualify any ISO under Section 422 of the Code.
No Disqualification
A Restricted Stock Award is an offer by the Company to grant or to sell to an eligible person Shares that are subject to restrictions. The Committee will determine to whom an offer will be made, the number of Shares the person may purchase, the price to be paid (the "Purchase Price"), if any, the restrictions to which the Shares will be subject, and all other terms and conditions of the Restricted Stock Award, subject to the following:
6. .
RESTRICTED STOCK
6.1. All grants or purchases under a Restricted Stock Award made pursuant to this Plan will be evidenced by an Award Agreement ("Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement") that will be in such form (which need not be the same for each Participant) as the Committee will from time to time approve, and will comply with and be subject to the terms and conditions of this Plan. The offer of Restricted Stock will be accepted by the Participant's execution and delivery of the Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement and full payment, if any, for the Shares to the Company within thirty (30) days, or such other date as may be set forth in the Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement, from the date the Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement is delivered to the person. If such person does not execute and deliver the Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement along with full payment, if any, for the Shares to the Company within thirty (30) days, or such other date as may be set forth in the Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement, then the offer will terminate, unless otherwise determined by the Committee.
Form of Restricted Stock Award
6.2. The Purchase Price of Shares sold pursuant to a Restricted Stock Award, if any, will be determined by the Committee on the date the Restricted Stock Award is granted. At the Committee's discretion, consideration for the Restricted Stock Award may be in the form of continued service to the Company or a Subsidiary. Payment of the Purchase Price may be made in accordance with Section 9 of this Plan.
Purchase Price
6.3. Restricted Stock Awards shall be subject to such restrictions as the Committee may impose. These restrictions may be based upon completion of a specified number of years of service with the Company or a Subsidiary or upon completion of the performance goals as set out in advance in the Participant's individual Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement. Restricted Stock Awards may vary from Participant to Participant and between groups of Participants. Prior to the grant of a Restricted Stock Award, the Committee shall: (a) determine the nature, length and starting date of any Performance Period for the Restricted Stock Award; (b) select from among the Performance Factors to be used to measure performance goals, if any; and (c) determine the number of Shares that may be awarded to the Participant. Prior to the payment of any Restricted Stock Award, the Committee shall determine the extent to which such Restricted Stock Award has been earned. Performance Periods may overlap and Participants may participate simultaneously with respect to Restricted Stock Awards that are subject to different Performance Periods and having different performance goals and other criteria.
Terms of Restricted Stock Awards
6.4. If a Participant is Terminated during a Performance Period for any reason, then such Participant will be entitled to payment (whether in Shares, cash or otherwise) with respect to the Restricted Stock Award only to the extent earned as of the date of Termination in accordance with the Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement, unless the Committee determines otherwise in the case of a Participant who is not a "covered employee" for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code in the year of Termination.
Termination During Performance Period
Each Restricted Stock Unit shall have a value equal to the Fair Market Value of a share of the Company's Common Stock. A Restricted Stock Unit does not constitute a share of, nor represent any ownership interest in, the Company. The Committee will determine the number of Restricted Stock Units granted to any eligible person; whether the Restricted Stock Units will be settled in Shares, in cash, or in a combination of the two; the price to be paid (the "Purchase Price"), if any, for any Shares issued pursuant to a Restricted Stock Unit; the restrictions to which the Restricted Stock Units will be subject, and all other terms and conditions of the Restricted Stock Units, subject to the following:
7. .
RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS
 
7.1 . All Restricted Stock Units granted pursuant to this Plan will be evidenced by an Award Agreement ("Restricted Stock Unit Agreement") that will be in such form (which need not be the same for each Participant) as the Committee will from time to time approve, and will comply with and be subject to the terms and conditions of this Plan. The offer of Restricted Stock Units will be accepted by the Participant's execution and delivery of the Restricted Stock Unit Agreement within thirty (30) days, or such other date as may be set forth in the Restricted Stock Unit Agreement, from the date the Restricted Stock Unit Agreement is delivered to the person. If such person does not execute and deliver the Restricted Stock Unit Agreement within thirty (30) days, or such other date as may be set forth in the Restricted Stock Unit Agreement, then the offer will terminate, unless otherwise determined by the Committee.
Form of Restricted Stock Unit Award
7.2 . The Purchase Price of Shares sold pursuant to a Restricted Stock Unit, if any, will be determined by the Committee on the date the Restricted Stock Unit is granted. At the Committee's discretion, consideration for the Restricted Stock Unit may be in the form of continued service to the Company or a Subsidiary. Payment of the Purchase Price, if any, shall be made in accordance with Section 9 of this Plan when the Shares are issued.
Purchase Price
7.3 . Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to such restrictions as the Committee may impose. These restrictions may be based upon completion of a specified number of years of service with the Company or a Subsidiary or upon completion of the performance goals as set out in advance in the Participant's individual Restricted Stock Unit Agreement. Restricted Stock Units may vary from Participant to Participant and between groups of Participants. Prior to the grant of Restricted Stock Units, the Committee shall: (a) determine the nature, length and starting date of any Performance Period for the Restricted Stock Unit; (b) select from among the Performance Factors to be used to measure performance goals, if any; and (c) determine the number of Restricted Stock Units that will be awarded to the Participant. Prior to the payment (whether in Shares, cash or otherwise) of any Restricted Stock Units, the Committee shall determine the extent to which such Restricted Stock Units have been earned. Performance Periods may overlap and Participants may participate simultaneously with respect to Restricted Stock Units that are subject to different Performance Periods and have different performance goals and other criteria.
Terms of Restricted Stock Units
7.4 . If a Participant is Terminated during a Performance Period for any reason, then such Participant will be entitled to payment (whether in Shares, cash or otherwise) with respect to the Restricted Stock Units only to the extent earned as of the date of Termination in accordance with the Restricted Stock Unit Agreement, unless the Committee determines otherwise in the case of a Participant who is not a "covered employee" for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code in the year of Termination.
Termination During Performance Period
7.5 . The cash or Shares that a Participant is entitled to receive pursuant to a Restricted Stock Unit shall be paid or issued to the Participant when all applicable restrictions and other conditions applicable to the Restricted Stock Unit have lapsed or have been satisfied, unless the Restricted Stock Unit Agreement provides for a later settlement date in compliance with Section 409A of the Code.
Payment When Restrictions Lapse
The Committee may grant Stock Appreciation Rights or SARs to eligible persons and will determine the number of Shares subject to the SARs, the Exercise Price of the SARs, the period during which the SARs may be exercised, and all other terms and conditions of the SARs, subject to the following:
8. .
STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS
8.1 . SARs granted under this Plan will be evidenced by an Award Agreement that will expressly identify the SARs as freestanding SARs (SARs granted independent of any other Option), tandem SARs (SARs granted in connection with an Option, or any portion thereof), or any combination thereof ("SAR Agreement"), and will be in such form and contain such provisions (which need not be the same for each Participant) as the Committee may from time to time approve, and which will comply with and be subject to the terms and conditions of this Plan.
Form of SAR Grant
 
8.2 . The date of grant of a SAR will be the date on which the Committee makes the determination to grant such SAR, unless otherwise specified by the Committee. The SAR Agreement and a copy of this Plan will be delivered to the Participant within a reasonable time after the granting of the SAR.
Date of Grant
8.3 .
Exercise Price and Other Terms
(a) The Committee, subject to the provisions of the Plan, shall have complete discretion to determine the terms and conditions of SARs granted under the Plan; provided, however, that no SAR will be exercisable after the expiration of ten (10) years from the date the SAR is granted; provided, further, that the Exercise Price for freestanding SARs shall be not less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the grant date. The Exercise Price for tandem SARs shall equal the Exercise Price of the related Option.
(b) Participant's ability to exercise SARs shall be subject to such restrictions, if any, as the Committee may impose. These restrictions may be based upon completion of a specified number of years of service with the Company or a Subsidiary or upon completion of the performance goals as set out in advance in the Participant's individual SAR Agreement. SARs may vary from Participant to Participant and between groups of Participants. Should the Committee elect to impose restrictions on a SAR, the Committee shall: (a) determine the nature, length and starting date of any Performance Period for the SAR; (b) select from among the Performance Factors to be used to measure performance goals, if any; and (c) determine the number of Shares subject to such SAR. Prior to such SAR becoming exercisable, the Committee shall determine the extent to which such Performance Factors have been met. Performance Periods may overlap and Participants may participate simultaneously with respect to SAR that are subject to different Performance Periods and have different performance goals and other criteria.
8.4 . Tandem SARs may be exercised for all or part of the Shares subject to the related Option upon the surrender of the right to exercise the equivalent portion of the related Option. Tandem SARs may be exercised only with respect to the Shares for which the related Option is then exercisable. With respect to tandem SARs granted in connection with an Option: (a) the tandem SARs shall expire no later than the expiration of the underlying Option; (b) the value of the payout with respect to the tandem SARs shall be for no more than one hundred percent (100%) of the difference between the Exercise Price of the underlying Option and the Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to the underlying Option at the time the tandem SARs are exercised; and (c) the tandem SARs shall be exercisable only when the Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to the underlying Option exceeds the Exercise Price of the Option.
Exercise of Tandem SARs
8.5 . Freestanding SARs shall be exercisable on such terms and conditions as the Committee, in its sole discretion, shall determine.
Exercise of Freestanding SARs
8.6 . Upon exercise of a SAR, a Participant shall be entitled to receive payment from the Company in an amount determined by multiplying:
Payment of SAR Amount
(a) The difference between (i) the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of exercise (or such other date as may be determined by the Committee and set forth in the Participant's SAR Agreement) and (ii) the Exercise Price; times
(b) The number of Shares with respect to which the SAR is exercised.
At the discretion of the Committee, the payment upon exercise of the SAR may be in cash, in Shares of equivalent value, or in some combination thereof.
8.7 . Notwithstanding the exercise periods set forth in the SAR Agreement, exercise of a SAR will always be subject to the following:
Termination
(a) If the Participant is Terminated for any reason except death or Disability, then the Participant may exercise such Participant's SAR only to the extent that such SAR would have been exercisable upon the Termination Date no later than three (3) months after the Termination Date (or such shorter or longer time period
 
not exceeding five (5) years as may be determined by the Committee), but in any event, no later than the expiration date of the SAR.
(b) If the Participant is Terminated because of Participant's death or Disability (or the Participant dies within three (3) months after a Termination other than for Cause or because of Participant's Disability), then Participant's SAR may be exercised only to the extent that such SAR would have been exercisable by Participant on the Termination Date and must be exercised by Participant (or Participant's legal representative or authorized assignee) no later than twelve (12) months after the Termination Date, but in any event no later than the expiration date of the SAR.
(c) Notwithstanding the provisions in paragraph 8.7(a) above, if a Participant is terminated for Cause, neither the Participant, the Participant's estate nor such other person who may then hold the SAR shall be entitled to exercise any SAR with respect to any Shares whatsoever, after termination of service, whether or not after termination of service the Participant may receive payment from the Company or Subsidiary for vacation pay, for services rendered prior to termination, for services rendered for the day on which Termination occurs, for salary in lieu of notice, or for any other benefits. In the event that the Committee has delegated to one or more officers of the Company the authority set forth in Section 4.2 above and Participant has been notified that such officer or officers has made a determination that Participant has been terminated for Cause, Participant shall have five (5) business days (measured from the date he or she was first notified of such determination) to appeal such determination to the Committee. If Participant appeals to the Committee in a timely manner, the Committee shall give the Participant an opportunity to present to the Committee evidence on his or her behalf. If the Committee has not delegated to one or more officers of the Company the authority set forth in Section 4.2, and the Committee makes such Cause determination itself, such decision shall be deemed final and unappealable. For the purpose of this paragraph, termination of service shall be deemed to occur on the date when the Company or Subsidiary dispatches notice or advice to the Participant that his service is terminated.
8.8 . The Committee may modify, extend or renew outstanding SARs and authorize the grant of new SARs, provided however, that (i) any such action may not, without the written consent of a Participant, impair any of such Participant's rights under any SAR previously granted, (ii) any such action shall not extend the exercise period of the SAR to a date later than the later of (a) the fifteenth day of the third month following the date on which the SAR otherwise would have expired or (b) December 31 of the calendar year in which the Option would have otherwise expired, and (iii) the Committee may not reduce the Exercise Price of outstanding SARs without the approval of the stockholders.

GRANTS TO OUTSIDE DIRECTORS
10.1 . Outside Directors are eligible to receive any type of Award offered under this Plan except ISOs. Awards pursuant to this Section 10 may be automatically made pursuant to policy adopted by the Board, or made from time to time as determined in the discretion of the Board.
Types of Awards and Shares
10.2 . Awards pursuant to this Section 10 shall be granted only to Outside Directors. An Outside Director who is appointed, elected or re-elected as a member of the Board will be eligible to receive an Award under this Section 10.
Eligibility
10.3 .
Vesting, Exercisability and Settlement
(a) Except as set forth below in Section 10.3(b), Awards shall vest, become exercisable and be settled as determined by the Board. With respect to Options and SARs, the exercise price granted to Outside Directors shall not be less than the Fair Market Value of the Shares at the time that such Option or SAR is granted.
(b) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, in the event of a corporate transaction described in Section 19.1, the vesting of all Awards granted to Outside Directors pursuant to this Section 10 will accelerate and such Awards will become exercisable (to the extent applicable) in full prior to the consummation of such event at such times and on such conditions as the Committee determines, and must be exercised, if at all, within three months of the consummation of said event. Any Awards not exercised within such three-month period shall expire.
10.4 . Each Outside Director may elect to reduce all or part of the cash compensation otherwise payable for services to be rendered by him as a director (including the annual retainer and any fees payable for serving on the Board or a Committee of the Board) and to receive in lieu thereof Shares. Any such election shall be in writing and must be made before the services are rendered giving rise to such compensation, and may not be revoked or changed thereafter during the Outside Director's term. On such election, the cash compensation otherwise payable will be increased by 10% for purposes of determining the number of Shares to be credited to such Outside Director. If an Outside Director so elects to receive Shares in lieu of cash, there shall be credited to such Outside Director a number of Shares equal to the amount of the cash compensation so reduced (increased by 10% as described in the preceding sentence) divided by the Fair Market Value on the day in which the compensation would have been paid in the absence of such election.
Shares in Lieu of Cash Compensation
11. .
WITHHOLDING TAXES
11.1 . Whenever Shares are to be issued in satisfaction of Awards granted under this Plan, the Company may require the Participant to remit to the Company an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state and local withholding tax and social security requirements prior to the delivery of any certificate or certificates for such Shares.

cash, such payment will be net of an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state, and local withholding tax and social security requirements.
11.2 . When, under applicable tax or social security laws, a Participant incurs tax or social security liability in connection with the exercise or vesting of any Award that is subject to tax or social security withholding and the Participant is obligated to pay the Company the amount required to be withheld, the Committee may in its sole discretion allow the Participant to satisfy the minimum tax or social security withholding obligation by electing to have the Company withhold from the Shares to be issued that number of Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the minimum amount required to be withheld, determined on the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined. All elections by a Participant to have Shares withheld for this purpose will be made in accordance with the requirements established by the Committee and be in writing in a form acceptable to the Committee.

TRANSFERABILITY
12.1 Except as otherwise provided in this Section 12, Awards granted under this Plan, and any interest therein, will not be transferable or assignable by Participant, and may not be made subject to execution, attachment or similar process, otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or as determined by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement with respect to Awards that are not ISOs.
12.2 . All Awards other than NQSOs and SARs shall be exercisable: (i) during the Participant's lifetime, only by (A) the Participant, or (B) the Participant's guardian or legal representative; and (ii) after Participant's death, by the legal representative of the Participant's heirs or legatees.

"Permitted transfer" means, as authorized by this Plan and the Committee in a Stock Option Agreement or SAR Agreement, any transfer effected by the Participant during the Participant's lifetime of an interest in such NQSO and SAR but only such transfers which are by gift or domestic relations order. A permitted transfer does not include any transfer for value and neither of the following are transfers for value: (a) a transfer under a domestic relations order in settlement of marital property rights or (b) a transfer to an entity in which more than fifty percent of the voting interests are owned by Family Members or the Participant in exchange for an interest in that entity.

PRIVILEGES OF STOCK OWNERSHIP; RESTRICTIONS ON SHARES
13.1 . No Participant will have any of the rights of a stockholder with respect to any Shares until the Shares are issued to the Participant. After Shares are issued to the Participant, the Participant will be a stockholder and have all the rights of a stockholder with respect to such Shares, including the right to vote and receive all dividends or other distributions made or paid with respect to such Shares; provided, that if such Shares are Restricted Stock, then any new, additional or different securities the Participant may become entitled to receive with respect to such Shares by virtue of a stock dividend, stock split or any other change in the corporate or capital structure of the Company will be subject to the same restrictions as the Restricted Stock; provided, further, that the Participant will have no right to retain such stock dividends or stock distributions with respect to Shares that are repurchased at the Participant's Purchase Price or Exercise Price pursuant to Section 13.2.
Voting and Dividends
13.2 . At the discretion of the Committee, the Company may reserve to itself and/or its assignee(s) in the Award Agreement a right to repurchase a portion of or all Unvested Shares held by a Participant following such Participant's Termination at any time within ninety (90) days after the later of Participant's Termination Date and the date Participant purchases Shares under this Plan, for cash and/or cancellation of purchase money indebtedness, at the Participant's Exercise Price or Purchase Price, as the case may be.
Restrictions on Shares
 
All certificates for Shares or other securities delivered under this Plan will be subject to such stock transfer orders, legends and other restrictions as the Committee may deem necessary or advisable, including restrictions under any applicable federal, state or foreign securities law, or any rules, regulations and other requirements of the SEC or any stock exchange or automated quotation system upon which the Shares may be listed or quoted.
14. .
CERTIFICATES
To enforce any restrictions on a Participant's Shares, the Committee may require the Participant to deposit all certificates representing Shares, together with stock powers or other instruments of transfer approved by the Committee, appropriately endorsed in blank, with the Company or an agent designated by the Company to hold in escrow until such restrictions have lapsed or terminated, and the Committee may cause a legend or legends referencing such restrictions to be placed on the certificates. Any Participant who is permitted to execute a promissory note as partial or full consideration for the purchase of Shares under this Plan will be required to pledge and deposit with the Company all or part of the Shares so purchased as collateral to secure the payment of Participant's obligation to the Company under the promissory note; provided, however, that the Committee may require or accept other or additional forms of collateral to secure the payment of such obligation and, in any event, the Company will have full recourse against the Participant under the promissory note notwithstanding any pledge of the Participant's Shares or other collateral. In connection with any pledge of the Shares, Participant will be required to execute and deliver a written pledge agreement in such form as the Committee will from time to time approve. The Shares purchased with the promissory note may be released from the pledge on a pro rata basis as the promissory note is paid.
15. .
ESCROW; PLEDGE OF SHARES
The Committee may, at any time or from time to time, authorize the Company, with the consent of the respective Participants, to issue new Awards in exchange for the surrender and cancellation of any or all outstanding Awards; provided, however, that no such exchange program may, without the approval of the Company's stockholders, allow for the cancellation of an outstanding Option or Stock Appreciation Right followed by its replacement with a new Option or Stock Appreciation Right having a lower Exercise Price. The Committee may, subject to approval by the Company's stockholders, at any time buy from a Participant an Award previously granted with payment in cash, Shares (including Restricted Stock) or other consideration, based on such terms and conditions as the Committee and the Participant may agree.
16. .
EXCHANGE AND BUYOUT OF AWARDS
An Award will not be effective unless such Award is in compliance with all applicable federal and state securities laws, rules and regulations of any governmental body, and the requirements of any stock exchange or automated quotation system upon which the Shares may then be listed or quoted, as they are in effect on the date of grant of the Award and also on the date of exercise or other issuance. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Plan, the Company will have no obligation to issue or deliver certificates for Shares under this Plan prior to: (a) obtaining any approvals from governmental agencies that the Company determines are necessary or advisable; and/or (b) completion of any registration or other qualification of such Shares under any state or federal law or ruling of any governmental body that the Company determines to be necessary or advisable. The Company will be under no obligation to register the Shares with the SEC or to effect compliance with the registration, qualification or listing requirements of any state securities laws, stock exchange or automated quotation system, and the Company will have no liability for any inability or failure to do so.
17. .
SECURITIES LAW AND OTHER REGULATORY COMPLIANCE
Nothing in this Plan or any Award granted under this Plan will confer or be deemed to confer on any Participant any right to continue in the employ of, or to continue any other relationship with, the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary of the Company or limit in any way the right of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary of the Company to terminate Participant's employment or other relationship at any time, with or without cause.
18. .
NO OBLIGATION TO EMPLOY
19. .
CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS
19.1 . In the event of (a) a dissolution or liquidation of the Company, (b) a merger or consolidation in which the Company is not the surviving corporation (other than a merger or consolidation with a wholly-owned subsidiary, a reincorporation of the Company in a
Assumption or Replacement of Awards by Successor
 
different jurisdiction, or other transaction in which there is no substantial change in the stockholders of the Company or their relative stock holdings and the Awards granted under this Plan are assumed, converted or replaced by the successor corporation, which assumption will be binding on all Participants), (c) a merger in which the Company is the surviving corporation but after which the stockholders of the Company immediately prior to such merger (other than any stockholder that merges, or which owns or controls another corporation that merges, with the Company in such merger) cease to own their shares or other equity interest in the Company, (d) the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company, or (e) the acquisition, sale, or transfer of more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Company by tender offer or similar transaction, any or all outstanding Awards may be assumed, converted or replaced by the successor corporation (if any), which assumption, conversion or replacement will be binding on all Participants. In the alternative, the successor corporation may substitute equivalent Awards or provide substantially similar consideration to Participants as was provided to stockholders (after taking into account the existing provisions of the Awards). The successor corporation may also issue, in place of outstanding Shares of the Company held by the Participants, substantially similar shares or other property subject to repurchase restrictions no less favorable to the Participant. In the event such successor corporation (if any) refuses to assume or substitute Awards, as provided above, pursuant to a transaction described in this Section 19.1, such Awards will accelerate and will become exercisable in full prior to the consummation of such transaction at such time and on such conditions as the Committee will determine, and if such Awards are not exercised prior to the consummation of the corporate transaction, they shall terminate at such time as determined by the Committee.
19.2 . Subject to any greater rights granted to Participants under the foregoing provisions of this Section 19, in the event of the occurrence of any transaction described in Section 19.1, any outstanding Awards will be treated as provided in the applicable agreement or plan of merger, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation, or sale of assets.
Other Treatment of Awards
19.3 . The Company, from time to time, also may substitute or assume outstanding awards granted by another company, whether in connection with an acquisition of such other company or otherwise, by either; (a) granting an Award under this Plan in substitution of such other company's award; or (b) assuming such award as if it had been granted under this Plan if the terms of such assumed award could be applied to an Award granted under this Plan. Such substitution or assumption will be permissible if the holder of the substituted or assumed award would have been eligible to be granted an Award under this Plan if the other company had applied the rules of this Plan to such grant. In the event the Company assumes an award granted by another company, the terms and conditions of such award will remain unchanged (except that the exercise price and the number and nature of Shares issuable upon exercise of any such option will be adjusted appropriately pursuant to Sections 409A and 424(a) of the Code). In the event the Company elects to grant a new Option or SAR rather than assuming an existing option, such new Option or SAR may be granted with a similarly adjusted Exercise Price.
Assumption of Awards by the Company
This Plan will become effective on the date that it is adopted by the Board (the "Effective Date"). This Plan shall be approved by the stockholders of the Company (excluding Shares issued pursuant to this Plan), consistent with applicable laws, within twelve (12) months before or after the date this Plan is adopted by the Board. Upon the Effective Date, the Committee may grant Awards pursuant to this Plan; provided, however, that: (a) no Option or SAR may be exercised prior to initial stockholder approval of this Plan; (b) no Option or SAR granted pursuant to an increase in the number of Shares subject to this Plan approved by the Board will be exercised prior to the time such increase has been approved by the stockholders of the Company; (c) in the event that initial stockholder approval is not obtained within the time period provided herein, all Awards granted hereunder shall be cancelled, any Shares issued pursuant to any Awards shall be cancelled and any purchase of Shares issued hereunder shall be rescinded; and (d) in the event that stockholder approval of such increase is not obtained within the time period provided herein, all Awards granted pursuant to such increase will be cancelled, any Shares issued pursuant to any Award granted pursuant to such increase will be cancelled, and any purchase of Shares pursuant to such increase will be rescinded.
20. .

22. .
AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION OF PLAN
Neither the adoption of this Plan by the Board, the submission of this Plan to the stockholders of the Company for approval, nor any provision of this Plan will be construed as creating any limitations on the power of the Board to adopt such additional compensation arrangements as it may deem desirable, including, without limitation, the granting of stock options and bonuses otherwise than under this Plan, and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.

Otherwise, the Company may, at its discretion, rescind the Award and the Restricted Stock Units granted thereunder in its entirety.
APPENDIX A
ELECTRONIC ARTS INC.
RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD (U.S. EMPLOYEES)
UNDER THE 2000 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN
1. Form of Award. Each Restricted Stock Unit granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by an award of Restricted Stock Units (the "Award") in such form (which need not be the same for each Participant) as the Committee shall from time to time approve, which Award shall comply with and be subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan. Awards may be evidenced by paper copy or electronic copy.
2. Date of Grant. The date of grant of the Restricted Stock Units shall be the date on which the Committee makes the determination to grant such Restricted Stock Units, unless otherwise specified by the Committee. The Award representing the Restricted Stock Units will be delivered to Participant within a reasonable time after the granting of the Restricted Stock Units.
3. Award. Each Restricted Stock Unit represents the unsecured right to receive one share of Common Stock, subject to certain restrictions and subject to the terms and conditions contained in this Award and the Plan. In the event of any conflict between the terms of the Plan and this Award, the terms of the Plan shall govern. Any terms not defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Plan.
4. No Shareholder Rights. The Restricted Stock Units do not entitle Participant to any rights of a shareholder of Common Stock. The rights of Participant with respect to the Restricted Stock Units shall remain forfeitable at all times prior to the date on which such rights become vested.
5. Conversion of Restricted Stock Units; Issuance of Award Shares. No Award Shares shall be issued to Participant prior to the date on which the Restricted Stock Units vest. After any Restricted Stock Units vest, the Company shall promptly cause to be issued in book-entry form, registered in Participant's name or in the name of Participant's legal representatives, beneficiaries or heirs, as the case may be, Award Shares in payment of such vested whole Restricted Stock Units; provided, however, that in the event such Restricted Stock Units do not vest on a day during which the Common Stock is quoted on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (or traded on such other principal national securities market or exchange on which the Common Stock may then be listed) ("Trading Day"), the Company shall cause Award Shares to be issued on the next Trading Day following the date on which such Restricted Stock Units vest; provided, further, that in no event shall the Company cause such Award Shares to be issued later than two (2) months after the date on which such Restricted Stock Units vest. For purposes of this Award, the date on which vested Restricted Stock Units are converted into Award Shares shall be referred to as the "Conversion Date."
6. Fractional Restricted Stock Units. In the event Participant would otherwise become vested in a fractional portion of a Restricted Stock Unit (a "Fractional Portion") based on the vesting terms of the Restricted Stock Units, such Fractional Portion shall instead remain unvested until the final vesting date for the Restricted Stock Units; provided, however, that if Participant would otherwise vest in a subsequent Fractional Portion prior to the final vesting date for the Restricted Stock Units and such Fractional Portion taken together with a previous Fractional Portion that remained unvested would equal a whole Award Share, then such Fractional Portions shall vest and be converted into one Share. Upon the final vesting date, the value of any remaining Fractional Portion(s) shall be rounded up to the nearest whole Award Share at the same time as the conversion of the remaining Restricted Stock Units and issuance of Award Shares described in Section 5 above.
7. Restriction on Transfer. Neither the Restricted Stock Units nor any rights under this Award may be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of by Participant other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and any such purported sale, assignment, transfer, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition shall be void and unenforceable against the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Participant may, in the manner established by the Committee, designate a beneficiary or beneficiaries to exercise Participant's rights and receive any property distributable with respect to the Restricted Stock Units upon Participant's death.
8. Termination of Employment.
(a) Forfeiture of Unvested Restricted Stock Units Upon Termination of Employment, Other than Death or Disability. In the event that Participant's employment or service is Terminated for any reason other than death or Disability and the Restricted Stock Units are not yet fully vested as of the Termination Date (as defined in Section 10(i) below), then the unvested Restricted Stock Units shall be forfeited immediately upon such Termination Date.
(b) Termination of Employment Due to Death or Disability. If the Participant's employment is Terminated due to death or Disability after the first anniversary of the Award Date, a pro-rata portion of the Restricted Stock Units, to the extent that the Restricted Stock Units are partially vested on the Termination Date (as defined in Section 10(i) below), will be converted into Award Shares and issued to the Participant, or Participant's legal representatives, beneficiaries, or heirs, as the case may be. If the Participant's employment with the Company or Subsidiary is Terminated due to death or Disability, before the first anniversary of the Award Date, the entire Award shall be forfeited. In determining the pro-rata portion of the Restricted Stock Units that are vested on the Termination Date (as defined in Section 10(i) below), the Committee will consider the number of months worked by Participant during the 12-calendar month period preceding the next anniversary of the Award Date under the following formula:
Number of Restricted Stock Units scheduled to vest on the next anniversary of the Award Date multiplied by [Number of calendar months worked by Participant during the 12-month period prior to the next anniversary of the Award Date] divided by 12.
Participant shall be deemed to have worked a calendar month if Participant has worked any portion of that month. The Committee's determination of vested Restricted Stock Units shall be in whole Restricted Stock Units only and will be binding on the Participant.
9. Suspension of Award and Repayment of Proceeds for Contributing Misconduct.
If at any time the Committee reasonably believes that Participant has engaged in an act of misconduct, including, but not limited to an act of embezzlement, fraud or breach of fiduciary duty during the Participant's employment that contributed to an obligation to restate the Company's financial statements ("Contributing Misconduct"), the Committee may suspend the vesting of the Restricted Stock Units pending a determination of whether an act of Contributing Misconduct has been committed. If the Committee determines that Participant has engaged in an act of Contributing Misconduct, then the Restricted Stock Units will terminate immediately upon such determination and the Committee may require Participant to repay to the Company, in cash and upon demand, the Award Proceeds (as defined below) resulting from any sale or other disposition (including to the Company) of Award Shares issued or issuable upon the vesting of the Restricted Stock Units if the sale or disposition was effected during the twelve-month period following the first public issuance or filing with the SEC of the financial statements required to be restated. The term "Award Proceeds" means, with respect to any sale or other disposition (including to the Company) of Award Shares issued or issuable upon vesting of Restricted Stock Units, an amount determined appropriate by the Committee to reflect the effect of the restatement on the Company's Share price, up to the amount equal to the market value per Share at the time of such sale or other disposition multiplied by the number of Award Shares sold or disposed of. The return of Award Proceeds is in addition to and separate from any other relief available to the Company due to the Participant's Contributing Misconduct. Any determination by the Committee with respect to the foregoing shall be final, conclusive and binding on all interested parties. For any Participant who is designated as an "executive officer", the determination of the Committee shall be subject to the approval of the Board of Directors.
10. Acknowledgement of Nature of Plan and Award. In accepting the Award, Participant acknowledges, understands and agrees that:
(a) the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature and it may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time;
(b) the grant of Restricted Stock Units is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of Restricted Stock Units, or benefits in lieu of Restricted Stock Units, even if Restricted Stock Units have been granted repeatedly in the past;
(c) all decisions with respect to future grants of Restricted Stock Units, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company;
(d) nothing in the Plan or the Award shall confer on Participant any right to continue in the employ of, or other service relationship with, the Company or, if different, Participant's employer (the "Employer") or limit in any way the right of the Company or the Employer to terminate Participant's employment or service relationship at any time;
(e) Participant's participation in the Plan is voluntary;
(f) in the event that Participant is not an employee of the Company, the Award and Participant's participation in the Plan will not be interpreted to form an employment or service contract or relationship with the Company;
(g) the future value of the underlying Award Shares is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty;
(h) no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from termination of the Restricted Stock Units or diminution in value of the Restricted Stock Units or Award Shares received upon vesting of the Restricted Stock Units resulting from Termination of Participant's employment (for any reason whatsoever and whether or not in breach of local labor laws) , and in consideration of the grant of the Restricted Stock Units to which Participant is otherwise not entitled, Participant irrevocably agrees never to institute any claim against the Company or the Employer, waive his or her ability, if any, to bring any such claim, and release the Company and the Employer from any such claim; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is allowed by a court of competent jurisdiction, then, by participating in the Plan, Participant shall be deemed irrevocably to have agreed not to pursue such claim and agree to execute any and all documents necessary to request dismissal or withdrawal of such claims;
(i) in the event of Termination of Participant's employment (whether or not in breach of local labor laws), Participant's right to receive and vest in the Restricted Stock Units under the Plan, if any, will terminate effective as of the date that Participant is no longer actively employed (the "Termination Date") and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law (e.g., active employment would not include a period of "garden leave" or similar period pursuant to local law); the Committee shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when Participant is no longer actively employed for purposes of the Restricted Stock Units; and
(j) the Restricted Stock Units and the benefits under the Plan, if any, will not automatically transfer to another company in the case of a merger, take-over or transfer of liability.
11. No Advice Regarding Grant. The Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any recommendations regarding Participant's participation in the Plan, or Participant's acquisition or sale of the underlying Award Shares. Participant is hereby advised to consult with his or her own tax, legal and financial advisors regarding Participant's participation in the Plan before taking any action related to the Plan.
12. Tax Withholding. Regardless of any action the Company and/or the Employer takes with respect to any or all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to Participant's participation in the Plan and legally applicable to Participant ("Tax-Related Items"), Participant acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains Participant's responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. Participant further acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (1) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, the issuance of Award Shares upon settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, the subsequent sale of Award Shares acquired pursuant to such issuance and the receipt of any dividends; and (2) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units to reduce or eliminate Participant's liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if Participant has become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction between the date of grant and the date of any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, Participant acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
Prior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, Participant will pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, Participant authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy the obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following:
(i) withholding Shares from the delivery of the Award Shares, provided that the Company only withholds a number of Shares with a Fair Market Value equal to or below the minimum withholding amount for Tax-Related Items, provided, however, that in order to avoid issuing fractional Shares, the Company may round up to the next nearest number of whole Shares, as long as the Company issues no more than a single whole Share in excess of the minimum withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items. For example, if the minimum withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items is $225 and the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock is $50 per share, then the Company may withhold up to five (5) Shares from the delivery of Award Shares on the Conversion Date. The Company or the Employer will remit the total amount withheld for Tax-Related Items to the appropriate tax authorities; or
(ii) withholding from Participant's wages or other cash compensation paid to Participant by the Company and/or the Employer; or
(iii) withholding from proceeds of the sale of Award Shares acquired upon vesting/settlement of the Restricted Stock Units either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on Participant's behalf pursuant to this authorization).
If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, Participant is deemed to have been issued the full number of Award Shares subject to the vested Restricted Stock Units, notwithstanding that a number of the Award Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of any aspect of Participant's participation in the Plan.
Finally, Participant shall pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold as a result of Participant's participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by one or more of the means previously described. The Company may refuse to deliver the Award Shares or proceeds from the sale of Award Shares if Participant fails to comply with his or her obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.
13. Compliance with Laws and Regulations. The issuance and transfer of Award Shares shall be subject to compliance by the Company and the Participant with all applicable requirements of federal and state laws and with all applicable requirements of any stock exchange or national market system on which the Company's Common Stock may be listed at the time of such issuance or transfer. The Company is not required to issue or transfer Award Shares if to do so would violate such requirements.
14. Data Privacy. Participant hereby explicitly and unambiguously consents to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of his or her personal data as described in the Award and any other Award materials by and among, as applicable, the Employer, the Company and any Subsidiary or affiliate of the Company for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing Participant's participation in the Plan.

Participant understands that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage Participant's participation in the Plan. Participant understands that he or she may, at any time, view Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing Participant's local human resources representative. Participant understands, however, that refusing or withdrawing his or her consent may affect Participant's ability to participate in the Plan. For more information on the consequences of Participant's refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, Participant understands that he or she may contact his or her local human resources representative.
15. Electronic Delivery. The Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to current or future participation in the Plan by electronic means. Participant hereby consents to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agrees to participate in the Plan through an on-line or electronic system established and maintained by the Company or another third party designated by the Company.
16. Authority of the Board and the Committee. Any dispute regarding the interpretation of the Award shall be submitted by Participant, the Employer, or the Company, forthwith to either the Board or the Committee, which shall review such dispute at its next regular meeting. The resolution of such a dispute by the Board or Committee shall be final and binding on the Participant, the Employer, and/or the Company.
17. Deferral of Compensation. Payments made pursuant to this Plan and Award are intended to qualify for the "short-term deferral" exemption from Section 409A of the Code. The Company reserves the right, to the extent the Company deems necessary or advisable in its sole discretion, to unilaterally amend or modify the Plan and/or this Award agreement to ensure that all Awards are made in a manner that qualifies for exemption from or complies with Section 409A of the Code, provided however, that the Company makes no representations that the Award will be exempt from Section 409A of the Code and makes no undertaking to preclude Section 409A of the Code from applying to this Award.

APPENDIX A
ELECTRONIC ARTS INC.
RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD (NON-U.S. EMPLOYEES)
UNDER THE 2000 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN
1. Form of Award. Each Restricted Stock Unit granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by an award of Restricted Stock Units (the "Award") in such form (which need not be the same for each Participant) as the Committee shall from time to time approve, which Award shall comply with and be subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan. Awards may be evidenced by paper copy or electronic copy.
2. Date of Grant. The date of grant of the Restricted Stock Units shall be the date on which the Committee makes the determination to grant such Restricted Stock Units, unless otherwise specified by the Committee. The Award representing the Restricted Stock Units will be delivered to Participant within a reasonable time after the granting of the Restricted Stock Units.
3. Award. Each Restricted Stock Unit represents the unsecured right to receive one share of Common Stock, subject to certain restrictions and subject to the terms and conditions contained in this Award and the Plan. In the event of any conflict between the terms of the Plan and this Award, the terms of the Plan shall govern. Any terms not defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Plan.
4. No Shareholder Rights. The Restricted Stock Units do not entitle Participant to any rights of a shareholder of Common Stock. The rights of Participant with respect to the Restricted Stock Units shall remain forfeitable at all times prior to the date on which such rights become vested.
5. Conversion of Restricted Stock Units; Issuance of Award Shares. No Award Shares shall be issued to Participant prior to the date on which the Restricted Stock Units vest. After any Restricted Stock Units vest, the Company shall promptly cause to be issued in book-entry form, registered in Participant's name or in the name of Participant's legal representatives or heirs, as the case may be, Award Shares in payment of such vested whole Restricted Stock Units; provided, however, that in the event such Restricted Stock Units do not vest on a day during which the Common Stock is quoted on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (or traded on such other principal national securities market or exchange on which the Common Stock may then be listed) ("Trading Day"), the Company shall cause Award Shares to be issued on the next Trading Day following the date on which such Restricted Stock Units vest; provided, further, that in no event shall the Company cause such Award Shares to be issued later than two (2) months after the date on which such Restricted Stock Units vest. For purposes of this Award, the date on which vested Restricted Stock Units are converted into Award Shares shall be referred to as the "Conversion Date."
6. Fractional Restricted Stock Units. In the event Participant would otherwise become vested in a fractional portion of a Restricted Stock Unit (a "Fractional Portion") based on the vesting terms of the Restricted Stock Units, such Fractional Portion shall instead remain unvested until the final vesting date for the Restricted Stock Units; provided, however, that if Participant would otherwise vest in a subsequent Fractional Portion prior to the final vesting date for the Restricted Stock Units and such Fractional Portion taken together with a previous Fractional Portion that remained unvested would equal a whole Award Share, then such Fractional Portions shall vest and be converted into one Share. Upon the final vesting date, the value of any remaining Fractional Portion(s) shall be rounded up to the nearest whole Award Share at the same time as the conversion of the remaining Restricted Stock Units and issuance of Award Shares described in Section 5 above.
7. Restriction on Transfer. Neither the Restricted Stock Units nor any rights under this Award may be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of by Participant other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and any such purported sale, assignment, transfer, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition shall be void and unenforceable against the Company.
8. Termination of Employment.
(a) Forfeiture of Unvested Restricted Stock Units Upon Termination of Employment, Other than Death or Disability. In the event that Participant's employment or service is Terminated for any reason other than death or Disability and the Restricted Stock Units are not yet fully vested as of the Termination Date (as defined in Section 10(k) below), then the unvested Restricted Stock Units shall be forfeited immediately upon such Termination Date.
(b) Termination of Employment Due to Death or Disability. If the Participant's employment is Terminated due to death or Disability after the first anniversary of the Award Date, a pro-rata portion of the Restricted Stock Units, to the extent that the Restricted Stock Units are partially vested on the Termination Date (as defined in Section 10(k) below), will be converted into Award Shares and issued to the Participant, or Participant's legal representatives or heirs, as the case may be. If the Participant's employment with the Company or Subsidiary is Terminated due to death or Disability, before the first anniversary of the Award Date, the entire Award shall be forfeited. In determining the pro-rata portion of the Restricted Stock Units that are vested on the Termination Date (as defined in Section 10(k) below), the Committee will consider the number of months worked by Participant during the 12-calendar month period preceding the next anniversary of the Award Date under the following formula:
Number of Restricted Stock Units scheduled to vest on the next anniversary of the Award Date multiplied by [Number of calendar months worked by Participant during the 12-month period prior to the next anniversary of the Award Date] divided by 12.
Participant shall be deemed to have worked a calendar month if Participant has worked any portion of that month. The Committee's determination of vested Restricted Stock Units shall be in whole Restricted Stock Units only and will be binding on the Participant.
9. Suspension of Award and Repayment of Proceeds for Contributing Misconduct. If at any time the Committee reasonably believes that Participant has engaged in an act of misconduct, including, but not limited to an act of embezzlement, fraud or breach of fiduciary duty during the Participant's employment that contributed to an obligation to restate the Company's financial statements ("Contributing Misconduct"), the Committee may suspend the vesting of the Restricted Stock Units pending a determination of whether an act of Contributing Misconduct has been committed. If the Committee determines that Participant has engaged in an act of Contributing Misconduct, then the Restricted Stock Units will terminate immediately upon such determination and the Committee may require Participant to repay to the Company, in cash and upon demand, the Award Proceeds (as defined below) resulting from any sale or other disposition (including to the Company) of Award Shares issued or issuable upon the vesting of the Restricted Stock Units if the sale or disposition was effected during the twelve-month period following the first public issuance or filing with the SEC of the financial statements required to be restated. The term "Award Proceeds" means, with respect to any sale or other disposition (including to the Company) of Award Shares issued or issuable upon vesting of Restricted Stock Units, an amount determined appropriate by the Committee to reflect the effect of the restatement on the Company's Share price, up to the amount equal to the market value per Share at the time of such sale or other disposition multiplied by the number of Award Shares sold or disposed of. The return of Award Proceeds is in addition to and separate from any other relief available to the Company due to the Participant's Contributing Misconduct. Any determination by the Committee with respect to the foregoing shall be final, conclusive and binding on all interested parties. For any Participant who is designated as an "executive officer", the determination of the Committee shall be subject to the approval of the Board of Directors.
10. Acknowledgement of Nature of Plan and Award. In accepting the Award, Participant acknowledges, understands and agrees that:
(a) the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature and it may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time;
(b) the grant of Restricted Stock Units is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of Restricted Stock Units, or benefits in lieu of Restricted Stock Units, even if Restricted Stock Units have been granted repeatedly in the past;
(c) all decisions with respect to future grants of Restricted Stock Units, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company;
(d) nothing in the Plan or the Award shall confer on Participant any right to continue in the employ of, or other service relationship with, the Company or, if different, Participant's employer (the "Employer") or any Subsidiary or affiliate, or limit in any way the right of the Company or the Employer to terminate Participant's employment or service relationship at any time;
(e) Participant's participation in the Plan is voluntary;
(f) the Restricted Stock Units and the Award Shares subject to the Restricted Stock Units are extraordinary items that do not constitute compensation of any kind for services of any kind rendered to the Company or the Employer, and which are outside the scope of Participant's employment or service contract, if any;
(g) the Restricted Stock Units and the Award Shares subject to the Restricted Stock Units are not part of normal or expected compensation or salary for any purposes, including, but not limited to, calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement or welfare benefits or similar payments and in no event may be considered as compensation for, or relating in any way to, past services for the Company or the Employer;
(h) in the event that Participant is not an employee of the Company, the Award and Participant's participation in the Plan will not be interpreted to form an employment or service contract or relationship with the Company;
(i) the future value of the underlying Award Shares is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty;
(j) no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from termination of the Restricted Stock Units or diminution in value of the Restricted Stock Units or Award Shares received upon vesting of the Restricted Stock Units resulting from Termination of Participant's employment (for any reason whatsoever and whether or not in breach of local labor laws) , and in consideration of the grant of the Restricted Stock Units to which Participant is otherwise not entitled, Participant irrevocably agrees never to institute any claim against the Company or the Employer, waive his or her ability, if any, to bring any such claim, and release the Company and the Employer from any such claim; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is allowed by a court of competent jurisdiction, then, by participating in the Plan, Participant shall be deemed irrevocably to have agreed not to pursue such claim and agree to execute any and all documents necessary to request dismissal or withdrawal of such claims;
(k) in the event of Termination of Participant's employment (whether or not in breach of local labor laws), Participant's right to receive and vest in the Restricted Stock Units under the Plan, if any, will terminate effective as of the date that Participant is no longer actively employed (the "Termination Date") and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law (e.g., active employment would not include a
period of "garden leave" or similar period pursuant to local law); the Committee shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when Participant is no longer actively employed for purposes of the Restricted Stock Units; and
(l) the Restricted Stock Units and the benefits under the Plan, if any, will not automatically transfer to another company in the case of a merger, take-over or transfer of liability.
11. No Advice Regarding Grant. The Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any recommendations regarding Participant's participation in the Plan, or Participant's acquisition or sale of the underlying Award Shares. Participant is hereby advised to consult with his or her own tax, legal and financial advisors regarding Participant's participation in the Plan before taking any action related to the Plan.
12. Tax Withholding. Regardless of any action the Company and/or the Employer takes with respect to any or all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to Participant's participation in the Plan and legally applicable to Participant ("Tax-Related Items"), Participant acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains Participant's responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. Participant further acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (1) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, the issuance of Award Shares upon settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, the subsequent sale of Award Shares acquired pursuant to such issuance and the receipt of any dividends; and (2) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units to reduce or eliminate Participant's liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if Participant has become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction between the date of grant and the date of any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, Participant acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
Prior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, Participant will pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, Participant authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy the obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following:
(i) withholding Shares from the delivery of the Award Shares, provided that the Company only withholds a number of Shares with a Fair Market Value equal to or below the minimum withholding amount for Tax-Related Items, provided, however, that in order to avoid issuing fractional Shares, the Company may round up to the next nearest number of whole Shares, as long as the Company issues no more than a single whole Share in excess of the minimum withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items. For
example, if the minimum withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items is $225 and the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock is $50 per share, then the Company may withhold up to five (5) Shares from the delivery of Award Shares on the Conversion Date. The Company or the Employer will remit the total amount withheld for Tax-Related Items to the appropriate tax authorities; or
(ii) withholding from Participant's wages or other cash compensation paid to Participant by the Company and/or the Employer; or
(iii) withholding from proceeds of the sale of Award Shares acquired upon vesting/settlement of the Restricted Stock Units either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on Participant's behalf pursuant to this authorization).
If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, Participant is deemed to have been issued the full number of Award Shares subject to the vested Restricted Stock Units, notwithstanding that a number of the Award Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of any aspect of Participant's participation in the Plan.
Finally, Participant shall pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold as a result of Participant's participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by one or more of the means previously described. The Company may refuse to deliver the Award Shares or proceeds from the sale of Award Shares if Participant fails to comply with his or her obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.
13. Compliance with Laws and Regulations. The issuance and transfer of Award Shares shall be subject to compliance by the Company and the Participant with all applicable requirements of federal and state laws and with all applicable requirements of any stock exchange or national market system on which the Company's Common Stock may be listed at the time of such issuance or transfer. The Company is not required to issue or transfer Award Shares if to do so would violate such requirements.
14. Data Privacy. Participant hereby explicitly and unambiguously consents to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of his or her personal data as described in the Award and any other Award materials by and among, as applicable, the Employer, the Company and any Subsidiary or affiliate of the Company for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing Participant's participation in the Plan.
Participant understands that the Company and the Employer may hold certain personal information about him or her, including, but not limited to, Participant's name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Company, details of all Restricted Stock Units or any other
entitlement to shares of stock awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in Participant's favor, for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan ("Data").
Participant understands that Data will be transferred to E*Trade Financial Services, Inc. or such other stock plan service provider as may be selected by Participant or as may be selected by the Company in the future, which is assisting the Company with the implementation, administration and management of the Plan. Participant understands that the recipients of the Data may be located in the United States or elsewhere, and that the recipients' country (e.g., the United States) may have different data privacy laws and protections than Participant's country. Participant understands that he or she may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting Participant's local human resources representative. Participant authorizes the Company, E*Trade Financial Services, Inc. and any other possible recipients which may assist the Company (presently or in the future) with implementing, administering and managing the Plan to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the sole purpose of implementing, administering and managing Participant's participation in the Plan. Participant understands that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage Participant's participation in the Plan. Participant understands that he or she may, at any time, view Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing Participant's local human resources representative. Participant understands, however, that refusing or withdrawing his or her consent may affect Participant's ability to participate in the Plan. For more information on the consequences of Participant's refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, Participant understands that he or she may contact his or her local human resources representative.
15. Electronic Delivery. The Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to current or future participation in the Plan by electronic means. Participant hereby consents to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agrees to participate in the Plan through an on-line or electronic system established and maintained by the Company or another third party designated by the Company.
16. Authority of the Board and the Committee. Any dispute regarding the interpretation of the Award shall be submitted by Participant, the Employer, or the Company, forthwith to either the Board or the Committee, which shall review such dispute at its next regular meeting. The resolution of such a dispute by the Board or Committee shall be final and binding on the Participant, the Employer, and/or the Company.
17. Deferral of Compensation. Payments made pursuant to this Plan and Award are intended to qualify for the "short-term deferral" exemption from Section 409A of the Code. The Company reserves the right, to the extent the Company deems necessary or advisable in its sole discretion, to unilaterally amend or modify the Plan and/or this
Award agreement to ensure that all Awards are made in a manner that qualifies for exemption from or complies with Section 409A of the Code, provided however, that the Company makes no representations that the Award will be exempt from Section 409A of the Code and makes no undertaking to preclude Section 409A of the Code from applying to this Award.
18. Governing Law and Choice of Venue. The Award as well as the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan shall be governed by, and subject to, the law of the State of California, U.S.A., without regard to the conflict of law provisions, as provided in the Plan.

21. Agreement Severable. In the event that any provision in this Award is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision will be severable from, and such invalidity or unenforceability will not be construed to have any effect on, the remaining provisions of this Award.
22. Entire Agreement. The Award, including this Appendix A, Appendix B and the Plan constitute the entire agreement of the parties and supersede all prior undertakings and agreements with respect to the subject matter hereof.
23. Appendix B. The Award shall be subject to any special terms and conditions set forth in the Appendix B for Participant's country. Furthermore, if Participant relocates to one of the other countries included in the Appendix B during the life of the Restricted Stock Units, the special terms and conditions for such country shall apply to Participant, to the extent the Company determines that the application of such provisions is necessary or advisable in order to comply with local law or facilitate the administration of the Plan.

Participant agrees that the loan will bear interest at the official rate of HM Revenue and Customs ("HMRC") and will be immediately due and repayable by Participant, and the Company and/or the Employer may recover it at any time thereafter by any of the means referred to in the Tax Withholding section of the Award. Participant authorizes the Company to delay the issuance of any Award Shares unless and until the loan is repaid in full.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Participant is an officer or executive director (as within the meaning of section 13(k) of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), the terms of the immediately foregoing provision will not apply. In the event that Participant is an officer or executive director and Tax-Related Items are not collected from or paid by Participant by the Due Date, the amount of any uncollected Tax-Related Items may constitute a benefit to Participant on which additional income tax and National Insurance Contributions may be payable. Participant acknowledges that the Company or the Employer may recover any such additional income tax and National Insurance Contributions at any time thereafter by any of the means referred to in the Tax Withholding section of the Award, although Participant acknowledges that he/she ultimately will be responsible for reporting any income tax or National Insurance Contributions due on this additional benefit directly to the HMRC under the self-assessment regime.

APPENDIX A
ELECTRONIC ARTS INC.
RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD WITH DEFERRAL FEATURE
(NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS)
1. Award. Each Award Unit represents the right to receive one share of Electronic Arts Inc. Common Stock, $0.01 par value per share ("Common Stock"), subject to certain restrictions and on the terms and conditions contained in this Restricted Stock Unit Award ("Award") and the Electronic Arts' 2000 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (the "Plan"). In the event of any conflict between the terms of the Plan and this Award, the terms of the Plan shall govern. Any terms not defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Plan.
2. No Shareholder Rights. The Award does not entitle Participant to any rights of a shareholder of Common Stock. The rights of Participant with respect to the Award shall remain forfeitable at all times prior to the date on which such rights become vested.
3. Conversion of Award Units; Issuance of Common Stock.
(a) No Shares of Common Stock shall be issued to Participant prior to the date on which the Award Units vest. After any Award Units vest, the Company shall promptly cause to be issued in book-entry form, registered in Participant's name or in the name of Participant's legal representatives, beneficiaries or heirs, as the case may be, Common Stock in payment of such vested whole Award Units; provided, however, that in the event such Award Units do not vest or are not otherwise distributable on a day during which the Company's Common Stock is quoted on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (or traded on such other principal national securities market or exchange on which the Company's Common Stock may then be listed) ("Trading Day"), the Company shall cause such Common Stock to be issued on the next Trading Day following the date on which such Award Units vest; provided, further, that in no event shall the Company cause such Shares to be issued later than two (2) months after the date on which such Award Units vest. For purposes of this Award, the date on which vested Award Units are converted into Common Stock shall be referred to as the "Conversion Date."
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Participant may elect to defer payment of his or her Award Units. Any deferral election must be made no later than the last day of the calendar year preceding the year in which the Award is granted; provided, however, that a newly-eligible Participant may make a deferral election, provided that the election is made not more than thirty days after the Participant first becomes eligible for an Award under the Plan and applies only to that portion of the Award earned after the date the election is made.
(c) An election to defer payment of Awards will remain in effect until Participant modifies or revokes the election. Participant may modify or revoke the deferral election with respect to payment of future Awards, provided that the modification or revocation of the election is made not later than last day of the calendar year preceding the year in which the modification or revocation will become effective.
(d) Participant shall indicate on his or her initial deferral election the date on which the Participant elects to receive payment of his or her deferred Awards, provided that payment shall be made on (i) the fifth anniversary of the date the Award Units vest, (ii) the tenth anniversary of the date the Award Units vest, or (iii) the date Participant Separates from Service. Shares subject to deferred Awards are paid in a lump sum within two (2) months of the elected payment date.
(e) Notwithstanding Participant's election to receive payment of his or her Award Units on the fifth or tenth anniversary of the vesting date, all Shares subject to vested Award Units shall be distributed within two (2) months following Participant's Separation from Service.
(f) For purposes of this Appendix A, "Separation from Service" means termination of service with the Company as described in Section 409A of the Code.
(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or this Appendix A to the contrary, no distribution shall be made that would constitute an impermissible acceleration of payments as defined in Section 409A(a)(3) of the Code and regulations promulgated thereunder.
4. Restriction on Transfer. Neither the Award Units nor any rights under this Award may be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of by Participant other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and any such purported sale, assignment, transfer, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition shall be void and unenforceable against the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Participant may, in the manner established by the Committee, designate a beneficiary or beneficiaries to exercise Participant's rights and receive any property distributable with respect to the Award Units upon Participant's death.
5. No Rights of Continued Service. Nothing in the Plan or the Award shall confer on Participant any right to continue in the service of, or other relationship with, the Company or limit in any way the right of the Company to terminate Participant's service or other relationship at any time, with or without cause.
6. No Acquired Rights. The Participant agrees and acknowledges that:
(a) the Plan is discretionary and the Company can amend or cancel it at any time;
(b) participation in the Plan is voluntary and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future rights to Award Units or Shares;
(c) the right to Award Units or Shares under the Plan is not part of normal or expected compensation for any purposes, including, but not limited to, calculating any termination, severance, resignation, redundancy, bonuses, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments, if applicable;
(d) the future value of the Shares awarded under the Plan is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty; and
(e) no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages arises from the termination of the right to receive Shares or diminution in value of the Shares awarded under the Plan and the Participant irrevocably releases the Company from any such claim that may arise.
7. Tax Withholding.
(a) The Company will assess its requirements regarding tax, social insurance, and other applicable taxes ("Tax Items") in connection with the Award. These requirements may change from time to time as laws or interpretations change. Regardless of the Company's actions in this regard, the Participant hereby acknowledges and agrees that the ultimate liability for Tax Items is the responsibility of the Participant. Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Company:
(i) makes no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax Items in connection with any aspect of the Award, including the subsequent sale of Shares acquired under the Plan; and
(ii) does not commit to structure the terms of the Award or any aspect of the Award to reduce or eliminate the Participant's liability for Tax Items.
8. Tax Consequences. Set forth below is a brief summary as of the date the form of Award was adopted of some of the federal tax consequences of the Award, the vesting or deferral of the Award Units, and disposition of the Award Shares. THIS SUMMARY IS NECESSARILY INCOMPLETE, AND THE TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE. PARTICIPANT IS STRONGLY ADVISED TO CONSULT A TAX ADVISER.
(a) Vesting of Award Units. Upon the issuance of Award Shares to Participant following the vesting of Award Units or the deferral of the Award Units, Participant will recognize compensation income (taxable at ordinary income tax rates) equal to the Fair Market Value of the Award Shares on the Conversion Date.
(b) Disposition of the Award Shares. For federal tax purposes, if the Award Shares are held for twelve (12) months or less after the Conversion Date, any gain realized on the disposition of the Award Shares will be treated as a short-term capital gain. If the Award Shares are held for more than twelve (12) months any such gain will be treated as long-term capital gain.
(c) Section 409A of the Code imposes certain design and administrative rules on Restricted Stock Units with a deferral feature granted after December 31, 2004. If these rules are violated, deferred amounts will be subject to tax at ordinary income rates immediately upon such violation and will be subject to penalties equal to (i) 20% of the amount deferred and (ii) interest at a specified rate on the under-payment of tax that would have occurred had the deferred compensation been included in gross income in the taxable year in which it was first deferred.
9. Compliance with Laws and Regulations.
(a) The issuance and transfer of Common Stock shall be subject to compliance by the Company and the Participant with all applicable requirements of federal and state laws and with all applicable requirements of any stock exchange or national market system on which the Company's Common Stock may be listed at the time of such issuance or transfer.
(b) The Award is intended to comply and shall be administered in a manner that is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code and shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with such intent. Payment under the Award shall be made in a manner that will comply with Section 409A of the Code, including regulations or other guidance issued with respect thereto, except as otherwise determined by the Committee. Any provision of the Award that would cause the payment or settlement thereof to fail to satisfy Section 409A of the Code shall be amended to comply with Section 409A of the Code on a timely basis, which may be made on a retroactive basis, in accordance with regulations and other guidance issued under Section 409A of the Code.
10. Authority of the Board and the Committee. Any dispute regarding the interpretation of the Award shall be submitted by Participant or the Company, forthwith to either the Board or the
Committee, which shall review such dispute at its next regular meeting. The resolution of such a dispute by the Board or Committee shall be final and binding on the Participant and/or the Company.
11. Governing Law. The Award as well as the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan shall be governed by, and subject to, the law of the State of California.
12. Captions. Captions provided herein are for convenience only and are not to serve as a basis for interpretation or construction or this Award.
13. Agreement Severable. In the event that any provision in this Award agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision will be severable from, and such invalidity or unenforceability will not be construed to have any effect on, the remaining provisions of this Award agreement.
 
(a) The Board, in its discretion, may terminate the deferral feature of the Award at any time and for any reason and may distribute the Shares subject to the deferred Award Units within the period beginning twelve months after the date the deferral feature is terminated and ending twenty-four months after the date the deferral feature is terminated, or pursuant to Section 3(d) or 3(e) if earlier. If the deferral feature of this Award is terminated and the Shares subject to the deferred Award Units are distributed, the Company shall terminate all substantially similar non-qualified deferred equity compensation arrangements with respect to all participants and shall not adopt a new, similar non-qualified deferred equity compensation arrangement for at least five years after the date the deferral feature is terminated, in accordance with Section 409A of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder.
(b) The deferral feature of this Award shall automatically terminate upon a dissolution of the Company that is taxed under Section 331 of the Code or with the approval of a bankruptcy court pursuant to 11 U.S.C. section 503(b)(1)(A), provided that the Shares subject to the deferred Award Units are distributed and included in the gross income of the Participant by the latest of (i) the calendar year in which the deferral feature is terminated or (ii) the first calendar year in which payment of the deferred Award Units is administratively practicable.
(c) The Board, in its discretion, may terminate the deferral feature of the Award thirty days prior to or twelve months following a Change in Control (as defined in Attachment 1) and distribute the Shares subject to the deferred Award Units within the twelve-month period following the termination of the deferral feature. If the deferral feature of the Award is terminated and the Shares subject to the deferred Award Units are distributed, the Company shall terminate all substantially similar non-qualified deferred equity compensation arrangements sponsored by the Company and all of the benefits of the terminated arrangements shall be distributed within twelve months following the termination of the arrangements.
15. Entire Agreement. The Award, including this Appendix A, and the Plan constitute the entire agreement of the parties and supersede all prior undertakings and agreements with respect to the subject matter hereof.
ATTACHMENT 1
A "Change in Control" means any one of the following events:
(i) Any one person, or more than one person acting as group, acquires ownership of stock of the Company that, together with stock held by such person or group, constitutes more than 50 percent of the total fair market value or total voting power of the stock of the Company; provided, however, that if any one person or more than one person acting as a group, is considered to own more than 50 percent of the total fair market value or total voting power of the stock of the Company, the acquisition of additional stock by the same person or persons is not considered to a cause a Change in Control of the Company;
(ii) Any one person, or more than one person acting as a group, acquires (or has acquired during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or persons) ownership of stock of the Company possessing 35 percent or more of the total voting power of the stock of the Company;
(iii) A majority of the members of the Board is replaced during any 12-month period by directors whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a majority of the members of the Board prior to the date of the appointment or election, provided that for purposes of this paragraph no other corporation is a majority shareholder of the Company;
(iv) Any one person, or more than one person acting as a group, acquires (or has acquired during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or persons) assets from the Company that have a total gross fair market value equal to or more than 40 percent of the total gross fair market value of all assets of the Company immediately prior to such

The term "Award Proceeds" means, with respect to any sale or other disposition (including to the Company) of Shares issued or issuable upon vesting of Award Units, an amount determined appropriate by the Committee to reflect the effect of the restatement on the Company's stock price, up to the amount equal to the market value per Share at the time of such sale or other disposition multiplied by the number of Shares sold or disposed of. The return of Award Proceeds is in addition to and separate from any other relief available to the Company due to the Participant's Contributing Misconduct. Any determination by the Committee with respect to the foregoing shall be final, conclusive and binding on all interested parties. For any Participant who is designated as an "executive officer", the determination of the Committee shall be subject to the approval of the Board of Directors.

of Control, or (C) a more than 10% reduction in Participant's total target annual cash compensation, including without limitation, annual base salary and target annual bonus or incentive opportunity, from that in effect immediately before the Change of Control; and (D) with respect to only those Participants in the position of CEO, CFO, Chief Human Resources Officer, EVP Legal and Business Affairs, SVP Tax and Treasury, General Counsel or Chief Accounting Officer of the Company on the Award Date, the occurrence without the affected Participant's written consent, on or after the date of a Change of Control, of a material reduction in Participant's authority, duties, or responsibilities, including, without limitation, a material diminution in the authority, duties, or responsibilities of the supervisor to whom Participant is required to report, which shall include a requirement that a Participant report to a corporate officer or employee instead of reporting directly to the board of directors of a corporation (or similar governing body with respect to an entity other than a corporation), when compared to Participant's authority, duties, or responsibilities, or the authority, duties or responsibilities of the supervisor to whom Participant is required to report, immediately before the Change of Control.
(2) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Good Reason shall exist only if the following conditions are met: (A) Participant gives the Company written notice of his or her intention to terminate employment with the Company for Good Reason; (B) such notice is delivered to the Company within 90 days of the initial existence of the condition giving rise to the right to terminate for Good Reason, and at least 30 days in advance of the date of termination; (C) the Company fails to cure the alleged Good Reason to the reasonable satisfaction of Participant prior to Participant's termination, and (D) the events described in the preceding sentence, singly or in combination, result in a material negative change in Participant's employment relationship with the Company, so that Participant's termination effectively constitutes an involuntary separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.
(iv) "Severance Agreement and Release" means the written separation agreement and release substantially in the form set forth in Appendix C, as may be amended from time to time.
(d) Anything to the contrary in this Award or the Plan notwithstanding, in the event that following the Award Date and prior to a Change of Control the Committee determines, in its sole discretion, that the Award would fail to qualify as "qualified performance-based compensation" as described in Section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code because of the provisions of Section 10(b) the Committee may adopt such amendments (including with retroactive effect) to the provisions of Section 10(b) , including eliminating the effect of the provisions of Section 10(b), that the Committee reasonably determines, in its sole discretion, are required to preserve the treatment of the Award as qualified performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code prior to a Change of Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in the proceeding sentence provides the Committee with any rights or discretion that is not itself permitted under Section 162(m).
 
11. . If Participant, upon taking into account the benefit provided under this Award and all other payments that would be deemed to be "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code (collectively, the "280G Payments"), would be subject to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, notwithstanding any provision of this Award to the contrary, Participant's benefit under this Award shall be reduced to an amount equal to (i) 2.99 times Participant's "base amount" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code), (ii) minus the value of all other payments that would be deemed to be "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code (but not below zero); provided, however, that the reduction provided by this sentence shall not be made if it would result in a smaller aggregate after-tax payment to Participant (taking into account all applicable federal, state and local taxes including the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code). Participant's benefit hereunder shall be reduced prior to any benefit owing to Participant under the Continuity Plan may be reduced pursuant to Section 2.11 of the Continuity Plan. Unless the Company and Participant otherwise agree in writing, all determinations required to be made under this Section 11, and the assumptions to be used in arriving at such determinations, shall be made in writing in good faith by the accounting firm serving as the Company's independent public accountants immediately prior to the events giving rise to the payment of such benefits (the "Accountants"). For the purposes of making the calculations required under this Section 11, the Accountants may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. The Company shall bear all costs the Accountants may reasonably incur in connection with any calculations contemplated by this Section 11.
Section 280G Provision
12. . In accepting the Award, Participant acknowledges that:
Acknowledgement of Nature of Plan and Award
(a) the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature, and it may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time, unless otherwise provided in the Plan;
(b) the Award is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future awards of Award Units, or benefits in lieu of Award Units, even if Award Units have been granted repeatedly in the past;
(c) all decisions with respect to future awards, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company;
(d) nothing in the Plan or the Award shall confer on Participant any right to continue in the employ of, or other relationship with, the Company or Participant's employer or limit in any way the right of the Company or Participant's employer to Terminate Participant's employment or service relationship at any time, with or without cause;
(e) Participant's participation in the Plan is voluntary;
 
(f) the Award Units are an extraordinary item that does not constitute compensation of any kind for services of any kind rendered to the Company or Participant's employer, and which is outside the scope of Participant's employment or service contract, if any;
(g) notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan or this Award, this Award is intended to provide tax-qualified performance based compensation in accordance with Section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code to Participant. Accordingly, this Award shall be construed consistent with that intent;
(h) the Award Units are not part of normal or expected compensation or salary for any purposes, including, but not limited to, calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement or welfare benefits or similar payments and in no event may be considered as compensation for, or relating in any way to, past services for the Company or Participant's employer;
(i) in the event that Participant is not an employee of the Company, the Award and Participant's participation in the Plan will not be interpreted to form an employment or service contract or relationship with the Company; and furthermore, the Award will not be interpreted to form an employment or service contract or relationship with Participant's employer or any Subsidiary;
(j) the future value of the underlying Shares of Common Stock is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty;
(k) in consideration of the Award, no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from termination of the Award Units or diminution in value of the Award Units or Shares of Common Stock received upon vesting of the Award Units resulting from Termination of Participant's employment by the Company or Participant's employer (for any reason whatsoever and whether or not in breach of local labor laws), and Participant irrevocably releases the Company and Participant's employer from any such claim that may arise; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen, then, by accepting the Award, Participant will be deemed irrevocably to have waived his or her entitlement to pursue such claim;
(l) except as otherwise provided by the Committee or pursuant to Section 10(b) hereof, in the event of Termination of Participant's employment (whether or not in breach of local labor laws), Participant's right to receive an Award and vest in the Award Units under the Plan, if any, will terminate effective as of the date that Participant is no longer actively employed and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law (e.g., active employment would not include a period of "garden leave" or similar period pursuant to local law); the Committee shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when Participant is no longer actively employed for purposes of his or her Award;
 
(m) the Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any recommendations regarding Participant's participation in the Plan, or Participant's acquisition or sale of the underlying Shares of Common Stock; and
(n) Participant is hereby advised to consult with his or her own tax, legal and financial advisors regarding Participant's participation in the Plan before taking any action related to the Plan.
13. . Regardless of any action the Company or Participant's employer takes with respect to any or all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other applicable taxes ("Tax Items") in connection with the Award, Participant hereby acknowledges and agrees that the ultimate liability for all Tax Items legally due by Participant is and remains the responsibility of Participant. Further, if Participant has become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction between the date of grant and the date of any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, Participant acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
Tax Withholding
(a) Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Company and/or Participant's employer: (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax Items in connection with any aspect of the Award, including, but not limited to, the grant or vesting of the Award Units, the subsequent sale of Shares of Common Stock acquired under the Plan and the receipt of any dividends; and (ii) do not commit to structure the terms of the Award or any aspect of the Award to reduce or eliminate Participant's liability for Tax Items.
(b) Prior to delivery of Shares of Common Stock upon the vesting of the Award Units ("Award Shares"), Participant must pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or Participant's employer to satisfy all withholding obligations for Tax Items of the Company and/or Participant's employer. In this regard, Participant authorizes the Company and/or Participant's employer, at their discretion and if permissible under local law, to satisfy the obligations with regard to all Tax Items legally payable by Participant by one or a combination of the following:
(i) withholding Shares from the delivery of the Award Shares, provided that the Company only withholds a number of Shares with a Fair Market Value equal to or below the minimum withholding amount for Tax Items, provided, however, that in order to avoid issuing fractional Shares, the Company may round up to the next nearest number of whole Shares, as long as the Company issues no more than a single whole Share in excess of the minimum withholding obligation for Tax Items. For example, if the minimum withholding obligation for Tax Items is $200 and the Fair
 
Market Value of the Common Stock is $20 per share, then the Company may withhold up to ten (10) Shares from the delivery of Award Shares on the Conversion Date. The Company or Participant's employer will remit the total amount withheld for Tax Items to the appropriate tax authorities; or
(ii) withholding from Participant's wages or other cash compensation paid to Participant by the Company and/or Participant's employer; or
(iii) selling or arranging for the sale of Award Shares.
Participant shall pay to the Company or Participant's employer any amount of Tax Items that the Company or Participant's employer may be required to withhold as a result of Participant's participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by one or more of the means previously described. The Company may refuse to deliver the Award Shares if Participant fails to comply with his or her obligations in connection with the Tax Items as described in this section.
14. . The issuance and transfer of Common Stock shall be subject to compliance by the Company and Participant with all applicable requirements of federal, state and non-U.S. laws and with all applicable requirements of any stock exchange or national market system on which the Company's Common Stock may be listed at the time of such issuance or transfer.

APPENDIX B
ELECTRONIC ARTS INC.
PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD
Performance Vesting Terms
1. . The performance period for the Award Units shall be the period of time beginning April 1, 2012 and ending on March 28, 2015 (the "Performance Period"). During the Performance Period there will be three (3) separate measurement periods of the Company's Relative TSR (each a "Measurement Period"). Each Measurement Period has a corresponding vest date (the "Vest Date") on which Award Units will vest.
Performance Period
The Start Dates, End Dates and Vest Dates for the three (3) Measurement Periods are:
 
2. . The Target Number of Award Units for each Measurement Period is:
Target Number of Award Units
 
3. The Performance Measure for the Performance Period is Relative TSR, as defined below. The number of Award Units that may vest for each Measurement Period will be determined by multiplying the Target Number of Award Units by the Maximum Vest Percentage that corresponds to the Company's Relative TSR percentile ranking according to the following schedule and subject to the Maximum Value limitation described below:
Performance Measure.
 
: if the Company's Relative TSR percentile ranking is 65%, up to 115% of the Target Number of Award Units for that Measurement Period could vest.
For example
 
4. The number of Award Units that vest will be between 0% and 200% of the Target Number of Award Units for each Measurement Period; provided that, under no circumstances will the monetary value of the actual number of Award Units that vest following each Measurement Period, exceed five (5) times the monetary value of those Award Units on the Award Date (the "Maximum Value"). For purposes of this Award Agreement "monetary value" refers to the value of a share of Company stock as determined on any specified date by the Company's closing stock price for that date. The Maximum Value for each Measurement Period is determined by multiplying the number of Award Units determined to vest based on the Company's Relative TSR percentile ranking for that Measurement Period by the closing price of the Company's stock on the Award Date and then multiplying that product by five (5). Accordingly, the maximum number of Award Units that vest for each Measurement Period shall not exceed the lesser of:
Maximum Number of Award Units.
(i) the number of Award Units determined by multiplying the Target Number of Award Units for each Measurement Period by the Maximum Vest Percentage corresponding to the Relative TSR percentile ranking of the Company for that Measurement Period; or
(ii) the number of Award Units determined not to exceed the Maximum Value, (with such number of Award Units calculated by dividing the Maximum Value by the closing price of the Company's stock on the End Date of each Measurement Period.)
5. "Relative TSR" means the Company's Total Stockholder Return relative to the Total Stockholder Returns of the other Group Companies. Relative TSR will be determined by ranking the Group Companies from the highest to lowest according to their respective Total Stockholder Return, then calculating the Relative TSR percentile ranking of the Company relative to the other Group Companies as follows:
Determination of Relative TSR.
 
Where:
"P" represents the Relative TSR percentile ranking rounded to the nearest whole percentile
"R" represents the Company's ranking among the Group Companies
"N" represents the number of Group Companies
"Total Stockholder Return" means the number calculated by dividing (i) the Closing Average Share Value minus the Opening Average Share Value (in each case adjusted to take into consideration the cumulative amount of dividends per share for the Measurement Period, assuming reinvestment, as of the of applicable ex-dividend date, of all cash dividends and other cash distributions (excluding cash distributions resulting from share repurchases or redemptions by the Company) paid to stockholders) by (ii) the Opening Average Share Value.
 
"Opening Average Share Value" means the average of the daily closing prices per share of a Group Company's stock as reported on the NASDAQ for all Trading Days in the 90 calendar days immediately following and including April 1, 2012.
"Closing Average Share Value" means the average of the daily closing prices per share of a Group Company's stock as reported on the NASDAQ for all Trading Days in the Closing Average Period.
"Closing Average Period" means (i) in the absence of a Change of Control of the Company, the 90 calendar days immediately prior to and including March 30, 2013 for the 1
st
Measurement Period; the 90 calendar days immediately prior to and including March 29, 2014 for the 2
nd
Measurement Period; and the 90 calendar days immediately prior to and including March 28, 2015 for the 3
rd
Measurement Period; or (ii) in the event of a Change of Control, the 90 calendar days immediately prior to and including the effective date of the Change of Control.
"Group Companies" means those companies listed in the NASDAQ-100 Index on April 1, 2012. The Group Companies may be changed as follows:
(i) In the event of a merger, acquisition or business combination transaction of a Group Company with or by another Group Company, the surviving entity shall remain a Group Company;
(ii) In the event of a merger, acquisition, or business combination transaction of a Group Company with or by another company that is not a Group Company, or "going private transaction" where the Group Company is not the surviving entity or is otherwise no longer publicly traded, the company shall no longer be a Group Company; and
(iii) In the event of a bankruptcy of a Group Company, such company shall remain a Group Company and its stock price will continue to be tracked for purposes of the Relative TSR calculation. If the company liquidates, it will remain a Group Company and its stock price will be reduced to zero for all remaining Measurement Periods in the Performance Period.
6. . The Committee will certify the Relative TSR percentile ranking of the Company after the End Date of each Measurement Period and determine the actual number of Award Units that vest for that Measurement Period on or before each applicable Vest Date.

Note: release to be reviewed in each case for purposes of compliance with laws of applicable jurisdiction
5. Employee hereby expressly waives the provision of California Civil Code Section 1542 which provides as follows:
.
Waiver of California Civil Code
A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his/her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him/her must have materially affected his/her settlement with the debtor.
Employee acknowledges that the waiver of this Section of the California Civil Code set forth above is an essential and material term of this release, and that Employee has read this provision, and intends these consequences even as to unknown claims which may exist at the time of this release.
6. . Employee represents that Employee has not filed or commenced any proceeding against the Releasees and agrees that at no time in the future will Employee file or maintain any charge, claim or action of any kind, nature and character whatsoever against the Releasees, or cause or knowingly permit any such charge, claim or action to be filed or maintained, in any federal, state or municipal court, administrative agency or other tribunal, arising out of any of the matters covered by this Agreement, except as provided in the following sentence. Notwithstanding Employee's release and waiver of remedies under the ADEA, this Agreement and the above covenant not to sue do not affect enforcement of the ADEA by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"), nor preclude Employee from (i) filing an ADEA charge with the EEOC, (ii) participating in an ADEA investigation or proceeding conducted by the EEOC, or (iii) initiating a proceeding regarding the enforceability of this Agreement with respect to ADEA rights and remedies. If Employee initiates any lawsuit or other legal proceeding in contravention of this covenant not to sue (other than a proceeding regarding the enforceability of this Agreement with respect to ADEA rights and remedies), Employee shall be required to immediately repay to Employer the full consideration paid to Employee pursuant to Paragraph 2 above, regardless of the outcome of Employee's legal action.
Covenant Not to Sue

APPENDIX A
ELECTRONIC ARTS INC.
Nonqualified Stock Option (the "Option") Terms and Conditions (Intl.)
Under the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan
1. Form of Option Grant. Each Option granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by a Stock Option Grant (the "Grant") in such form (which need not be the same for each Optionee) as the Committee shall from time to time approve, which Grant shall comply with and be subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan. Grants may be evidenced by paper copy or electronic copy.
2. Date of Grant. The date of grant of the Option shall be the date on which the Committee makes the determination to grant such Option, unless otherwise specified by the Committee. The Grant representing the Option will be delivered to Optionee within a reasonable time after the granting of the Option.
3. Exercise Price. The Exercise Price of the Option shall be determined by the Committee on the date the Option is granted pursuant to the rules of the Plan.
4. Exercise Period. Options shall be exercisable within the times or upon the events determined by the Committee as set forth in the Grant; provided, however, that no Option shall be exercisable after the expiration of ten (10) years from the date the Option is granted (the "Expiration Date").
5. Restrictions on Exercise. Exercise of the Option is subject to the following limitations:
(a) The Option may not be exercised until the Plan has been approved by the stockholders of the Company as set forth in the Plan.
(b) The Option may not be exercised and the Option Shares may not be issued unless such exercise/issuance is in compliance with the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the U.S. Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, all applicable state and local securities laws, and the requirements of any stock exchange or national market system on which the Company's Common Stock may be listed, as they are in effect on the date of exercise/issuance.
6. Cancellation of Option.
(a) Except as provided in this section, the unvested portion of the Option shall be cancelled in whole if Optionee is Terminated and may not be exercised to the extent cancelled. If the Optionee is Terminated for any reason except by death or Disability, the Option, to the extent it is exercisable on the Termination Date, may be exercised by the Optionee within three (3) months after the Termination Date, but in no event later than the Expiration Date.
(b) Except as provided in this subsection, the Option shall be cancelled in part, if Optionee ceases to be a full-time employee, but remains an employee of the Optionee's employer (the "Employer"), and may not be exercised to the extent cancelled. If the Optionee ceases to be a full-time employee for any reason other than Disability, the Option, to the extent it is exercisable on the date on which the Optionee ceases to be a full-time employee, may be exercised by the Optionee within three (3) months after the Termination Date, but in no event later than the Expiration Date:
(i) Unless otherwise required by contract or local law, an Optionee shall be deemed to be a "full-time" employee if Optionee works not less than 40 hours per week;
(ii) Except to the extent the Option is cancelled in accordance with subsection (b)(iii) below, the Option shall continue to vest in equal monthly amounts from the Termination Date up to 50 calendar months from the vest start date set forth in the Grant (the "Vest Start Date"), provided the Optionee is continuously employed during the period; and
(iii) The number of Option Shares under the Option that shall be cancelled in accordance with this subsection will be determined by multiplying the total number of Option Shares by the following fraction:
40 minus [number of hours regularly worked per week] / 40
(c) If the Optionee's employment with the Company is Terminated because of the Retirement of the Optionee, as defined below, the Option, to the extent that it is exercisable on the Termination Date, may be exercised by the Optionee at any time prior to the earlier of (i) expiration of sixty (60) months from the Termination Date, and (ii) the Expiration Date. For the purposes of this Paragraph 6(c) "Retirement" means voluntary terminations, involuntary terminations in connection with a reduction in force, or other involuntary terminations other than for Cause (if and to the extent the Company, in its sole discretion, determines such a termination to be eligible for purposes of this Paragraph 6(c)) if Optionee's age added to Optionee's years of Service with the Company equals or exceeds sixty (60) and Optionee has at least ten (10) years of service with the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries. For the purposes of this Paragraph 6(c), "Service" means employment from date of hire to Termination Date plus any previous employment with the Company where the previous employment period was at least 12 months (exclusive of any extended non-medical leaves of absence) and exceeded the length of time between Optionee's previous and current employment with the Company. Notwithstanding the definition of Retirement set forth in this Section 6(c), if the Company receives an opinion of counsel that there has been a legal judgment and/or legal development in Optionee's jurisdiction that would likely result in the favorable Retirement treatment that applies to the Option pursuant to this Section 6(c) being deemed unlawful and/or discriminatory, then the Company will not apply the favorable Retirement treatment at the time of Optionee's Termination and the Option will be treated as it would under the rules that apply if Optionee's employment ends for reasons other than death, Retirement or Disability.
(d) If the Optionee is Terminated because of the death of the Optionee or Disability of the Optionee the Option, to the extent that it is exercisable on the Termination Date, may be exercised by the Optionee (or the Optionee's legal representative) at any time prior to the expiration of twelve months after the Termination Date, but in any event no later than the Expiration Date.
(e) Notwithstanding the provisions in subsection 6(a) above, if the Optionee's employment is Terminated for Cause, the Option may not be exercised to any extent whatsoever and any and all rights and claims Optionee may have to any Option Shares, or value attributable to any Option Shares upon vesting is hereby revoked.
(f) Notwithstanding the provisions in subsection 6(a) above, if (i) the Optionee's employment with the Company is Terminated other than for Cause, (ii) the Optionee was subject to the Company's "trading window" (as described in the Company's Policy on Securities Trades by Electronic Arts Personnel) at the time his or her employment was Terminated, and (iii) the "trading window" was closed at the time the Optionee's employment was Terminated and remained closed during the entire Post-Termination Exercise Period (thereby preventing the immediate resale of Option Shares acquired upon exercise of the Option), then the Option, to the extent it is exercisable on the Termination Date, shall remain exercisable until ten (10) days after the date the Optionee is notified by the Company that the "trading window" has been opened; provided, however, that no Option will be exercisable later than the Expiration Date.
7. Manner of Exercise.
(a) The Option shall be exercisable by delivery to the Company of a written notice in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A or in such other form as may be approved by the Company, which shall set forth the Optionee's election to exercise the Option, the number of Option Shares being purchased, and such other representations and agreements as to the Optionee's investment intent and access to information as may be required by the Company to comply with applicable securities laws.
(b) Such notice shall be accompanied by full payment of the Exercise Price (i) in cash; (ii) with proceeds from a sale made pursuant to a broker-assisted same-day sale; or (iii) a combination of the foregoing, provided that a portion of the Exercise Price equal to the par value of the Option Shares, if any, must be paid in cash or other legal consideration.
(c) Prior to the issuance of the Option Shares upon exercise of the Option, the Optionee must pay or make adequate provision for any Tax-Related Items (as defined below).
(d) Provided that such notice and payment are in form and substance satisfactory to counsel for the Company, the Company shall issue the Option Shares registered in the name of the Optionee or the Optionee's legal representative.
8. Responsibility for Taxes. Regardless of any action the Company and/or the Employer takes with respect to any or all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related items arising out of Optionee's participation in the Plan and legally applicable to Optionee ("Tax-Related Items"), Optionee acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains Optionee's responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company and/or the Employer. Optionee further acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Option, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting
or exercise of the Option, the subsequent sale of Option Shares acquired pursuant to such exercise and the receipt of any dividends; and (ii) do not commit and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Option to reduce or eliminate Optionee's liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Furthermore, if Optionee has become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction between the date on which the Option was granted and the date of any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, Optionee acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
Prior to the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, Optionee shall pay or make arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, Optionee authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy the Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following: (i) withholding from Optionee's wages or other cash compensation paid to Optionee by the Company or the Employer; or (ii) withholding from proceeds of the sale of Option Shares acquired at exercise of the Option either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on Optionee's behalf pursuant to this authorization); or (iii) withholding in Option Shares to be issued at exercise of the Option.
To avoid any negative accounting treatment, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Option Shares, for tax purposes, Optionee is deemed to have been issued the full number of Option Shares subject to the exercised Options, notwithstanding that a number of the shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of any aspect of Optionee's participation in the Plan.
Optionee shall pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of Optionee's participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means described in this Section. The Company may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares, if Optionee fails to comply with his or her obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.
9. Nature of Grant. In accepting the Option, Optionee acknowledges that:
(a) the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, is discretionary in nature, and may be amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time;
(b) grant of the Option is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of options, or benefits in lieu of options, even if options have been granted repeatedly in the past;
(c) all decisions with respect to future option grants, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company;
(d) Optionee's participation in the Plan is voluntary;
(e) nothing in the Plan or this Grant will be deemed to constitute an employment contract or confer or be deemed to confer any right for Optionee to continue in the employ of, or to continue any other relationship with, the Company, the Employer or any Subsidiary or limit in any way the right of the Company, the Employer or any Subsidiary to terminate Optionee's employment or other relationship at any time, with or without Cause;
(f) the Option and any Option Shares acquired under the Plan are extraordinary items that do not constitute compensation of any kind for services of any kind rendered to the Employer, the Company, or any Subsidiary, and that are outside the scope of Optionee's employment or service contract, if any;
(g) the Option and any Option Shares acquired under the Plan are not intended to replace any pension rights or compensation;
(h) the Option and any Option Shares acquired under the Plan are not part of normal or expected compensation or salary for any purposes, including, but not limited to, calculating any termination, severance, resignation, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement or welfare benefits or similar payments and in no event should be considered compensation for, or relating in any way to, past services for the Employer, the Company or any Subsidiary;
(i) the future value of the Option Shares is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty;
(j) if the Option Shares do not increase in value, the Option will have no value;
(k) if Optionee exercises the Option and acquires Option Shares, the value of such Option Shares may increase or decrease in value, even below the Exercise Price;
(l) in consideration of the grant of the Option, no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages arises from the termination of the Option or diminution in value of the Option or Option Shares resulting from Optionee's Termination (for any reason whatsoever and whether or not in breach of local labor laws) and Optionee irrevocably releases the Employer, the Company and/or any Subsidiary from any such claim that may arise; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen, then, by signing the Grant, Optionee shall be deemed irrevocably to have waived his or her entitlement to pursue such claim; and
(m) the Option and the benefits under the Plan, if any, will not automatically transfer to another company in the case of a merger, take-over or transfer of liability.
10. Exclusion of Option From Notice Period. The period of continuous employment for the purposes of the Grant shall be the period commencing on the Vest Start Date and ending on the Termination Date, or if earlier, the date on which the Employer gives notice of Termination (the "Vest End Date"). In no event shall vesting of the Option extend beyond the Vest End Date, nor shall any potential value of the Option after the Vest End Date be considered in determining any notice or compensation in lieu of notice that may be required or given upon Termination. Optionee agrees that this provision is a condition to the Grant and hereby waives any and all rights and claims Optionee may have to any Option Shares, or value attributable to any Option Shares, which would have under any circumstances vested after the Vest End Date.
11. No Advice Regarding Grant. The Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any recommendations regarding Optionee's participation in the Plan, or Optionee's acquisition or sale of the Option Shares. Optionee should obtain tax, legal and financial advice before exercising the Option and prior to the disposition of the Option Shares.
12. Data Privacy. The Optionee hereby explicitly and unambiguously:
(a) consents to the collection, use, processing, and transfer, in electronic or other form, of personal data described in this Grant by and among, as applicable, the Employer, and the Company and any Subsidiary for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Optionee's participation in the Plan;

(f) understands that Personal Data will be held only as long as necessary to implement, administer and manage the Optionee's participation in the Plan;

(h) understands that refusal or withdrawal of Optionee's consent may affect the Optionee's ability to participate in the Plan. For more information on the consequences of refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, Optionee understands that he or she may contact Optionee's local human resources representative.
13. Nontransferability of Option. No Option may be sold, pledged, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution or, unless otherwise determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion.
14. Authority of the Board and the Committee. Any dispute regarding the interpretation of the Grant shall be submitted by the Optionee, the Employer, or the Company, forthwith to the Board or the Committee, which shall review such dispute at its next regular meeting. The resolution of such a dispute by the Board or Committee shall be final and binding on the Optionee, the Employer, and/or the Company.

INDIA
Terms and Conditions
Exercise Restriction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan or the Grant, due to legal restrictions in India, you will not be permitted to pay the Exercise Price by a "sell-to-cover" exercise such that part of the Option Shares subject to the exercised Option will be sold immediately upon exercise and the proceeds of sale will be remitted to the Company to cover the aggregate Exercise Price for the purchased Option Shares and any Tax-Related Items. The Company reserves the right to provide you with this method of payment depending on the development of local law.
Fringe Benefit Tax. By accepting the Option, you consent and agree to assume liability for any fringe benefit tax that may be payable by the Company and/or the Employer in connection with the Option, as well as in connection with the portion of any option granted to you by the Company in the past which has not yet been exercised as of the date of grant of the current Option, to the extent determined by the Company and/or the Employer.
You understand that the grant of the Option is contingent upon you agreeing to assume liability for fringe benefit tax payable on the Option and the portion of any outstanding option that is exercised after the date of grant of the current Option.
Further, by accepting the Option, you agree that the Company and/or the Employer may collect the fringe benefit tax from you by any of the means set forth in the Responsibility for Taxes section in the Grant or any other reasonable method established by the Company. You also agree to execute any other consents or elections required to accomplish the foregoing, promptly upon request of the Company.
You understand that the fringe benefit tax will be calculated based on the difference between the Exercise Price and the fair market value of the underlying Option Shares at the time of vesting. Therefore, no fringe benefit tax will be due if the Option is not in-the-money at vesting. On the other hand, if the Option is in-the-money at vesting and the fair market value of the shares decreases between vesting and exercise, you may be liable for fringe benefit tax on a greater amount than the benefit you will receive at exercise.

Notifications
Exchange Control Information. If Optionee remits funds out of Korea to purchase Option Shares under the Plan, the remittance must be "confirmed" by a foreign exchange bank in Korea.

Under Article 46 of the Act on the Supervision of the Securities Trade 1995, anyone who has "inside information" related to the Company is prohibited from effectuating a transaction in securities in or from the Netherlands.

SOUTH AFRICA
Terms and Conditions
Responsibility for Taxes. This provision supplements the Responsibility for Taxes section of the Grant:
By accepting the Option, Optionee agrees to immediately notify the Employer of the amount of any gain realized upon exercise of the Option. If Optionee fails to advise the Employer of the gain realized at exercise, Optionee may be liable for a fine. Optionee will be responsible for paying any difference between the actual tax liability and the amount withheld.
Notifications
Tax Clearance Certificate for Cash Exercises. If Optionee exercises the Option by a cash purchase exercise, Optionee must obtain and provide to the Employer, or any third party
designated by the Employer or the Company, a Tax Clearance Certificate (with respect to Foreign Investments) bearing the official stamp and signature of the Exchange Control Department of the South African Revenue Service ("SARS"). Optionee must renew this Tax Clearance Certificate every twelve (12) months, or in such other period as may be required by the SARS. If Optionee exercises the Option by a broker-assisted same-day sale whereby no funds are remitted offshore for the purchase of Option Shares, no Tax Clearance Certificate is required.
Exchange Control Information. Optionee is solely responsible for complying with applicable South African exchange control regulations. Since the exchange control regulations change frequently and without notice, Optionee should consult his or her legal advisor prior to the acquisition or sale of Option Shares acquired under the Plan to ensure compliance with current regulations. As noted, it is Optionee's responsibility to comply with South African exchange control laws, and neither the Company nor the Employer will be liable for any fines or penalties resulting from Optionee's failure to comply with applicable laws.
Under current South African exchange control regulations, Optionee may, during his or her lifetime, invest a maximum of ZAR 2,000,000 in offshore investments, including in Option Shares. It is Optionee's responsibility to ensure that he or she does not exceed this limit. Please note that this is a cumulative allowance; therefore, Optionee's ability to remit funds for the purchase of Option Shares will be reduced if Optionee's foreign investment limit is utilized to make a transfer of funds offshore that is unrelated to the Plan. If Optionee wishes to exercise the Option through a cash purchase exercise and the ZAR 2,000,000 limit will be exceeded upon the exercise of the Option, Optionee may still transfer funds for payment of the Option Shares provided that Optionee immediately sells the Option Shares and repatriates the full proceeds to South Africa. There is no repatriation requirement on the sale proceeds if the ZAR 2,000,000 limit is not exceeded. If Optionee exercises the Option using a broker-assisted same-day sale, the value of the Shares thus purchased will not be counted against Optionee's lifetime offshore investment allowance.
SPAIN
Terms and Conditions
Nature of Grant. This provision supplements the Nature of Grant section of the Grant:
In accepting the Option, Optionee consents to participate in the Plan and acknowledges that he or she has received a copy of the Plan. Optionee understands that the Company has unilaterally, gratuitously and discretionally decided to grant options under the Plan to individuals who may be employees of the Company or a Subsidiary throughout the world. The decision is a limited decision that is entered into upon the express assumption and condition that any grant will not economically or otherwise bind the Company or any Subsidiary. Consequently, Optionee understands that the Option is granted on the
assumption and condition that the Option and any Option Shares acquired upon exercise of the Option are not part of any employment contract (either with the Company or any Subsidiary) and shall not be considered a mandatory benefit, salary for any purposes (including severance compensation) or any other right whatsoever. In addition, Optionee understands that the Option would not be granted to Optionee but for the assumptions and conditions referred to herein; thus, Optionee acknowledges and freely accepts that should any or all of the assumptions be mistaken or should any of the conditions not be met for any reason, then the grant of this Option shall be null and void.
Notifications
Exchange Control Information. Optionee must declare the acquisition of Shares to the Direccin General de Politica Comercial y de Inversiones Extranjeras (the "DGPCIE") of the Ministerio de Economia for statistical purposes.

When receiving foreign currency payments derived from the ownership of Shares (i.e., cash dividends or sale proceeds), Optionee must inform the financial institution receiving the payment of the basis upon which such payment is made.

Responsibility for Taxes. The following provisions supplement the Responsibility for Taxes section of the Grant:
Optionee agrees that, if Optionee does not pay or the Employer or the Company does not withhold from Optionee the full amount of Tax-Related Items that Optionee owes at exercise of the Option, or the release or assignment of the Option for consideration, or the receipt of any other benefit in connection with the Option (the "Taxable Event") within 90 days after the Taxable Event, or such other period specified in section 222(1)(c) of the U.K. Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (the "Due Date"), then the amount that should have been withheld shall constitute a loan owed by Optionee to the Employer, effective on the Due Date. Optionee agrees that the loan will bear interest at the HMRC's official rate and will be immediately due and repayable by Optionee, and the
Company and/or the Employer may recover it at any time thereafter by any of the means referred to in the Responsibility for Taxes section of the Grant. Optionee authorizes the Company to delay the issuance of any Option Shares unless and until the loan is repaid in full.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Optionee is an officer or executive director (as within the meaning of section 13(k) of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), the terms of the immediately foregoing provision will not apply. In the event that Optionee is an officer or executive director and Tax-Related Items are not collected from or paid by Optionee by the Due Date, the amount of any uncollected Tax-Related Items may constitute a benefit to Optionee on which additional income tax and National Insurance Contributions may be payable. Optionee acknowledges that the Company or the Employer may recover any such additional income tax and National Insurance Contributions at any time thereafter by any of the means referred to in the Responsibility for Taxes section of the Grant, although Optionee acknowledges that he/she ultimately will be responsible for reporting any income tax or National Insurance Contributions due on this additional benefit directly to the HMRC under the self-assessment regime.
Election to Transfer Employer's National Insurance Contributions Liability to Optionee (the "Election").
Optionee acknowledges that he or she will pay the employee's primary Class 1 National Insurance Contributions ("the Primary Contributions") due on the exercise or assignment or release of the Option, pursuant to section 4(4)(a) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. The Primary Contributions will be payable (i) on the gain arising on exercise or (ii) in the case of assignment or release of the Option, in respect of the difference between the amount of the consideration (if any) given for such assignment or release and the amount of the consideration (if any) given for the Option.

In addition, Optionee and Electronic Arts Limited ("the Employer") hereby elect that the entire liability of the Employer to pay secondary Class 1 National Insurance Contributions due on the exercise or assignment or release of the Option ("the Secondary Contributions") is hereby transferred to Optionee. The Secondary Contributions will also be payable (i) on the gain arising on exercise or (ii) in the case of assignment or release of the Option, in respect of the difference between the amount of the consideration (if any) given for such assignment or release and the amount of the consideration (if any) given for the Option. The purpose of this Election is to transfer the Employer's liability for the Secondary Contributions to the Optionee.
Optionee hereby authorizes the Employer to collect the Secondary Contributions from the Optionee within 30 days after the exercise or assignment or release of the Option or, if earlier, within 14 days after the end of the tax month during which such exercise or assignment or release takes place:
