ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS
         On July 10, 2002, a purported class action complaint was filed in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County (No. 19745) by Daniel Lowe, an alleged stockholder of PayPal, Inc. ("PayPal"). As previously reported by eBay Inc. ("eBay") in its Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 11, 2002, two other purported class action complaints have been filed in the same court by alleged stockholders of PayPal. Each of the complaints name as defendants PayPal and each member of its board of directors as well as eBay. Each of the complaints are purported class actions that allege, among other things, that (i) eBay controls PayPal, (ii) the defendants have breached fiduciary duties they assertedly owed to PayPal's stockholders in connection with PayPal entering into the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 7, 2002, with eBay and Vaquita Acquisition Corp. and (iii) the merger consideration is unfair and inadequate. The plaintiffs in each lawsuit seek, among other things, an injunction against the consummation of the merger and an award of unspecified compensatory damages. eBay believes that each of the lawsuits are without merit and intends to defend itself vigorously.
