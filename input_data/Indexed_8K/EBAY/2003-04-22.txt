Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
    (c)  Exhibits     99.1.  Press release dated April 22, 2003 containing financial information for eBay Inc. for the quarter ended March 31, 2003 and forward-looking statements relating to eBay's performance during 2003.
Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure Information Furnished Pursuant to Item 12. Disclosures of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
     On April 22, 2003, eBay Inc. announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2003. A copy of eBay's press release announcing these financial results and certain other information is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
     The attached press release contains non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of Regulation G, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, eBay uses non-GAAP measures of gross profit, operating income, net income, earnings per share, and cash flows, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of our current financial performance and our prospects for the future. Specifically, we believe the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses that may not be indicative of our core operating results. In addition, because we have historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, we believe the inclusion of non-GAAP numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but are not a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. Consistent with our historical practice, the non-GAAP measures included in the attached press release have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure.
     The attached press release also contains forward-looking statements relating to eBay's performance during 2003. A more thorough discussion of certain factors which may affect the eBay's operating results is included under the captions "Risk Factors That May Affect Results of Operations and Financial Condition" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in eBay's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002, and will also be included in eBay's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2003 to be filed in the second quarter of 2003.
     In accordance with the procedural guidance in SEC Release No. 33-8216, the information in this report is being furnished under "Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure" rather than under "Item 12. Disclosure of Results of Operations and Financial Condition." The information in this report shall not be treated as "filed" for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Exhibit 99.1
San Jose, CA, April 22, 2003  eBay Inc. (Nasdaq: EBAY; www.ebay.com), the world's online marketplace, reported financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2003.
eBay reported record consolidated Q1-03 net revenues of $476.5 million. Consolidated net income in Q1-03 was a record $104.2 million, or $0.32 per diluted share. eBay's pro forma consolidated net income, excluding certain items, was a record $116.2 million, or $0.36 per diluted share.
During Q1-03, consolidated net transaction revenues increased to a record $465.6 million, driven by 49% year-over-year transaction revenue growth in the core eBay U.S. business, 166% year-over-year transaction revenue growth internationally, and a $92.2 million transaction revenue contribution from PayPal.
"Q1 was a terrific quarter for eBay, delivering record results across every part of the business," said Meg Whitman, President and CEO of eBay. "We are now more confident than ever in eBay's long-term potential across every facet of our business."

Consolidated Financial and Operating Summary
eBay reported record net revenues of $476.5 million in Q1-03, representing a 94% year-over-year increase. Excluding PayPal, eBay's Q1-03 net revenues totaled $382.3 million, representing a 56% year-over-year increase. PayPal's Q1-03 net revenues totaled $94.2 million, representing a 93% year-over-year increase compared to the $48.8 million PayPal reported in Q1-02. The strong Q1-03 performance was attributed to a combination of effective integrated marketing programs and a substantial increase in user activity. Revenues from third party advertisers declined 54% year over year to $8.8 million and now represent approximately 2% of net revenues.
Payments net transaction revenues totaled $93.2 million in Q1-03, driven by PayPal total payment volume of $2.63 billion, an 80% year-over-year increase over the Q1-02 total payment volume of $1.46 billion. Including net revenues from third party advertising, total payments net revenues
 
totaled $95.2 million. In Q1-03, 67% of total payment volume came from eBay and other online trading sites, up from 66% in Q4-02. eBay continues to expect that its Billpoint operations, which contributed $1 million in net revenues in Q1-03, will be completely phased out during the second quarter of 2003.
Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was 81%, up from the 80% level reported in Q4-02, but down from the 83% level reported in Q1-02. The reported gross profit percentage reflects an improvement in the US and International operations offset by the lower gross margin from PayPal.
Sales and marketing expenses totaled $123.8 million, or 26% of net revenues, consistent with the 26% reported in Q4-02 and down from the 30% reported in Q1-02. The sequential dollar increase in sales and marketing expense was attributed to the company's integrated marketing campaigns combined with the incremental expenses from the PayPal business.
Product development costs totaled $34.3 million, or approximately 7% of net revenues, down from the 8% of net revenues reported in Q4-02 and the 10% of net revenues reported in Q1-02. Product development expense reflects an actual spending increase combined with the incremental expenses from the PayPal business, partially offset by $4.7 million of required capitalization for major site and product development efforts.
General and administrative costs totaled $63.0 million, or about 13% of net revenues, down from the 15% of net revenues reported for Q4-02 and consistent with the 13% of net revenues reported for Q1-02. The sequential percentage decrease primarily reflects leverage in the core eBay business partially offset by the addition of PayPal general and administrative expenses. PayPal's transaction losses represented approximately 0.34% of PayPal's total payment volume.
Income from operations totaled $148.1 million during Q1-03, a 109% increase over the $70.7 million reported in Q1-02. On a pro forma basis, income from operations totaled $165.6 million, or 35% of Q1-03 consolidated net revenues, comparing favorably to the $74.4 million and 30% of net revenues reported in Q1-02.
Net interest and other income totaled $7.4 million in Q1-03, down from the $24.0 million reported in Q4-02. The sequential decrease primarily reflects certain one-time gains in Q4-02. On a pro forma basis, net interest and other income increased to $7.7 million from $6.6 million in Q4-02.
eBay reported a consolidated pro forma tax provision of $54.7 million. The Q1-03 effective pro forma tax rate was 32%, down from the 36% effective tax rate in Q4-02 and the 38% rate in Q1-02. The lower effective tax rate reflects the increasing profit contribution from the company's international operations.
eBay's balance sheet remains strong. At the end of Q1-03, the company had $2.2 billion in aggregate corporate cash and investments and total assets of more than $4.5 billion.
The company reported $190.0 million in operating cash flows, 106% higher than the $92.3 million reported in Q1-02, primarily reflecting increased profitability.
 
Free cash flows during Q1-03 totaled $146.1 million, 81% higher than the $80.8 million reported in Q1-02. Capital expenditures in Q1-03 totaled $43.9 million, relating primarily to the purchase of site-related hardware and software, the build-out of PayPal's new customer service center, and the required capitalization of certain product development costs.
Business Outlook
Net Revenues  The company now expects that revenues for 2003 could be as high as $2.05 billion, $150 million higher than the company's most recent guidance. This higher revenue outlook derives from the strength of eBay's U.S., International and Payments businesses. From a quarterly perspective, eBay estimates that Q2-03 revenues could be $500 million, Q3-03 $510 million, and Q4-03 $564 million.
GAAP Diluted EPS  eBay now estimates that earnings per diluted share for the full year 2003 could be as high as $1.27, $0.15 higher than the company's most recent guidance. From a quarterly perspective, eBay estimates that GAAP earnings per diluted share to be $0.30 in Q2-03, $0.30 in Q3-03 and $0.35 in Q4-03.
Pro Forma Diluted EPS  The company's pro forma earnings per diluted share for the full year 2003 could be as high as $1.41, $0.14 higher than the company's most recent guidance. eBay now believes that amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expenses and other pro forma items primarily related to the PayPal acquisition, as well as the related tax impact of these items, will range between $11.0 million to $12.0 million per quarter through 2003. From a quarterly perspective, eBay estimates pro forma earnings per diluted share to be $0.33 in Q2-03, $0.33 in Q3-03 and $0.39 in Q4-03.
Effective Tax Rate  eBay's current estimate for its effective tax rate is 32% for 2003.
Non-GAAP Measures
To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, eBay uses non-GAAP measures of gross profit, operating income, net income, earnings per share, and cash flows, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of our current financial performance and our prospects for the future. Specifically, we believe the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses that may not be indicative of our core operating results. In addition, because we have historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, we believe the inclusion of non-GAAP measures provides consistency in our financial reporting. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. Consistent with our historical practice, the non-GAAP measures included in this press release have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure.
