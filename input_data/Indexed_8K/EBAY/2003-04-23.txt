Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure Information Furnished Pursuant to Item 12. Disclosure of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
     On April 22, 2003, eBay Inc. announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2003 and furnished the press release announcing those financial results as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K. That press release contained an inconsistency between the company's net revenue guidance as set forth in the narrative and the comparable numbers included in the Guidance Summary' table for the third and fourth fiscal quarters of 2003. This amendment on Form 8-K/A is being filed solely to correct the error contained in the Guidance Summary' table, a correct copy of which is attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto.
     In accordance with the procedural guidance in SEC Release No. 33-8216, the information in this report is being furnished under "Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure" rather than under "Item 12. Disclosure of Results of Operations and Financial Condition." The information in this report shall not be treated as "filed" for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
