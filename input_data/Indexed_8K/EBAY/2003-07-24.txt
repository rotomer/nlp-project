     (c)  Exhibits
     99.1. Press release dated July 24, 2003 containing financial information for eBay Inc. for the quarter ended June 30, 2003 and forward-looking statements relating to eBay's future performance.
Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure Information Furnished Pursuant to Item 12 (Disclosures of Results of Operations and Financial Condition).
     On July 24, 2003, eBay Inc. announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2003. A copy of eBay's press release announcing these financial results and certain other information is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
     The attached press release contains non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of Regulation G, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, eBay uses non-GAAP measures of gross profit, operating income, net income, earnings per share, and cash flows, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of our current financial performance and our prospects for the future. Specifically, we believe the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses that may not be indicative of our core operating results. In addition, because we have historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, we believe the inclusion of non-GAAP numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but are not a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. Consistent with our historical practice, the non-GAAP measures included in the attached press release have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure.
     The attached press release also contains forward-looking statements relating to eBay's future performance. A more thorough discussion of certain factors which may affect the eBay's operating results is included under the captions "Risk Factors That May Affect Results of Operations and Financial Condition" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in eBay's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.
     In accordance with the procedural guidance in SEC Release No. 33-8216, the information in this report is being furnished under "Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure" rather than under "Item 12. Disclosure of Results of Operations and Financial Condition." The information in this report shall not be treated as "filed" for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Exhibit 99.1
San Jose, CA, July 24, 2003  eBay Inc. (Nasdaq: EBAY; www.ebay.com), the world's online marketplace, reported financial results for its quarter ended June 30, 2003.
eBay reported record consolidated Q2-03 net revenues of $509.3 million, up 91% year-over-year; record operating income of $152 million, up 91% year-over-year; and record pro forma operating income of $168.7 million, up 109% year-over-year. Operating income was 30% of net revenues and pro forma operating income was 33% of net revenues.
Consolidated net income in Q2-03 was a record $109.7 million, or $0.33 per diluted share. eBay's pro forma consolidated net income, excluding certain items, was a record $120.9 million, or $0.37 per diluted share.
These results exceeded the company's guidance of $500 million for net revenues, $0.30 for GAAP earnings per diluted share and $0.33 for pro forma earnings per diluted share.
In addition, eBay's Board of Directors has approved a two-for-one split of all outstanding shares of the company's common stock, payable August 28, 2003 to stockholders of record on August 4, 2003.
"Q2 was another great quarter for eBay," said Meg Whitman, President and CEO of eBay. "Our thriving community of buyers and sellers continues to spread the word that eBay is a great place to trade, build a business, make friends and have fun."

Total Payment Volume (TPV)  TPV was $2.8 billion in Q2-03, up from TPV of $2.6 billion in Q1-03.
Gross Profit  Gross profit was a record $410.1 million, or 81% of net revenues, which was down from the 83% level reported in Q2-02, reflecting the increased contribution of the lower margin PayPal business.
Operating Income  Operating income was a record $152.0 million or 30% of net revenues and a 91% increase over the $79.4 million reported in Q2-02. Pro forma operating income increased 109% year-over-year to $168.7 million, or 33% of net revenues, versus 30% in Q2-02.
GAAP Net Income  GAAP net income increased 102% year-over-year, to a record $109.7 million, or $0.33 per diluted share.
Pro Forma Net Income  Pro forma net income increased 124% year-over-year, to a record $120.9 million, or $0.37 per diluted share.
Operating and Free Cash Flows  Operating cash flows totaled a record $208.7 million, a 125% increase from the $92.8 million reported in Q2-02. Free cash flows totaled $22.6 million, a 25% decrease from the $30.1 million reported in Q2-02, reflecting the purchase of additional facilities in San Jose, California.
Key Category Performance  Based on Q2-03 GMS, eBay has nine categories that deliver more than $1 billion in worldwide annualized GMS: eBay Motors at $6.3 billion; Consumer Electronics at $2.0 billion; Computers at $2.0 billion; Books/Movies/Music at $1.6 billion; Sports at $1.5 billion; Clothing and Accessories at $1.3 billion; Collectibles at $1.1 billion; Toys at $1.0 billion; and Home & Garden at $1.0 billion.
Fixed Price Trading  eBay's fixed price trading contributed approximately $1.51 billion or 27% of total GMS during Q2-03, primarily from eBay's "Buy It Now" feature. Pure fixed price, which allows sellers to offer items for a set price rather than in an auction format, accounted for 11% of eBay's global GMS.
 
eBay Stores  eBay hosts approximately 110,000 stores, with slightly more outside the US than on eBay.com.
EachNet  On July 16, 2003, eBay increased its investment in EachNet Inc., which in cooperation with local subsidiaries operates the leading e-commerce company in China. eBay paid approximately $150 million in cash to acquire the remaining outstanding stock of EachNet Inc.
Consolidated Financial and Operating Summary
eBay reported record consolidated net revenues of $509.3 million in Q2-03, representing a 91% year-over-year increase. Excluding PayPal, eBay's Q2-03 net revenues totaled $407.7 million, representing a 53% year-over-year increase. PayPal's Q2-03 total net revenues were $101.5 million, representing an 89% year-over-year increase compared to the $53.8 million PayPal reported in Q2-02. As expected, revenues from third party advertisers and end-to-end services declined 43% year over year to $12.4 million and now represent approximately 2% of net revenues. Consolidated revenues reflected a foreign exchange benefit in Q2-03 in the amount of approximately $6.9 million, based on Q1-03 weighted average foreign exchange rates.
Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was 81%, which was consistent with the 81% level reported in Q1-03, but down from the 83% level reported in Q2-02. The reported gross profit percentage reflects an improvement in US and International segments offset by an increased contribution of the PayPal business, which has a lower gross margin structure.
Sales and marketing expenses totaled $134.6 million, or 26% of net revenues, consistent with the 26% reported in Q1-03 and down from the 30% reported in Q2-02. The sequential dollar increase of $10.9 million in sales and marketing expense during the quarter was attributed to the company's expanded marketing programs and growth in sales and marketing headcount.
Product development costs totaled $38.8 million, or approximately 8% of net revenues, up from the 7% of net revenues reported in Q1-03 and down from the 9% of net revenues reported in Q2-02. The incremental product development expense reflects an actual sequential spending increase, offset by $12.3 million of required capitalization for major site and other product development efforts.
General and administrative costs totaled $69.5 million, or about 14% of net revenues, up from the 13% of net revenues reported for Q1-03 and consistent with the 14% of net revenues reported for Q2-02. Included in general and administrative costs were PayPal's transaction losses, which represented approximately 0.32% of PayPal's total payment volume. The incremental general and administration costs primarily reflect an increase in legal costs, headcount, and the impact of a weakening dollar on Euro denominated expenses in the quarter.
Income from operations totaled $152.0 million during Q2-03, a 91% increase over the $79.4 million reported in Q2-02. On a pro forma basis, income from operations totaled $168.7 million, or 33% of Q2-03 consolidated net revenues, comparing favorably to the $80.7 million and 30% of net revenues reported in Q2-02.
 
Net interest and other income totaled $10.9 million in Q2-03, up from the $7.4 million reported in Q1-03, reflecting a larger investment base. On a pro forma basis, net interest and other income increased to $9.9 million from $7.7 million in Q1-03.
The Q2-03 effective tax rate for both GAAP and pro forma was 32%, consistent with the 32% effective tax rate in Q1-03 and a decrease from the 38% rate in Q2-02. The lower effective tax rate reflects the increased profit contribution from the company's international operations.
eBay's balance sheet remains strong. At the end of Q2-03, the company had $2.5 billion in aggregate corporate cash and investments and total assets of more than $5.0 billion.
The company reported $208.7 million in operating cash flows, 125% higher than the $92.8 million reported in Q2-02, primarily reflecting increased profitability.
Capital expenditures increased in Q2-03 to $186.1 million from $43.9 million in Q1-03, reflecting the $125 million purchase of new facilities in San Jose, California. As a result, free cash flows during Q2-03 totaled $22.6 million, 25% lower than the $30.1 million reported in Q2-02.
Business Outlook
Net Revenues  The company now expects that revenues for 2003 could be as high as $2.075 billion, $25 million higher than the company's most recent guidance. This higher revenue outlook derives from the strength of eBay's US, International and Payments businesses. From a quarterly perspective, eBay expects consolidated net revenue to be approximately $515 million in Q3-03, and approximately $575 million in Q4-03. eBay's guidance is based on an assumed quarterly weighted average translation of 1.14 U.S. dollars per Euro.
GAAP Diluted EPS  eBay now estimates that earnings per diluted share for the full year 2003 could be as high as $1.31, $0.05 higher than the company's most recent guidance. From a quarterly perspective, eBay estimates GAAP earnings per diluted share to be $0.29 in Q3-03 and $0.36 in Q4-03. This guidance includes a $0.02 decrease in Q3-03 and $0.01 decrease in Q4-03 from the acquisition of EachNet, which closed on July 16, 2003.
Pro Forma Diluted EPS  eBay now estimates that pro forma earnings per diluted share for the full year 2003 could be as high as $1.47, $0.06 higher than the company's most recent guidance. This guidance includes a $0.02 decrease in Q3-03 and $0.01 decrease in Q4-03 from the acquisition of EachNet, which closed on July 16, 2003. eBay now believes that amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expenses and other pro forma items primarily related to the PayPal acquisition, as well as the related tax impact of these items, will range between $13.0 million to $18.0 million per quarter through 2003. From a quarterly perspective, eBay estimates pro forma earnings per diluted share to be $0.34 in Q3-03 and $0.40 in Q4-03.
Effective Tax Rate  eBay's current estimate for its effective tax rate is 32% for 2003.
Capital Expenditures  eBay expects capital expenditures to be approximately $80 million in Q3-03 and $76 million in Q4-03, reflecting expected spending in technology, facilities, and PayPal. This implies an increase in 2003 capital expenditure guidance of approximately $11 million to $385 million from our prior guidance of $374 million.
 
Stock Split  eBay's Board of Directors approved a two-for-one split of all outstanding shares of the company's common stock, payable August 28, 2003 to stockholders of record on August 4, 2003.
Legal Settlement
We have reached a settlement with the US Attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri on the issue of PayPal's services to online gambling merchants, which were discontinued following PayPal's acquisition by eBay, as previously disclosed, for a payment of $10 million. The settlement amount will be included as an adjustment to our purchase price of PayPal and not as a charge against earnings.
Non-GAAP Measures
To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, eBay uses non-GAAP measures of gross profit, operating income, net income, earnings per share, and cash flows, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of our current financial performance and our prospects for the future. Specifically, we believe the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses that may not be indicative of our core operating results. In addition, because we have historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, we believe the inclusion of non-GAAP measures provides consistency in our financial reporting. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. Consistent with our historical practice, the non-GAAP measures included in this press release have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure.
