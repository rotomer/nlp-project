     (c)  Exhibits
     99.1. Press release dated October 16, 2003 containing financial information for eBay Inc. for the quarter ended September 30, 2003 and forward-looking statements relating to eBay's performance during the fourth quarter of 2003 and fiscal year 2004.
Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
     On October 16, 2003, eBay Inc. announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2003. A copy of eBay's press release announcing these financial results and certain other information is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
     The attached press release contains non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of Regulation G, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, eBay uses non-GAAP measures of gross profit, operating income, net income, earnings per share, cash flows and its effective tax rate, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance the investors' overall understanding of our current financial performance and our prospects for the future. Specifically, we believe the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses that may not be indicative of our core operating results. In addition, because we have historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, we believe the inclusion of non-GAAP numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but are not a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. Consistent with our historical practice, the non-GAAP measures included in the attached press release have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure.
     The attached press release also contains forward-looking statements relating to eBay's performance during the fourth quarter of 2003 and fiscal year 2004. A more thorough discussion of certain factors which may affect the eBay's operating results is included under the captions "Risk Factors That May Affect Results of Operations and Financial Condition" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in eBay's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.

EXHIBIT 99.1
San Jose, CA, October 16, 2003  eBay Inc. (Nasdaq: EBAY; www.ebay.com), the world's online marketplace, reported financial results for its quarter ended September 30, 2003.
eBay reported record consolidated Q3-03 net revenues of $530.9 million, up 84% year over year; record operating income of $155.9 million, up 73% year over year; and record pro forma operating income of $172.2 million, up 87% year over year. Operating income was 29% of net revenues and pro forma operating income was 32% of net revenues.
Consolidated net income in Q3-03 was $103.3 million, or $0.16 per diluted share. eBay's pro forma consolidated net income, excluding certain items, was a record $118.3 million, or $0.18 per diluted share.
These results exceeded the company's guidance of $515 million for net revenues, $0.14 for GAAP earnings per diluted share and $0.17 for pro forma earnings per diluted share. Adjusting for the company's 2-for-1 stock split effected during the quarter, pro forma earnings per diluted share would be $0.36, $0.02 above the company's Q3-03 guidance of $0.34.
"Q3 was another very strong quarter for eBay and its community," said Meg Whitman, President and CEO of eBay. "With record levels of registered users, listings, and gross merchandise sales, along with a strong performance by PayPal, eBay's business continues to gain momentum going into the holiday season."
Key Financial and Operating Metrics

This was an increase of 10.2 million users sequentially and a 56% increase over the 54.9 million users reported at the end of Q3-02.
Active Users  Active users, the number of users on the eBay platform who bid, bought or listed over the trailing 12 months, increased to 37.4 million, a 55% increase over the 24.2 million active users reported in the same period a year ago.

Gross Profit  Gross profit was a record $421.6 million, or 79% of net revenues, which was down from the 84% level reported in Q3-02, primarily reflecting the lower structural gross margin of the PayPal business and increased investments in technology and customer support.
Operating Income  Operating income was a record $155.9 million, or 29% of net revenues, a 73% increase over the $90.1 million reported in Q3-02. Pro forma operating income increased 87% year-over-year to a record $172.2 million, or 32% of net revenues, consistent with the reported 32% in Q3-02 despite the addition of the PayPal business.
GAAP Net Income  GAAP net income increased 69% year over year to $103.3 million, or $0.16 per diluted share.

Consolidated Financial and Operating Summary
eBay reported record consolidated net revenues of $530.9 million in Q3-03, representing an 84% year-over-year increase. Excluding PayPal, eBay's Q3-03 net revenues totaled $422.6 million, representing a 46% year-over-year increase. PayPal's Q3-03 net revenues totaled $108.4 million, representing an 83% year-over-year increase compared to the $59.3 million PayPal reported in Q3-02. On a year-over-year basis, consolidated net revenues reflected a foreign exchange benefit in Q3-03 of approximately $15 million.
Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was 79%, which was below the 84% level reported in Q3-02. The year-over-year decline in the gross profit percentage primarily reflects the lower structural gross margin of the PayPal business and increased investment in technology and customer support.
Sales and marketing expenses totaled $136.4 million, or 26% of net revenues, down from the 30% reported in Q3-02. The year-over-year decline as a percentage of net revenues primarily reflects the addition of the PayPal business.
Product development expenses totaled $39.7 million, or approximately 7% of net revenues, down from the 8% of net revenues reported in both Q2-03 and Q3-02. Total product development expenses in Q3-03 do not include $11.4 million of required cost capitalization for major site and other product development efforts.
General and administrative costs totaled $74.2 million, or about 14% of net revenues, consistent with the 14% of net revenues reported in Q3-02. Included in Q3-03 general and administrative costs were PayPal's transaction losses, which represented approximately 0.22% of PayPal's total payment volume. The incremental general and administration costs primarily reflect an increase in headcount, legal costs, and insurance.
Income from operations totaled a record $155.9 million during Q3-03, a 73% increase over the $90.1 million reported in Q3-02. On a pro forma basis, income from operations totaled a record $172.2 million, an 87% increase over the $92.2 reported in Q3-02.
 
eBay Announces Q3-03 Earnings (cont.)
Net interest and other income totaled $5.5 million in Q3-03, down from the $10.9 million reported in Q2-03. On a pro forma basis, net interest and other income decreased to $5.5 million in Q3-03 from $9.9 million in Q2-03. These decreases were primarily the result of interest-only payments of $1.9 million related to the San Jose facilities, which were recorded as a lease-related operating expense in prior periods and eBay's share of acquisition costs incurred by EachNet.
The GAAP and pro forma effective tax rates for Q3-03 were 32.0% and 32.8% respectively, a decrease from the 36% GAAP and pro forma effective tax rate in Q3-02. The lower rate reflects an increased profit contribution from the company's international operations.
eBay's balance sheet remains strong. At the end of Q3-03, the company had $2.6 billion in aggregate cash and investments and more than $5.5 billion in total assets.
The company reported $208.0 million in operating cash flows, 86% higher than the $111.9 million reported in Q3-02, primarily reflecting increased profitability.
Capital expenditures totaled $39.6 million in Q3-03, 96% higher than the $20.2 million reported in Q3-02. Free cash flows, which are operating cash flows less capital expenditures, were a record $168.4 million in Q3-03, 84% higher than $91.7 million reported in Q3-02.
Business Outlook
Fiscal Year 2003
Net Revenues  The company now expects that consolidated net revenues could be as high as $590 million for Q4-03, $15 million higher than the company's most recent guidance. Full year 2003 net revenues could be as high as $2.1 billion. This higher net revenue outlook derives from the strength of eBay's US, International and Payments businesses. eBay's guidance is based on an assumed Q4-03 quarterly weighted average exchange rate of US$1.14 per Euro.
GAAP Diluted EPS  eBay now estimates GAAP earnings per diluted share could be $0.19 in Q4-03. eBay estimates that earnings per diluted share for the full year 2003 could be as high as $0.65, $0.02 higher than the company's most recent guidance.
Pro Forma Diluted EPS  eBay now estimates pro forma earnings per diluted share to be $0.21 in Q4-03. eBay estimates that pro forma earnings per diluted share for the full year 2003 could be as high as $0.72, $0.01 higher than the company's most recent guidance. eBay now believes that amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expenses and other pro forma items, primarily related to the company's acquisitions, will be approximately $12 million, net of tax, during Q4-03.
 
eBay Announces Q3-03 Earnings (cont.)
Fiscal Year 2004
Net Revenues  The company expects that net revenues for 2004 could be as high as $2.9 billion. On a quarterly basis, eBay expects consolidated net revenues to be approximately $675 million in Q1-04, $695 million in Q2-04, $710 million in Q3-04 and $820 million in Q4-04. eBay's guidance is based on an assumed 2004 quarterly weighted average exchange rate of US$1.14 per Euro.
GAAP Diluted EPS  eBay estimates that earnings per diluted share for the full year 2004 could be as high as $0.91. From a quarterly perspective, eBay estimates GAAP earnings per diluted share could be as high as $0.22 in Q1-04, $0.21 in Q2-04, $0.22 in Q3-04 and $0.26 in Q4-04.
Pro Forma Diluted EPS  eBay estimates that pro forma earnings per diluted share for the full year 2004 could be as high as $0.98. From a quarterly perspective, eBay estimates pro forma earnings per diluted share could be as high as $0.24 in Q1-04, $0.23 in Q2-04, $0.23 in Q3-04 and $0.28 in Q4-04.
Effective Tax Rate  eBay's current estimate for its 2004 effective tax rate is 30% on a GAAP basis and 31% on a pro forma basis. This compares to an expected GAAP and pro forma effective tax rate of approximately 32% in 2003. This lower effective tax rate estimate reflects anticipated increased profit contribution from the company's international operations.
Non-GAAP Measures
To supplement the company's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, eBay uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance, including gross profit, operating income, net income, earnings per share, cash flows, and effective tax rate, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of the company's current financial performance and the company's prospects for the future. Specifically, the company believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses that may not be indicative of its core operating results. In addition, because eBay has historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, the company believes the inclusion of non-GAAP measures provides consistency in the company's financial reporting. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. Consistent with the company's historical practice, the non-GAAP measures included in this press release have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure.
