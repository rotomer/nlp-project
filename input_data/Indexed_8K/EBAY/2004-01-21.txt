     (c)  Exhibits
     99.1. Press release dated January 21, 2004 containing financial information for eBay Inc. for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2003 and forward-looking statements relating to eBay's performance during fiscal year 2004.
Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
     On January 21, 2004, eBay Inc. announced its financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2003. A copy of eBay's press release announcing these financial results and certain other information is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
     The attached press release contains non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of Regulation G, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, eBay uses non-GAAP measures of gross profit, operating income, net income, earnings per share, cash flows and its effective tax rate, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance the investors' overall understanding of our current financial performance and our prospects for the future. Specifically, we believe the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses that may not be indicative of our core operating results. In addition, because we have historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, we believe the inclusion of non-GAAP numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but are not a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. Consistent with our historical practice, the non-GAAP measures included in the attached press release have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure.
     The attached press release also contains forward-looking statements relating to eBay's performance during fiscal year 2004. A more thorough discussion of certain factors which may affect the eBay's operating results is included under the captions "Risk Factors That May Affect Results of Operations and Financial Condition" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in eBay's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Additional information will be included under those captions in eBay's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003, which will be filed with the SEC in the first quarter of 2004.

However, the company initiated store fees for the first time for certain of its international websites in early Q1-04, therefore, the number of eBay stores worldwide may decrease in future periods.

On a year-over-year basis, consolidated net revenues reflected a foreign exchange benefit in Q4-03 of approximately $26.7 million. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was 82%, a 2 percentage point improvement from the 80% level reported in Q4-02, primarily reflecting improved cost leverage and cost savings from its recently launched eBay Picture Services. Sales and marketing expenses totaled $172.8 million, or 27% of net revenues, up from the 26% reported in Q4-02. The year-over-year increase as a percentage of net revenues primarily reflects increases in international marketing efforts combined with expanded television advertising campaigns. - 3 -
eBay Announces Q4-03 Earnings (cont.) Product development expenses totaled $46.4 million, or approximately 7% of net revenues, down from the 8% of net revenues reported in Q4-02. Total product development expenses in Q4-03 do not include $9.2 million of required cost capitalization for major site and other product development efforts. General and administrative costs totaled $96.0 million, or about 15% of net revenues, consistent with the 15% of net revenues reported in Q4-02. The incremental dollar change in general and administration costs primarily reflects the resolution of various legal matters, headcount and insurance. Income from operations totaled a record $203.1 million during Q4-03, a 78% increase over the $113.9 million reported in Q4-02. On a pro forma basis, income from operations totaled a record $218.5 million, a 65% increase over the $132.4 million reported in Q4-02. Included in both the GAAP and pro forma Q4-03 results were $10.6 million of incremental costs related to the resolution of various legal matters primarily relating to PayPal and $11.4 million of year-over-year effect on operating expenses from changes in foreign exchange rates. Net interest and other income totaled $9.4 million in Q4-03, up from the $5.5 million reported in Q3-03. The increase was primarily the result of Q4-03 foreign currency gains and additional investment income. The GAAP and pro forma effective tax rates for Q4-03 were 32% and 30% respectively, a decrease from the 36% GAAP and pro forma effective tax rate in Q4-02. The lower rate reflects an increased profit contribution from the company's international operations. eBay's balance sheet remains strong. At the end of Q4-03, the company had $2.8 billion in aggregate cash and investments and more than $5.8 billion in total assets. The company reported $267.4 million in operating cash flows and $95.7 million of capital expenditures in Q4-03, resulting in free cash flows of $171.7 million. BUSINESS OUTLOOK Net Revenues - The company expects that net revenues for 2004 could be as high as $3.0 billion. On a quarterly basis, eBay expects consolidated net revenues could be as high as $700 million in Q1-04, $720 million in Q2-04, $725 million in Q3-04 and $855 million in Q4-04. eBay's guidance is based on an assumed 2004 quarterly weighted average exchange rate of US$1.20 per Euro. GAAP Diluted EPS - eBay expects that GAAP earnings per diluted share for the full year 2004 could be as high as $0.99. From a quarterly perspective, eBay estimates GAAP earnings per diluted share could be as high as $0.24 in Q1-04, $0.23 in Q2-04, $0.23 in Q3-04 and $0.29 in Q4-04. - 4 -
eBay Announces Q4-03 Earnings (cont.) Pro Forma Diluted EPS - eBay expects that pro forma earnings per diluted share for the full year 2004 could be as high as $1.04. From a quarterly perspective, eBay estimates pro forma earnings per diluted share could be as high as $0.25 in Q1-04, $0.25 in Q2-04, $0.24 in Q3-04 and $0.30 in Q4-04. Effective Tax Rate - eBay expects its 2004 effective tax rate could be 30% on a GAAP basis and 31% on a pro forma basis. This effective tax rate estimate reflects anticipated increased profit contribution from the company's international operations. Capital Expenditures - eBay expects its capital expenditures to total $250 million for the full year 2004, without taking into account acquisitions. NON-GAAP MEASURES To supplement the company's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, eBay uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance, including gross profit, operating income, net income, earnings per share, cash flows, and effective tax rate, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of the company's current financial performance and the company's prospects for the future. Specifically, the company believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses that may not be indicative of its core operating results. In addition, because eBay has historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, the company believes the inclusion of non-GAAP measures provides consistency in the company's financial reporting. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. Consistent with the company's historical practice, the non-GAAP measures included in this press release have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure.
