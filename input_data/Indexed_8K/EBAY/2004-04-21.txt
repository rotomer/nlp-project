     99.1. Press release dated April 21, 2004 containing financial information for eBay Inc. for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 and forward-looking statements relating to eBay's performance during 2004.
Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
     On April 21, 2004, eBay Inc. announced its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2004. A copy of eBay's press release announcing these financial results and certain other information is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
     The attached press release contains non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of Regulation G, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, eBay uses non-GAAP measures of gross profit, operating income, net income, earnings per share, cash flows and its effective tax rate, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance the investors' overall understanding of our current financial performance and our prospects for the future. Specifically, we believe the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses that may not be indicative of our core operating results. In addition, because we have historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, we believe the inclusion of non-GAAP numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but are not a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. Consistent with our historical practice, the non-GAAP measures included in the attached press release have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure.
     The attached press release also contains forward-looking statements relating to eBay's performance during 2004. A more thorough discussion of certain factors which may affect the eBay's operating results is included under the captions "Risk Factors That May Affect Results of Operations and Financial Condition" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in eBay's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003. Additional information will be included under those captions in eBay's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2004, which will be filed with the SEC in the second quarter of 2004.

Consolidated Financial and Operating Summary
eBay reported record consolidated net revenues of $756.2 million in Q1-04, representing a 59% year-over-year increase.

Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was 82%, a percentage point improvement from the 81% level reported in Q1-03, primarily reflecting improved cost leverage and the continuing effects of cost savings from eBay Picture Services, launched in Q4-03.
Sales and marketing expenses totaled $192.7 million, or 25% of net revenues, compared with 26% reported in Q1-03. The incremental dollar change in sales and marketing costs primarily reflects international expansion and increases in both on-line and off-line marketing efforts.

eBay Announces Q1-04 Earnings (cont.)
Net interest and other income totaled $21.2 million in Q1-04, up from the $7.4 million reported in Q1-03. The increase in Q1-04 was primarily the result of gains of approximately $14.8 million due to certain sublease amendments and contract terminations.
The GAAP and pro forma effective tax rates for Q1-04 were 30% and 31% respectively, a decrease from the 32% GAAP and pro forma effective tax rates in Q1-03. The lower rates reflect an increased profit contribution from the company's international operations.
eBay's balance sheet remains strong. At the end of Q1-04, the company had $3.1 billion in aggregate cash and investments and more than $6.4 billion in total assets.
The company reported $366.2 million in operating cash flows and $70.9 million of capital expenditures in Q1-04, resulting in free cash flows of $295.3 million.
Business Outlook
For the remainder of 2004, and consistent with eBay's long-term opportunity and financial strategy, the company plans to invest aggressively in China, product development, site infrastructure, sales and marketing, and the international expansion of PayPal.
Net Revenues  The company now expects that consolidated net revenues for 2004 could be as high as $3.15 billion, $150 million higher than the company's most recent guidance. This improved outlook derives from the strength of eBay's U.S., International and Payments businesses. From a quarterly perspective, eBay expects that consolidated net revenues could be as high as $760 million in Q2-04, $765 million in Q3-04 and $869 million in Q4-04. eBay's guidance is based on an assumed 2004 quarterly weighted average exchange rate of US $1.20 per Euro.
GAAP Diluted EPS  eBay now expects that GAAP earnings per diluted share for the full year 2004 could be as high as $1.06, $0.07 higher than the company's most recent guidance. From a quarterly perspective, eBay estimates that GAAP earnings per diluted share could be as high as $0.24 in Q2-04, $0.24 in Q3-04 and $0.29 in Q4-04.
Pro Forma Diluted EPS  eBay now expects that pro forma earnings per diluted share for the full year 2004 could be as high as $1.13, $0.09 higher than the company's most recent guidance. From a quarterly perspective, eBay estimates pro forma earnings per diluted share could be as high as $0.26 in Q2-04, $0.25 in Q3-04 and $0.31 in Q4-04.
Effective Tax Rate  eBay's current estimate for its 2004 effective tax rate is 30% on a GAAP basis and 31% on a pro forma basis, which is consistent with previous guidance.
Capital Expenditures  eBay expects its capital expenditures to total $250 million for the full year 2004, without taking into account acquisitions, which is consistent with previous guidance.

Non-GAAP Measures
To supplement the company's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, eBay uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance, including gross profit, operating income, net income, earnings per share, cash flows, and effective tax rate, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of the company's current financial performance and the company's prospects for the future. Specifically, the company believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses that may not be indicative of its core operating results. In addition, because eBay has historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, the company believes the inclusion of non-GAAP measures provides consistency in the company's financial reporting. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. Consistent with the company's historical practice, the non-GAAP measures included in this press release have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure.
