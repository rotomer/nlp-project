     99.1. Press release dated July 21, 2004 containing financial information for eBay Inc. for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 and forward-looking statements relating to eBay's performance during 2004.
Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
     On July 21, 2004, eBay Inc. announced its financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2004. A copy of eBay's press release announcing these financial results and certain other information is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
     The attached press release contains non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of Regulation G, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, eBay uses non-GAAP measures of gross profit, operating income, net income, earnings per share, cash flows and its effective tax rate, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance the investors' overall understanding of our current financial performance and our prospects for the future. Specifically, we believe the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses that may not be indicative of our core operating results. In addition, because we have historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, we believe the inclusion of non-GAAP numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but are not a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. Consistent with our historical practice, the non-GAAP measures included in the attached press release have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure.
     The attached press release also contains forward-looking statements relating to eBay's performance during 2004. A more thorough discussion of certain factors which may affect eBay's operating results is included under the captions "Risk Factors That May Affect Results of Operations and Financial Condition" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in eBay's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2004. Additional information will be included under those captions in eBay's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2004, which will be filed with the SEC in the third quarter of 2004.

Consolidated Financial and Operating Summary
eBay reported record consolidated net revenues of $773.4 million in Q2-04, representing a 52% year-over-year increase. On a year-over-year basis, consolidated net revenues reflected a foreign currency translation benefit in Q2-04 of approximately $26.0 million. On a sequential basis, consolidated net revenues were negatively impacted by foreign currency translation in Q2-04 of approximately $11.3 million, primarily related to the Euro.
Gross profit was $626.9 million, or 81% of net revenues, which is consistent with the percentage reported in Q2-03.
Sales and marketing expenses totaled $189.2 million, or 24% of net revenues, compared with 26% reported in Q2-03. While sales and marketing expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenues, the absolute dollars increased, primarily as a result of global increases in both on-line and off-line marketing efforts and international expansion.
Product development expenses totaled $60.0 million, or 8% of net revenues, consistent with 8% of net revenues reported in Q2-03. Total product development expenses in Q2-04 do not include $9.7 million of required cost capitalization for major site and other product development efforts.
General and administrative costs totaled $102.9 million, or 13% of net revenues, down from the 14% of net revenues reported in Q2-03. While general and administrative costs decreased as a percentage of net revenues, the absolute dollars increased, primarily as a result of increases in headcount and professional services.
Income from operations totaled $253.9 million during Q2-04, a 108% increase over the $122.1 million reported in Q2-03. On a pro forma basis, income from operations totaled $275.6 million, a 99% increase over the $138.7 million reported in Q2-03. Included in both the GAAP and pro forma Q2-04 consolidated income from operations results was a $19.8 million year-over-year net benefit from changes in foreign currencies. On a sequential basis, both the GAAP and pro forma

consolidated income from operations results were negatively impacted by a foreign currency translation in Q2-04 of approximately $6.1 million, primarily related to the Euro.
Interest and other income, net, totaled $22.4 million in Q2-04, up from the $10.9 million reported in Q2-03. The increase in Q2-04 was primarily the result of a gain of approximately $7.3 million due to the sale of our equity investment in IPIX Corporation. This gain has been excluded from pro forma net income.
The GAAP effective tax rate for Q2-04 was 30%, consistent with the GAAP effective tax rate for Q2-03. The pro forma effective tax rate for Q2-04 was 31%, an increase from the 30% pro forma effective tax rate for Q2-03. The higher pro forma effective tax rate for Q2-04 compared to Q2-03 reflects an increase in our non-deductible expenses related primarily to acquisitions.
At the end of Q2-04, the company had $3.3 billion in aggregate cash and investments and more than $6.8 billion in total assets.
The company reported $263.1 million in operating cash flows and $65.7 million of capital expenditures in Q2-04, resulting in free cash flows of $197.4 million. Free cash flows for Q1-04 totaled $295.3 million. The decrease in Q2-04 is primarily due to the timing of vendor payments.
Business Outlook
For the remainder of 2004, and consistent with eBay's long-term opportunity and financial strategy, the company plans to invest significantly in China, the international expansion of PayPal, product development, customer support, Trust & Safety, infrastructure, and sales and marketing in the U.S., Germany, the U.K., Taiwan, and China.
Net Revenues  The company now expects that consolidated net revenues for 2004 could be as high as $3.185 billion, $35 million higher than the company's most recent guidance. This improved outlook derives from the strength of eBay's U.S., International and Payments businesses. From a quarterly perspective, eBay expects that consolidated net revenues will be approximately $770 million in Q3-04, approximately even with Q2-04, and as high as $886 million in Q4-04. eBay's guidance for Q3-04 and Q4-04 is based on an assumed weighted average exchange rate of US $1.20 per Euro.
GAAP Diluted EPS  eBay now expects that GAAP earnings per diluted share for the full year 2004 could be as high as $1.10, $0.04 higher than the company's most recent guidance. From a quarterly perspective, eBay estimates that GAAP earnings per diluted share could be as high as $0.24 in Q3-04 and $0.30 in Q4-04.

Pro Forma Diluted EPS  eBay now expects that pro forma earnings per diluted share for the full year 2004 could be as high as $1.17, $0.04 higher than the company's most recent guidance. From a quarterly perspective, eBay estimates pro forma earnings per diluted share could be as high as $0.25 in Q3-04 and $0.32 in Q4-04.
Effective Tax Rate  eBay's current estimate for its 2004 effective tax rate is 30% on a GAAP basis and 31% on a pro forma basis, which is consistent with previous guidance.
Capital Expenditures  eBay expects its capital expenditures to total $315 million for the full year 2004, without taking into account acquisitions, which is $65 million higher than the company's most recent guidance. This is primarily due to the build out of a new data center to ensure redundancy and scalability.
Non-GAAP Measures
To supplement the company's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, eBay uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance, including gross profit, operating income, net income, earnings per share, cash flows, and effective tax rate, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of the company's current financial performance and the company's prospects for the future. Specifically, the company believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses that may not be indicative of its core operating results. In addition, because eBay has historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, the company believes the inclusion of non-GAAP measures provides consistency in the company's financial reporting. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. Consistent with the company's historical practice, the non-GAAP measures included in this press release have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure.
