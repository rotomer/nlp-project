Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     The information in this report is being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
     On October 20, 2004, eBay Inc. announced its financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2004. A copy of eBay's press release announcing these financial results and certain other information is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
     The attached press release contains non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of Regulation G, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, eBay uses non-GAAP measures of gross profit, operating income, net income, earnings per share, cash flows and its effective tax rate, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance the investors' overall understanding of our current financial performance and our prospects for the future. Specifically, we believe the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses that may not be indicative of our core operating results. In addition, because we have historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, we believe the inclusion of non-GAAP numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but are not a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. Consistent with our historical practice, the non-GAAP measures included in the attached press release have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure.
     The attached press release also contains forward-looking statements relating to eBay's performance during the fourth quarter of 2004 and fiscal year 2005. A more thorough discussion of certain factors which may affect eBay's operating results is included under the captions "Risk Factors That May Affect Results of Operations and Financial Condition" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in eBay's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2004. Additional information will be included under those captions in eBay's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2004, which will be filed with the SEC in the fourth quarter of 2004.

Fixed Price Trading - eBay's fixed price trading contributed approximately $2.4 billion or 29% of total GMV during Q3-04, primarily from eBay's "Buy It Now" feature. eBay Stores - At the end of Q3-04, eBay hosted approximately 224,000 stores worldwide, with approximately 143,000 stores hosted on the U.S. site.

Internet Auction Co., Ltd. - On August 31, 2004, September 6, 2004 and October 6, 2004, eBay purchased, for cash, an aggregate of approximately 4.8 million additional shares in Internet Auction Co., Ltd. (IAC) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $523 million. As a result, eBay increased its investment in IAC from approximately 62.2% to approximately 99.7%. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL AND OPERATING SUMMARY eBay reported record consolidated net revenues of $805.9 million in Q3-04, representing a 52% year-over-year increase. On a year-over-year basis, consolidated net revenues reflected a foreign currency translation benefit in Q3-04 of approximately $22.3 million. On a sequential basis, consolidated net revenues reflected a foreign currency translation benefit in Q3-04 of approximately $4.5 million, primarily related to the Euro. Gross profit was $648.8 million, or 81% of net revenues, which was up from the 79% level reported in Q3-03. Sales and marketing expenses totaled $207.2 million, or 26% of net revenues, which is consistent with the percentage reported in Q3-03. While sales and marketing expenses remained consistent as a percentage of net revenues, the absolute dollars increased, primarily as a result of global increases in both on-line and off-line marketing efforts and international expansion. Product development expenses totaled $63.4 million, or 8% of net revenues, which was up from the 7% of net revenues reported in Q3-03. Total product development expenses in Q3-04 do not include $10.7 million of required cost capitalization for major site and other product development efforts. General and administrative costs totaled $105.9 million, or 13% of net revenues, down from the 14% of net revenues reported in Q3-03. While general and administrative costs decreased as a percentage of net revenues, the absolute dollars increased, primarily as a result of increases in headcount, professional services and costs related to legal matters. 3
eBay Announces Q3-04 Earnings (cont.) Income from operations totaled $253.9 million during Q3-04, a 63% increase over the $155.9 million reported in Q3-03. On a pro forma basis, income from operations totaled $272.6 million, a 58% increase over the $172.2 million reported in Q3-03. Included in both the GAAP and pro forma Q3-04 consolidated income from operations was a $9.9 million year-over-year net benefit from changes in foreign currencies. On a sequential basis, both the GAAP and pro forma consolidated income from operations reflected a foreign currency translation benefit in Q3-04 of approximately $2.5 million, primarily related to the Euro. Interest and other income, net, totaled $13.2 million in Q3-04, up from the $7.8 million reported in Q3-03. The increase in Q3-04 was primarily the result of gains recorded in Q3-04 due to certain facility sublease amendments in Q1-04 and eBay's portion of EachNet's losses recorded in Q3-03 prior to the acquisition of the remaining interest in EachNet's common stock. The GAAP and pro forma effective tax rate for Q3-04 was 30% and 31%, respectively, a decrease from the GAAP effective tax rate of 32% and the pro forma effective tax rate of 33% for Q3-03. The lower rates for Q3-04 compared to Q3-03 reflects an increased profit contribution from the company's international operations. At the end of Q3-04, the company had nearly $3.1 billion in aggregate cash and investments and more than $7.2 billion in total assets. The company reported $274.8 million in operating cash flows and $73.4 million of capital expenditures in Q3-04, resulting in free cash flows of $201.4 million.

NON-GAAP MEASURES To supplement the company's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, eBay uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance, including gross profit, operating income, net income, earnings per share, cash flows, and effective tax rate, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of the company's current financial performance and the company's prospects for the future. Specifically, the company believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses that may not be indicative of its core operating results. In addition, because eBay has historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, the company believes the inclusion of non-GAAP measures provides consistency in the company's financial reporting. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. Consistent with the company's historical practice, the non-GAAP measures included in this press release have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure. 5
