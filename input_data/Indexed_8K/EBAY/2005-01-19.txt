Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     The information in this report is being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
     On January 19, 2005, eBay Inc. announced its financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2004. In addition, eBay announced that its Board of Directors had declared a two-for-one stock split to be effected in the form of a stock dividend, with a record date of January 31, 2005, and a payment date of February 16, 2005. A copy of eBay's press release announcing its financial results, the stock split and certain other information is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
     The attached press release contains non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of Regulation G, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, eBay uses non-GAAP measures of gross profit, operating income, net income, earnings per share, cash flows and its effective tax rate, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance the investors' overall understanding of our current financial performance and our prospects for the future. Specifically, we believe the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses that may not be indicative of our core operating results. In addition, because we have historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, we believe the inclusion of non-GAAP numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but are not a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. Consistent with our historical practice, the non-GAAP measures included in the attached press release have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure.
     The attached press release also contains forward-looking statements relating to eBay's performance during fiscal year 2005. A more thorough discussion of certain factors which may affect eBay's operating results is included under the captions "Risk Factors That May Affect Results of Operations and Financial Condition" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in eBay's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2004. Additional information will be included under those captions in eBay's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004, which will be filed with the SEC on or about March 1, 2005.

Operating income was 30% of net revenues and pro forma operating income was 34% of net revenues.
Consolidated net income in Q4-04 was $205.4 million, or $0.30 per diluted share. eBay's pro forma consolidated net income, excluding certain items, was $226.0 million, or $0.33 per diluted share.

For the full year, eBay generated consolidated net revenues of $3.27 billion, a 51% increase over the $2.17 billion reported in 2003. Consolidated net income increased 76% year over year to $778.2 million, or $1.14 per diluted share. On a pro forma basis, eBay reported a 68% increase in consolidated net income year over year to $829.5 million, or $1.21 per diluted share.
In addition, eBay's Board of Directors has approved a two-for-one split of all outstanding shares of the company's common stock, payable February 16, 2005 to stockholders of record on January 31, 2005. These results have not been adjusted to reflect this stock split.

Consolidated Financial and Operating Summary
eBay reported record consolidated net revenues of $935.8 million in Q4-04, representing a 44% year-over-year increase. On a year-over-year basis, consolidated net revenues reflected a foreign currency translation benefit in Q4-04 of approximately $34.5 million. On a sequential basis, consolidated net revenues reflected a foreign currency translation benefit in Q4-04 of approximately $19.7 million.
Gross profit was $759.4 million, or 81% of net revenues, which was down slightly from the 82% level reported in Q4-03. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to the relative growth of the lower-margin Payments segment.
Sales and marketing expenses totaled $268.9 million, or 29% of net revenues, which was up from the 27% reported in Q4-03. The year-over-year increase as a percentage of net revenues primarily reflects global increases in on-line marketing and in international off-line marketing.
Product development expenses totaled $64.6 million, or 7% of net revenues, which was consistent with the percentage reported in Q4-03. Total product development expenses in Q4-04 do not include $10.6 million of required cost capitalization for major site and other product development efforts.
General and administrative costs totaled $116.3 million, or 12% of net revenues, down from the 15% of net revenues reported in Q4-03. While general and administrative costs decreased as a percentage of net revenues, the absolute dollars increased, primarily as a result of increases in headcount.
Income from operations totaled $284.7 million during Q4-04, a 40% increase over the $203.1 million reported in Q4-03. On a pro forma basis, income from operations totaled $313.9 million, a 44% increase over the $218.5 million reported in Q4-03. Included in both the GAAP and pro forma Q4-04 consolidated income from operations was a $12.4 million year-over-year net benefit from changes in foreign exchange rates. On a sequential basis, both the GAAP and pro forma consolidated income from operations reflected a foreign currency translation benefit in Q4-04 of approximately $5.0 million.
Interest and other income, net, totaled $18.8 million in Q4-04, up from the $11.4 million reported in Q4-03. The increase in Q4-04 was primarily the result of increased interest income earned on larger cash, cash equivalents, and investment balances, partially offset by foreign exchange losses.
The GAAP and pro forma effective tax rate for Q4-04 was 32%, consistent with the GAAP effective tax rate for Q4-03, and an increase from the pro forma effective tax rate of 30% for Q4-03. The higher pro forma effective tax rate for Q4-04, as compared to Q4-03, reflects an increase in our non-deductible expenses related primarily to international acquisitions.
At the end of Q4-04, the company had nearly $3.4 billion in aggregate cash and investments and more than $7.9 billion in total assets.
 
eBay Announces Q4-04 Earnings (cont.)
The company reported $381.2 million in operating cash flows and $82.9 million of capital expenditures in Q4-04, resulting in free cash flows of $298.3 million.

The guidance does not include the impact of any other potential acquisitions. This updated guidance also includes the effect of a significantly increased investment pool for the company's 2005 strategic initiatives.

The updated guidance now includes the impact of the amortization of acquired intangible assets in relation to our acquisition of the outstanding common stock of Marktplaats.nl and the potential acquisitions of Rent.com and Kurant Corporation. The estimated earnings per diluted share does not include the impact of expensing stock options upon the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 123 "Share-Based Payment."
GAAP Diluted EPS
 eBay now estimates pro forma earnings per diluted share for the full year 2005 to fall in the range of $1.48 to $1.52. From a quarterly perspective, eBay estimates pro forma earnings per diluted share to fall in the range of $0.34 to $0.35 in Q1-05, $0.34 to $0.35 in Q2-05, $0.35 to $0.36 in Q3-05, and $0.43 to $0.44 in Q4-05.
Pro Forma Diluted EPS
 eBay expects its capital expenditures to total approximately $525 million for the full year 2005, which is 12% of eBay's guidance for net revenues. Excluding the one time payment from restricted cash of approximately $126 million in relation to the repayment of our San Jose corporate headquarters lease obligation in Q1-05, eBay expects its capital expenditures to total approximately $400 million for the full year 2005, which is 9% of eBay's guidance for net revenues.
Capital Expenditures
In addition, eBay's Board of Directors has approved a two-for-one split of all outstanding shares of the company's common stock, payable February 16, 2005 to stockholders of record on January 31, 2005. The guidance has not been updated to reflect the impact of this stock split.
