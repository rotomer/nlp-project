Item 8.01. Other Events.
On December 16, 2004, eBay Inc. announced that it had agreed to acquire Rent.com, an Internet listing website in the apartment and rental housing industry, for total consideration of approximately $415 million plus acquisition costs, net of Rent.coms cash on hand, with the consideration to be payable in approximately $30 million in cash and the remainder in eBay common stock. On February 7, 2005, eBay and Rent.com amended the acquisition agreement to change the form of consideration from a combination of stock and cash to an all-cash transaction. The total value of the consideration to be payable by eBay remains unchanged. Under the amended agreement, eBay will acquire Rent.com for approximately $415 million in cash plus acquisition costs, net of Rent.com's cash on hand. Subject to the approval of Rent.coms stockholders and the satisfaction of other closing conditions, eBay now expects the acquisition to close by the end of February 2005.
