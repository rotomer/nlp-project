Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     The information in this report is being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
     On April 20, 2005, eBay Inc. announced its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2005. A copy of eBay's press release announcing its financial results and certain other information is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
     The attached press release contains non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of Regulation G, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, eBay uses non-GAAP measures of gross profit, operating income, net income, earnings per share, cash flows and its effective tax rate, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance the investors' overall understanding of our current financial performance and our prospects for the future. Specifically, we believe the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses that may not be indicative of our core operating results. In addition, because we have historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, we believe the inclusion of non-GAAP numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but are not a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. Consistent with our historical practice, the non-GAAP measures included in the attached press release have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure.
     The attached press release also contains forward-looking statements relating to eBay's performance during the remainder of fiscal year 2005. A more thorough discussion of certain factors which may affect eBay's operating results is included under the captions "Risk Factors That May Affect Results of Operations and Financial Condition" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in eBay's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004. Additional information will be included under those captions in eBay's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2005, which will be filed with the SEC on or about April 27, 2005.

Exhibit 99.1
San Jose, CA, April 20, 2005 - eBay Inc. (Nasdaq: EBAY; www.ebay.com), the World's Online Marketplace, reported financial results for its quarter ended March 31, 2005.
eBay reported record consolidated Q1-05 net revenues of $1.032 billion, up 36% year over year; operating income of $335.6 million, up 26% year over year, representing a 33% operating margin; and pro forma operating income of $367.4 million, up 28% year over year, representing a 36% pro forma operating margin.
Consolidated net income in Q1-05 was $256.3 million, or $0.19 per diluted share. eBay's pro forma consolidated net income, excluding certain items, was $275.5 million, or $0.20 per diluted share.
These results exceeded the high end of the company's guidance of $1.030 billion for net revenues, $0.17 for earnings per diluted share, and $0.18 for pro forma earnings per diluted share.

Consolidated Financial and Operating Summary
eBay reported record consolidated net revenues of $1.032 billion in Q1-05, representing a 36% year-over-year increase. On a year-over-year basis, consolidated net revenues reflected a foreign currency translation benefit in Q1-05 of approximately $24.9 million. On a sequential basis, consolidated net revenues reflected a foreign currency translation benefit in Q1-05 of approximately $10.6 million.
Gross profit was $845.4 million, or 82% of net revenues, consistent with the percentage reported in Q1-04, and higher than the 81% reported in Q4-04. The sequential percentage increase was primarily a result of an increase in the Payments segment gross margin.
Sales and marketing expenses totaled $271.3 million, or 26% of net revenues, up from the 25% reported in Q1-04, but down from the 29% reported in Q4-04. The year-over-year percentage increase was primarily a result of international expansion and industry-wide increases in Internet marketing rates, which was partially offset by marketing efficiencies. The sequential percentage decrease was primarily the result of various efficiencies achieved in our marketing campaigns during Q1-05.
Product development expenses totaled $73.8 million, or 7% of net revenues, consistent with the percentage reported in Q1-04 and in Q4-04.
General and administrative costs totaled $136.4 million, or 13% of net revenues, up from the 12% of net revenues reported in both Q1-04 and Q4-04. The year-over-year percentage increase was primarily a result of increases in headcount in our trust and safety and corporate functions. The sequential percentage increase was primarily the result of higher performance-based compensation in Q1-05.
Income from operations totaled $335.6 million during Q1-05, a 26% increase over the $266.7 million reported in Q1-04. On a pro forma basis, income from operations totaled $367.4 million, a 28% increase over the $286.4 million reported in Q1-04. Included in both the GAAP and pro forma Q1-05 consolidated income from operations was a $12.8 million year-over-year net benefit from changes in foreign exchange rates. On a sequential basis, both the GAAP and pro forma consolidated income from operations reflected a foreign currency translation benefit in Q1-05 of approximately $6.8 million.
Interest and other income, net, totaled $22.4 million in Q1-05, down from the $23.5 million reported in Q1-04. Interest and other income, net, in Q1-04 included one-time gains of approximately $11.2 million relating to certain contract amendments. Without these gains, interest and other income, net, would have shown an increase in Q1-05 from Q1-04 of approximately $10.1 million which was primarily the result of increased interest income earned on larger cash, cash equivalents, and investment balances.
The GAAP effective tax rate for Q1-05 was 28%, down from the GAAP effective tax rate of 30% for Q1-04. The pro forma effective tax rate for Q1-05 was 29%, down from the pro forma effective tax rate of 31% for Q1-

04. The lower GAAP and pro forma effective tax rates for Q1-05, as compared to Q1-04, reflects an increased profit contribution from the company's international operations.
During Q1-05, operating cash flow of $495.4 million and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $179.3 million were used to fund the purchase of property and equipment of $79.6 million, the payment of a lease obligation for our headquarters facility of $126.4 million, the acquisition of businesses of $445.0 million and additional net investment purchases of $122.4 million. The company's cash and investments totaled over $3.4 billion at the end of Q1-05.
