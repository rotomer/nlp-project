Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     The information in this report is being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
     On July 20, 2005, eBay Inc. announced its financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2005. A copy of eBay's press release announcing its financial results and certain other information is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
     The attached press release contains non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of Regulation G, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, eBay uses non-GAAP measures of gross profit, operating income, net income, earnings per share, cash flows and its effective tax rate, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance the investors' overall understanding of our current financial performance and our prospects for the future. Specifically, we believe the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses that may not be indicative of our core operating results. In addition, because we have historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, we believe the inclusion of non-GAAP numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but are not a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. Consistent with our historical practice, the non-GAAP measures included in the attached press release have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure.
     The attached press release also contains forward-looking statements relating to eBay's performance during the remainder of fiscal year 2005. A more thorough discussion of certain factors which may affect eBay's operating results is included under the captions "Risk Factors That May Affect Results of Operations and Financial Condition" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in eBay's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2005. Additional information will be included under those captions in eBay's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2005, which will be filed with the SEC during the week of July 25, 2005.

Consolidated Financial and Operating Summary
eBay reported record consolidated net revenues of $1.086 billion in Q2-05, representing a 40% year-over-year increase. On a year-over-year basis, consolidated net revenues reflected a foreign currency translation benefit in Q2-05 of approximately $24.7 million. On a sequential basis, consolidated net revenues were negatively impacted by foreign currency translation in Q2-05 by approximately $17.3 million.
Gross profit was $894.5 million, or 82% of net revenues, higher than the 81% reported in Q2-04. The percentage increase was primarily the result of an increase in our Payments segment gross margin.
Sales and marketing expenses totaled $287.1 million, or 26% of net revenues, up from the 24% reported in Q2-04. The percentage increase was primarily the result of international expansion and industry-wide increases in Internet marketing rates, partially offset by marketing efficiencies. Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues in Q2-05 was consistent with Q1-05.
Product development expenses totaled $71.6 million, or 7% of net revenues, down from the 8% reported in Q2-04.
General and administrative costs totaled $129.3 million, or 12% of net revenues, down from the 13% of net revenues reported in Q2-04. The percentage decrease was primarily the result of a lower transaction loss rate in our Payments segment due to improved transaction loss detection and related loss prevention programs.
 
 
eBay Announces Q2-05 Earnings (cont.)
Income from operations totaled $379.0 million during Q2-05, a 49% increase over the $253.9 million reported in Q2-04. On a pro forma basis, income from operations totaled $406.4 million, a 47% increase over the $275.6 million reported in Q2-04. Included in both the GAAP and pro forma Q2-05 consolidated income from operations was a $12.5 million year-over-year net benefit from changes in foreign exchange rates. On a sequential basis, both the GAAP and pro forma consolidated income from operations were negatively impacted by foreign currency translation in Q2-05 by approximately $10.1 million.
Interest and other income, net, totaled $32.5 million in Q2-05, up from the $22.4 million reported in Q2-04. The increase was primarily the result of increased interest income earned on larger cash, cash equivalents, and investment balances.
The GAAP effective tax rate for Q2-05 was 29%, a decrease from the GAAP effective tax rate of 30% for Q2-04, and an increase from the 28% for Q1-05. The pro forma effective tax rate for Q2-05 was 30%, a decrease from the pro forma effective tax rate of 31% for Q2-04, and an increase from the 29% for Q1-05. The lower GAAP and pro forma effective tax rates for Q2-05, as compared to Q2-04, and the higher sequential GAAP and pro forma effective tax rates for Q2-05 reflect changes in the company's geographic business mix.
The company reported $496.6 million in operating cash flows and $90.5 million of capital expenditures in Q2-05, resulting in free cash flows of $406.1 million. The company's cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled more than $3.8 billion at the end of Q2-05.
Business Outlook

The updated guidance is based on an assumed weighted average exchange rate of US $1.20 per Euro, as compared to the prior guidance, which assumed a weighted average exchange rate of US $1.30 per Euro. The guidance does not include the impact of the completion of the acquisition of Shopping.com or any other potential acquisitions.

Capital Expenditures  eBay continues to expect its capital expenditures to be in the range of $340 million to $400 million for the full year 2005, which amount to approximately 8% to 9%, respectively, of eBay's guidance for net revenues.

Quarterly Conference Call
eBay will host a conference call to discuss second quarter results at 2 pm Pacific Time today.

In addition, an archive of the webcast will be accessible through the same link.
Non-GAAP Measures
To supplement the company's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, eBay uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include pro forma net income, pro forma earnings per diluted share, pro forma operating margin, and free cash flows. These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of the company's current financial performance and the company's prospects for the future. Specifically, the company believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses that may not be indicative of its core operating results. In addition, because eBay has historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, the company believes the inclusion of non-GAAP measures provides consistency in the company's financial reporting. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. Reconciliation of all non-GAAP measures included in this press release, to the nearest GAAP measure, can be found in the financial tables included in this press release.
