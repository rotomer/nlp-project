Item 3.02 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
On October 10, 2005, eBay Inc. ("eBay"), PayPal, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of eBay ("PayPal"), PayPal International Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of PayPal ("PayPal International"), and VeriSign, Inc. ("VeriSign") entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement pursuant to which PayPal and PayPal International agreed to acquire certain assets relating to VeriSign's payment gateway business for approximately $370 million. Pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, subject to certain limitations, eBay, in its sole discretion, may elect to pay all or any portion of the consideration payable to VeriSign in shares of eBay common stock, which shares would be valued based on the average of the closing sale price of eBay common stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market for the 10 trading day period ending immediately prior to (and excluding) the trading day immediately before the closing date of the transaction.
In the event that eBay elects to use shares of eBay common stock to pay any portion of the consideration payable to VeriSign in connection with the transaction, such shares would be issued to VeriSign in reliance upon the exemption from the registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), pursuant to Regulation D thereunder. eBay will rely upon, among other things, representations, warranties, certifications and agreements of VeriSign, including its agreement with respect to restrictions on resale, in support of the satisfaction of the conditions contained in Regulation D under the Securities Act.
