Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
On October 14, 2005, eBay Inc. ("eBay") completed its previously announced acquisition of the outstanding securities of Skype Technologies S.A., a limited company (socit anonyme) registered under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg ("Skype"), pursuant to the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement dated September 11, 2005 (the "Purchase Agreement") entered into among eBay, Skype and the shareholders and warrantholders of Skype. Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, Skype will become an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of eBay.
In exchange for the share capital and warrants of Skype, eBay made an initial payment to the sellers of such share capital and warrants consisting of approximately 2.1 billion, or approximately $2.6 billion, which was comprised of approximately $1.3 billion in cash and the value of approximately 32.8 million shares of eBay common stock, plus potential earn out payments tied to the achievement of certain performance targets prior to June 30, 2009. The maximum amount potentially payable under the performance-based earn out is approximately 1.1 billion, or approximately $1.3 billion, and would be payable in cash or eBay stock, at eBay's discretion, with expected payment dates in 2008 and/or 2009. All dollar amounts herein are based on the Euro-Dollar exchange rate as of October 12, 2005, as compared with the Euro-Dollar exchange rate as of September 9, 2005 used for purposes of calculating the amounts set forth in eBay's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on September 15, 2005 (the "Original Form 8-K"). In addition, since the filing of the Original Form 8-K, certain options to acquire ordinary shares of Skype have been exercised and the holders of the shares issuable upon exercise of the options have made either a "Fixed Consideration Election" or an "Earn Out Election" as described below.
Skype shareholders and warrantholders were offered the choice between several consideration alternatives for their shares and warrants. Shareholders and warrantholders representing approximately 42% of the Skype shares and warrants chose to receive a single payment in cash and eBay stock at the closing of the acquisition (the "Fixed Consideration Election"). Shareholders and warrantholders representing the remaining 58% of the Skype shares and warrants chose to receive a reduced up-front payment in cash and eBay stock at the closing of the acquisition plus potential future earn-out payments which are based on performance-based targets for active users, gross profit and revenue (the "Earn Out Election").
The terms and conditions of the earn out payments are set forth in an Earn Out Agreement entered into concurrently with the Purchase Agreement by eBay, Skype and the sellers of the share capital and warrants of Skype who elected to receive the earn out payments. The earn out payments are contingent upon Skype achieving: (a) a net revenue and gross margin-based target; (b) a gross profit-based target; and (c) a target based on the number of active users of Skype's communication products. Base earn out payments of up to an aggregate of approximately 877 million, or approximately $1.05 billion, weighted equally among the three targets, would be payable if the targets are achieved over any four-quarter period commencing on January 1, 2006 through June 30, 2009. Additional bonus earn out payments of up to an aggregate of approximately 292 million, or approximately $351 million, weighted equally among the three targets, would be payable if Skype exceeds the targets during calendar year 2008. The Earn Out Agreement also provides that certain persons who were officers and directors of Skype prior to the closing of the transaction will continue to be officers and directors of Skype following the closing of the transaction.
The eBay stock to be issued in connection with the acquisition will be subject to certain contractual and other restrictions on resale. Seventy-five percent of the shares of eBay stock to be issued to persons who made the Fixed Consideration Election that are not otherwise deposited into escrow will be subject to contractual restrictions on transfer that will lapse with respect to one-third of such shares on each of the 180th, 360th and 540th day following the closing of the acquisition. All of the shares of eBay stock to be issued to persons who made the Earn Out Election that are included in the up-front payment but are not otherwise deposited into escrow will be subject to contractual restrictions on transfer that will lapse with respect to twenty-five percent of such shares on each of the 180th, 360th, 540th and 720th day following the closing of the acquisition. eBay and the sellers of the share capital and warrants of Skype have entered into a Registration Rights Agreement requiring eBay to file a registration statement on Form S-3 covering the resale of such eBay stock within 75 days following the closing of the acquisition.
In addition to the foregoing, eBay agreed to assume the options to acquire ordinary shares of Skype outstanding as of the closing of the transaction (the "Skype Options") and convert them into options to acquire approximately 1.9 million shares of eBay stock (the "eBay Options") pursuant the terms of Option Assumption Agreements or EMI Rollover Agreements entered into between eBay and the holders of options to acquire ordinary shares of Skype in connection with the closing of the transaction.
The foregoing description of the transactions consummated pursuant to the Purchase Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Purchase Agreement, the Earn Out Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement, which are filed as Exhibits 2.1, 2.2 and 10.1, respectively, hereto and are incorporated herein by reference, and the Option Assumption Agreements and EMI Rollover Agreements, forms of which are filed as Exhibits 2.3 and 2.4, respectively, hereto and are incorporated herein by reference.
Item 3.02 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
The disclosure set forth in Item 2.01 above is hereby incorporated herein by reference. The eBay stock issued to the sellers of the share capital and warrants of Skype in connection with the Purchase Agreement, as well as the eBay Options into which the Skype Options were converted or exchanged pursuant to the terms of the Option Assumption Agreements or EMI Rollover Agreements, were issued in reliance upon the exemptions from the registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
 
"Securities Act"), pursuant to Section 4(2) thereof and Regulation D and Regulation S thereunder. eBay relied upon representations, warranties, certifications and agreements of the sellers of the share capital and warrants of Skype and the holders of Skype Options, including their agreement with respect to restrictions on resale, in support of the satisfaction of the conditions contained in Section 4(2) of the Securities Act or Regulation D or Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Exhibit 99.1
eBay (Nasdaq: EBAY; www.ebay.com) today completed its previously announced acquisition of Skype, the global Internet communications company.
San Jose, Calif., October 14, 2005 
In accordance with the terms of the acquisition agreement as announced on September 12, 2005, eBay acquired all of the outstanding shares of privately-held Skype for a total up-front consideration of approximately 2.1 billion, or approximately $2.5 billion, plus potential performance-based consideration. The up-front consideration is comprised of approximately $1.3 billion in cash and the value of 32.8 million shares of eBay stock, which are subject to certain restrictions on resale.
The maximum amount potentially payable under the performance-based earn-out is approximately 1.2 billion, or approximately $1.4 billion, and would be payable in cash or eBay stock, at eBay's discretion, with expected payment to occur in 2008 and/or 2009. Skype shareholders were offered the choice between several consideration options for their shares. Shareholders representing approximately 42% of the Skype shares ultimately chose to receive a single payment in cash and eBay stock at the close of the transaction. Shareholders representing the remaining approximate 58% of the Skype shares chose to receive a reduced up-front payment in cash and eBay stock at the close plus potential future earn-out payments which are based on performance-based goals for active users, gross profit and revenue.
The above-mentioned dollar amounts are approximate, based on an October 12, 2005 exchange rate of 1 to $1.20.
As previously indicated, eBay expects the acquisition to be dilutive to its Q4-05 pro forma and GAAP earnings per share by $0.01 and $0.04 respectively. For the full year 2006, eBay expects the transaction to be dilutive to pro forma and GAAP earnings per share by $0.04 and $0.12 respectively, with breakeven on a pro forma basis expected in the fourth quarter of 2006.
Pro forma earnings per share represents GAAP earnings per share adjusted to exclude certain items, primarily stock based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangibles and income taxes related to these items.
Founded in 1995, eBay pioneers communities built on commerce, sustained by trust, and inspired by opportunity. eBay enables ecommerce on a local, national and international basis with an array of websites  including the eBay Marketplace, PayPal, Kijiji, Rent.com and Shopping.com  that bring together millions of buyers and sellers every day.

This announcement contains forward-looking statements regarding Skype and the expected impact of the acquisition of Skype on eBay's financial results. Those statements involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results could differ materially from those discussed. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, the reaction of the users of Skype's services, the future growth of Skype's user base and public acceptance of Internet voice communication services, rapid technological changes in the Internet voice communications sector, the reaction of competitors to the transaction, global developments in the regulation of Internet voice communication services including those provided by Skype, the possibility that integration of Skype's offerings following the transaction may be more difficult than expected, and the possibility that entry by Skype and eBay into potential new lines of business will not be successful. More information about potential factors which could affect eBay's business and financial results is included in eBay's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004, the company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K.
