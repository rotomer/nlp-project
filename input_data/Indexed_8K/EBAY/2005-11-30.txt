Explanatory Note
This Form 8-K/A is being filed to amend Item 9.01 of the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by eBay Inc. on October 18, 2005. This amendment provides the audited historical financial statements of the businesses acquired as required by Item 9.01(a) and the unaudited pro forma financial information required by Item 9.01(b), which financial statements and information were not included in the Form 8-K filed on October 18, 2005.
Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
On October 14, 2005, eBay Inc. ("eBay") completed its previously announced acquisition of the outstanding securities of Skype Technologies S.A., a limited company (socit anonyme) registered under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg ("Skype"), pursuant to the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement dated September 11, 2005 (the "Purchase Agreement") entered into among eBay, Skype and the shareholders and warrantholders of Skype. Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, Skype will become an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of eBay.
In exchange for the share capital and warrants of Skype, eBay made an initial payment to the sellers of such share capital and warrants consisting of approximately 2.1 billion, or approximately $2.6 billion, which was comprised of approximately $1.3 billion in cash and approximately 32.8 million shares of eBay common stock with a value of approximately $1.3 billion. The sellers have the potential to receive earn out payments tied to the achievement of certain performance targets prior to June 30, 2009. The maximum amount potentially payable under the performance-based earn out is approximately 1.1 billion, or approximately $1.4 billion, and would be payable in cash or eBay stock, at eBay's discretion, with the expected payment dates for any potential payments in 2008 and/or 2009. All dollar amounts herein are based on the Euro-Dollar exchange rate as of October 12, 2005, as compared with the Euro-Dollar exchange rate as of September 9, 2005 used for purposes of calculating the amounts set forth in eBay's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on September 15, 2005 (the "Original Form 8-K"). The fair value of the stock consideration issued has, however, been based on the average closing price of our common stock surrounding the acquisition announcement date of September 12, 2005. In addition, since the filing of the Original Form 8-K, certain options to acquire ordinary shares of Skype have been exercised and the holders of the shares issuable upon exercise of the options have made either a "Fixed Consideration Election" or an "Earn Out Election" as described below.
Skype shareholders and warrantholders were offered the choice between several consideration alternatives for their shares and warrants. Shareholders and warrantholders representing approximately 42% of the Skype shares and warrants chose to receive a single payment in cash and eBay stock at the closing of the acquisition (the "Fixed Consideration Election"). Shareholders and warrantholders representing the remaining 58% of the Skype shares and warrants chose to receive a reduced up-front payment in cash and eBay stock at the closing of the acquisition in return for potential future earn-out payments which are based on performance-based targets for active users, gross profit and net revenue (the "Earn Out Election").
The terms and conditions of the earn out payments are set forth in an Earn Out Agreement entered into concurrently with the Purchase Agreement by eBay, Skype and the sellers of the share capital and warrants of Skype who elected to receive the earn out payments. The earn out payments are contingent upon Skype achieving: (a) a net revenue and gross margin-based target; (b) a gross profit-based target; and (c) a target based on the number of active users of Skype's communication products. Base earn out payments of up to an aggregate of approximately 877 million, or approximately $1.05 billion, weighted equally among the three targets, would be payable if the targets are achieved over any four-quarter period commencing on January 1, 2006 through June 30, 2009. Additional bonus earn out payments of up to an aggregate of approximately 292 million, or approximately $351 million, weighted equally among the three targets, would be payable if Skype exceeds the targets during calendar year 2008. The Earn Out Agreement also provides that certain persons who were officers and directors of Skype prior to the closing of the transaction will continue to be officers and directors of Skype following the closing of the transaction. However, the earn out payments are not tied to continued employment with Skype or eBay.
The eBay stock issued in connection with the acquisition will be subject to certain contractual and other restrictions on resale. Seventy-five percent of the shares of eBay stock to be issued to persons who made the Fixed Consideration Election that are not otherwise deposited into escrow will be subject to contractual restrictions on transfer that will lapse with respect to one-third of such shares on each of the 180th, 360th and 540th day following the closing of the acquisition. All of the shares of eBay stock to be issued to persons who made the Earn Out Election that are included in the up-front payment but are not otherwise deposited into escrow will be subject to contractual restrictions on transfer that will lapse with respect to twenty-five percent of such shares on each of the 180th, 360th, 540th and 720th day following the closing of the acquisition. eBay and the sellers of the share capital and warrants of Skype have entered into a Registration Rights Agreement requiring eBay to file a registration statement on Form S-3 covering the resale of such eBay stock within 75 days following the closing of the acquisition.
 
In addition to the foregoing, eBay agreed to assume the options to acquire ordinary shares of Skype outstanding as of the closing of the transaction (the "Skype Options") and convert them into options to acquire approximately 1.9 million shares of eBay stock (the "eBay Options") pursuant the terms of Option Assumption Agreements or EMI Rollover Agreements entered into between eBay and the holders of options to acquire ordinary shares of Skype in connection with the closing of the transaction.
The foregoing description of the transactions consummated pursuant to the Purchase Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Purchase Agreement, the Earn Out Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement, which are filed as Exhibits 2.1, 2.2 and 10.1, respectively, hereto and are incorporated herein by reference, and the Option Assumption Agreements and EMI Rollover Agreements, forms of which are filed as Exhibits 2.3 and 2.4, respectively, hereto and are incorporated herein by reference.
Item 3.02 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.
The disclosure set forth in Item 2.01 above is hereby incorporated herein by reference. The eBay stock issued to the sellers of the share capital and warrants of Skype in connection with the Purchase Agreement, as well as the eBay Options into which the Skype Options were converted or exchanged pursuant to the terms of the Option Assumption Agreements or EMI Rollover Agreements, were issued in reliance upon the exemptions from the registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), pursuant to Section 4(2) thereof and Regulation D and Regulation S thereunder. eBay relied upon representations, warranties, certifications and agreements of the sellers of the share capital and warrants of Skype and the holders of Skype Options, including their agreement with respect to restrictions on resale, in support of the satisfaction of the conditions contained in Section 4(2) of the Securities Act or Regulation D or Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Exhibit 99.2
 
 
Report of Independent Auditors
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Skype Technologies S.A.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Skype Technologies S.A. and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations, statements of changes in stockholders' equity and statements of cash flows for each of the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Skype Technologies S.A. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2004 and 2003 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As of December 31, 2004 and 2003 (expressed in USD)
NOTE 1  ORGANIZATION, NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND HISTORY
Skype Technologies S.A. (the "Company") and its subsidiaries together form the Skype group (the "Group"). The Company is a limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in Luxembourg. The Company was incorporated on November 3, 2003 and has its registered office at 15, rue Notre-Dame L-2240 Luxembourg.
Skype is a Global peer-to-peer ("P2P") Voice-Over-Internet Protocol ("VoIP") Group which offers consumers free, superior-quality calling worldwide as well as providing the capability to paying customers to connect to telephone networks and benefit from VoIP related paid services. The Group mainly operates in the U.S., Latin America, Europe and Asia.
Until July 2004, the Group devoted substantially all of its efforts to developing new business and, as principal operations had not yet commenced, the Group qualified as a development stage company. Since July 2004, the Group has generated sufficient revenues to no longer qualify as a development stage company.
The current regulatory environment for Voice-Over-Internet Protocol ("VoIP") is uncertain, and is rapidly evolving. In most jurisdictions in which the Group operates, there are little or no regulatory requirements for providing the Group's VoIP related services, although many jurisdictions are contemplating regulating VoIP services, and in some jurisdictions there are proposed regulations being actively considered. Some of those proposed regulations, and the interpretation of them, could impose obligations on VoIP services that would place additional obligations on the Group or its suppliers, and may inhibit the provision of certain VoIP services or combination of services in some jurisdictions for some period of time. The Group believes that any such regulations would apply equally to all VoIP providers, and thus would not place the Group at a competitive disadvantage, although in some cases it could be more difficult for the Group to implement solutions to regulatory changes due to its use of peer-to-peer technology.
It is not possible to provide any assurance about the Group's ability to comply with future regulatory changes; however, the Group is actively monitoring the regulatory process in many markets and believes that the regulatory environment will evolve in a manner that recognizes the significant benefits and practical realities of utilizing the full capabilities of the internet for voice communication and related services. Consequently, the Group believes that, although new regulations may impose additional obligations on VoIP providers, such regulations will not fundamentally impair the provision of VoIP services over the longer term.

NOTE 1  ORGANIZATION, NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND HISTORY  CONTINUED
Reorganization of companies under common control
On November 19, 2003, the controlling stockholder of the Group sold its 100% ownership in Skyper Ltd to the Company for a consideration of 31,000 (approximately $37,000). Skyper Ltd is a company incorporated in the Bahamas on October 22, 2002. This transaction represents a reorganization of entities under common control and has been accounted for in a manner similar to a pooling-of-interests for the periods presented. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements of the Group have been presented using historical carrying costs of Skyper Ltd.
NOTE 2  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The consolidated financial statements of the Group are presented in US Dollar ("USD") and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("US GAAP").
a) Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, over which it has the ability to exercise unilateral control.
All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in the consolidation.
b) Use of estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, Management evaluates estimates, including those related to provisions for doubtful accounts, legal contingencies, accruals and income taxes. Management based its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

NOTE 2  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  CONTINUED
c) Cash equivalents
Highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased are considered to be cash equivalents.
d) Trade accounts receivable
Trade accounts receivable are carried at original invoice amount less allowance made for doubtful accounts of these receivables. An allowance for doubtful accounts for trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, no allowance for doubtful accounts has been recorded.
e) Fixed assets
Fixed assets are stated at cost, net of depreciation. All repairs and maintenance expenditures are expensed as incurred.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives are as follows:
- Furniture, fixtures and office equipment      3 years
- Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the remaining term of the related lease.

NOTE 2  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  CONTINUED
f) Software development costs
Software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed.
The Group develops and continues to enhance its P2P software ("Skype software") which is downloaded by Skype customers in order to use the Group's services. This software is accounted for as software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed in accordance with FASB issued Statement No. 86, "". The Group expenses the costs of research, including predevelopment efforts prior to establishing technological feasibility of the Skype software, and costs incurred for training and maintenance. Software development costs are capitalized when technological feasibility has been established and anticipated future revenues assure recovery of the capitalized amounts. Capitalization stops when the product is available for general release to customers. Because of the short time period between technological feasibility and product release, and the insignificant amount of costs incurred during such period, the Group has not capitalized any software development costs to date.
Accounting for the costs of computer softwares to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed
Software developed for internal use
The Group is developing its operating systems to support its paid services. The Group accounts for these systems as software developed for internal use, in accordance with SOP 98-1, "". The Group expenses the costs related to preliminary project stage. Capitalization of costs begins when the preliminary project stage is completed and management authorizes and commits to funding a computer software project and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended.
Accounting for costs of computer softwares developed or obtained for internal use
Costs then capitalized include external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal-use computer software and direct payroll and payroll-related costs.
Because of the insignificance of costs that meet criteria for capitalization and incurred to develop various software, including the operating system, the Group has not capitalized any software development costs to date.

g) Impairment of long-lived assets
The recoverability of the Group's long-lived assets is subject to the future performance of the Group's operations and the evolution of the business in accordance with its plans. In evaluating the recoverability of its assets, the value and future benefits of the Group's operations are periodically reviewed by Management based on technological, regulatory and market conditions. In accordance with SFAS 144, "", long-lived assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by that asset, an impairment loss is measured based on the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying amount of the asset. Management's estimates of fair value are based on market prices of similar assets to the extent available under the circumstances and the result of valuation techniques; these include net present values of estimated future cash flows and valuations based on market transactions in similar circumstances. For new product launches where no comparable market information is available, management bases its view on recoverability primarily on cash flow forecasts. In conjunction with the evaluation of a possible impairment of the long-lived assets' carrying value, the Group also evaluates the appropriateness of the estimated useful lives of the long-lived assets. There were no impairment losses recorded for 2004 and 2003.
Accounting for the impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
h) Revenue recognition
The Group earns revenues primarily from prepaid subscriber services and to a lesser extent, fees earned from the offering of Skype's products by third-parties.
The Group recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the fees are fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured.
As of December 31, 2004, the majority of the Group's revenues is derived from "Skype-Out" services which consist of calls made from the internet to the telephone network for a fee. Such fees which are prepaid are deferred and recorded as "Deferred revenue" until recognized as revenues at the time of customer usage. Prepaid fees are contractually valid for six months after activation and unused credits after that period are recognized as revenues (breakage). Discounts and incentives are accounted for as a reduction of revenues.
For services which are covered by an upfront yearly or quarterly subscription fee, recognition of revenue is deferred as "Deferred revenue" and recognized ratably over the subscription period.
 
Skype Technologies S.A. and Subsidiaries
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) As of December 31, 2004 and 2003 (expressed in USD)
NOTE 2  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  CONTINUED
In addition to the direct relationship that the Group has with the majority of its subscribers, the Group also has agreements with companies whereby those companies' customers are offered a co-branded subscription service. When the agreement provides that the Group is the party responsible for providing the service and has control over the fees charged to customers, the Group records the gross amount billed as revenue. When the agreement provides that Skype is not the primary obligor to provide such co-branded services, Skype records the net amount received from those companies as revenue, which is in accordance with EITF 99-19, "".
Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent
In 2004, the Group started to market bundled services. These transactions contain multiple elements and the Group applies EITF 00-21, "to these arrangements. The various elements of the arrangement are separable and each element is recognized separately in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin, No. 104, . In accounting for multiple deliverables, management's judgment is necessary when identifying the nature of deliverables in an arrangement as well as measuring and allocating fair value to the multiple deliverables.
Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables"
Revenue Recognition
The Group offers promotional vouchers to consumers to subscribe for a fixed amount to enable them to try Skype-Out on a free trial basis. The associated incremental costs thereon are provided for as a liability and recorded as selling expenses in the statement of operations.
i) Cost of sales
Cost of sales consists principally of billing and collection costs, hosting cost, termination fees for calls and the direct costs of rendering services.
Payment processing costs are expensed as incurred and included under the caption "cost of sales."
j) Income taxes
The Group companies are subject to taxation in the countries in which they operate. Corporate tax, including deferred taxation where appropriate, is applied at the applicable current rates on their taxable profits. Deferred income taxes are determined using the liability method whereby the future expected consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements are recognized as deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to a valuation allowance to reduce the balance to an amount, which is more likely than not to be realized.

k) Leases
Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
l) Foreign currency translation
The reporting currency of the Group is the USD (US$ or $). The functional currency of the Group and most of its subsidiaries is the Euro ("EUR").
In the financial statements of Group companies, transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are recorded in the functional currency at the actual exchange rate existing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at year-end are reported at the exchange rates prevailing at year-end. Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the consolidated statements of operations.
For the purpose of consolidating subsidiaries that report in currencies other than the USD, assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates on the respective balance sheet dates. Income and expense items are translated using the average rates of exchange for the periods involved. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders' equity.
The following is a table of the principal currency translation rates to the USD:
m) Concentration of credit risk
Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Group to concentrations of credit risk, are primarily cash and cash equivalents, deposits, and accounts receivable. The counter parties to the agreements relating to the Group's cash and cash equivalents and deposits are well established financial institutions. Accordingly, management does not believe there is a significant risk of non-performance by these counter parties. As of December 31, 2004, Group's trade accounts receivable mainly comprises receivables from payment processing suppliers. The Group estimates and records, if appropriate, an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectibility of all trade accounts receivable.

NOTE 2  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  CONTINUED
n) Financial Risk Management
The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including price, fraud, currency exchange rates and liquidity risks. The Group's overall risk management approach considers the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimize potential adverse effects on the Group's financial performance.
Price risk
The Group seeks to maintain multiple suppliers and terms with suppliers and customers that allow for pricing adjustments within reasonable time delays should market conditions change significantly.
Fraud risk
The Group is exposed to fraudulent credit card usage over the internet and is subject to the charge-back costs and potential fines which credit card companies could impose in such circumstances. The Group manages fraud risks via customer and credit card verification processes.
Currency exchange rates risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to currency exchange rates risk from future commercial transactions, recognized assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations. The Group seeks to reduce its foreign currency exposure through a policy of matching, as far as possible, assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.
Liquidity risk
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient funding. Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, the Group aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping adequate cash balances available.
o) Financial assets and liabilities
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate carrying value, principally because of the short maturity of these items. The Group does not have long term liabilities and financing.

NOTE 7  ACCRUED LIABILITIES
Credit card fine provision

The Group has recorded a provision of $0.7 million as of December 31, 2004, in respect of this risk which represents the Group's best estimate of the probable risk based on information available.
Chargeback provision
The chargeback provision relates to costs charged by financial institutions in relation with fraudulent credit card usage over the internet that occurred in 2004.

NOTE 8  STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
a) Common stock, preferred stocks and additional paid-in capital
On November 3, 2003, the Company was incorporated with a share capital of 31,000 ($35,514) consisting of 24,800 registered ordinary shares, at a par value of 1.25 ($1.43) each.
At the time of the reorganization of the entities under common control on November 19, 2003 (refer to note 1), Skyper Ltd had outstanding Bridge Loan Financing Agreements (the "Agreements") and Promissory Notes (the "Notes") with third party financial investors for an accumulated nominal value of $716,325 and accrued interest of 15,208 ($18,090) as of November 20, 2003 (interest accruing at 7% per year compounded on a monthly basis). The Agreements and Notes were unsecured convertible loans being convertible into series A-1 and A-2 preferred stocks at agreed conversion rates. With the exception of one Agreement, the conversion rate equals to the subscription price agreed with any third party financial investors at a subsequent round of financing, unless the pre-money valuation exceeded an agreed-upon threshold, upon which the investor is entitled to receive a specified percentage of the Company's shares as of the time of the financing. One Agreement with a nominal value of 100,000 is convertible at a conversion rate which is in the money at the issuance date. This embedded beneficial conversion feature has been accounted for in accordance with EITF 98-5, "Accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion feature or contingently adjustable conversion ratios". The intrinsic value of the embedded conversion feature exceeds the total amount of the proceeds of the convertible securities and, accordingly, the total proceeds on the issuance of the convertible securities was credited to additional paid-in capital for an amount of 100,000 ($115,810). The debt discount resulting from the allocation of proceeds to the beneficial conversion feature has been amortized over the period from the issuance of the Agreement to its conversion on November 20, 2003. The Company has recognized this amortization as interest expense in the statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003. In addition, the Agreements also contained a provision whereby, the investors would be entitled to subscribe for a specified number of warrants for shares indexed to the amount of shares issued on conversion. The warrants would have an exercise price equal to the subscription price agreed with any third party financial investors at subsequent round of financing.
Subsequent to the reorganization, on November 27, 2003, the Bridge Loan Financing was converted into series A-1 preferred stocks, resulting in the issuance of 57,606 shares of Series A-1 preferred stocks, which have been recorded for a total amount of 975,173 ($1,157,260) allocated between share capital for 72,008 ($85,675) and additional paid-in capital for 903,165 ($1,071,585) and the issuance of 18,992 warrants with a right to subscribe to Series A-1 preferred stocks. The warrants were exercisable on issue at an exercise price of 1.25 per share, with an exercise period of five years.

In 2005, the Board of Directors and Stockholders of the Company have approved the implementation of a stock option plan ("the Plan"). Options may be granted by the Board of Directors to employees on a discretionary basis within the limits established by law and the authorizations granted by the general meeting of the shareholders of the Company.
One option entitles the holder to subscribe to one ordinary share in the capital of the Company. The total number of ordinary shares available under the Plan shall not exceed 52,900, unless a new authorization is granted to the Board of Directors by a general meeting of shareholders of the Company. The options are valid for a period of 8 years from the effective grant date as indicated in the option agreement of each beneficiary and vest ratably generally over a 4-year vesting period. The option starts vesting retroactively on the date which the holder starts his employment or relationship with any Group Company. A seniority of one year in the Group is required in any case to acquire options, failing which all vested and unvested options lapse.
The strike price shall be based on a valuation of the ordinary shares of the Company approved by the Board of Directors. Vested and unvested options may be transferred subject to conditions and restrictions. The Plan's rules are completed or amended according to territorial riders taking into account geographically based requirements applicable to specific grants.
Through October 5, 2005 grants for 35,756 options to employees, directors and consultants had been confirmed by the Board. The weighted average strike price of those options amounts to 209.51 ($251.91) per share and of which 13,965 options were vested as of October 5, 2005 (including those still subject to completion of the one year seniority requirement).

NOTE 2  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  CONTINUED
The reporting currency of the Group is the USD (US$ or $). The functional currency of the Group and most of its subsidiaries is the Euro ("EUR").
The accounting policies are consistent with those presented in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2004 and 2003.
Stock Options
Beginning with the stock options granted in May 2005, the Group accounts for stock options and stock-based compensation granted to employees in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 ("APB 25"), "". Under APB 25, no compensation expense is recognized for stock options issued to employees with an exercise price equal to or greater than the fair value of the underlying shares at the grant date. Options issued with an exercise price less than the fair value result in deferred compensation which is recorded within shareholder's equity and amortized to expense over the vesting period.
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
APB 25 does not apply to stock options granted to selected non-employees. Stock options granted to selected non-employees have been accounted for under the fair value model in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 ("SFAS 123"), "" and Issue 96-18 "".

NOTE 4  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
In 2005, the Board of Directors and Shareholders of the Company approved the implementation of a stock option plan (the "Plan"). Options may be granted by the Board of Directors to employees on a discretionary basis within the limits established by the law and the authorizations granted by the general meeting of the shareholders of the Company.
One option entitles the holder to subscribe to one ordinary share in the capital of the Company. The total number of ordinary shares available under the Plan shall not exceed 52,900, unless a new authorization is granted to the Board of Directors by a general meeting of shareholders of the Company. The options are valid for a period of 8 years as of the effective grant date as indicated in the option agreement of each beneficiary and vest ratably generally over a 4-year period. The option starts vesting retroactively on the date which the holder starts his employment or relationship with any Group company. A seniority of one year in the Group is required however to benefit from the option scheme, failing which no options vest.
The strike price shall be based on a valuation of the ordinary shares of the Company approved by the Board of Directors. Vested and unvested options may be transferred subject to conditions and restrictions. The transfer of ordinary shares acquired further to the exercise of unvested options shall be subject to the conditions or restrictions. The Plan's rules are completed or amended according to territorial riders taking into account geographically based requirements applicable to specific grants.
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 ("SFAS 123"), "" provides an alternative to APB 25 in accounting for stock-based compensation issued to employees. SFAS 123 provides for a fair-value-based method of accounting for employee stock options and similar equity instruments. Companies that elect to continue to account for stock-based compensation arrangements under APB 25 are required by SFAS 123 to disclose the pro forma effect on net income/(loss) as if the fair-value-based method proposed by SFAS 123 had been adopted. Skype is accounting for stock-based compensations arrangements under APB 25.
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
Pro forma information regarding net loss is required by SFAS 123 as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock options under the fair value method. The fair value of the Company's options was estimated at the date of grant using the minimum value method, based on the following weighted average assumptions for the period ended June 30, 2005, the Company's first stock options issue being granted in May 2005: risk-free interest rates of 3.2%; expected dividend yield and volatility of zero; and a weighted average expected life for all options of four years.

NOTES TO THE INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED) As of June 30, 2005 and 2004 (expressed in USD)
NOTE 4  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  CONTINUED
Because the determination of the fair value of the Company's options is based on assumptions described above, and because additional option grants are expected to be made in future periods, this pro forma information is not likely to be representative of the pro forma effects on reported net income or loss for future periods.
For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options is amortized to expense over the options' vesting period. The following table illustrates the net loss that would have occurred had the Company accounted for its stock options under the provisions of SFAS 123.
A summary of stock options activity under the plans is as follows:

     The acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141, . Under the purchase method of accounting, the total estimated purchase price, calculated as described in Note 1 to these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, is allocated to the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed of Skype in connection with the acquisition, based on their estimated fair values.

1. Basis of Pro Forma Presentation
     On October 14, 2005, eBay completed the acquisition of Skype Technologies, S.A., a global internet communications company. The total estimated purchase price of approximately $2.6 billion includes cash of $1.3 billion and 32.8 million shares of common stock valued at $1.3 billion, plus potential performance-based payments of up to $1.4 billion. In addition, eBay agreed to assume Skype's stock options outstanding as of the closing date and convert them into options to acquire approximately 1.9 million shares of eBay's common stock.
     The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet at June 30, 2005 is presented to give effect to eBay's acquisition of Skype as if the transaction had been consummated on that date. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet at June 30, 2005 has been prepared by combining the historical unaudited consolidated balance sheet data of eBay and Skype as of June 30, 2005 to give effect to eBay's acquisition of Skype using the purchase method of accounting and apply the assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income of eBay and Skype for the year ended December 31, 2004 and the six-months ended June 30, 2005 are presented as if eBay's acquisition of Skype had been consummated on January 1, 2004. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income of eBay and Skype for the year ended December 31, 2004 and the six-months ended June 30, 2005 have been prepared using the historical consolidated statements of income data of eBay and Skype for the year ended December 31, 2004 and the six-months ended June 30, 2005 and giving effect to eBay's acquisition of Skype using the purchase method of accounting and applying the assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes to these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements.
2. Preliminary Purchase Price
     The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements reflect an estimated purchase price of approximately $2.6 billion, which was comprised of approximately $1.3 billion in cash and the value of approximately 32.8 million shares of eBay common stock. For accounting purposes, the stock portion of the initial consideration is valued at approximately $1.3 billion based on the average closing price of our common stock surrounding the acquisition announcement date of September 12, 2005. The preliminary fair value of the options assumed was determined using the Black-Sholes model. The estimated total purchase price of the proposed Skype acquisition is as follows (in thousands):
     In addition to the initial consideration, the maximum amount potentially payable under the performance-based earn out is approximately 1.1 billion, or approximately $1.4 billion, and is payable in cash or common stock, at eBay's discretion.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements reflect an estimated purchase price of approximately $2.6 billion, which was comprised of approximately $1.3 billion in cash and the value of approximately 32.8 million shares of eBay common stock. For accounting purposes, the stock portion of the initial consideration is valued at approximately $1.3 billion based on the average closing price of our common stock surrounding the acquisition announcement date of September 12, 2005. The preliminary fair value of the options assumed was determined using the Black-Sholes model. The estimated total purchase price of the proposed Skype acquisition is as follows (in thousands):
 
 
In addition to the initial consideration, the maximum amount potentially payable under the performance-based earn out is approximately 1.1 billion, or approximately $1.4 billion, and is payable in cash or common stock, at eBay's discretion.
