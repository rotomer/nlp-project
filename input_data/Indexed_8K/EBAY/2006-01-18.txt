     Results of Operations and Financial Condition
The information in this report is being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), and is not to be incorporated by reference into any filing by eBay Inc. under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, regardless of any general incorporation language contained in such filing.
On January 18, 2006, eBay Inc. announced its financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2005. A copy of eBay's press release announcing its financial results and certain other information is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The attached press release contains non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of Regulation G, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, eBay uses non-GAAP measures of gross profit, operating income, net income, earnings per share, cash flows and its effective tax rate, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance the investors' overall understanding of our current financial performance and our prospects for the future. Specifically, we believe the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses that may not be indicative of our core operating results. In addition, because we have historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, we believe the inclusion of non-GAAP numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but are not a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. Consistent with our historical practice, the non-GAAP measures included in the attached press release have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure.
The attached press release also contains forward-looking statements relating to eBay's performance during fiscal year 2006. A more thorough discussion of certain factors which may affect eBay's operating results is included under the captions "Risk Factors That May Affect Results of Operations and Financial Condition" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in eBay's Annual Report on for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 and Quarterly Report on for the quarter ended September 30, 2005. Additional information will be included under those captions in eBay's Annual Report on for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, which will be filed with the SEC during the first quarter of 2006.

Operating and Free Cash Flows
eBay reported record consolidated net revenues of $1.329 billion in Q4-05 with growth rates accelerating to 42% year over year.

Gross profit was $1.089 billion in Q4-05, or 82% of net revenues, slightly higher than the 81% reported in Q4-04, due primarily to increases in our International Marketplaces and Payments segment gross margins.
Sales and marketing expenses totaled $378.5 million, or 28% of net revenues, lower than the 29% reported in Q4-04. This improvement results from optimization of our marketing mix and increased focus on online marketing efficiency.
Product development expenses totaled $103.9 million, or 8% of net revenues, up from the 7% reported in Q4-04.
General and administrative costs totaled $181.7 million, or 14% of net revenues, up from the 12% reported in Q4-04. The percentage increase was primarily due to headcount additions and higher transaction loss expense.
Income from operations totaled $370.4 million during Q4-05, a 30% increase over the $284.7 million reported in Q4-04. On a pro forma basis, income from operations totaled $448.1 million, a 43% increase over the $313.9 million reported in Q4-04. On a year over year basis, income from operations was negatively impacted by foreign currency translation of approximately $17.7 million in Q4-05. On a sequential basis, income from operations was negatively impacted by foreign currency translation in Q4-05 by approximately $5.2 million.
Interest and other income, net, totaled $25.6 million in Q4-05, up from the $18.8 million reported in The increase was primarily due to higher interest rates, offset in part by lower cash and investments balances resulting from Q4-05 acquisitions.
Q4-04.
The GAAP effective tax rate for Q4-05 was 29% (pro forma 28%), a decrease from the GAAP effective tax rate of 32% for Q4-04 (pro forma 32%), and from 34% for Q3-05 (pro forma 34%). The lower effective tax rates for Q4-05 as compared to Q3-05 were due primarily to a one-time $16.6 million charge in Q3-05 related to the final application of certain tax regulations. The lower tax rates for Q4-05 as compared to Q4-04 results primarily from changes in the company's geographic mix.

In addition, because eBay has historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, the company believes the inclusion of non-GAAP measures provides consistency in the company's financial reporting.
