Free cash flows, representing operating cash flows less net purchases of property and equipment of $137 million, decreased 14% year over year to $385 million. The decrease in free cash flow is due in part to increases in purchases of property and equipment, primarily related to data center and software investments to support capacity expansion in our business, and capitalized product development costs related to our websites.
 
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments  The company's cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled approximately $3.8 billion at the end of Q3-06.
 
"We're pleased with the solid revenue growth, strong earnings and cash flow we delivered in Q3," said Bob Swan, Chief Financial Officer. "Our long-term confidence in the business is underscored by the significant share repurchase we executed in the quarter."
 
Business Outlook
 
The following guidance includes the estimated impact of expensing stock options from the adoption of FAS 123(R), which has been reflected in eBay's operating results beginning in Q1-06.
 
Fourth Quarter 2006  eBay expects consolidated net revenues for Q4 2006 to be in the range of $1.615 billion to $1.675 billion. GAAP earnings per diluted share for Q4 2006 are expected to be in the range of $0.21 to $0.22. GAAP earnings per diluted share for Q4 2006 includes the estimated impact of stock-based compensation from the adoption of FAS 123(R) of approximately $0.03-$0.04. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for Q4 2006 are expected to be in the range of $0.27 to $0.28. This guidance assumes a US dollar to Euro exchange rate of $1.25.
 
Full Year 2006  eBay expects consolidated net revenues 2006 to be in the range of $5.865 billion to $5.925 billion. GAAP earnings per diluted share for 2006 are expected to be in the range of $0.75 to $0.76. GAAP earnings per diluted share for 2006 includes the estimated impact of stock-based compensation from the adoption of FAS 123(R) of approximately $0.15 to $0.16 per diluted share. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for 2006 are expected to
 
be in the range of $1.01 to $1.02. This guidance assumes a Q4 2006 US dollar to Euro exchange rate of $1.25, and actual rates through the first three quarters of 2006.
 
Full Year 2007  eBay expects organic consolidated net revenue growth for 2007 in the range of 17% to 21% over 2006 revenues. GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins are expected to improve by at least 0.5 percentage points over 2006 GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins. GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected to grow by at least 20% over 2006 GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share. This guidance assumes a US dollar to Euro exchange rate of $1.25 and does not reflect the potential impact of the adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting FIN 48 (which will be effective January 1, 2007) on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.

To supplement the company's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, eBay uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate, and free cash flows, as well as GAAP amounts excluding stock-based compensation on operating income, net income and earnings per share, and the corresponding percentages of net revenues. eBay also makes reference to measures of operating income, net income and earnings per diluted share, which exclude stock-based compensation in order to allow for a better comparison of results in the current period to those in prior periods that did not include FAS 123(R) stock-based compensation.
 
These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with eBay's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. These measures should only be used to evaluate eBay's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.
 
Reconciliation to the nearest GAAP measure of all non-GAAP measures included in this press release can be found in the tables included on pages 6, 7, 9, 10, and 16 of this press release. For non-GAAP measures that exclude only stock-based compensation, the reconciliation to GAAP is presented in narrative form in this release when the non-GAAP measure is referenced.
 
These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of the company's current financial performance and the company's prospects for the future, and to provide further information for comparative purposes due to the adoption of the new accounting standard FAS 123(R). Specifically, the company believes the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses, and net purchases of property and equipment that may not be indicative of its core operating results and business outlook. In addition, because eBay has historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, the company believes the inclusion of non-GAAP measures provides consistency in the company's financial reporting.
 
For its internal budgeting process, and as discussed further below, eBay's management uses financial statements that do not include stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock options and employee stock purchases, employer payroll taxes on employee non-qualified stock option gains, amortization of acquired intangible assets, gain on sale of equity investment and the income taxes associated with the foregoing. In addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, eBay's management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures in reviewing the financial results of eBay. Note that beginning with Q1-06, eBay's financial results include stock-based compensation from the adoption of the new accounting standard, FAS 123(R). eBay's financial results for prior periods have not been restated for FAS 123(R).
 
eBay excludes the following items from non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate, as well as GAAP amounts excluding stock-based compensation on operating income, net income and earnings per share, and the corresponding percentages of net revenues.:
 
These expenses consist of expenses for stock options and employee stock purchases under FAS 123(R). eBay excludes stock-based compensation expenses from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses that eBay does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results and because excluding these amounts allow for a comparison of the results in the current period to those in the prior periods that did not include FAS 123(R) stock-based compensation expense.
Stock-based compensation related to stock options and employee stock purchases.
 
This amount is dependent on eBay's stock price and the timing and size of exercise by employees of their stock options, over which management has virtually no control, and as such does not correlate to eBay's operation of the business.
Employer payroll taxes on employee non-qualified stock option gains.
 
eBay incurs amortization of acquired intangible assets in connection with acquisitions and investments. eBay excludes these items because they arise from eBay's prior acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the current operating results of eBay's business.
Amortization of acquired intangible assets.
 
eBay does not actively trade public equity securities nor does it rely on these securities positions for funding of ongoing operations. eBay excludes these gains because they are unrelated to eBay's ongoing business and operating results.
Gain on sale of equity investment.
 
This amount is used to present each of the amounts described above on an after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP net income.
Income taxes associated with certain non-GAAP entries.
 
In addition to the non-GAAP measures discussed above, eBay also uses free cash flow. Free cash flow represents operating cash flows less net purchases of property, buildings, and equipment. eBay considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases of property, buildings, and equipment, which can then be used to, among other things, invest in eBay's business, make strategic acquisitions, strengthen the balance sheet and repurchase stock. A limitation of free cash flow is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the company's cash balance for the period.
