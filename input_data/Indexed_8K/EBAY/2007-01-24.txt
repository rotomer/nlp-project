To supplement the company's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, eBay uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate, and free cash flows, as well as GAAP amounts excluding stock-based compensation on operating income, net income and earnings per share, and the corresponding percentages of net revenues. eBay also makes reference to measures of operating income, net income and earnings per diluted share, which exclude stock-based compensation in order to allow for a better comparison of results in the current period to those in prior periods that did not include FAS 123(R) stock-based compensation.
 
These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with eBay's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. These measures should only be used to evaluate eBay's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.
 
Reconciliation to the nearest GAAP measure of all non-GAAP measures included in this press release can be found in the tables included on page 9, 10 and 16 of this press release. For non-GAAP measures that exclude only stock-based compensation, the reconciliation to GAAP is presented in narrative form in this release when the non-GAAP measure is referenced.
 
These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of the company's current financial performance and the company's prospects for the future, and to provide further information for comparative purposes due to the adoption of the new accounting standard FAS 123(R). Specifically, the company believes the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses, and net purchases of property and equipment that may not be indicative of its core operating results and business outlook. In addition, because eBay has historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, the company believes the inclusion of non-GAAP measures provides consistency in the company's financial reporting.
 
For its internal budgeting process, and as discussed further below, eBay's management uses financial statements that do not include stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock options and employee stock purchases, employer payroll taxes on employee non-qualified stock option gains, amortization of acquired intangible assets, gain on sale of equity investment and the income taxes associated with the foregoing. In addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, eBay's management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures in reviewing the financial results of eBay. Note that beginning with Q1-06, eBay's financial results include stock-based compensation from the adoption of the new accounting standard, FAS 123(R). eBay's financial results for prior periods have not been restated for FAS 123(R).
 
eBay excludes the following items from non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate, as well as GAAP amounts excluding stock-based compensation on operating income, net income and earnings per share, and the corresponding percentages of net revenues:
 
  These expenses consist of expenses for stock options and employee stock purchases under FAS 123(R). eBay excludes stock-based compensation expenses from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses that eBay does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results and because excluding these amounts allow for a comparison of the results in the current period to those in the prior periods that did not include FAS 123(R) stock-based compensation expense.
Stock-based compensation related to stock options and employee stock purchases.
 
  This amount is dependent on eBay's stock price and the timing and size of exercise by employees of their stock options, over which management has virtually no control, and as such does not correlate to eBay's operation of the business.
Employer payroll taxes on employee non-qualified stock option gains.
 
  eBay incurs amortization of acquired intangible assets in connection with acquisitions and investments. eBay excludes these items because they arise from eBay's prior acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the current operating results of eBay's business.
Amortization of acquired intangible assets.
 
  eBay does not actively trade public equity securities nor does it rely on these securities positions for funding of ongoing operations. eBay excludes these gains because the previous losses were excluded in prior periods and they are unrelated to eBay's ongoing business and operating results.
Gain on sale of equity investment.
 
  This amount is used to present stock-based compensation and the other amounts described above on an after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP net income.
Income taxes associated with certain non-GAAP entries.
 
In addition to the non-GAAP measures discussed above, eBay also uses free cash flow. Free cash flow represents operating cash flows less net purchases of property, buildings, and equipment. eBay considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases of property, buildings, and equipment, which can then be used to, among other things, invest in eBay's business, make strategic acquisitions, strengthen the balance sheet and repurchase stock. A limitation of free cash flow is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the company's cash balance for the period.
