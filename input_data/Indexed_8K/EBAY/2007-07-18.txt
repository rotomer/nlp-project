Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
San Jose, Calif, July 18, 2007  eBay Inc. (Nasdaq:  EBAY; www.ebay.com) reported financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2007.
 
eBay reported record consolidated Q2-07 net revenues of $1.83 billion, representing a growth rate of 30% year over year. GAAP operating income was $457 million, an increase of 47% year over year, and represented 24.9% of net revenues. Non-GAAP operating income was $595 million, an increase of 29% year over year, and represented 32.4% of net revenues.
 
GAAP net income in Q2-07 increased 50% year over year to $376 million, or $0.27 earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income increased 34% year over year to $471 million, or $0.34 earnings per diluted share. GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share increased 57% and 40% year over year, respectively.
 
The company purchased approximately 10 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of approximately $344 million during the quarter out of its authorized stock repurchase program of up to $2 billion by January 2009.
 
"The quarter was a very good one for the company, as our portfolio of businesses continued to deliver value to our global community," said eBay President and CEO, Meg Whitman. "Providing a great user experience has always been critical to our success and will remain part of our ongoing focus as we expand the business further."
 
Q2 Business Unit Discussion
 
Marketplaces
 
Overall, eBay's Marketplaces business posted strong results in the quarter, with solid top-line growth and expanded margins. The company continues to make significant investments to reinvigorate its core auctions business as well as to expand its portfolio of adjacent businesses.
 
Marketplaces net revenues totaled a record $1.29 billion in Q2-07, a growth rate of 26% over the $1.03 billion reported in Q2-06. eBay's users posted a total of 559 million listings in Q2-07, 6% lower than the 596 million listings posted in Q2-06. These listings generated Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) of $14.46 billion in Q2-07, representing a 12% year-over-year increase from the $12.90 billion reported in Q2-06.
 
Payments
 
PayPal had another exceptional quarter, with accelerating Total Payment Volume (TPV) and revenue growth. PayPal's Merchant Services business recorded outstanding results, as PayPal expanded its global footprint to new geographies and currencies during the quarter.
 
PayPal net revenues totaled a record $454 million in Q2-07, a growth rate of 34% over the $339 million reported in Q2-06. Global TPV was $11.69 billion in Q2-07, a 32% increase from the $8.86 billion reported in Q2-06.
 
PayPal Merchant Services contributed $4.92 billion globally to the $11.69 billion in global TPV in Q2-07, representing a 57% increase from the $3.13 billion reported in Q2-06.
 
Communications
 
Skype continues to grow rapidly, while delivering segment profitability for the second quarter in a row.
 
Skype net revenues totaled a record $90 million in Q2-07, a growth rate of 103% over the $44 million reported in Q2-06.
 
Skype had 220 million registered user accounts at the end of Q2-07, representing a 94% increase from the 113 million registered user accounts at the end of Q2-06.
 
Other selected financial results
 
Operating Margin  GAAP operating margin increased to 24.9% in Q2-07, up from 22.1% in Q2-06. Non-GAAP operating margin decreased slightly to 32.4% in Q2-07, from 32.6% in Q2-06. The slight decrease in non-GAAP operating margin is the result of the negative gross margin mix impact coming from our lower margin businesses, such as PayPal and Skype, mostly offset by productivity gains.
 
Taxes  The GAAP effective tax rate for Q2-07 was 23%, which was a decrease from 26% for Q2-06 and 24% in Q1-07. The non-GAAP effective tax rate in Q2-07 was 25%, which was a decrease from 28% for Q2-06 and 26% in Q1-07. The lower tax rates in Q2-07 resulted primarily from increased profits generated through the expansion of our international operations.
 
Cash Flows  GAAP operating cash flows increased to $655 million in Q2-07. Free cash flow increased to $533 million in Q2-07.
 
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments  The company's cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled approximately $3.78 billion at the end of Q2-07.
 
"Overall, we posted great financial results in the second quarter." said Bob Swan, chief financial officer, eBay Inc. "We're now halfway through the year, and we're increasingly confident in our ability to deliver even stronger full year revenue and earnings growth through our portfolio of businesses."
 
Business Outlook
 
Third Quarter 2007  eBay expects consolidated net revenues for Q3-07 to be in the range of $1.775 billion to $1.825 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for Q3-07 are expected to be in the range of $0.31 to $0.33. These amounts assume a US dollar to Euro exchange rate of $1.30.
 
Full Year 2007  eBay now expects consolidated net revenues for 2007 to be in the range of $7.300 billion to $7.450 billion. Non-GAAP operating margin for 2007 is expected to be approximately 33%. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for 2007 are now expected to be in the range of $1.34 to $1.38. These amounts assume a US dollar to Euro exchange rate of $1.30.

Forward-Looking Statements
 
This press release contains forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of eBay and its consolidated subsidiaries. These statements involve risks and uncertainties, and the company's actual results could differ materially from those discussed. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to: the company's need to increasingly achieve growth from its existing users as well as from new users in its more established markets; the company's ability to deal with the increasingly competitive environment, including competition for its sellers from other trading sites and other means of selling, and competition for its buyers from other merchants, online and offline; the need to manage an increasingly large enterprise with a broad range of businesses of varying degrees of maturity and in many different geographies; the regulatory, patent, and competitive and other risks specific to Skype; the competitive, regulatory, credit card association, and other risks specific to PayPal, especially as it continues to expand geographically; the company's need to manage other regulatory, tax, and litigation risks as its product offerings expand, its services are offered in more jurisdictions and applicable laws become more restrictive; the company's ability to upgrade and develop its systems, infrastructure and customer service capabilities to accommodate growth at a reasonable cost; the company's ability to maintain site stability and performance on all of its sites while adding new products and features in a timely fashion; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; the company's ability to profitably expand its business model to new types of merchandise and sellers; assumptions and methods used to value and expense stock options provided to employees; and, the company's ability to profitably integrate, manage and grow recent and future acquisitions and other transactions. The forward-looking statements in this release do not include the potential impact of any acquisitions that may be announced completed after the date hereof.

To supplement the company's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, eBay uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate, and free cash flow.
 
These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with eBay's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. These measures should only be used to evaluate eBay's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.
 
Reconciliation to the nearest GAAP measure of all non-GAAP measures included in this press release can be found in the tables included on page 12, 14 and 15 of this press release.
 
These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of the company's current financial performance and the company's prospects for the future. Specifically, the company believes the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses, and net purchases of property and equipment that may not be indicative of its core operating results and business outlook. In addition, because eBay has historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, the company believes the inclusion of non-GAAP measures provides consistency in the company's financial reporting.
 
For its internal budgeting process, and as discussed further below, eBay's management uses financial statements that do not include stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock options and employee stock purchases, employer payroll taxes on employee non-qualified stock option gains, amortization of acquired intangible assets and the income taxes associated with the foregoing. In addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, eBay's management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures in reviewing the financial results of eBay.
 
eBay excludes the following items from non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP effective tax rate:
 
  These expenses consist of expenses for stock options and employee stock purchases under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment." eBay excludes stock-based compensation expenses from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses that eBay does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results.
Stock-based compensation related to stock options and employee stock purchases.
 
  This amount is dependent on eBay's stock price and the timing and size of exercise by employees of their stock options, over which management has virtually no control, and as such does not correlate to eBay's operation of the business.
Employer payroll taxes on employee non-qualified stock option gains.
 
  eBay incurs amortization of acquired intangible assets in connection with acquisitions and investments. eBay excludes these items because they arise from eBay's prior acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the current operating results of eBay's business.
Amortization of acquired intangible assets.
 
  This amount is used to present stock-based compensation and the other amounts described above on an after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP net income.
Income taxes associated with certain non-GAAP entries.
 
In addition to the non-GAAP measures discussed above, eBay also uses free cash flow. Free cash flow represents operating cash flows less net purchases of property and equipment. eBay considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases of property, buildings, and equipment, which can then be used to, among other things, invest in eBay's business, make strategic acquisitions, strengthen the balance sheet and repurchase stock. A limitation of free cash flow is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the company's cash balance for the period.
