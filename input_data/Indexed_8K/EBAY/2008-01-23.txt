Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
San Jose, Calif, January 23, 2008  eBay Inc. (Nasdaq: EBAY; www.ebay.com) today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2007. The ecommerce company posted fourth quarter revenue of $2.18 billion, representing a $461 million year-over-year increase. Revenue grew across all businesses highlighted by more robust growth from PayPal, StubHub, Skype, classifieds and advertising. The company recorded net income on a GAAP basis of $531 million or $0.39 per diluted share, and non-GAAP net income of $611 million or $0.45 per diluted share.
 
For the full year, eBay Inc. posted $7.67 billion in revenue, net income on a GAAP basis of $348 million or $0.25 per diluted share, and non-GAAP net income of $2.11 billion or $1.53 per diluted share.
 
GAAP operating margin increased to 28.7% for the quarter, compared to 26.2% for the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin increased to 34.6% for the quarter, from 33.4% for the same period last year. For the full year GAAP operating margin came in at 8.0%, with non-GAAP operating margin at 33.1%.
 
eBay Inc. generated $793 million of operating cash flow and $665 million of free cash flow during the fourth quarter. The company's full year operating cash flow was $2.64 billion and free cash flow was $2.19 billion.
 
"We're very pleased with the results for the quarter which were strengthened by a solid holiday shopping season," said eBay Inc. President and CEO, Meg Whitman. "We had a remarkably strong year from a financial perspective. We enter 2008 with our most diverse portfolio of ecommerce offerings ever  positioning us to drive long-term growth in the global ecommerce market."
 
Quarterly Business Highlights
 
 
"Our fourth quarter results capped off a great year for eBay, with strong top-line growth, stronger bottom-line growth, and excellent free cash flows," said Bob Swan, eBay Inc. CFO.

Quarterly Business Unit Discussion
 
Marketplaces
 
The Marketplaces business unit, which consists of eBay, Shopping.com, StubHub, Kijiji and other ecommerce sites, had a strong quarter with a record $1.50 billion in revenue, equating to 21% year-over-year growth. Revenue growth was driven by StubHub, advertising, the fixed price format on eBay and, in part, by the benefit of a weaker U.S. dollar. Based on average monthly unique visits, eBay was the number one ecommerce site in the U.S., UK and Germany during the 2007 holiday shopping season, according to Nielsen Online. Approximately 54% of Marketplaces revenue came from markets outside the U.S. Gross merchandise volume was $16.21 billion for the quarter, an increase of 12% over the fourth quarter of 2006. eBay continues to focus on buyer and seller initiatives to accelerate gross merchandise volume in the U.S., Germany and the United Kingdom.
 
Payments
 
PayPal posted another stellar quarter with $563 million in revenue, an increase of 35% year-over-year. Net total payment volume (TPV) for the quarter was $14.04 billion, an increase of 35% year-over-year. The revenue and net TPV growth represents increased penetration on eBay as well as expanded adoption of PayPal Merchant Services across the Web. PayPal will continue to focus on greater penetration into the Marketplaces business as well as the acquisition of new merchants.
 
Communications
 
Skype contributed $115 million in revenue, representing 76% year-over-year growth, and posted a fourth consecutive quarter of segment profitability. Skype attracted new users at a rapid pace through the quarter and ended the period with more than 276 million registered users around the world.

Forward-Looking Statements
 
This press release contains forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of eBay and its consolidated subsidiaries that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. The company's actual results could differ materially from those predicted and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to: the company's need to increasingly achieve growth from its existing users in its more established markets; the company's ability to deal with the increasingly competitive ecommerce environment, including competition for its sellers from other trading sites and other means of selling, and competition for its buyers from other merchants, online and offline; the need to manage an increasingly large enterprise with a broad range of businesses of varying degrees of maturity and in many different geographies; the effect of management changes and business initiatives; the regulatory, patent, competitive and other risks specific to Skype; the competitive, regulatory, credit card association, and other risks specific to PayPal, especially as it continues to expand geographically; the company's need to manage other regulatory, tax, and litigation risks as its services are offered in more jurisdictions and applicable laws become more restrictive; the company's ability to upgrade and develop its systems, infrastructure and customer service capabilities at reasonable cost; the company's ability to maintain site stability and performance on all
 
of its sites while adding new products and features in a timely fashion; changes in political, business and economic conditions, including conditions that affect consumer confidence or ecommerce growth; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; the company's ability to profitably expand its business model to new types of merchandise and sellers; and, the company's ability to profitably integrate, manage and grow businesses that have been acquired recently or may be acquired in the future. The forward-looking statements in this release do not include the potential impact of any acquisitions that may be announced completed after the date hereof.

To supplement the company's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, eBay uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate, and free cash flow.
 
These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with eBay's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. These measures should only be used to evaluate eBay's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.
 
Reconciliation to the nearest GAAP measure of all non-GAAP measures included in this press release can be found in the tables included on page 13, 15 and 16 of this press release.
 
These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of the company's current financial performance and the company's prospects for the future. Specifically, the company believes the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses, and net purchases of property and equipment that may not be indicative of its core operating results and business outlook. In addition, because eBay has historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, the company believes the inclusion of non-GAAP measures provides consistency in the company's financial reporting.
 
For its internal budgeting process, and as discussed further below, eBay's management uses financial statements that do not include stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock options and employee stock purchases, employer payroll taxes on employee non-qualified stock option gains, amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets and the income taxes associated with the foregoing. In addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, eBay's management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures in reviewing the financial results of eBay.
 
eBay excludes the following items from non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP effective tax rate:
 
  These expenses consist of expenses for stock options and employee stock purchases under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment." eBay excludes stock-based compensation expenses from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses that eBay does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results.
Stock-based compensation related to stock options and employee stock purchases.
 
  This amount is dependent on eBay's stock price and the timing and size of exercise by employees of their stock options, over which management has limited to no control, and as such does not correlate to eBay's operation of the business.
Employer payroll taxes on employee non-qualified stock option gains.
 
  eBay incurs amortization or impairments of acquired intangible assets in connection with acquisitions and investments. eBay excludes these items because they arise from eBay's prior acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the current operating results of eBay's business.
Amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets and impairment of goodwill.
 
  This amount is used to present stock-based compensation and the other amounts described above on an after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP net income.
Income taxes associated with certain non-GAAP entries.
 
In addition to the non-GAAP measures discussed above, eBay also uses free cash flow. Free cash flow represents operating cash flows less net purchases of property and equipment. eBay considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases of property, buildings, and equipment, which can then be used to, among other things, invest in eBay's business, make strategic acquisitions, strengthen the balance sheet and repurchase stock. A limitation of free cash flow is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the company's cash balance for the period.
