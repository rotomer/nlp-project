EBAY INC. REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 2008 RESULTS
Delivered second consecutive $2-billion plus quarter
Completed approximately $1 billion in stock repurchases
Acquired Fraud Sciences Ltd.
 
San Jose, Calif, April 16, 2008  eBay Inc. (Nasdaq: EBAY) today reported financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2008. The ecommerce company posted first quarter revenue of $2.19 billion, up $424 million from the same period last year. Revenue growth was driven primarily by Marketplaces net transaction revenues, the ongoing expansion at PayPal, Skype and the company's global classifieds business. The company's global footprint helped it benefit from strength in other currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar. The company recorded net income on a GAAP basis of $460 million or $0.34 per diluted share, and non-GAAP net income of $562 million or $0.42 per diluted share.
 
GAAP operating margin decreased to 25.2% for the quarter, compared to 26.5% for the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin decreased to 32.0% for the quarter, compared to 33.6% for the same period last year. The decrease in operating margins was caused primarily by our faster growing lower-margin businesses, such as PayPal and Skype.
 
eBay Inc. generated $766 million of operating cash flow during the first quarter. Free cash flow during the quarter was $632 million.
 
"This was a very strong financial quarter for the company," said eBay Inc. President and CEO John Donahoe. "The results reflect the strength provided by our diverse portfolio of businesses. Our stability and growth continues to give us the confidence to make innovative changes to our products to keep customers engaged for years to come."
 
Quarterly Business Highlights
 
 
"We are pleased with our first quarter results. We generated strong revenue growth, even stronger earnings growth and excellent free cash flow. During the quarter, we opportunistically repurchased approximately 3% of eBay shares outstanding," said Bob Swan, eBay Inc. CFO. "We are seeing some positive early indicators based on our key initiatives, but there is still much work to be done. For the remainder of 2008, we'll continue to focus on the strategies we've put into motion, and we believe our guidance will allow us to invest in, and make the necessary changes to, our business while still delivering on our financial commitments."

Forward-Looking Statements
 
This press release contains forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of eBay and its consolidated subsidiaries that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. The company's actual results could differ materially from those predicted and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to: the company's need to increasingly achieve growth from its existing users, particularly in its more established markets, as well as the need to acquire new users; the company's ability to deal with the increasingly competitive ecommerce environment, including competition for its sellers from other trading sites and other means of selling, and competition for its buyers from other merchants, online and offline; the need to manage an increasingly large enterprise with a broad range of businesses of varying degrees of maturity and in many different geographies; the effect of management changes and business initiatives; the regulatory, intellectual property, competitive and other risks specific to Skype; the competitive, regulatory, credit card association, and other risks specific to PayPal, especially as it continues to expand geographically; the company's need to manage other regulatory, tax, and litigation risks as its services are offered in more jurisdictions and applicable laws become more restrictive; the company's ability to upgrade and develop its systems, infrastructure and customer service capabilities at reasonable cost; the company's ability to maintain site stability and performance on all of its sites while adding new products and features in a timely fashion; changes in political, business and economic conditions, including conditions that affect consumer confidence or ecommerce growth; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; the company's ability to profitably expand its business model to new types of merchandise and sellers; and, the company's ability to profitably integrate, manage and grow businesses that have been acquired recently or may be acquired in the future. The forward-looking statements in this release do not include the potential impact of any acquisitions that may be announced and/or completed after the date hereof.
 
More information about factors that could affect the company's operating results is included under the captions "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the company's most recent annual report on and any subsequent quarterly reports on copies of which may be obtained by visiting the company's investor relations web site at or the SEC's web site at .

To supplement the company's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, eBay uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate, and free cash flow.
 
These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with eBay's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. These measures should only be used to evaluate eBay's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.
 
Reconciliation to the nearest GAAP measure of all non-GAAP measures included in this press release can be found in the tables included on page 13, 15 and 16 of this press release.
 
These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of the company's current financial performance and the company's prospects for the future. Specifically, the company believes the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses, and net purchases of property and equipment that may not be indicative of its core operating results and business outlook. In addition, because eBay has historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, the company believes the inclusion of non-GAAP measures provides consistency in the company's financial reporting.
 
For its internal budgeting process, and as discussed further below, eBay's management uses financial statements that do not include stock-based compensation expense, employer payroll taxes on stock-based compensation, amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets and the income taxes associated with the foregoing. In addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, eBay's management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures in reviewing the financial results of eBay.
 
eBay excludes the following items from non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP effective tax rate:
 
This expense consists of expenses for stock options, restricted stock and employee stock purchases under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment." eBay excludes stock-based compensation expenses from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses that eBay does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results.
Stock-based compensation expense.  
 
This amount is dependent on eBay's stock price and the timing and size of exercise by employees of their stock options and restricted stock, over which management has limited to no control, and as such does not correlate to eBay's operation of the business.
Employer payroll taxes on stock-based compensation.  
 
eBay incurs amortization or impairments of acquired intangible assets in connection with acquisitions. eBay excludes these items because they arise from eBay's prior acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the current operating results of eBay's business.
Amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets and impairment of goodwill.  
 
This amount is used to present stock-based compensation and the other amounts described above on an after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP net income.
Income taxes associated with certain non-GAAP entries.  
 
In addition to the non-GAAP measures discussed above, eBay also uses free cash flow. Free cash flow represents operating cash flows less net purchases of property and equipment. eBay considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases of property, buildings, and equipment, which can then be used to, among other things, invest in eBay's business, make strategic acquisitions, strengthen the balance sheet and repurchase stock. A limitation of free cash flow is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the company's cash balance for the period.
