Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
On October 16, 2008, eBay Inc. (the "Company") drew down an aggregate amount of $1.0 billion under its revolving credit facility (the "Facility") pursuant to the Credit Agreement (as amended, the "Credit Agreement") with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent (the "Agent"); certain lenders named therein; JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Syndication Agents; and Banc of America Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Book Managers. This borrowing under the Facility currently bears interest at a rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus a margin of 0.20% (4.67% as of October 16, 2008). We expect that the funds will be used for general corporate purposes, including financing the acquisition of Bill Me Later, Inc. and its associated receivables. Following this borrowing, the remaining availability under the Facility is approximately $840 million (which also reflects a $160 million reduction in available borrowing result ing from the bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., the parent corporation of Lehman Brothers Commercial Bank (which had a $160 million lending commitment)).
