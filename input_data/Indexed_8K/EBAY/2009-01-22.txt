Item 8.01 Other Events.
The 2009 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of eBay Inc. (the "Company") has been scheduled for April 29, 2009 (the "2009 Annual Meeting") in San Jose, California. Because the expected date of the 2009 Annual Meeting represents a change of more than 30 days from the anniversary of the Companys 2008 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the Company has set a new deadline for the receipt of stockholder proposals submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") for inclusion in the Companys proxy materials for the 2009 Annual Meeting. In order to be considered timely, such proposals must be received by the Corporate Secretary at the Companys principal executive office at 2145 Hamilton Avenue, San Jose, CA 95125 no later than February 13, 2009. This deadline will also apply in determining whether notice is timely for purposes of exercising discretionary voting authority with respect to proxies for purposes of Rule 14a-4(c) under t he Exchange Act. Additionally, in accordance with the advance notice provisions set forth in the Companys Amended and Restated Bylaws, in order for a stockholder proposal to be submitted outside of Rule 14a-8 or a director nomination submitted by a stockholder to be considered timely, it must be received by the Corporate Secretary at the Companys principal executive office at 2145 Hamilton Avenue, San Jose, CA 95125 no later than February 2, 2009.
