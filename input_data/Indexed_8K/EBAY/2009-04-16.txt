Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On April 15, 2009 in the United States (and April 16, 2009 in Korea), eBay Inc., a Delaware corporation ("eBay"), eBay KTA (UK) Ltd., a company organized under the laws of the United Kingdom and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of eBay (the "Offeror"), and Gmarket Inc., a company organized under the laws of the Republic of Korea ("Gmarket"), entered into a Share Allocation and Tender Offer Agreement (the "Agreement") which contemplates the acquisition by the Offeror of common shares, par value KRW 100 per share (the "Common Shares"), and American Depositary Shares, each representing one Common Share and evidenced by an American Depositary Receipt issued by Citibank, N.A. (the "ADSs"), of Gmarket. The Agreement provides that the Offeror would commence a cash tender offer (the "Offer") to purchase all outstanding Common Shares and all outstanding ADSs at a purchase price of $24.00 per Common Share and per ADS (such price, or any other price per Common Share and per ADS that is paid in the Offer, the "Offer Price"), without interest thereon, less any required withholding taxes. In addition, pursuant to the Agreement, the Offeror has agreed to purchase 23,131,071 newly-issued Common Shares (the "New Shares") from Gmarket for a price per New Share equal to the Offer Price, or an aggregate amount of $555,145,704, in cash.
Concurrently with the execution of the Agreement, eBay, the Offeror and Gmarket entered into a separate Share Purchase Agreement (the "IAC Share Purchase Agreement") providing for the purchase by Gmarket of all of the shares of Internet Auction Co., Ltd., a company organized under the laws of the Republic of Korea and a subsidiary of the Offeror ("IAC"), currently held by the Offeror for an aggregate amount equal to $555,145,704 in cash.
It is contemplated that the purchase of the New Shares will close a few business days following the time that the Offeror first accepts Common Shares (including Common Shares underlying ADSs) for payment pursuant to the Offer and that the purchase of shares of IAC from the Offeror under the IAC Share Purchase Agreement will occur a few business days thereafter.
The Agreement provides that the Offeror will commence the Offer as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of the Agreement. The obligation of the Offeror to accept for payment Common Shares and ADSs validly tendered (and not withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer is subject to a number of conditions set forth in the Agreement, including, among other things, that (i) more than 50% of the Common Shares and ADSs outstanding (determined on a fully-diluted basis based on a formula set forth in the Agreement) have been validly tendered (and not withdrawn), (ii) final clearance under Korean antitrust laws has been obtained, and (iii) other conditions set forth in Annex I to the Agreement have been satisfied.
As an inducement to eBay to enter into the Agreement, certain shareholders of Gmarket, holding outstanding Common Shares and ADSs of Gmarket sufficient to satisfy the minimum tender condition have entered into an Agreement to Tender and Voting Agreement pursuant to which such shareholders have agreed to tender all Common Shares and ADSs now owned or hereafter acquired by them in the Offer and to vote any such Common Shares and ADSs in favor of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement.
Common Shares and ADSs that are not tendered in the Offer will remain outstanding after the completion of the Offer and will be delisted from The NASDAQ Stock Market. It is expected that there will not be an active trading market for outstanding Gmarket shares following completion of the Offer.
The foregoing descriptions of the Agreement and the IAC Share Purchase Agreement (collectively, the "Transaction Agreements") in this Current Report on Form 8-K are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of such agreements referenced as Exhibits 2.1 and 2.2, respectively, which are incorporated by reference herein. The Agreement and the IAC Share Purchase Agreement contain representations and warranties that eBay, the Offeror and Gmarket made solely to each other as of specific dates. Those representations and warranties were made solely for purposes of the Agreement and the IAC Share Purchase Agreement and may be subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by eBay, the Offeror and Gmarket. Moreover, some of those representations and warranties may not be accurate or complete as of any specified date, may be subject to a standard of materiality provided for in the Agreement or the IAC Share Purchase Agreement and have been used for the purpose of allocating risk among eBay, the Offeror and Gmarket rather than establishing matters as facts.
Item 8.01. Other Events.
On April 15, 2009 in the United States (and April 16, 2009 in Korea), eBay and Gmarket issued a joint press release, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated by reference herein, announcing the execution of the Transaction Agreements.
Additional Information and Where to Find It
The description contained herein is neither an offer to purchase nor a solicitation of an offer to sell shares or American Depositary Shares of Gmarket. At the time the offer is commenced, eBay and its acquisition subsidiary will file tender offer materials with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and Gmarket will file a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement with respect to the offer. The tender offer materials (including an Offer to Purchase, a related Letter of Transmittal and certain other offer documents) and the Solicitation/Recommendation Statement will contain important information, which should be read carefully before any decision is made with respect to the tender offer. The Offer to Purchase, the related Letter of Transmittal and certain other offer documents, as well as the
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement, will be made available to all holders of shares or American Depositary Shares of Gmarket at no expense to them at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Free copies of these documents will be made available upon request by mail to eBay Inc., 2145 Hamilton Avenue, San Jose, CA 95125, Attention: Investor Relations or to Gmarket Inc., 9th Floor, LIG Tower, 649-11 Yeoksam-Dong, Gangnam-Gu, Seoul 135-912, Korea, Attention: Investor Relations.
In addition to the Offer to Purchase, the related Letter of Transmittal and certain other offer documents, as well as the Solicitation/Recommendation Statement, Gmarket and eBay file annual and special reports and other information with the SEC. You may read and copy any reports or other information filed by eBay or Gmarket at the SEC public reference room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. Please call the Commission at 1-800-SEC-0330 for further information on the public reference room. eBay's and Gmarket's filings with the SEC are also available to the public from commercial document-retrieval services and at the website maintained by the SEC at http://wwvw.sec.gov.

The existing litigation against the Company that is described in Parent's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 eBay Inc. (Nasdaq: EBAY) and Gmarket Inc. (Nasdaq: GMKT) today jointly announced a definitive agreement for eBay to combine Gmarket, Korea's leading e-commerce business, with eBay's existing online marketplace in Korea. Under the terms of the agreement, eBay will make a cash tender offer of $24.00 per share for all outstanding Gmarket common shares and American Depositary Shares, for a total purchase price of up to approximately $1.2 billion assuming all outstanding shares are tendered. As of April 15, 2009, the consideration of $24.00 per share was equivalent to approximately 31,767 Korean won per share.
San Jose, Calif., April 15, 2009
At closing, eBay will hold at least 67 percent of Gmarket as a result of shares tendered pursuant to agreements to tender with members of management and other investors sufficient to satisfy the minimum tender condition, as well as new shares issued by Gmarket in connection with the combination of Gmarket and eBay's existing Korean marketplace business, Internet Auction Company. Shareholders that have signed agreements to tender include Interpark Corporation and its chairman, Ki Hyung Lee, current holders of approximately 34 percent of the outstanding shares of Gmarket. eBay will combine Gmarket's operations with IAC, while maintaining separate sites.
"The combination of Gmarket and IAC establishes an exceptionally strong leadership position for eBay in one of the world's largest, most dynamic and innovative e-commerce markets," said John Donahoe, eBay's president and chief executive officer. "This deal creates strong operational synergies between the two market leaders, offers more opportunities for sellers and enhances our ability to serve complementary consumer segments."
"We welcome eBay's investment in Gmarket," said Young Bae Ku, Gmarket's president and chief executive officer. "This transaction will provide us an excellent opportunity for our next growth stage in Korea and will also help accelerate our expansion strategies beyond Korea. We look forward to teaming up with eBay's leadership both locally and globally to drive our future growth and expansion."
 
The Board of Directors of Gmarket has voted unanimously to approve the transaction and recommends that Gmarket security holders accept the offer. A special committee of Gmarket's independent directors recommended approval of the transaction to Gmarket's Board of Directors. The transaction, which is conditioned on the tender of a majority of the outstanding shares and American Depositary Shares of Gmarket on a fully diluted basis, final Korean antitrust clearance and other customary closing conditions, is expected to close in the second quarter of 2009. Following completion of the tender offer, shares of Gmarket not purchased by eBay will remain outstanding and will be delisted from The NASDAQ Stock Market. It is expected that there will not be an active trading market for outstanding Gmarket shares following completion of the offer.
With more than 86 million active users, eBay Marketplaces generated $60 billion of gross merchandise volume worldwide in 2008 and revenue of $5.6 billion. IAC generated $2.2 billion of gross merchandise volume in 2008 and revenue of $161.2 million at an assumed exchange rate of 1262 KRW per USD. In 2008, Gmarket generated $3.2 billion of gross merchandise volume and revenue of $220.8 million at the same assumed exchange rate.
Through the combined businesses, eBay will be able to offer benefits for Gmarket and IAC sellers, such as tools for quick, simultaneous listings across both platforms, and enhanced experiences for buyers through improved selection, incentives and loyalty programs. eBay also expects the combination with Gmarket to provide a potential platform for further expansion within Asia.
The combination also provides the necessary support for Korean sellers who seek access to eBay's global network. By joining eBay's Cross Border Trade program, Korean small and medium sized businesses can export their products to buyers in foreign countries. Jooman Park, president of IAC and Young Bae Ku, president of Gmarket will jointly lead the combination of IAC and Gmarket and will manage the integration of the two e-commerce companies.
Gmarket's focus on fashion-oriented categories and IAC's focus on computers, electronics and sports give the two platforms core strengths in complementary consumer segments. Females age 20-29, representing Korea's fastest-growing online segment, comprise more than 21 percent of Gmarket's consumer base. Males age 30 and over comprise IAC's biggest consumer segment. Korea is the world's sixth-largest e-commerce market behind the United States, Germany, United Kingdom, China and Japan. eBay has more than seven years of experience in the market, beginning with its acquisition of IAC in 2001.
 
eBay Inc. will host an investor conference call on Thursday, April 16 at 6 a.m. PDT to discuss this announcement. A live webcast of the conference can be accessed through eBay Investor Relations Web site at . An archive of the webcast will be accessible through the same link.
