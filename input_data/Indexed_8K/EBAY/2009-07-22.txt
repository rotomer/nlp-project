Exhibit 99.1
eBAY INC. REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 2009 RESULTS
San Jose, Calif., July 22, 2009  eBay Inc. (Nasdaq: EBAY) today reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2009. The ecommerce company posted second quarter revenue of $2.10 billion, a $97.7 million year-over-year decrease. The year-over-year revenue growth of PayPal and Skype was offset by the effects of the stronger dollar and a modest decline in the Marketplaces business. The company recorded net income on a GAAP basis of $327.3 million or $0.25 per diluted share, and non-GAAP net income of $478.6 million or $0.37 per diluted share.
GAAP operating margin decreased to 19.6% for the quarter, compared to 24.8% for the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin decreased to 28.7% for the quarter, compared to 31.9% for the same period last year. The decrease in operating margins was caused primarily by the impact of the stronger dollar and the company's continuing shift to faster growing, lower margin businesses, partially offset by strong cost controls.
eBay Inc. generated $730.7 million of operating cash flow during the second quarter. Free cash flow during the quarter was $602.3 million.
"We drove solid second quarter results, with strong momentum and market share gains at PayPal and continued stabilization in our core eBay business," said eBay Inc. President and CEO John Donahoe. "We are managing our business with focus and discipline, delivering on our commitments while investing in our growth priorities. I'm pleased with our pace, our progress and our performance."
Financial Highlights (presented in millions, except per share data and percentages)
 
Quarterly Business Unit Discussion
Payments
The Payments business unit reported a strong quarter with $669.3 million in revenue, an increase of 11% year over year. Net total payment volume (TPV) for the quarter was $16.71 billion, an increase of 12%. The revenue and TPV growth was driven by continued momentum in PayPal Merchant Services and the contribution made by Bill Me Later. Continued increases in PayPal penetration on eBay helped offset the negative impact of lower addressable gross merchandise volume (GMV) on revenue and TPV. Active registered accounts reached 75.4 million, an increase of 20% year over year. The Payments business will continue to focus on the acquisition of new merchants, greater penetration into the Marketplaces business and the integration of Bill Me Later.
Marketplaces
The Marketplaces business unit, which consists of eBay, Shopping.com, StubHub, Kijiji and other ecommerce sites, recorded $1.26 billion in revenue, a 14% year-over-year decline. The revenue drop was attributable to the impact of the stronger dollar and the impact of challenging macroeconomic conditions. eBay Marketplaces continues to make progress in stabilizing its core business as the year-over-year decline in revenue slowed versus the prior quarter. Approximately 57% of Marketplaces revenue came from markets outside of the U.S. GMV (excluding vehicles) was $11.13 billion for the quarter, a decrease of 10%, compared to the second quarter of 2008. Online classifieds revenue increased 19% year over year. A focus on geographic, format and category expansion combined with improving trust, value and selection for customers are expected to drive future revenue.
Communications
Skype contributed $170.0 million in revenue for the quarter, representing 25% year-over-year growth. Skype added 37.3 million registered users during the quarter and ended the period with more than 480.5 million registered users. In addition to growing its user base, Skype is focused on product strategies to enhance customer engagement.

These statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding expected financial results for the third quarter of 2009, and anticipated future stability and growth in the Marketplaces business unit. The company's actual results could differ materially from those predicted and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to: the impact of the credit crisis, economic downturn and other changes in political, business and economic conditions, including conditions that affect consumer confidence or ecommerce growth; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; the company's ability to profitably integrate, manage and grow businesses that have been acquired recently or may be acquired in the future; the company's need to increasingly achieve growth from its existing users, particularly in its more established markets; the company's ability to deal with the increasingly competitive ecommerce environment, including competition for its sellers from other trading sites and other means of selling, and competition for its buyers from other merchants, online and offline; the company's need to manage an increasingly large enterprise with a broad range of businesses of varying degrees of maturity and in many different geographies; the effect of management changes and business initiatives; the company's need and ability to manage other regulatory, tax and litigation risks as its services are offered in more jurisdictions and applicable laws become more restrictive; any changes the company may make to its product offerings in response to slowing growth; the regulatory, intellectual property, competitive and other risks specific to Skype; the competitive, regulatory, credit card association, and other risks specific to PayPal and Bill Me Later, especially as PayPal continues to expand geographically; the company's ability to upgrade and develop its systems, infrastructure and customer service capabilities at reasonable cost; and the company's ability to maintain site stability and performance on all of its sites while adding new products and features in a timely fashion.

To supplement the company's condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, eBay uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate, and free cash flow.
These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with eBay's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. These measures should only be used to evaluate eBay's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.
Reconciliation to the nearest GAAP measure of all non-GAAP measures included in this press release can be found in the tables included on pages 12, 14 and 15 of this press release.
These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of the company's current financial performance and the company's prospects for the future. Specifically, the company believes the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses, and net purchases of property and equipment that may not be indicative of its core operating results and business outlook. In addition, because eBay has historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, the company believes the inclusion of non-GAAP measures provides consistency in the company's financial reporting.
For its internal budgeting process, and as discussed further below, eBay's management uses financial statements that do not include stock-based compensation expense, employer payroll taxes on stock-based compensation, amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, restructuring-related charges and the income taxes associated with the foregoing. In addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, eBay's management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures in reviewing the financial results of eBay.
eBay excludes the following items from non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP effective tax rate:
 This expense consists of expenses for stock options, restricted stock and employee stock purchases under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment." eBay excludes stock-based compensation expenses from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses that management does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results.
Stock-based compensation expense.
 This amount is dependent on eBay's stock price and the timing and size of exercises by employees of their stock options and the vesting of their restricted stock, over which management has limited to no control, and as such management does not believe it correlates to eBay's operation of the business.
Employer payroll taxes on stock-based compensation.
eBay incurs amortization or impairments of acquired intangible assets and goodwill in connection with acquisitions. eBay excludes these items because they arise from eBay's prior acquisitions and management does not believe it has any direct correlation to the current operating results of eBay's business.
Amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets and impairment of goodwill.
 These charges consist of expenses for employee severance and other exit and disposal costs. eBay excludes restructuring charges primarily because management does not believe they are reflective of ongoing operating results.
Restructuring.
 This amount is used to present stock-based compensation and the other amounts described above on an after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP net income.
Income taxes associated with certain non-GAAP entries.
In addition to the non-GAAP measures discussed above, eBay also uses free cash flow. Free cash flow represents operating cash flows less net purchases of property and equipment. eBay considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases of property, buildings, and equipment, which can then be used to, among other things, invest in eBay's business, make strategic acquisitions, and repurchase stock. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the company's cash balance for the period.
