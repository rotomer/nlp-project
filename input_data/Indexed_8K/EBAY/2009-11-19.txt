On November 19, 2009, eBay Inc., a Delaware corporation ("eBay"), eBay International AG, a company organized under the laws of Switzerland and a wholly owned subsidiary of eBay ("International"), and Sonorit Holding, AS, a Norwegian company and a wholly owned subsidiary of eBay ("Sonorit," and together with eBay and International, the "Sellers"), completed the previously announced sale of the share capital of Skype Luxembourg Holdings S..r.l. ("Skype Luxembourg"), Skype Inc. and Sonorit (collectively with their respective subsidiaries, the "Skype Companies") to Springboard Group S..r.l. (formerly SLP III Cayman DS IV Holdings S..r.l.) (the "Buyer"), an entity organized and owned by an investor group led by Silver Lake and including Joltid Limited and certain of its affiliated parties, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Andreessen Horowitz. The Skype Companies provide software that enables individuals and businesses to make free video and voice calls, send instant messages and share files with other Skype users and to make low-cost calls to landline and mobile numbers. The consideration received at the closing, which was determined based upon arms-length negotiations between the parties, consisted of (i) approximately $1.9 billion in cash, (ii) a subordinated note issued by a subsidiary of the Buyer in the principal amount of $125 million and (iii) an equity stake of approximately 30% of the outstanding capital stock of the Buyer.
At the closing, the Buyer, International and the other shareholders of the Buyer entered into a shareholders agreement relating to, among other things, the governance of the Buyer, the issuance, disposition or transfer of the equity of the Buyer, extraordinary transactions involving the Skype Companies and other customary provisions. The Sellers, the Buyer and/or their respective affiliates also entered into certain ancillary agreements, including agreements relating to intellectual property cross-licenses, management services, transitional services and office space. Skype Communications S..r.l. entered into a new commercial agreement with an affiliate of PayPal, Inc. Skype Technologies S.A., the Buyer and eBay also entered into a tax cooperation agreement. In addition, eBay purchased senior debt securities with a face value of $50 million as part of a Skype debt financing.
The foregoing descriptions of the sale do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Share Purchase Agreement between the Sellers and the Buyer, dated September 1, 2009, as amended on September 14, 2009 (the "Original Purchase Agreement"), and as further amended on October 19, 2009, October 21, 2009, November 5, 2009 and November 19, 2009 (collectively, the "Amendments" and, together with the Original Purchase Agreement, the "Purchase Agreement"). The Original Purchase Agreement was filed as Exhibit 2.01 to eBay's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed on October 27, 2009, which is incorporated herein by reference. The Amendments are filed as Exhibit 2.2 to this report, which are incorporated herein by reference. The Purchase Agreement is being filed to provide information regarding the terms of the sale and the Purchase Agreement. No representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in the Purchase Agreement is, or should be construed as, a representation or warranty by eBay to any investor, or covenant or agreement of eBay with any investor. The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in the Purchase Agreement are solely for the benefit of the Sellers and Buyer, may represent an allocation of risk between the parties, may be subject to standards of materiality that differ from those that are applicable to investors and may be qualified by disclosures between the parties.
As previously disclosed, Mr. Marc L. Andreessen, a member of the board of directors of eBay, is a general partner of the Andreessen Horowitz, which owns less than 5% of the Buyer.
On November 19, 2009, eBay issued a press release announcing the closing of its sale of the Skype Companies, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 99.2
On November 19, 2009, eBay Inc. ("eBay" or the "Company") sold all of the share capital of Skype Luxembourg Holdings S.a.r.l., Skype Inc. and Sonorit Holdings, A.S. (collectively with their respective subsidiaries, the "Skype Companies") to an entity organized and owned by an investor group led by Silver Lake and including Joltid Limited and certain of its affiliated parties, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Andreessen Horowitz (the "Buyer"). The Company received cash proceeds of approximately $1.9 billion, a note from a subsidiary of the Buyer in the principal amount of $125.0 million and a 30 percent equity interest in the outstanding capital stock of the Buyer. The Company also purchased senior debt securities with a face value of $50.0 million as part of a Skype debt financing. We will account for the minority equity interest using the equity method of accounting.
The unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet Information as of September 30, 2009 set forth below has been presented to give effect to the sale of the controlling interest in the Skype Companies as if it had occurred on September 30, 2009. The unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2008 and the nine month period ended September 30, 2009 set forth below have been presented after giving effect to the sale as if it had occurred on January 1, 2008, and do not assume any interest income on cash proceeds.
The unaudited pro forma financial statements have been derived from the historical audited consolidated financial statements of the Company included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 and interim financial statements in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2009. The unaudited pro forma financial statements are based upon available information and assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable under the circumstances and were prepared to illustrate the estimated effects of the sale.
The unaudited pro forma financial statements have been provided for informational purposes and should not be considered indicative of the financial condition or results of operations that would have been achieved had the sale occurred as of the periods presented. In addition, the unaudited pro forma financial statements do not purport to indicate balance sheet data or results of operations as of any future date or for any future period. The unaudited pro forma financial statements, including the notes thereto, should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements of the Company included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 and interim financial statements in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the nine month period ended September 30, 2009.
