Item 5.02.    Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
 
At a regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of eBay Inc. (the "Company") held on March 3, 2010, the Board determined to move one of the directors from Class II (with a term expiring at the 2012 annual meeting of stockholders) to Class III (with a term expiring at the 2010 annual meeting of stockholders) to achieve a more equal balance of membership among the classes of directors following the decision of Philippe Bourguignon to retire from the Board and not to stand for re-election at the 2010 annual meeting of stockholders. Accordingly, on March 3, 2010, Richard T. Schlosberg, III agreed to resign as a Class II director and was immediately appointed to the Board as a Class III director. Mr. Schlosberg continues to serve on the Company's Audit and Corporate Governance and Nominating Committees. The resignation and reappointment of Mr. Schlosberg was effected solely to rebalance the Board classes, and for all other purposes, including vesting and other compensation matters, Mr. Schlosberg's service on the Board is deemed to have continued uninterrupted.
