Exhibit 99.1
EBAY INC. REPORTS STRONG SECOND QUARTER REVENUE AND EARNINGS GROWTH
, July 21, 2010  Global ecommerce and online payments leader eBay Inc. (Nasdaq: EBAY) today reported that revenue for the fiscal second quarter ended June 30, 2010, increased 6% to $2.2 billion, or 15% excluding Skype, compared to the same period of 2009. The company recorded second quarter net income on a GAAP basis of $412.2 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, and non-GAAP net income of $530.2 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, representing an 18% increase excluding Skype, compared to the same period of 2009.
SAN JOSE, Calif.
The company's PayPal business delivered record second quarter performance. PayPal added a million new accounts each month during the quarter and its merchant services business continued to gain share in ecommerce. For three consecutive quarters, PayPal's merchant services business has grown by over 40% year over year. The company also reported that the multiyear turnaround of its eBay business continued on track in the second quarter, with strength in Europe, expected performance in Asia, slower than expected growth in the U.S. and progress against underlying customer metrics focused on trust, value and selection for the world's largest online marketplace.
"We delivered strong second quarter results, demonstrating the global strength and increasing diversity of our business," said John Donahoe, eBay Inc. President and CEO. "PayPal is strong and getting stronger, building a robust and innovative global footprint serving all of ecommerce. And our eBay turnaround remains on track, with strong performance in Europe, significant changes in the U.S. and continued improvements to the buying and selling experience. We continue to focus on delivering strong financial results, managing a healthy balance sheet and making the necessary investments to compete, win and satisfy our customers."

Other Selected Financial Results
 
 
 
 
 
Business Outlook  Impact of Stronger Dollar
For the full year 2010, eBay expects its PayPal business unit to continue its strong performance, resulting in a positive impact to full year net revenues of approximately $100 million and $0.06 to $0.08 per diluted share. The company expects its Marketplaces business unit to continue its strong growth in Europe, offset by its slower growth in the U.S.
However, full year pressure from the stronger U.S. dollar, relative to other currencies, is expected to have full year negative impact on 2010 net revenues of approximately $250 million and $0.09 to $0.11 per diluted share.
As a result, the company is modestly adjusting full year guidance from that provided on January 20, 2010 and reaffirmed on April 21, 2010. The company now estimates full year 2010 net revenues in the range of $8.8 billion to $9.0 billion, representing growth of 9% to 11% compared to 2009, excluding Skype. The company also estimates GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.23 to $1.28 and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.60 to $1.65, representing growth of 9% to 12% compared to 2009, excluding Skype.
Third quarter 2010 guidance includes the negative impact of pressure from a stronger U.S. dollar on net revenues and earnings on a year-over-year basis of approximately $70 million and $0.02 per diluted share. For the third quarter 2010, eBay estimates net revenues in the range of $2.13 billion to $2.18 billion representing growth of 4% to 6% compared to third quarter 2009, excluding Skype. The company also estimates GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.26 to $0.28 and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.35 to $0.37, representing growth of 0% to 6% compared to third quarter 2009, excluding Skype.
Quarterly Conference Call
eBay will host a conference call to discuss second quarter 2010 results at 2 p.m. Pacific Time today. A live webcast of the conference call, together with a slide presentation that includes supplemental financial information and reconciliations of certain non-GAAP measures to their nearest comparable GAAP measures, can be accessed through the company's Investor Relations web site at .

Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements relating to, among other things, the future performance of eBay and its consolidated subsidiaries that are based on the company's current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding expected financial results for the third quarter and full year 2010 and the future growth in the Payments and Marketplaces businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from those predicted or implied and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to: the further impact of the credit crisis and the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, a continued or worsening economic downturn, declining consumer confidence and other changes in political, business and economic conditions, including any conditions that affect ecommerce growth; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; the company's ability to profitably integrate, manage and grow businesses that have been acquired recently or may be acquired in the future; the company's need to increasingly achieve growth from its existing users, particularly in its more established markets; the company's ability to deal with the increasingly competitive ecommerce environment, including competition for its sellers from other trading sites and other means of selling, and competition for its buyers from other merchants, online and offline; the company's need to manage an increasingly large enterprise with a broad range of businesses of varying degrees of maturity and in many different geographies; the effect of management changes and business initiatives; the company's need and ability to manage other regulatory, tax and litigation risks as its services are offered in more jurisdictions and applicable laws become more restrictive; any changes the company may make to its product offerings; the competitive, regulatory, credit card association-related, and other risks specific to PayPal and Bill Me Later, especially as PayPal continues to expand geographically and grow its open platform initiative and as new laws and regulations related to financial services companies are passed; the company's ability to upgrade and develop its systems, infrastructure and customer service capabilities at reasonable cost; and the company's ability to maintain site stability and performance on all of its sites while adding new products and features in a timely fashion. The forward-looking statements in this release do not include the potential impact of any acquisitions or divestitures that may be announced and/or completed after the date hereof.

To supplement the company's condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, eBay uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net revenue excluding Skype, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income excluding Skype, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share excluding Skype, non-GAAP effective tax rate, and free cash flow.
These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with eBay's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. These measures should only be used to evaluate eBay's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.
Reconciliation to the nearest GAAP measure of all non-GAAP measures included in this press release can be found in the tables included on pages 11, 13 and 14 of this press release.
These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of the company's current financial performance and the company's prospects for the future. Specifically, the company believes the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses or net purchases of property and equipment, as the case may be, that may not be indicative of its core operating results and business outlook. In addition, because eBay has historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, the company believes that the inclusion of non-GAAP measures provides consistency in the company's financial reporting.
For its internal budgeting process, and as discussed further below, eBay's management uses financial measures that do not include stock-based compensation expense, employer payroll taxes on stock-based compensation, amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, significant gains or losses from the disposal of a business, restructuring-related charges and the income taxes associated with the foregoing. In addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, eBay's management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures in reviewing the financial results of eBay.
eBay excludes the following items from non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP effective tax rate:
This expense consists of expenses for stock options, restricted stock and employee stock purchases. eBay excludes stock-based compensation expenses from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses that management does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results. eBay also excludes its proportionate share of Skype's stock-based compensation expense.
Stock-based compensation expense.
This amount is dependent on eBay's stock price and the timing and size of exercises by employees of their stock options and the vesting of their restricted stock, over which management has limited to no control, and as such management does not believe it correlates to eBay's operation of the business.
Employer payroll taxes on stock-based compensation.
eBay incurs amortization or impairments of acquired intangible assets and goodwill in connection with acquisitions and may incur significant gains or losses from the disposal of a business and therefore excludes these amounts from its non-GAAP measures. eBay also excludes its proportionate share of Skype's amortization of acquired intangibles expense. eBay also settled a legal exposure in conjunction with the disposal of a business and excludes this settlement payment. In addition, eBay's results are also impacted by hedge transactions related to unique movements of cash from significant business acquisitions or dispositions. eBay excludes these items because management does not believe they have any direct correlation to the current operating results of eBay's business.
Amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets, impairment of goodwill and significant gains or losses from the disposal of a business.
These charges consist of expenses for employee severance and other exit and disposal costs. eBay excludes restructuring charges primarily because management does not believe they are reflective of ongoing operating results.
Restructuring.
This amount is used to present stock-based compensation and the other amounts described above on an after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP net income.
Income taxes associated with certain non-GAAP entries.
The presentation of non-GAAP net income excluding Skype and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share excluding Skype also excludes, in addition to the amounts described above, Skype's 2009 results of operations, which were consolidated in the company's 2009 results through the date of sale (November 19, 2009). The presentation of non-GAAP net revenue excluding Skype excludes Skype's 2009 net revenue, which was consolidated in the company's 2009 net revenue through the date of sale.
        In addition to the non-GAAP measures discussed above, eBay also uses free cash flow. Free cash flow represents operating cash flows less net purchases of property and equipment. eBay considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases of property, buildings, and equipment, which can then be used to, among other things, invest in eBay's business, make strategic acquisitions, and repurchase stock. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the company's cash balance for the period.
