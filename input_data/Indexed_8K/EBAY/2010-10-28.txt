In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and such indemnified party seeks or intends to seek indemnity from an indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall elect, jointly with all other indemnifying parties similarly notified, by written notice delivered to the indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, such indemnified party shall have the right to employ its own counsel in any such action and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party, unless: (i) the employment of such counsel has been specifically authorized in writing by the indemnifying party; (ii) the indemnifying party has failed promptly to assume the defense and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party; or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both such indemnified party and the indemnifying party or any affiliate of the indemnifying party, and such indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that either (x) there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party or such affiliate of the indemnifying party or (y) a conflict may exist between such indemnified party and the indemnifying party or such affiliate of the indemnifying party (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to a single firm of local counsel) for all such indemnified parties, which firm shall be designated in writing by BAS and that all such reasonable fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred). Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of such indemnifying party's election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence, in which case the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party.

(d) The indemnifying party under this Section 8 shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such

No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
S 9. If the indemnification provided for in Section 8 is for any reason held to be unavailable to or otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party, as incurred, as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the front cover page of the Prospectus bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Notes as set forth on such cover. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or the Underwriters, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.

The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several, and not joint, in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments as set forth opposite their names in Schedule A. For purposes of this Section 9, each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company with the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.

If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase such Notes and the aggregate principal amount of such Notes with respect to which such default occurs exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Notes are not made within 48 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability of any party to any other party except that the provisions of Sections 4, 6, 8, 9 and 17 shall at all times be effective and shall survive such termination. In any such case, either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days in order that the required changes, if any, to the Registration Statement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or any other documents or arrangements may be effected.

Any termination pursuant to this Section 11 shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Sections 4 and 6 hereof, and provided further that Sections 4, 6, 8, 9 and 17 shall survive such termination and remain in full force and effect.

The Trustee shall at any time, and from time to time, authenticate Securities for original issue in the principal amount provided in the Board Resolution, supplemental indenture hereto or Officers' Certificate, upon receipt by the Trustee of a Company Order. Such Company Order may authorize authentication and delivery pursuant to electronic instructions from the Company or its duly authorized agent or agents. If all the Securities of any one Series are not to be originally issued at one time and if a Board Resolution, a supplemental indenture hereto or an Officers' Certificate shall so permit, such Company Order may set forth the procedures for the issuance and authentication of such Securities. Each Security shall be dated the date of its

The aggregate principal amount of Securities of any Series outstanding at any time may not exceed any limit upon the maximum principal amount for such Series set forth in the Board Resolution, supplemental indenture hereto or Officers' Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 2.2, except as provided in such Section 2.2 or Sections 2.8 and 2.9.

The Trustee shall have the right to decline to authenticate and deliver any Securities of such Series: (a) if the Trustee, being advised by counsel, determines that such action may not be taken lawfully; or (b) if the Trustee in good faith by a Responsible Officer shall determine that such action would expose the Trustee to personal liability to Holders of any then outstanding Series of Securities.
The Trustee may, with the prior written consent of the Company, appoint an authenticating agent acceptable to the Company to authenticate Securities. An authenticating agent may authenticate Securities whenever the Trustee may do so. Each reference in this Indenture to authentication by the Trustee includes authentication by such agent. An authenticating agent has the same rights as an Agent to deal with the Company or an Affiliate of the Company.

To permit registrations of transfers and exchanges, the Trustee shall authenticate Securities at the Registrar's request. No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange (except as otherwise expressly permitted herein), but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith (other than any such tax or other governmental charge payable upon exchanges pursuant to Sections 2.11, 3.7 or 9.6).
Transfer and Exchange
Neither the Company nor the Registrar shall be required (a) to issue, register the transfer of, or exchange Securities of any Series during the period beginning at the opening of business fifteen days immediately preceding the mailing of a notice of redemption of Securities of that Series selected for redemption and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing, or (b) to register the transfer of or exchange Securities (or portions thereof) of any Series selected, called or being called for redemption, or, if applicable, surrendered for repurchase by the Company at the option of the Holders, except any portion thereof not so selected, called, being called or surrendered.
Section 2.8 . If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same Series and of like tenor, terms and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities
If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (a) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (b) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon its request the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of the same Series and of like tenor, terms and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.

Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
Every new Security of any Series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time
 
enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that Series duly issued hereunder.

If any Security is converted into or exchanged for common stock or other securities as contemplated by this Indenture and the terms of such Security, such Security ceases to be outstanding on the date of such conversion or exchange, as the case may be.
A Security does not cease to be outstanding because the Company or an Affiliate of the Company holds the Security.
In determining whether the Holders of the requisite principal amount of outstanding Securities have given any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver or taken any other action hereunder or in respect of such Securities, the principal amount of a Discount Security that shall be deemed to be outstanding for such purposes shall be the amount of the principal thereof that would be due and payable as of the date of such determination upon acceleration of the Maturity thereof pursuant to Section 6.2.
Section 2.10 . In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of Securities or of Securities of a Series have concurred in any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or any other action, Securities of a Series owned by the Company or any Affiliate of the Company shall be disregarded, except that for the purposes of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver, only Securities that the Trustee knows are so owned shall be so disregarded.
Treasury Securities
Section 2.11 . Until definitive Securities are ready for delivery, the Company may prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate temporary Securities upon a Company Order. Temporary Securities shall be substantially in the form of definitive Securities but may have variations that the Company considers appropriate for temporary Securities.

Section 2.12 . The Company at any time may deliver Securities to the Trustee for cancellation. The Registrar and the Paying Agent shall forward to the Trustee any Securities surrendered to them for registration of transfer, exchange or payment.

The Company may not issue new Securities to replace Securities that it has paid or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.
Cancellation
Section 2.13 .

The Company shall fix the special record date and payment date. At least 10 days before the special record date, the Company shall give notice to the Trustee and to each Securityholder of the Series of the special record date, the payment date and the amount of interest to be paid. The Company may pay defaulted interest in any other lawful manner.

Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 2.2 with respect to the Securities of any Series, the Global Securities of any Series shall be exchangeable pursuant to Section 2.7 of this Indenture for Physical Securities of such Series in an equal aggregate principal amount and of like tenor and terms registered in the names of Holders other than the Depositary for such Global Securities or its nominee only if (a) the Company receives notice from such Depositary that it is unwilling or unable to continue as
Transfer and Exchange
 
Depositary for the Global Securities of such Series or if such Depositary ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act, and, in either case, the Company fails to appoint a successor Depositary for the Global Securities of such Series registered as a clearing agency under the Exchange Act within 90 days after the date the Company receives such notice or learns that such Depositary has ceased to be so registered, (b) the Company, in its sole discretion, determines that the Global Securities of such Series shall be exchanged (in whole but not in part) for Securities of such Series in certificated form and delivers to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate to such effect, or (c) an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of such Series shall have occurred and shall be continuing. Any Global Security of a Series that is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be exchangeable for Physical Securities of the same Series registered in such names as the Depositary shall direct in writing in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security of such Series being exchanged and with like tenor and terms. The Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery, in exchange for a Global Security or any portion thereof being exchanged for Physical Securities, a like aggregate principal amount of Physical Securities of the same series of authorized denominations and of like tenor and terms as the Global Security or portion thereof to be exchanged, subject, however, to the provisions of the second paragraph of Section 2.7 of this Indenture. Promptly following any such exchange in part, such Global Security shall, at the option of the Company, either be returned by the Trustee to such Depositary (or its custodian) and the Trustee shall endorse such Global Security to reflect the decrease in the principal amount thereof resulting from such exchange or such Global Security shall be exchanged for another Global Security in a principal amount reflecting the decrease in such principal amount resulting from such exchange. If a Physical Security is issued in exchange for any portion of a Global Security after the close of business on (i) any record date for such Security and before the opening of business on the next interest payment date for such Security, or (ii) any special record date for such Security and before the opening of business on the related proposed date for payment of interest or defaulted interest thereon, as the case may be, interest shall not be payable on such interest payment date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, in respect of such Physical Security, but shall be payable on such interest payment date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, only to the person to whom interest in respect of such portion of such Global Security shall be payable in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture and such Security.
2.15.3 . Any Global Security issued hereunder shall bear such legend as the Company may deem appropriate or as the Depositary may require.
Legend
2.15.4 .

The Trustee shall make the selection from Securities of the Series outstanding not previously called for redemption. Securities of the Series and portions of them it selects shall be in amounts of $1,000 or whole multiples of $1,000 (or in such other authorized denominations as may be provided as contemplated by Section 2.2), provided that the remaining principal amount of any Security

Replacement of Trustee
The Trustee may resign with respect to the Securities of one or more Series by so notifying the Company at least 30 days (or such shorter time as the Trustee deems necessary, provided a successor Trustee is in place) prior to the date of the proposed resignation. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities of any Series may remove the Trustee with respect to that Series by so notifying the Trustee and the Company.

If a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any one or more Series does not take office within 60 days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee, the Company or the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities of the applicable Series may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee.
A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company. Immediately after that, the retiring Trustee shall transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee subject to the lien provided for in
 
Section 7.7, the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee with respect to each Series of Securities for which it is acting as Trustee under this Indenture. A successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to each Securityholder of each such Series. Notwithstanding replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this Section 7.8, the Company's obligations under Section 7.7 hereof shall continue for the benefit of the retiring Trustee with respect to expenses and liabilities incurred by it prior to such replacement.
Section 7.9 . If the Trustee consolidates with, merges or converts into, or transfers all or substantially all of its corporate trust business to, another person, the successor person without any further act shall be the successor Trustee.
