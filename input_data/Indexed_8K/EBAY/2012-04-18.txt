Exhibit 99.1
eBAY INC. REPORTS STRONG FIRST QUARTER 2012 RESULTS
Revenue and Net Income up Double Digits Year Over Year as PayPal and Marketplaces Momentum Continues
SAN JOSE, Calif.
,
April 18, 2012
 - Global commerce platform and payments leader eBay Inc. (Nasdaq: EBAY) today reported that revenue for the
first
quarter ended
March 31, 2012
, increased
29%
to
$3.3 billion
, compared to the same period of
2011
. The company reported
first
quarter net income on a GAAP basis of
$570 million
, or
$0.44
per diluted share, and non-GAAP net income of
$725 million
, or
$0.55
per diluted share. The year-over-year increase in
first
quarter GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was driven primarily by strong top-line growth, partially offset by increased investment in the shopping experience and the impact of acquisitions.
The first quarter was a strong start to the year for us with momentum continuing in our Marketplaces, PayPal and GSI Commerce businesses," said eBay Inc. President and CEO John Donahoe. "We believe that innovation in retail today is technology driven, and consumers are embracing smarter, easier, better ways to shop. We are enabling commerce in this new retail environment, supporting and partnering with sellers of all sizes and giving consumers worldwide the ability to shop anytime, anywhere, for whatever they want.
The company's PayPal business delivered strong first quarter performance. PayPal ended the quarter with 109.8 million active registered accounts, a 12% increase over the first quarter of 2011. PayPal revenue increased 32% year over year, driven primarily by increased penetration on eBay as well as continued merchant and consumer adoption. PayPal's net total payment volume (TPV) grew 24% year over year to $34 billion. PayPal continues to invest in innovation, focusing on its core platform as well as mobile and point of sale initiatives. PayPal expects to process $7 billion in mobile TPV in 2012. PayPal launched an expansion of its payment services to offline merchants in the first quarter. The Home Depot has launched PayPal payments in all of its nearly 2,000 U.S. stores, giving shoppers the opportunity to pay using just their mobile phone number or PayPal payment card and PIN. Users can switch between paying with their phone or payment card at any time. The company also launched PayPal Here in the U.S., Australia, Canada and Hong Kong. With PayPal Here, small businesses can now process almost any form of payment online or offline, including credit and debit cards, checks and PayPal using only a smartphone.  
The company's Marketplaces business also delivered strong first quarter performance. Gross merchandise volume (GMV) excluding vehicles increased 12% year over year to $16 billion. Sold items increased 17% compared to the first quarter of 2011, reflecting the continued impact of improvements to eBay's core technology that are designed to make it easier and faster for shoppers to browse and buy. U.S. GMV excluding vehicles increased 13% year over year as sold items growth, mobile engagement and momentum in fashion and parts & accessories were key drivers of growth in the first quarter. Fixed price GMV, which represented 64% of total GMV in the first quarter, grew 18% globally year over year, a four-point acceleration compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. International GMV excluding vehicles increased 11% year over year to $10 billion, reflecting improved performance in Korea and solid growth in Europe. Downloads of eBay's suite of mobile apps surpassed 12 million in the first quarter and 78 million globally since the launch of mobile in the third quarter of 2008. eBay expects to generate $8 billion in mobile volume transacted in 2012.
The company's GSI business, which was acquired in the second quarter of 2011, contributed $237 million in revenue for the first quarter. GSI generated $715 million in global ecommerce (GeC) merchandise sales during the quarter. Same store sales grew 26% year over year, reflecting strong ecommerce sales from retail clients.

eBay Inc.
Non-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance
To supplement the company's condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, eBay uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate, and free cash flow.
These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with eBay's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. These measures should only be used to evaluate eBay's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.
Reconciliation to the nearest GAAP measure of all non-GAAP measures included in this press release can be found in the tables included in this press release.
These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of the company's current financial performance and the company's prospects for the future. Specifically, the company believes the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses or net purchases of property and equipment, as the case may be, that may not be indicative of its core operating results and business outlook. In addition, because eBay has historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, the company believes that the inclusion of non-GAAP measures provides consistency in the company's financial reporting.
For its internal budgeting process, and as discussed further below, eBay's management uses financial measures that do not include stock-based compensation expense, employer payroll taxes on stock-based compensation, amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, significant gains or losses from the disposal/acquisition of a business, restructuring-related charges and the income taxes associated with the foregoing. In addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, eBay's management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures in reviewing the financial results of eBay.
eBay excludes the following items from non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP effective tax rate:
Stock-based compensation expense.
This expense consists of expenses for stock options, restricted stock and employee stock purchases. eBay excludes stock-based compensation expenses from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses that management does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results. eBay also excludes its proportionate share of Skype's stock-based compensation expense.
Employer payroll taxes on stock-based compensation.
This amount is dependent on eBay's stock price and the timing and size of exercises by employees of their stock options and the vesting of their restricted stock, over which management has limited to no control, and as such management does not believe it correlates to eBay's operation of the business.
Amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets, impairment of goodwill and significant gains or losses and transaction expenses from the acquisition or disposal of a business.
eBay incurs amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill in connection with acquisitions and may incur significant gains or losses from the acquisition or disposal of a business and therefore excludes these amounts from its non-GAAP measures. eBay also excludes its proportionate share of Skype's amortization of acquired intangibles expense. eBay also settled a legal exposure in conjunction with the acquisition of a business and excludes this settlement payment. In addition, eBay's results are also impacted by hedge transactions related to unique movements of cash from significant business acquisitions or dispositions. eBay excludes the impact of the accretion of a note receivable associated with the disposal of certain businesses. eBay excludes these items because management does not believe they correlate to the ongoing operating results of eBay's business.
Restructuring.
These charges consist of expenses for employee severance and other exit and disposal costs. eBay excludes restructuring charges primarily because management does not believe they are reflective of ongoing operating results.
Income taxes associated with certain non-GAAP entries.
This amount is used to present stock-based compensation and the other amounts described above on an after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP net income
.
In addition to the non-GAAP measures discussed above, eBay also uses free cash flow. Free cash flow represents operating cash flows less net purchases of property and equipment. eBay considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases of property, buildings, and equipment, which can then be used to, among other things, invest in eBay's business, make strategic acquisitions, and repurchase stock. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the company's cash balance for the period.
