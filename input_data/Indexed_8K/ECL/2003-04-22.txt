Per share amounts do not necessarily sum due to rounding.
Income for the first quarter of last year was reduced by several unusual items.  See the schedule of  "Supplemental 2002 Diluted Earnings Per Share Information."
ST. PAUL, Minn., April 22, 2003:  Leveraging the continuing growth trends of global foodservice customers, Ecolab's first quarter more than offset slowing economic activity as diluted net income per share increased 56% to $0.42 for the quarter ended March 31, 2003.
 
Ecolab's consolidated sales increased 11% to a record $876 million in 2003's first quarter.  Net income rose 58% to a record $55 million.  Diluted net income per share of $0.42 for the first quarter of 2003 increased 14 percent over last year's $0.37 pro forma earnings per share from ongoing operations. (Details are in the schedule "Supplemental 2002 Diluted Earnings Per Share Information" located at the end of this news release.)  The increase in net income reflected higher sales volume and good cost containment.  Currency translation had a favorable impact on net income of approximately $2 million.
 
Commenting on the quarter, Allan L. Schuman, Ecolab's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer said, "We are very pleased with the first quarter's results.  We posted good growth in our core businesses, offsetting the effects of the soft global economies.  This was accomplished through the very committed and aggressive efforts of our associates, who relentlessly pursued new accounts, utilizing an array of new products and services, focusing on new solutions for customer problems, and leveraging the diversity of our customer base to outperform economic uncertainty to achieve their targeted results.
 
"While 2003 may hold economic challenges, we are committed to achieving our goals and continuing our history of outperformance.  We have substantial opportunities to grow share in our core operations, we have introduced a series of new businesses which we are developing and have solid growth prospects, and we are actively pursuing new opportunities to add to our portfolio.  Further, we are continuing to aggressively seek out new accounts in all of our areas, and develop new products and services to meet our existing customer needs.  We continue to develop and expand Ecolab's range of premium service solutions, as well as enhance our growth prospects for 2003 and the future.  We are a company that is clearly focused on superior performance, both for our customers and our shareholders, and are working very aggressively to deliver the results."
 
First quarter sales for Ecolab's United States Cleaning & Sanitizing operations rose 6% over the first quarter of 2002 to $417 million, led by solid gains in Institutional, Kay and Professional Products operations.  Ecolab's United States Cleaning & Sanitizing operating income rose 8% to $70 million, reflecting the higher sales, new products, aggressive sales efforts and close attention to costs.
United States Other Services sales increased 4% to $73 million in the first quarter.  Operating income in the first quarter of 2003 declined 31% to $4 million. An improved performance by Pest Elimination was offset by GCS, where soft sales and the focus on infrastructure development for future growth impacted results.
 
Sales of Ecolab's International Cleaning & Sanitizing operations rose 6% in the first quarter when measured at fixed currency rates. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, sales rose 3%.  Latin America sales showed strong growth, though much was offset by the impact of turmoil in Venezuela.  Fixed currency operating income rose a strong 20% to $26 million.  The income improvement was due to cost controls and the higher sales volumes. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, fixed currency International operating income increased 33%.
 
Ecolab reacquired 180,000 shares of its common stock during the first quarter.
 
Business Outlook
 
The following statements are based on current expectations.  These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.  These statements do not include the potential impact of business acquisitions or other material corporate transactions, which may be completed after the date of this release.  This Business Outlook section should be read in conjunction with the information on "Forward-Looking Statements" at the end of this release.
 
Ecolab expects sales for both domestic and international operations (in fixed currencies) to increase in the second quarter 2003 over the second quarter 2002. Gross margins are expected to remain steady when compared with last year's second quarter in the 51% range, and selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to be similar to last year's 38% of sales.  Interest expense is likely to be in the $11-$12 million area.  The effective tax rate should be around 39%.  Overall, currency translation is expected to contribute to second quarter earnings.  Earnings per share are expected to be in the $0.48-$0.52 range in the second quarter.  Full year earnings per share continue to be expected to rise 10% - 13% to the $2.05 area.
 
With sales of $3.4 billion, Ecolab is a global developer and marketer of premium cleaning, sanitizing, pest elimination, maintenance and repair products for the hospitality, foodservice, institutional and industrial markets

The non-GAAP financial measures in the foregoing table are provided to assist in the reader's understanding of the comparability of the company's operations for 2003 and 2002.  The company believes that 2002 pro forma income from ongoing operations, a non-GAAP financial measure, is a useful basis to compare the company's 2003 results against, because certain unusual items during 2002 impacted the company's reported net income.  The following presentation reconciles as reported net income (U.S. GAAP amounts) to pro forma income from ongoing operations for the full year and quarters ended March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, 2002. The information was originally presented in the company's 2002 quarterly earnings releases
 
The pro forma information should not be construed as an alternative to reported results under U.S. GAAP.
