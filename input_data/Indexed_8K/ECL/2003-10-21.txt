Income for 2002 was reduced by several unusual items.  See the attached schedule of "Supplemental 2002 Diluted Earnings per Share Information."
ST. PAUL, Minn., October 21, 2003:  Strong international profit growth and continued domestic sales gains, along with favorable currency trends and a lower effective tax rate, propelled results in Ecolab's third quarter ended September 30, 2003 as diluted net income per share rose 18% to $0.33 per share.  (All share and per share results discussed in this release are adjusted to reflect the company's two-for-one stock split paid June 6, 2003.)
Ecolab's consolidated sales increased 10% to a record $983 million in 2003's third quarter. Net income rose 21% to a record $87 million.  Third quarter net income included an after-tax gain of $6.2 million on the previously announced sale of an equity interest in Comac (a floor machine manufacturer based in Italy) and special charges.  The special charges include approximately $1.7 million of after-tax expense related to a change in the amount of goodwill allocated to the Darenas business (a janitorial distribution business based in the United Kingdom) which was sold earlier this year and $0.3 million of after-tax reductions in restructuring expense. Pro forma diluted earnings per share, adjusted for the gain and special charges, was $0.32 for the third quarter and increased 14 percent over last year's $0.28 per share. (See the schedule of "Supplemental 2002 Diluted Earnings per Share Information" located at the end of this news release.)  Currency translation had a favorable impact on net income of approximately $4 million for the third quarter of 2003.
Commenting on the quarter, Allan L. Schuman, Ecolab's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer said, "Third quarter earnings from ongoing operations came in at the top end of our $0.30-$0.32 forecast.  We worked hard in the quarter against continued tough market conditions to produce improved sales and a healthy earnings performance, led by our international operations.  Our focus on leveraging our broad market opportunities while improving operating margins in these challenging times demonstrates again the strength and balance of our business and strategy, and the commitment of our people to get the job done.
 "We are confident in our outlook for solid earnings gains in the fourth quarter, which would yield another year of double-digit sales and earnings growth in 2003.  We are determined to do what it takes to ensure our strong growth trends will continue for years to come, as we invest and drive results in our established businesses while at the same time continue to invest and build our developing businesses' long-term growth and profit potential.  We remain dedicated in our efforts to build on and improve the levels of performance that made us the global leader, and you can be assured this commitment will continue in 2004  and beyond."
Third quarter sales for Ecolab's United States Cleaning & Sanitizing operations rose 4%
to $445 million, as good gains in Kay and Professional Products led growth.  Ecolab's United States Cleaning & Sanitizing operating income rose 3% to $82 million as the benefits of new products and cost efficiencies were partially offset by higher operating costs and sales force investments and training.
United States Other Services sales increased 2% to $83 million in the third quarter.  Operating income declined 19% to $9 million. Continued good growth by Pest Elimination was offset by GCS, where the transition to a new centralized administration center adversely affected results.
Sales of Ecolab's International Cleaning & Sanitizing operations rose 5% to $400 million in the third quarter when measured at fixed currency rates. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, sales rose 2%.  Latin America sales showed double-digit growth.  Europe's sales results strengthened moderately, while Asia Pacific sales were flat.  Fixed currency operating income rose 17% to $49 million as margins increased through improved business mix as well as careful management of costs.  At public currency rates, International Cleaning and Sanitizing sales increased 17% and operating income grew 31%.
Ecolab reacquired 2.7 million shares of its common stock during the third quarter.
 
Business Outlook
 
The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.  These statements do not include the potential impact of business acquisitions, divestitures or other material corporate transactions, which may be completed after the date of this release.  This Business Outlook section should be read in conjunction with the information on "Forward Looking Statements" at the end of this release.
Ecolab expects sales for both domestic and international operations (in fixed currencies) to increase in the fourth quarter 2003 over the fourth quarter 2002. Gross margins are expected to be in the 51% range, and selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to be around 38% of sales.  Interest expense is expected to be approximately $11 million.  The effective tax rate should be approximately 39%.  Overall, currency translation is expected to contribute to fourth quarter earnings.  Earnings per share from ongoing operations are expected to be in the $0.23-$0.25 range in the fourth quarter.
With 2002 sales of $3.4 billion, Ecolab is a global developer and marketer of premium cleaning, sanitizing, pest elimination, maintenance and repair products for the hospitality, foodservice, institutional and industrial markets

The non-GAAP financial measures in the table above are provided to assist in the reader's understanding of the comparability of the company's operations for 2003 and 2002. The company believes that 2002 pro forma income from ongoing operations, a non-GAAP financial measure, is a useful basis to compare the company's 2003 results against, because four unusual items during 2002 impacted the company's reported net income (see "pro forma adjustments" in table above).  The presentation above reconciles as reported net income (U.S. GAAP amounts) to pro forma income from ongoing operations for the full year and quarters and interim year-to-date periods ended March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, 2002. The information was originally presented in the company's 2002 quarterly earnings releases and reflects the impact of the company's two-for-one stock split paid June 6, 2003.
 
The pro forma information should not be construed as an alternative to reported results under U.S. GAAP.
