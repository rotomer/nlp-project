Per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted for the two-for-one stock split paid June 6, 2003.  Per share amounts do not necessarily sum due to changes in shares outstanding and rounding.   Pro Forma Income from Ongoing Operations, a non-GAAP financial measure, is provided to assist in the reader's understanding of the comparability of the company's results for 2002 and 2003.  Net income for the year ended December 31, 2003 included a $0.03 gain on the sale of an equity investment and special charges which were not significant and therefore are not reflected in the table above.  In addition, income for 2002 was impacted by several unusual items.  See the attached schedule of "Supplemental Diluted Earnings per Share Information."
ST. PAUL, Minn., February 6, 2003:  Strong profit growth from its European operations and improving U.S. Cleaning & Sanitizing profitability, along with favorable currency trends and a lower effective tax rate, spurred results as diluted net income per share rose 37% to $0.26 per share in Ecolab's fourth quarter ended December 31, 2003.  (All share and per share results discussed in this release are adjusted to reflect the company's two-for-one stock split paid June 6, 2003.)
Ecolab's consolidated sales increased 8% to a record $956 million in 2003's fourth quarter. Net income increased 32% to a record $67 million.  Fourth quarter 2002 net income included special charges related to restructuring and cost saving actions.  Excluding those special charges from 2002 results, fourth quarter 2003 diluted earnings per share increased 18%.   Currency translation had a favorable impact on net income of approximately $4.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2003.
Commenting on the quarter, Allan L. Schuman, Ecolab's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer said, "Excellent margin improvement in our European and U.S. Cleaning & Sanitizing operations led the way as we turned in outstanding profits in the fourth quarter.  Conditions in certain of our businesses, including those serving the industrial markets, continued to be challenging in the quarter, but our ability to leverage our wide range of market opportunities while at the same time improve operating margins demonstrates once again the strength and balance of our business and strategy. At the same time we achieved these strong earnings gains, we also made important progress in developing our newer businesses.  Overall, it was an impressive performance and we are very pleased with the net results and the way in which we set ourselves up for future growth.
"We believe 2004 will yield an improving business environment.  We are seeing continued improving trends in our key restaurant and lodging markets, and are ready and eager to fully exploit them.  Ecolab entered 2004 with an excellent array of new and differentiated products, and are making key investments in our sales and service organization.  Our financial position is strong and we are using it wisely as we actively pursue acquisitions and related strategic business development opportunities. We have also strengthened our management team through internal development and selective additions from outside the company.   In short, we believe Ecolab is positioned to again outperform the industry and achieve strong earnings growth in 2004.  We are excited by the opportunities before us."
Fourth quarter sales for Ecolab's United States Cleaning & Sanitizing operations rose 2% to $401 million, while operating income rose 6% to $61 million as the benefits of an improved business mix and cost efficiencies offset sales force investments and training.
United States Other Services sales increased 4% to $81 million in the fourth quarter.  Operating income declined to $2 million. Continued growth by Pest Elimination was offset by GCS, where transition costs related to a new centralized administration center adversely affected results.
Sales of Ecolab's International Cleaning & Sanitizing operations when measured at fixed currency rates rose 2% to $410 million in the fourth quarter. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, sales rose 3%.  Asia Pacific and Latin America sales showed good sales gains.  Fixed currency operating income rose 19% to $47 million, led by Europe, primarily due to an improved business and product mix as well as careful management of costs.  Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, fixed currency operating income rose 13%.  At public currency rates, International Cleaning and Sanitizing sales increased 15% and operating income grew 37%.
During the fourth quarter, Ecolab made voluntary cash contributions to its pension plan totaling $75 million. 
Ecolab reacquired approximately 1.1 million shares of its common stock during the fourth quarter.  Share repurchases totaled 8 million for the full year.
 
Business Outlook
 
The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.  These statements do not include the potential impact of business acquisitions, divestitures or other material corporate transactions, which may be completed after the date of this release.  This Business Outlook section should be read in conjunction with the information on "Forward Looking Statements" at the end of this release and in our periodic reports.
Ecolab expects sales for both domestic and international operations (in fixed currencies) to increase in the first quarter 2004 over the first quarter 2003. Gross margins are expected to be around 51%, and selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to be slightly higher than the 39.3% of sales recorded in the first quarter of 2003.    Interest expense is expected to be
approximately $13 million.  The effective tax rate should be approximately 37.5%.  Overall, currency translation is expected to contribute to first quarter earnings.  Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the $0.23-$0.25 range in the first quarter of 2004. 
For the full year ending December 31, 2004, Ecolab expects diluted earnings per share to increase to the $1.14-$1.17 range compared with as reported net income per share of $1.06 and the $1.03 earned from ongoing operations in 2003.
With 2003 sales of $3.8 billion, Ecolab is the leading global developer and marketer of premium cleaning, sanitizing, pest elimination, maintenance and repair products for the hospitality, foodservice, institutional and industrial markets

The non-GAAP financial measures in the tables above are provided to assist in the reader's understanding of the comparibility of the company's operations for 2002 and 2003.  The company believes that pro forma income from ongoing operations, a non-GAAP financial measure, is a useful basis to compare the company's results against, because several unusual items during 2002 and 2003 impacted the company's reported net income (see "pro forma adjustments" in table above).  The presentation above reconciles as reported net income (U.S. GAAP amounts) to pro forma income from ongoing operations for the full year and quarters ended March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, 2002 and 2003.  The information was originally presented in the company's quarterly earning releases and reflects the impact of the company's two-for-one stock split paid June 6, 2003.
 
The pro forma information should not be constured as an alternative to reported results under U.S. GAAP.
