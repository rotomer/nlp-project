ST. PAUL, Minn., July 22, 2004:  Continued growth in its domestic and international businesses led Ecolab's results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2004, as diluted earnings per share rose 20% to $0.30 per share.
 
Ecolab's consolidated sales increased 10% to a record $1 billion in 2004's second quarter.  Net income rose 17% to a record $78 million.  Diluted net income per share of $0.30 for the second quarter of 2004 increased 20 percent over last year's $0.25 net income per share.  Currency translation had a favorable impact on net income of approximately $2.5 million for the second quarter of 2004.
 
Commenting on the quarter, Douglas M. Baker, Ecolab's President and Chief Executive Officer said, "The second quarter results were outstanding as we continued to outpace recovering markets and leverage a strong slate of new product offerings.  We did this through the hard work of our outstanding sales and service force, careful management of expenses, and our ongoing commitment to performance excellence.  We remained focused on execution and it shows in our results.
 
"Our strong earnings underscore our confidence that we will achieve yet another year of double-digit growth in 2004. Though unlikely to match the first half's very strong growth, we nonetheless continue to expect further good earnings gains in the remaining quarters as our improving sales momentum and divisional operations more than offset less favorable comparisons for currencies and reduced benefits from lower tax rates in the second half.  We remain focused on delivering the industry's best products and service solutions to our customers, continuing to follow our Circle the Customer strategy to bring new opportunities for growth, and relentlessly driving for improved service and operating excellence.  Ecolab has a strong tradition for unbeatable customer service, expanding its market opportunities and delivering consistent, reliable double-digit growth and superior returns for its shareholders, and we will focus all our efforts to continuing that in the years ahead."
 
Second quarter sales for Ecolab's United States Cleaning & Sanitizing operations rose 5% to $451 million, as gains in Institutional and Kay led the growth.  Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, sales rose 4% for the quarter. Ecolab's United States Cleaning & Sanitizing operating income also rose 5% to $75 million as the higher volume, new products and cost efficiencies were partially offset by sales force and other investments.
United States Other Services sales increased 4% to $86 million in the second quarter.  Operating income grew 20% to $8 million due to an improved performance by Pest Elimination.
 
Sales of Ecolab's International Cleaning & Sanitizing operations rose 8% in the second quarter when measured at fixed currency rates to $486 million. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, sales rose 4%.  Latin America sales showed double-digit growth, while both Europe/Africa/Middle East and Asia Pacific reported attractive gains.  Fixed currency operating income rose 12% to $50 million as margins improved in all regions through new products and programs as well as careful management of costs.  At public currency rates, International Cleaning & Sanitizing sales increased 17% and operating income grew 23%.
 
Ecolab reacquired 180,000 shares of its common stock during the second quarter.

Per share amounts do not necessarily sum due to changes in shares outstanding and rounding.
 
The non-GAAP financial measures in the tables above are provided to assist in the reader's understanding of the comparibility of the company's operations for 2004 and 2003.  The company believes that pro forma income from ongoing operations, a non-GAAP financial measure, is a useful basis to compare the company's results against, because unusual items during 2004 and 2003 impacted the company's reported net income (see "pro forma adjustments" in table above).  The presentation above reconciles as reported net income (U.S. GAAP amounts) to pro forma income from ongoing operations for the quarters and interim year-to-date periods ended March 31, and June 30, 2004 and for the full year and quarters and interim year-to-date periods ended March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, 2003.  The information was originally presented in the company's quarterly earning releases and reflects the impact of the company's two-for-one stock split paid June 6, 2003.  Special charges includes reductions to prior restructuring expenses and losses related to the sale of product lines and businesses.  The pro forma information should not be construed as an alternative to reported results under U.S. GAAP.
