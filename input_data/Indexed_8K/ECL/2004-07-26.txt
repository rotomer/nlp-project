News Release
 
Ecolab Inc.

ST. PAUL, Minn., July 26, 2004:  Ecolab Inc. announced today that the anticipated share exchange ratio associated with its acquisition of Alcide Corporation is 0.6744, meaning Alcide stockholders will receive 0.6744 shares of Ecolab common stock for each share of Alcide common stock they hold.  As provided in the merger agreement between Ecolab and Alcide, the exchange ratio will equal $21.00 divided by the average closing price per share of Ecolab common stock on the New York Stock Exchange for each of the ten consecutive trading days ending five trading days prior to the closing date of the merger.  The anticipated exchange ratio assumes, and Ecolab expects, that the merger will close on July 30, 2004, the date of the special meeting of Alcide stockholders.  If the closing is delayed for any reason, then the exchange ratio would be calculated based on the actual closing date.
 
Alcide had approximately 2,717,000 shares outstanding at July 23, 2004.
 
With 2003 sales of $3.8 billion, Ecolab is the leading global developer and marketer of premium cleaning, sanitizing, pest elimination, maintenance and repair products and services for the hospitality, foodservice, institutional and industrial markets.
