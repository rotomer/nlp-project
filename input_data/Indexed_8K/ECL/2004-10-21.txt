ST. PAUL, Minn., October 21, 2004:  Continued growth in its domestic and international businesses, along with favorable currency and tax rates, led Ecolab's results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2004, as diluted net income per share rose to $0.36 per share, the top end of the company's $0.34-$0.36 forecasted range.
 
Ecolab's consolidated sales increased 11% to a record $1.1 billion in 2004's third quarter.  Net income rose to a record $95 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, representing a 9% gain over net income of $0.33 a year ago.  Third quarter 2004 net income included a $1.6 million charge for in-process research and development recorded as part of the July 30 acquisition of Alcide Corp, as well as an offsetting $1.9 million of favorable tax benefits related to prior periods.  In addition to the one-time tax benefits, the third quarter 2004 tax rate was reduced by lower international rates and tax savings efforts. Third quarter 2003 net income included an after-tax gain of $6.2 million on the sale of an equity interest in Comac (a floor machine manufacturer based in Italy) and $1.4 million of special charges.  Diluted earnings per share, adjusted for the gain and special charges, was $0.32 for 2003's third quarter. Third quarter 2004 net income per share increased 13% over last year's $0.32 from ongoing operations.  (See the schedule of "Supplemental Diluted Earnings per Share Information" located at the end of this news release.)  Currency translation had a favorable impact on net income of approximately $2.8 million for the third quarter of 2004.
 
Commenting on the quarter, Douglas M. Baker, Ecolab's President and Chief Executive Officer said, "Ecolab continues to drive strong current growth while making the right investments to bolster our future potential, and the third quarter was another great example of that powerful combination.  Our outstanding people, products and commitment to premium customer service once again fueled our progress, and we worked hard to further improve our execution, efficiency and pipeline for future growth.
 
"We look for excellent double-digit EPS growth for the full year 2004, and are using a portion of our earnings strength to make investments in our future during the fourth quarter.  We are increasing our sales and service force and making additional key investments in our infrastructure, information technology and product research and development areas to make sure we have the right tools to continue posting attractive growth for years ahead.  In addition, we continue to be aggressive in our pursuit of acquisitions to strengthen our existing business development and add important new offerings for our customer base in fulfillment of our Circle the Customer strategy.  While we face our share of business and market challenges, we have a long history of more than meeting them, and we
believe we have the right people and strategies in place to effectively manage what lies before us.  We remain excited by the outstanding opportunities we see in our markets, and we are energized by our prospects to achieve them.  We believe the outlook for Ecolab remains robust, and we expect continued strong growth for our future."
 
Third quarter sales for Ecolab's United States Cleaning & Sanitizing operations rose 8% to $478 million.  Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, sales rose 6% for the quarter, as gains in Institutional and Kay led the growth. Ecolab's United States Cleaning & Sanitizing operating income rose 5% to $86 million as the higher volume, new products and cost efficiencies were partially offset by sales force additions and product and technology investments.
 
United States Other Services sales increased 7% to $89 million in the third quarter.  Operating income declined to $7 million as an improved performance by Pest Elimination was offset by higher costs in the GCS kitchen equipment repair business, driven primarily by a charge related to the GCS transition to a centralized business model.
 
Sales of Ecolab's International Cleaning & Sanitizing operations rose 8% in the third quarter when measured at fixed currency rates to $498 million. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, sales rose 5%.  Asia Pacific and Latin America sales showed strong growth, while Europe/Africa/Middle East reported modest gains.  Fixed currency operating income rose 13% to $64 million as margins improved in most regions through new products and programs as well as careful management of costs.  At public currency rates, International Cleaning & Sanitizing sales increased 15% and operating income grew 21%.
 
Ecolab reacquired 2,069,600 shares of its common stock during the third quarter.

Ecolab expects sales for both domestic and international operations (in fixed currencies) to increase in the fourth quarter 2004 over the fourth quarter 2003. Gross margins are expected to approximate last year's 51% of sales, and selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to
be in the 39%-40% range.  The effective tax rate should be approximately 37% compared with 35% a year ago.  Overall, currency translation is expected to contribute to fourth quarter earnings.  Diluted earnings per share from ongoing operations are expected to be in the $0.26-$0.28 range in the fourth quarter of 2004.  Ecolab earned $0.26 per share from ongoing operations in the fourth quarter of 2003.  For the full year ending December 31, 2004, Ecolab continues to expect diluted earnings per share from ongoing operations will reach the $1.18-$1.20 rangeIn 2003, Ecolab reported diluted net income per share of $1.06; earnings from ongoing operations were $1.03.

The non-GAAP financial measures in the tables above are provided to assist in the reader's understanding of the comparability of the company's operations for 2004 and 2003. The company believes that pro forma income from ongoing operations, a non-GAAP financial measure, is a useful basis to compare the company's results against, because unusual items during 2004 and 2003 impacted the company's reported net income (see "pro forma adjustments" in table above). The presentation above reconciles as reported net income (U.S. GAAP amounts) to pro forma income from ongoing operations for the quarters and interim year-to-date periods ended March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2004 and for the full year and quarters and interim year-to-date periods ended March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, 2003. The information was originally presented in the company's quarterly earning releases and reflects the impact of the company's two-for-one stock split paid June 6, 2003. Special charges include reductions to prior restructuring expenses, losses related to the sale of a product line, a charge for in-process research and development and a favorable tax benefit related to prior periods. The pro forma information should not be construed as an alternative to reported results under U.S. GAAP.
