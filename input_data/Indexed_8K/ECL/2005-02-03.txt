Domestic and international sales gains lead growth and offset investments and higher tax rate
 
 
ST. PAUL, Minn., February 3, 2005:  Continued growth in its domestic and international businesses, along with favorable currency exchange, offset accelerated business investments, higher delivered product costs and a higher tax rate in Ecolab's results for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 as diluted net income per share rose to $0.27, the mid-point of the company's $0.26-$0.28 per share range.
 
Ecolab's consolidated sales increased 12% to a record $1.1 billion in 2004's fourth quarter.  Net income rose 6% to a record $71 million.  Net income per diluted share was $0.27, representing a 4% gain over $0.26 a year ago.  Results for the fourth quarter 2003 included $4.5 million of expense related to postretirement death benefits for retired executives.  Currency translation had a favorable impact on net income of approximately $3.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2004 compared with a $4.5 million benefit from currency last year.
 
Commenting on the quarter, Douglas M. Baker, Ecolab's President and Chief Executive Officer said, "The fourth quarter was right in line with our targets. We used the strong earnings momentum of 2004 to fund accelerated investments and to reduce promotions and sales incentives in the quarter while still delivering an outstanding year.  Importantly, we beat all three of our long term financial objectives in 2004: earnings per share growth from ongoing operations was 16% versus our 15% growth goal, return on beginning equity was 24% compared with our 20% target, and we sustained an "A" rated balance sheet, well above our objective of an investment grade rating.
 
"It was an outstanding year for Ecolab, our people and our shareholders as we delivered great results and used the momentum to invest in continued growth for the future.  Once again, exceptional execution by our sales and service force, another great slate of new products and the commitment of the Ecolab team led the way.
 
"The investments we made in 2004 have improved our prospects for the future.  We remain excited about our fundamental markets and growth opportunities as 2005 unfolds, and we have the plans in place to take advantage of them.  We accelerated sales and service force additions, adding to our already industry-leading team. Further, we will have more innovative new products in 2005 as we continue to drive for better, more effective and more efficient value-driven customer solutions.
 
"We feel well positioned as we move into 2005. Clearly, as in any year, we face challenges, and 2005 will be no exception.  Rising raw material costs, weak economies in Europe and currency
changes will require us to take effective offsetting actions as a management team.  However, Ecolab has consistently met such challenges in the past, and we expect to meet them once again in 2005.  We are already driving pricing where needed, focusing on cost savings and, as always, driving growth.
 
"We enter 2005 in good shape and ready for the challenges ahead.  We are focused on the tasks required to achieve what we expect will be another superior performance and record year."
 
Fourth quarter sales for Ecolab's United States Cleaning & Sanitizing operations rose 9% to $437 million.  Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, sales rose 7% for the quarter, as gains in Institutional and Kay led the growth.  Ecolab's United States Cleaning & Sanitizing operating income decreased 16% to $51 million.  Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, operating income declined 23%.   Planned investments in the sales and service force, technology, and research & development combined with higher delivered product costs, incentive-based compensation costs and a less favorable business mix more than offset sales growth and cost savings programs.
 
United States Other Services sales increased 7% to $86 million in the fourth quarter.  Operating income rose to $4 million as Pest Elimination showed good growth.  GCS showed modest improvement over last year.
 
Sales of Ecolab's International operations grew 8% in the fourth quarter when measured at fixed currency rates to $509 million.  Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, sales rose 4%.  Latin America sales showed strong growth, while Europe/Africa/Middle East and Asia Pacific reported modest gains.  Fixed currency operating income rose 10% to $62 million as margins improved in most regions through new products and programs as well as careful management of costs.  Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, operating income increased 7%.  At public currency rates, International sales increased 16% and operating income grew 20%.
 
Ecolab repurchased 1,062,600 shares of its common stock during the fourth quarter.
 
Business Outlook
 
The following statements are based on current expectations.  These statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially.  These statements do not include the potential impact of business acquisitions, divestitures, adoption of new financial accounting standards, or other material corporate events, which may be completed after the date of this release.  This Business Outlook section should be read in conjunction with the information on "Forward-Looking Statements" at the end of this release.
Ecolab expects sales for both domestic and international operations (in fixed currencies) to increase in the first quarter 2005 over the first quarter 2004.  Gross margins are expected to be in the range of 51% to 52% of sales, and selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to be in the 39% range.  The effective tax rate should approximate 2004's 36.8% full year rate from ongoing operations.  Overall, currency translation is expected to contribute to first quarter earnings.  Diluted earnings per share from ongoing operations are expected to be in the $0.27-$0.29 range in the first quarter of 2005.  Ecolab reported diluted net income per share of $0.25 in the first quarter of 2004; first quarter 2004 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.26 per share.  For the full year ending December 31, 2005, Ecolab expects diluted earnings per share from ongoing operations will reach the $1.30 to $1.34 range.
 
Beginning with the third quarter ending September 30, 2005, Ecolab plans to adopt SFAS 123(R), the new standard for expensing stock options.  The above forecasts for the first quarter and full year 2005 do not include any impact from the accounting rule changes.  As part of the transition to the new standard, Ecolab expects to restate its earnings history in line with the pro forma amounts historically disclosed in Ecolab's financial statements.  Ecolab expects to have these restated results available on Ecolab's website at www.ecolab.com/investor in the third quarter.

Per share amounts do not necessarily sum due to changes in shares outstanding and rounding.
 
The non-GAAP financial measures in the tables above are provided to assist in the reader's understanding of the comparability of the company's operations for 2004 and 2003. The company believes that pro forma income from ongoing operations, a non-GAAP financial measure, is a useful basis to compare the company's results against, because unusual items during 2004 and 2003 impacted the company's reported net income (see "pro forma adjustments" in table above). The presentation above reconciles as reported net income (U.S. GAAP amounts) to pro forma income from ongoing operations for the full year, quarters and interim year-to-date periods ended March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, 2004 and for the full year and quarters and interim year-to-date periods ended March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, 2003. The information was originally presented in the company's quarterly earning releases and reflects the impact of the company's two-for-one stock split paid June 6, 2003. Special charges includes reductions to prior restructuring expenses, losses related to the sale of a product line, a charge for in-process research and development and a favorable tax benefit related to prior periods. The pro forma information should not be construed as an alternative to reported results under U.S. GAAP.
