ST. PAUL, Minn., July 25, 2005:  Continued strong sales in its domestic and Latin American businesses, along with further sharp profit improvement in U.S. Other Services, led Ecolab's second quarter results to record levels for the period ended June 30, 2005.
 
Ecolab's consolidated sales increased 11% to a record $1.2 billion in 2005's second quarter. Net income increased 11% to a record $87 million, or $0.33 per diluted share.  Currency translation had a favorable impact on net income growth of approximately $ 2.8 million for the second quarter of 2005.
 
Commenting on the quarter, Douglas M. Baker, Ecolab's President and Chief Executive Officer said, "We enjoyed strong business trends across our U.S. and Latin America operations in the second quarter.  Asia Pacific and Canada also reported good sales growth, while Europe saw moderate gains.  We achieved good growth in our core hospitality and foodservice markets as a result of our investments in new products and an increased sales and service force.  Our Healthcare and GCS sales increased at double-digit rates as they showed excellent progress in developing their businesses and profitability. Further, we have been successful in our pricing and aggressive cost reduction actions to manage the higher raw material cost environment. It was a solid quarter, especially when compared with the strong earnings achieved in the year-ago period. We are pleased with our performance."
 
"We remain very confident in our prospects for the balance of 2005.  Solid trends in most of our markets, and operational improvements in our businesses should yield further gains in the second half of the year.  Our pricing and cost reduction measures are expected to show further and increasing benefit in our results as the year progresses, and we will continue to take appropriate measures in these areas.  While the second half of the year may hold its challenges, we are committed to achieving our goals and continuing our history of outperformance, as reflected in our improved earnings outlook for 2005.  Ecolab is a strong company building a stronger future, and we have the market opportunities, the people and the resources to develop them.  We are determined to do what it takes to continue our strong growth trends for years to come, as we invest and drive results in our established businesses while at the same time continue to invest and build the long-term growth and profit potential in our developing businesses.  As the global leader in premium cleaning and sanitizing products and services to our customers, we are determined to build on and aggressively grow our business."
 
Second quarter sales for Ecolab's United States Cleaning & Sanitizing operations rose 10% over the second quarter of 2004 to $497 million, as most businesses showed solid gains.
Excluding acquisitions, sales rose 8% for the quarter.  Ecolab's United States Cleaning & Sanitizing operating income rose 3% to $77 million, as the benefits of the higher sales, cost efficiencies and increased pricing were partially offset by higher delivered product costs.
 
United States Other Services sales increased 12% to $96 million in the second quarter with good sales gains by both Pest Elimination and GCS.  Operating income in the second quarter of 2005 increased 38% to $11 million as both businesses showed solid improvement in their profitability.
 
Sales of Ecolab's International operations, when measured at fixed currency rates, rose 5% to $560 million in the second quarter. Excluding acquisitions, sales rose 4%. Latin America sales showed double-digit sales gains, and Asia Pacific and Canada sales also showed good increases; Europe recorded a moderate sales gain as weak economies in major central countries slowed results.  Fixed currency operating income rose 2% to $57 million, as sales growth, pricing initiatives and cost efficiencies were partially offset by higher delivered product costs and less favorable business mix.  At public currency rates, International sales increased 12% and operating income grew 11%.
 
Business Outlook
 
The following statements are based on current expectations.  These statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially.  These statements do not include the potential impact of business acquisitions, divestitures, higher than anticipated raw material price increases, or other material corporate events, which may be completed after the date of this release.  This Business Outlook section should be read in conjunction with the information on "Forward-Looking Statements" at the end of this release.
 
Ecolab expects sales for both domestic and international operations (in fixed currencies) to increase in the third quarter 2005 over the third quarter 2004. Gross margins are expected to approximate 52%, and selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to approximate 37%.  Interest expense is expected to be approximately $12 million.  The effective tax rate should be approximately 36%.  Overall, currency translation is expected to contribute to third quarter earnings.  Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the $0.39-$0.40 range in the third quarter of 2005.  For the full year ending December 31, 2005, Ecolab expects diluted earnings per share in the $1.32 -$1.35 range.  In 2004, Ecolab reported net income per share of $1.19.
Ecolab plans to adopt SFAS 123(R), the new standard for expensing stock options, when it becomes effective, currently anticipated to be the beginning of 2006.  The above forecasts for the third quarter and full year 2005 do not include any impact from this accounting rule change. As part of the transition to the new standard, Ecolab expects to restate its earnings history in line with the pro forma amounts historically disclosed in Ecolab's financial statements.  Ecolab expects to present these restated results on Ecolab's website at www.ecolab.com/investor as part of this change.
 
In addition, Ecolab continues to evaluate the reinvestment of foreign earnings in the United States pursuant to the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.  This Act provides the company the opportunity to tax efficiently repatriate foreign earnings for U.S. qualifying investments specified in a domestic reinvestment plan.  Any tax charges resulting from a possible repatriation are not considered in the above forecasts.
 
With 2004 sales of $4.2 billion, Ecolab is the leading global developer and marketer of premium cleaning, sanitizing, pest elimination, maintenance and repair products and services for the hospitality, foodservice, institutional and industrial markets.

Per share amounts do not necessarily sum due to changes in shares outstanding and rounding.
 
The non-GAAP financial measures in the tables above are provided to assist in the reader's understanding of the comparability of the company's operations for 2005 and 2004.  The company believes that pro forma income from ongoing operations, a non-GAAP financial measure, is a useful basis to compare the company's results against, because unusual items during 2004 impacted the company's reported net income (see "pro forma adjustments" in table above).  The presentation above reconciles as reported net income (U.S. GAAP amounts) to pro forma income from ongoing operations for the quarters and interim year-to-date periods ended March 31 and June 30, 2005 and for the quarters and interim year-to-date periods ended March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, 2004. The information was originally presented in the company's quarterly earning releases.  Special charges for 2004 includes reductions to prior restructuring expenses, losses related to the sale of a product line, a charge for in-process research and development and a favorable tax benefit related to prior periods. The pro forma information should not be construed as an alternative to reported results under U.S. GAAP.
