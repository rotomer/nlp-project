Other Events
 
On October 31, 2005, Ecolab announced that it plans to reinvest approximately $225,000,000 of foreign earnings in the United States pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.  As a result, the company expects to record a tax charge of approximately $3,300,000, or $0.01 per share, in the fourth quarter ending December 31, 2005, which charge was not included in the company's fourth quarter and full-year earnings per share forecasts announced October 21, 2005.
 
SFAS 123(R),
The company also announced that it will adopt
the new accounting standard for expensing stock options, beginning in the fourth quarter 2005. The company expects the adoption of SFAS 123(R) will result in an annual charge to earnings of approximately $0.10 per share.  The company previously reported a pro forma impact from expensing stock options of $0.10 per diluted share for 2004 in the notes to that year's consolidated financial statements.  As part of the transition to the new standard, Ecolab expects to restate its earnings history in line with the pro forma amounts historically disclosed in Ecolab's financial statements.  Ecolab expects to present these restated GAAP results on Ecolab's website at www.ecolab.com/investor.
