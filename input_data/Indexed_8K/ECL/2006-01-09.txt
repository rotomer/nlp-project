Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure
 
As previously announced, Ecolab Inc. ("Ecolab") has adopted SFAS 123(R), the new accounting standard for expensing stock options, effective as of the fourth quarter 2005, using the modified retrospective application method for all prior periods.  Accordingly, as part of the transition to the new standard, all prior period financial statements have been restated to recognize share-based compensation expense historically reported in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.  Ecolab also adjusted its previously announced EPS guidance for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2005 to reflect SFAS 123(R), and to reflect the previously announced $0.01 per share tax charge anticipated for repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.  In addition, Ecolab issued EPS guidance for 2006.
 
SFAS 123(R) Information Published On-line
Ecolab has posted restated financial information on our website at www.ecolab.com/investor, and the same information is furnished as Exhibits (99)B  (99)E of this report.  This restated information reflecting SFAS 123(R) is comprised of unaudited income statement, balance sheet and cash flow information for the years ended December 31, 1995 through 2004, as well as unaudited comparative financial data for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2004 and the quarterly periods ended March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2005.
 
Adjusted 2005 EPS Guidance
Following adjustment for previously announced items, Ecolab expects
diluted earnings per share in the $0.26 to $0.28 range for the fourth quarter 2005 (which includes a $0.04 per share charge for option expense and $0.01 per share charge for repatriation of foreign earnings) and in the $1.22 to $1.24 range for the full year 2005 (which includes a $0.10 per share charge for option expense and $0.01 per share charge for repatriation of foreign earnings).  These results compare with restated diluted earnings per share of $0.22 for the fourth quarter of 2004 and $1.09 for the full year 2004.
 
2006 EPS Guidance
On January 9, 2006, Ecolab also
announced that it expects diluted earnings per share for the year ending December 31, 2006 to rise double-digits to the $1.38 to $1.42 range. This would compare with the $1.22 to $1.24 range expected for the full year 2005.  Included in both projections is an annual charge of approximately $0.10 per share for SFAS 123(R).

Exhibit 99.A
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
Michael J. Monahan  (651) 293-2809
 
ST. PAUL, Minn., January 9, 2006: Ecolab Inc. announced today it has made restated financial information available reflecting its adoption of SFAS 123(R), the new accounting standard for expensing stock options.  Ecolab also updated its 2005 EPS guidance to reflect the adoption of the new standard as well as the previously announced charge for earnings repatriated under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, and issued earnings per share guidance for 2006, again reflecting adoption of SFAS 123(R).
 
Restated financials posted to Ecolab's web site
 
As previously announced, Ecolab adopted the new accounting standard for expensing stock options beginning in its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2005 and has restated prior period financial statements in transitioning to the new rules.
 
To assist investors in understanding the impact of the new standard on its results, Ecolab has posted restated financial statements for the years 1995  2004, as well as quarterly financial statements for 2004 and the first three quarters of 2005, on the company's website at www.ecolab.com/investor.  These restatements recognize share-based compensation expense historically reported by Ecolab in the notes to its consolidated financial statements.
 
Adjusted 2005 earnings per share guidance to reflect SFAS 123(R)
 
The adoption of SFAS 123(R) is expected to result in a charge to full year 2005 earnings of approximately $0.10 per diluted share.  The expense related to stock based awards was also $0.10 per share for 2004.
 
Ecolab previously announced it expected diluted earnings per share in the $0.31-$0.33 range for the fourth quarter 2005 and in the $1.33-$1.35 range for the full year 2005, excluding the impact of SFAS 123(R) and any charges relating to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA).  These expectations compared with diluted earnings per share of $0.27 and $1.19 originally reported for the fourth quarter and full year 2004, respectively.
 
After adjusting for adoption of the new standard for expensing stock options, and reflecting the previously announced $0.01 per share tax charge related to the reinvestment of foreign earnings under AJCA, Ecolab expects diluted earnings per share in the $0.26-$0.28 range for the fourth quarter 2005 (which includes a $0.04 per share charge for option expense and $0.01 per share charge for AJCA) and in the $1.22-$1.24 range for the full year 2005 (which includes a $0.10 per share charge for option expense and $0.01 per share charge for AJCA).  These expected 2005 results compare with restated diluted earnings per share of $0.22 for the fourth quarter of 2004 and $1.09 for the full year 2004.
 
Ecolab expects to report results for its fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2005 on February 10, 2006.
 
2006 earnings outlook issued
 
Ecolab announced that it expects diluted earnings per share for the year ending December 31, 2006 to rise double-digits to the $1.38 to $1.42 range.   This would compare with the $1.22-$1.24 expected for the full year 2005.  Included in both projections is an annual charge of approximately $0.10 per share for SFAS 123(R).
 
Commenting on the earnings projections, Douglas M. Baker, Ecolab's President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are on target for the double-digit earnings gains we forecasted for 2005, as our strong sales and cost savings actions more than offset the impact of higher costs to deliver outstanding growth.  We have maintained our focus on delivering superior customer
results through our differentiated products, our premium services and our aggressive sales team, and we made significant investments to bolster our future.  We enter 2006 with solid momentum, and though we face economic uncertainty and further raw material cost increases, we believe our strong value proposition - which has served us well through favorable and unfavorable economic times - will enable us to drive another year of double-digit earnings per share growth in 2006.  Ecolab remains an aggressive, results-oriented company, committed to high standards of performance and reliability - to both our customers and to our shareholders. We intend to sustain that commitment and build upon it."
 
With 2004 sales of $4.2 billion, Ecolab is the leading global developer and marketer of premium cleaning, sanitizing, pest elimination, maintenance and repair products and services for the hospitality, foodservice, healthcare and industrial markets.
