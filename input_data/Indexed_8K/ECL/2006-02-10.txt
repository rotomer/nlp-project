ST. PAUL, Minn., February 10, 2006: Healthy sales trends in its North America, Asia Pacific and Latin American businesses, along with robust profit improvement by the U.S. operating segments, led Ecolab's fourth quarter results to record levels for the period ended December 31, 2005.
 
Ecolab's consolidated sales increased 6% to a record $1.1 billion in 2005's fourth quarter. Net income increased 23% to a record $71 million, or $0.27 per diluted share. Fourth quarter 2005 results include a tax charge of $0.01 per share related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA); excluding that charge, diluted earnings per share would have risen 27% to $0.28 per share in the fourth quarter. Option expense was lower in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared with the same period in 2004. Excluding the effects of option expensing, net income per diluted share would have risen 15%; excluding the effects of option expensing and the AJCA charge, diluted earnings per share would have risen 19%. Currency translation had an unfavorable impact on net income of approximately $0.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2005.
 
As previously announced, Ecolab adopted SFAS 123(R), the new accounting standard for expensing stock options, in the fourth quarter of 2005. All financial results presented in this release include the impact from this accounting rule change. Fourth quarter 2005 diluted earnings per share include a $0.04 per share charge for option expense; for the full year 2005 option expense was a $0.10 per share charge. As part of the transition to the new standard, Ecolab restated its earnings per share in line with the pro forma amounts historically disclosed in the notes to Ecolab's financial statements. Ecolab presented these restated results on Ecolab's website at www.ecolab.com/investor.
 
Commenting on the quarter, Douglas M. Baker, Ecolab's President and Chief Executive Officer said, "We finished 2005 on a very positive note, turning in a strong finish. We began the year faced with unprecedented increases in our raw material costs as well as less than robust world economies. We took on that challenge, and reflecting the strong Ecolab culture, our highly effective and differentiated product and service offerings, and our outstanding global customer base, we were able to implement the necessary actions to serve our customers and earn an attractive return for our shareholders. We introduced a slate of new, differentiated products that address key customer needs while also helping them to improve results and better manage their costs. We expanded our already industry leading sales and service force, and provided improved training and tools to make them even more effective in the marketplace. We also made key
 
investments in research and development and information systems to enable further growth and competitive differentiation in our future. The net result of these efforts and investments was double-digit earnings gains in each quarter driving a 13% gain for 2005 in total. We thank the more than 22,000 dedicated Ecolab associates who made this year a success, as well as our customers who we are privileged to serve in meeting their cleaning and sanitizing needs.
 
"We are excited by our prospects in 2006. While we expect continued raw material cost increases and further economic challenges, we believe we are well-positioned to excel in that environment and deliver superior growth. We will stay focused on the keys to our business attention to customer needs, delivering outstanding products and service at the appropriate price, developing continuous improvement in our operations and a continued commitment to make the right investments to sustain our value proposition and drive growth enablers for the future. We believe these will continue to be the factors which drive our success in 2006 and for the years beyond. As always, Ecolab is dedicated to delivering superior results for its customers and shareholders, and we will do so again in 2006."
 
Fourth quarter sales for Ecolab's United States Cleaning & Sanitizing operations rose 9% over the fourth quarter of 2004 to $478 million, led by the Institutional and Kay businesses. Ecolab's reported United States Cleaning & Sanitizing operating income rose 25% to $50 million. Excluding the effects of option expensing, United States Cleaning & Sanitizing operating income rose 12% as the benefits of the higher sales, cost efficiencies, increased pricing and favorable general and administrative costs were partially offset by higher delivered product costs.
 
United States Other Services sales increased 10% to $95 million in the fourth quarter with good sales gains by both Pest Elimination and GCS. Reported United States Other Services operating income in the fourth quarter of 2005 increased 181% to $7 million. Excluding the effects of option expensing, United States Other Services operating income rose 93% as GCS continues to show sharp profitability improvement and Pest Elimination continued to achieve strong growth.
 
Sales of Ecolab's International operations, when measured at fixed currency rates, rose 5% to $591 million in the fourth quarter. Asia Pacific, Latin America and Canada all showed double-digit sales gains; Europe recorded a modest sales gain as weak economies in major Central European countries slowed results. Reported fixed currency operating income increased 14% to $69 million. Excluding the effects of option expensing and at fixed currency rates,
 
International operating income rose 7% as sales growth, cost efficiencies and pricing initiatives more than offset higher delivered product costs. At public currency rates, International sales increased 4% and operating income grew 13%.
 
The tax rate for the fourth quarter increased to 38.2% in 2005 from 36.6% in 2004. Excluding the tax charge on the repatriation of
foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA), the tax rate would have been 35.5%
.
 
Ecolab reacquired 2.4 million shares of its common stock during the fourth quarter, under our share repurchase program.
 
Business Outlook
 
Certain information presented in this news release, including the following statements, are forward-looking and based on current expectations. Actual results may differ materially. These statements do not include the potential impact of business acquisitions, divestitures, higher than anticipated raw material price increases or other material corporate events, which may be completed after the date of this release. This Business Outlook section should be read in conjunction with the information on "Forward-Looking Statements" at the end of this release.
 
Ecolab expects sales for both domestic and international operations (in fixed currencies) to increase in the first quarter 2006 over the first quarter 2005, though unfavorable currency translation may hurt international sales when reported in dollars. Gross margins are expected to be in the 50%-51% range compared with 50.7% last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to approximate 39% compared with 39.7% a year ago. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $10 million. The effective tax rate should be approximately 36%. Overall, currency translation is expected to negatively impact first quarter earnings. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the $0.29-$0.31 range in the first quarter of 2006. For the full year ending December 31, 2006, Ecolab expects diluted earnings per share in the $1.38 - $1.42 range. In 2005, net income per share was $0.27 in the first quarter and $1.23 for the full year.

2004 amounts have been restated for the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment"
 
IMMEDIATE RELEASE
M.J. Monahan
(651) 293-2809
 
 
 
 
The company has restated prior periods earnings per share for the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment"
 
Per share amounts do not necessarily sum due to changes in shares outstanding and rounding.
 
The non-GAAP financial measures in the tables above are provided to assist in the reader's understanding of the comparability of the company's operations for 2005 and 2004. The company believes that earnings excluding SFAS 123R and AJCA, a non-GAAP financial measure, is a useful basis to compare the company's results against, because it assists readers in understanding the impact of the company's adoption of SFAS 123R and the tax charge related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA) is an unusual item which impacted the company's reported earnings per share in 2005. The presentation above reconciles restated earnings per share (U. S. GAAP amounts) to amounts excluding SFAS 123R and AJCA for the quarters ended March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2005 and the quarter and year ended December 31, 2005 and for the quarters ended March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2004 and the quarter and year ended December 31, 2004. The non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an alternative to reported results under U. S. GAAP.
