Accordingly, as part of the transition to the new standard, all prior period financial statements have been restated to recognize share-based compensation expense historically reported in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Ecolab has posted comparative operating segment information for the quarterly and interim year-to-date periods ended March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2005 on our website at www.ecolab.com/investor, and the same information is furnished as Exhibits (99)B  (99)D of this report.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
(651) 293-2809
Michael J. Monahan   
 
ST. PAUL, Minn., February 14, 2006: Ecolab Inc. commented on reaction to its recent earnings announcement.  It also announced it has expanded the information available on its website, adding operating segment data to the restated financial information reflecting its adoption of SFAS 123(R), the new accounting standard for expensing stock options.
 
"In looking at the news articles and reports following our fourth quarter earnings release February 10, it appears there has been confusion regarding the impact of adoption of option expensing (SFAS 123(R)) on fourth quarter 2005 results, as well as comparisons to last year and consensus forecasts.  The same issue is also true for our 2006 forecasted range.  We hope this posting assists in a better understanding of those results," commented Steven L. Fritze, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Ecolab Inc.
 
"When we reported actual fourth quarter and year-end results February 10, they were right in line with our previous statements and forecasts reflecting the early adoption of option expensing.  We reported a 23% gain for the fourth quarter 2005 and a 13% increase for the full year.  Further, we projected 2006 earnings per share would grow 12% to 15% to the $1.38 to $1.42 range.  However, several news articles compared our 2005 results to consensus earnings numbers from data services, which in turn derived their data from a mix of analyst estimates,
some of which included option expensing and some of which did not reflect option expensing.  As a result of the inconsistent basis of the numbers comprising the consensus, it appeared we had fallen below fourth quarter 2005 consensus expectations.  This is not the case. Our fourth quarter earnings and 2006 forecasts are in line with consensus when analyst projections are appropriately adjusted for the previously announced early adoption of SFAS 123(R) and the charge for repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act.  Further, investors should understand that some analysts have chosen not to restate prior year numbers in their reports to reflect option expensing in prior years, thereby skewing year-over-year comparisons.
 
"We hope this release, as well as posting the segment data, helps clarify the situation and provides a clearer understanding of our results and prospects.  We have a strong record of superior growth, compounding our earnings growth at double-digits over the past 5 and 10 years periods, and we have a strong outlook for double-digit growth in 2006."
 
With 2005 sales of $4.5 billion, Ecolab is the leading global developer and marketer of premium cleaning, sanitizing, pest elimination, maintenance and repair products and services for the hospitality, foodservice, healthcare and industrial markets.
