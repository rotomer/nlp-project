ST. PAUL, Minn., April 21, 2006:  Continued strong sales trends in its U.S., Latin American and Asia Pacific businesses led Ecolab's first quarter results to record levels for the period ended March 31, 2006.
 
Ecolab's consolidated sales increased 5% to a record $1.1 billion in the first quarter. Foreign currency translation had an unfavorable impact on sales; when measured in fixed currency rates, sales rose 8%. Net income increased 12% to a record $78 million, or $0.30 per diluted share. Currency translation had an unfavorable impact on net income of approximately $1 million.
 
All financial results presented in this release include the impact of expensing stock options. Ecolab adopted SFAS 123
(R), the new accounting standard for expensing stock options, in the fourth quarter of 2005. As part of the transition to the new standard, Ecolab restated its earnings per share in line with the pro forma amounts historically disclosed in the notes to Ecolab's financial statements. These restated results were included in Ecolab's 2005 annual report and are available at Ecolab's website at www.ecolab.com/investor.
 
Commenting on the quarter, Douglas M. Baker, Jr., Ecolab's President and Chief Executive Officer said, "Growth continued to be strong in our U.S., Latin America and Asia Pacific businesses. Customer account gains, new products and increased solutions for our customers drove the growth. These strong fundamentals, along with improved pricing and cost savings, more than offset higher raw material costs and fueled the margin improvement and strong earnings. We are pleased by the solid start to the year.
 
"Our prospects for 2006 remain attractive, and we raised our forecast for full year diluted earnings per share to $1.40 to $1.43. Our end markets are in good shape and our capacity to drive business within them is stronger than ever; in addition, changes in the competitive landscape offer opportunities for us to further serve our industry. We continue to be aggressive in the marketplace, and remain focused on delivering the strongest product and service solutions available to our existing and new customers. We believe 2006 will once again show why Ecolab remains the industry leader and a superior growth company."
 
First quarter sales for Ecolab's United States Cleaning & Sanitizing operations rose 10% over the first quarter of 2005 to $513 million, led by Institutional, Kay and Food & Beverage. Ecolab's United States Cleaning & Sanitizing operating income increased 11% to $80 million, as the benefits of the higher sales to existing and new accounts, cost efficiencies and increased pricing offset higher delivered product costs.
United States Other Services sales increased 9% to $93 million in the first quarter reflecting double-digit gains by Pest Elimination and modest growth by GCS. Operating income in the first quarter of 2006 increased 6% to $8 million as continued strong growth at Pest Elimination and improvement at GCS were offset by GCS systems investments and the annualization against a favorable Pest Elimination legal settlement last year.
 
Sales of Ecolab's International operations, when measured at fixed currency rates, rose 5% to $510 million in the first quarter. Latin America sales again enjoyed double-digit sales gains, and Asia Pacific and Canada reported good sales growth; Europe recorded a moderate sales gain. Fixed currency operating income rose 18% to $43 million as sales growth, pricing initiatives and cost efficiencies more than offset higher delivered product costs. At public currency rates, International sales decreased 1% and operating income grew 13%.
 
The tax rate for the first quarter was 35.7% in 2006 and 35.0% in 2005. Last year's first quarter tax rate included the benefits of one-time items. Excluding those one-time items, the tax rate was 36.1% in the first quarter 2005.
 
Ecolab reacquired 2.0 million shares of its common stock during the first quarter.
 
Business Outlook
 
Certain information presented in this news release, including the following statements, are forward-looking and based on current expectations. Actual results may differ materially. These statements do not include the potential impact of business acquisitions, divestitures, higher than anticipated raw material price increases or other material corporate events, which may be completed after the date of this release. This Business Outlook section should be read in conjunction with the information on "Forward-Looking Statements" at the end of this release.
 
Ecolab expects sales for both domestic and international operations (in fixed currencies) to increase in the second quarter 2006 over the second quarter 2005. Gross margins are expected to approximate 51%, and selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to be in the range of 38%-39%. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $10 million. The effective tax rate should be approximately 36%. Overall, currency translation is expected to reduce second quarter earnings. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the $0.34-$0.36 range in the second quarter of 2006. Diluted net income per share was $0.31 for the second quarter of 2005. For the full year ending December 31, 2006, Ecolab raised its forecast range for diluted earnings per share to $1.40 to $1.43 from the prior $1.38-$1.42 range. In 2005, Ecolab reported diluted
net income per share of $1.23.
 
With 2005 sales of $4.5 billion, Ecolab is the leading global developer and marketer of premium cleaning, sanitizing, pest elimination, maintenance and repair products for the hospitality, foodservice, healthcare and industrial markets.
