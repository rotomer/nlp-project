Item 4.01 Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant
 
On May 5, 2006, the Plan Administrator of the Ecolab Savings Plan and ESOP (the "Plan") dismissed  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") as the independent auditor for the Plan. PwC will continue as the independent registered public accounting firm of Ecolab Inc.
(a)
                                 
 
The reports of PwC on the financial statements of the Plan for the years ended December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2004 contained no adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principle.
 
During the years ended December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2004, and through May 5, 2006, the Plan had no disagreements with PwC on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of PwC, would have caused PwC to make reference thereto in its reports on the financial statements of the Plan for such years.
 
During the years ended December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2004 and through May 5, 2006, the Plan had no "reportable events" as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
 
The Plan provided PwC with a copy of the above disclosures and requested that PwC furnish the Plan with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether or not it agrees with the above statements. A copy of PwC's letter, dated May 5, 2006, issued in connection with this report under Item 4.01 is attached as Exhibit (16) and incorporated  by reference herein.
 
On May 5, 2006, the Plan Administrator notified McGladrey & Pullen, LLP of its appointment as the Plan's independent auditor for the year ended December 31, 2005, effective upon execution of a mutually approved engagement agreement. The Plan had no occasions during the years ended December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2004, and through May 5, 2006, upon which it has consulted with McGladrey & Pullen, LLP on any matters described in Item 304(a)(2)(i) and Item 304(a)(2)(ii) of Regulation S-K.
