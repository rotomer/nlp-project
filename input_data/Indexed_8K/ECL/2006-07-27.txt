Tax Indemnification
Taxing Jurisdiction
If any deduction or withholding for any Tax of a Taxing Jurisdiction shall at any time be required in respect of any amounts to be paid by the Company under this Agreement or the Notes, the Company will pay to the relevant Taxing Jurisdiction the full amount required to be withheld, deducted or otherwise paid before penalties attach thereto or interest accrues thereon and pay to each holder of a Note such additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts paid to such holder pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or the Notes after such deduction, withholding or payment (including, without limitation, any required deduction or withholding of Tax on or with respect to such additional amount), shall be not less than the amounts then due and payable to such holder under the terms of this Agreement or the Notes before the assessment of such Tax, that no payment of any additional amounts shall be required to be made for or on account of:
provided
(a)           any Tax that would not have been imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection between such holder (or a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member of, shareholder of, or possessor of a power over, such holder, if such holder is an estate, trust, partnership or corporation or any Person other than the holder to whom the Notes or any amount payable thereon is attributable for the purposes of such Tax) and the Taxing Jurisdiction, other than the mere holding of the relevant Note or the receipt of payments thereunder or in respect thereof, including, without limitation, such holder (or such other Person described in the above parenthetical) being or having been a citizen or resident thereof, or being or having been present or engaged in trade or business therein or having or having had an establishment, office, fixed base or branch therein, that this exclusion shall not apply with respect to a Tax that would not have been imposed but for the Company, after the date of the Closing, opening an office in, moving an office to, reincorporating in, or changing the Taxing Jurisdiction from or through which payments on account of this Agreement or the Notes are made to, the Taxing Jurisdiction imposing the relevant Tax (including as a result of a Merger Event);
provided
(b)           any Tax that would not have been imposed but for the delay or failure by such holder (following a written request by the Company) in the filing with the relevant Taxing Jurisdiction of Forms (as defined below) that are required to be filed by such holder to avoid or reduce such Taxes (including for such purpose any refilings or renewals of filings that may from time to time be required by the relevant Taxing
35
 
Jurisdiction), that the filing of such Forms would not (in such holder's reasonable judgment) impose any unreasonable burden (in time, resources or otherwise) on such holder or result in any confidential or proprietary income tax return information being revealed, either directly or indirectly, to any Person and such delay or failure could have been lawfully avoided by such holder, and that such holder shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements of this clause (b) upon the good faith completion and submission of such Forms (including refilings or renewals of filings) as may be specified in a written request of the Company no later than 60 days after receipt by such holder of such written request (accompanied by copies of such Forms and related instructions, if any, all in the English language or with an English translation thereof); or

(c)           any combination of clauses (a) and (b) above;
and that in no event shall the Company be obligated to pay such additional amounts to any holder of a Note (i) not resident in the United States of America or any other jurisdiction in which an original Purchaser is resident for tax purposes on the date of the Closing in excess of the amounts that the Company would be obligated to pay if such holder had been a resident of the United States of America or such other jurisdiction, as applicable, or (ii) registered in the name of a nominee if under the law of the relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (or the current regulatory interpretation of such law) securities held in the name of a nominee do not qualify for an exemption from the relevant Tax and the Company shall have given timely notice of such law or interpretation to such holder.
provided
further
By acceptance of any Note, the holder of such Note agrees, subject to the limitations of clause (b) above, that it will from time to time with reasonable promptness (x) duly complete and deliver to or as reasonably directed by the Company all such forms, certificates, documents and returns provided to such holder by the Company (collectively, together with instructions for completing the same, "") required to be filed by or on behalf of such holder in order to avoid or reduce any such Tax pursuant to the provisions of an applicable statute, regulation or administrative practice of the relevant Taxing Jurisdiction or of a tax treaty between the United States and such Taxing Jurisdiction and (y) provide the Company with such information with respect to such holder as the Company may reasonably request in order to complete any such Forms, that nothing in this Section 23.2 shall require any holder to provide information with respect to any such Form or otherwise if in the opinion of such holder such Form or disclosure of information would involve the disclosure of tax return or other information that is confidential or proprietary to such holder, and that each such holder shall be deemed to have complied with its obligation under this paragraph with respect to any Form if such Form shall have been duly completed and delivered by such holder to the Company or mailed to the appropriate taxing authority (which in the case of a United Kingdom Inland Revenue Form FD13 or any similar Form shall be deemed to occur when such Form is submitted to the United States Internal Revenue Service in accordance with instructions contained in such Form), whichever is applicable, within 60 days following a written request of the Company (which request shall be accompanied by copies of such Form and English translations of any such Form not in the English language) and, in the case of a transfer of any Note, at least 90 days prior to the relevant interest payment date.
Forms

On or before the date on which the provisions of this Section 23.2 will become operative, the Company will furnish each holder of a Note with copies of the appropriate Form (and English translation if required as aforesaid) then required to be filed in the applicable Taxing Jurisdiction pursuant to clause (b) of the first paragraph of this Section 23.2, if any, and in connection with the transfer of any Note the Company will furnish the transferee of such Note with copies of any Form and English translation then required.
If any payment is made by the Company to or for the account of the holder of any Note after deduction for or on account of any Taxes, and increased payments are made by the Company pursuant to this Section 23.2, then, if such holder at its sole discretion determines that it has received or been granted a refund of such Taxes, such holder shall, to the extent that it can do so without prejudice to the retention of the amount of such refund, reimburse to the Company such amount as such holder shall, in its sole discretion, determine to be attributable to the relevant Taxes or deduction or withholding. Nothing herein contained shall interfere with the right of the holder of any Note to arrange its tax affairs in whatever manner it thinks fit and, in particular, no holder of any Note shall be under any obligation to claim relief from its corporate profits or similar tax liability in respect of such Tax in priority to any other claims, reliefs, credits or deductions available to it or (other than as set forth in clause (b) above) oblige any holder of any Note to disclose any information relating to its tax affairs or any computations in respect thereof.
The Company will furnish the holders of Notes, promptly and in any event within 60 days after the date of any payment by the Company of any Tax in respect of any amounts paid under this Agreement or the Notes, the original tax receipt issued by the relevant taxation or other authorities involved for all amounts paid as aforesaid (or if such original tax receipt is not available or must legally be kept in the possession of the Company, a duly certified copy of the original tax receipt or any other reasonably satisfactory evidence of payment), together with such other documentary evidence with respect to such payments as may be reasonably requested from time to time by any holder of a Note.
If the Company is required by any applicable law, as modified by the practice of the taxation or other authority of any relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, to make any deduction or withholding of any Tax in respect of which the Company would be required to pay any additional amount under this Section 23.2, but for any reason does not make such deduction or withholding with the result that a liability in respect of such Tax is assessed directly against the holder of any Note, and such holder pays such liability, then the Company will promptly reimburse such holder for such payment (including any related interest or penalties to the extent such interest or penalties arise by virtue of a default or delay by the Company) upon demand by such holder accompanied by an official receipt (or a duly certified copy thereof) issued by the taxation or other authority of the relevant Taxing Jurisdiction.
If the Company makes payment to or for the account of any holder of a Note and such holder is entitled to a refund of the Tax to which such payment is attributable upon the making of a filing (other than a Form described above), then such holder shall, as soon as practicable after receiving written request from the Company (which shall specify in reasonable detail and supply the refund forms to be filed) use reasonable efforts to complete and deliver such refund forms to
37
 
or as directed by the Company, subject, however, to the same limitations with respect to Forms as are set forth above.
 
The obligations of the Company under this Section 23.2 shall survive the payment or transfer of any Note and the provisions of this Section 23.2 shall also apply to successive transferees of the Notes.
The Company also agrees to pay all stamp, documentary or similar taxes or fees which may be payable in respect of the enforcement of this Agreement or the execution and delivery (but not the transfer) or the enforcement of any of the Notes in any Taxing Jurisdiction or of any amendment of, or waiver or consent under or with respect to, this Agreement or of any of the Notes, and to pay any value added tax due and payable in respect of reimbursement of costs and expenses by the Company pursuant to this Section 23.2, and will save each holder of a Note to the extent permitted by applicable law harmless against any loss or liability resulting from nonpayment or delay in payment of any such tax or fee required to be paid by the Company hereunder.
Section
23.3.         . This Agreement and the Notes have been prepared and signed in English and the parties hereto agree that the English version hereof and thereof (to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law) shall be the only version valid for the purpose of the interpretation and construction hereof and thereof notwithstanding the preparation of any translation into another language hereof or thereof, whether official or otherwise or whether prepared in relation to any proceedings which may be brought in any jurisdiction in respect hereof or thereof.

Section
23.4.         .
Jurisdiction and Process

The Company agrees that such service upon receipt (i) shall be deemed in every respect effective service of process upon it in any such suit, action or proceeding and (ii) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be taken and held to be valid personal service upon and personal delivery to it. Notices hereunder shall be conclusively presumed received as evidenced by a delivery receipt furnished by the United States Postal Service or any reputable commercial delivery service.

38
 
may be, and may be enforced in the courts of the United States of America or the State of New York (or any other courts to the jurisdiction of which it or any of its assets is or may be subject) by a suit upon such judgment.
Section
23.5.         . Any payment on account of an amount that is payable hereunder or under the Notes in Dollars which is made to or for the account of any holder of Notes in any other currency, whether as a result of any judgment or order or the enforcement thereof or the realization of any security or the liquidation of the Company, shall constitute a discharge of the obligation of the Company under this Agreement or the Notes only to the extent of the amount of Dollars which such holder could purchase in the foreign exchange markets in London, England, with the amount of such other currency in accordance with normal banking procedures at the rate of exchange prevailing on the London Banking Day following receipt of the payment first referred to above. If the amount of Dollars that could be so purchased is less than the amount of Dollars originally due to such holder, the Company agrees to the fullest extent permitted by law, to indemnify and save harmless such holder from and against all loss or damage arising out of or as a result of such deficiency. This indemnity shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, constitute an obligation separate and independent from the other obligations contained in this Agreement and the Notes, shall give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, shall apply irrespective of any indulgence granted by such holder from time to time and shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any judgment or order for a liquidated sum in respect of an amount due hereunder or under the Notes or under any judgment or order. As used herein the term "" shall mean any day other than Saturday or Sunday or a day on which commercial banks are required or authorized by law to be closed in London, England.
