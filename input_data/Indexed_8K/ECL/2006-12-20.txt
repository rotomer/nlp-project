Item 2.03  Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
 On December 14, 2006, Ecolab Inc. (the "Company") issued and sold in a private placement exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, 300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's senior notes in two series: 4.355% Series A Senior Notes due 2013 in the aggregate principal amount of  125,000,000 (the "Series A Notes") and 4.585% Series B Senior Notes due 2016 in the aggregate principal amount of 175,000,000 (the "Series B Notes," and together with the Series A Notes, the "Notes"), pursuant to a Note Purchase Agreement, previously disclosed, dated as of July 26, 2006, between the Company and the purchasers party thereto.
The Series A Notes bear interest at the rate of 4.355% per year and mature on December 14, 2013. Interest on the Series A Notes will be paid annually on December 14, commencing December 14, 2007. The Series B Notes bear interest at the rate of 4.585% per year and mature on December 14, 2016. Interest on the Series B Notes will be paid annually on December 14, commencing December 14, 2007. The Notes are not subject to prepayment except where, in certain specified instances, the Company consolidates or merges all or substantially all of its assets with any other Person (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement). Upon such consolidation or merger, the Company will offer to prepay all of the Notes at 100% of the principal amount then outstanding plus accrued interest. In the event of a default by the Company under the Note Purchase Agreement, the Notes may become immediately due and payable for the unpaid principal amount, accrued interest and a make-whole amount determined as of the time of the default.
The foregoing summary of the Note Purchase Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such agreement, a copy of which was previously filed as Exhibit (10) to the Company's Report on Form 8-K dated July 26, 2006.
