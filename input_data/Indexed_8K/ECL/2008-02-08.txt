Item 1.01  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
.
 
On February 5, 2008, Ecolab Inc. (the "Company") entered into an underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") with Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and JP Morgan Securities Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters listed therein (the "Underwriters"), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell to the Underwriters $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 4.875% Notes due 2015 (the "Notes"). The Notes will be issued pursuant to an Amended and Restated Indenture (the "Indenture"), dated January 9, 2001, by and between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, as supplemented by a supplemental indenture, dated February 8, 2008 (the "Supplemental Indenture").
 
The Notes bear interest at the rate of 4.875% per year. Interest on the Notes is payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on August 15, 2008. The Notes will mature on February 15, 2015. Upon 30 days' notice to holders of the Notes, the Company may redeem the Notes for cash in whole, at any time, or in part, from time to time, prior to maturity, at redemption prices that include accrued and unpaid interest and a make-whole premium, as specified in the Indenture and Supplemental Indenture. The Indenture limits the ability of the Company to incur certain liens or consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of its assets. The Notes will be unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Company and will rank equally with all of the Company's existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness from time to time outstanding. The Indenture also contains customary event of default provisions. Subject to certain limitations, in the event of the occurrence of both (1) a change of control of the Company and (2) a downgrade of the Notes below investment grade rating by both Moody's Investors Services, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services within a specified time period, the Company will be required to make an offer to purchase the Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase.
 
The public offering price of the Notes was 99.805% of the principal amount. The Company expects to receive net proceeds (before expenses) of approximately $247.95 million and to use such net proceeds to, among other things, repay a portion of its commercial paper borrowings, which commercial paper borrowings were issued for general corporate and working capital purposes and, as previously reported, to finance a portion of the Company's acquisitions of Microtek Medical Holdings, Inc. and Ecovation, Inc.
 
The Notes were offered and sold pursuant to the Company's automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-149052) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which was filed and became effective on February 5, 2008. The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a prospectus supplement, dated February 5, 2008, together with the accompanying prospectus, dated February 5, 2008, relating to the offering and sale of the Notes.
 
The above description of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture, the Supplemental Indenture and the Notes is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture, the Supplemental Indenture and the Notes, each of which is incorporated herein by reference and are attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibits 1.1, 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3, respectively.
 
The underwriters and their affiliates have performed, from time to time, and may in the future perform, various investment banking, commercial lending, financial advisory and other services for the Company, including participating as lenders under the Company's revolving credit facilities, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses.

Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses

therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein.  This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
provided
however
 
(b)           Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity.  This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have.  The Company acknowledges that the (i) list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities under the heading "Underwriting," (ii) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances under the heading "Underwriting" and (iii) the paragraphs under the heading "Underwriting" related to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in any Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
 
(c)           Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above.  The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party.  Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel
provided
however
chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party.  An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.
 
(d)           In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending the same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder.   If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus.  Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission.  The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d),
provided
however
no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
 
9.             .  If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule I hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule I hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company.  In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Supplemental Indenture, pursuant to Section 8.1(d) of the Existing Indenture, the provisions of this Supplemental Indenture, including the covenants set forth herein, are expressly being included solely for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes.  The Notes constitute a series of notes as provided in Section 2.3 of the Existing Indenture.
 
 
Section 1.02
Designation and Amount of Notes
.
 
The Notes shall be known and designated as the "4.875% Notes due 2015" and shall be unsecured and unsubordinated Obligations of the Company. The initial maximum aggregate principal amount of Notes that may be authenticated and delivered under this Supplemental Indenture shall not exceed $250,000,000 except for Notes authenticated and delivered upon registration or transfer of, or in exchange for, or in lieu of, Notes pursuant to Sections 2.8, 2.9, 2.11 and 12.3 of the Existing Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Company may from time to time, without giving notice to or seeking the consent of the Holders of the Notes, issue debt securities having the same terms (except for the issue date, the public offering price and the first Interest Payment Date) and ranking equally and ratably with the Notes ("Additional Notes"). 
The Notes and the Additional Notes shall together constitute one series for purposes of the Existing Indenture and this Supplemental Indenture, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase.
 
Section 1.03

(a) The Notes are issuable in fully registered form as Registered Global Securities  without coupons, in denominations of $2,000 or any amount in excess thereof which is an integral multiple of $1,000, and
shall be in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto.  The Depository Trust Company shall act as Depositary for the Notes.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Notes shall be issued as Registered Securities in definitive form to each person that the Depositary identifies as the beneficial owner of the Notes represented by the Registered Global Securities upon surrender by the Depositary of the Registered Global Security if:
 
(i)
                                    
the Depositary notifies us that it is no longer willing or able to act as a depositary for such Registered Global Security or ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act, and the Company shall not have appointed a successor Depositary within 90 days of that notice or becoming aware that the Depositary is no longer so registered;
 
(ii)

the Company determines not to have the Notes represented by a Registered Global Security.
 
(b)
                                
The terms and provisions contained in the form of Note attached hereto as Exhibit A shall constitute, and are hereby expressly made, a part of this Supplemental Indenture and the Company, by its execution and delivery of this Supplemental Indenture, expressly agrees to such terms and provisions and to be bound thereto. Any of the Notes may have such letters, numbers or other marks of identification and such notations, legends and endorsements as the officers executing the same may approve (execution thereof to be conclusive evidence of such approval) and are not inconsistent with the provisions of the Indenture (and which do not affect the rights, duties or immunities of the Trustee), or as may be required to comply with any law or with any
 
 
rule or regulation made pursuant thereto or with any rule or regulation of any securities exchange or automated quotation system on which the Notes may be listed.

The Notes shall bear interest at 4.875% per annum from and including February 8, 2008, or from the most recent Interest Payment Date on which interest has been paid or provided for until the principal thereof becomes due and payable, and on any overdue principal and (to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) on any overdue installment of interest at the same rate per annum.  Interest shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.  Interest on the Notes shall be payable semi-annually in arrears in U.S. Dollars on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing on August 15, 2008 (the Interest Payment Dates with respect to the Notes).  Payments of interest shall be made to the Person in whose name a Note (or predecessor Note) is registered (which shall initially be the Depositary) at the close of business on the February 1 or August 1, as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date (the Regular Record Date with respect to the Notes).
 
(c)
                                 
For so long as the Notes are represented by one or more Registered Global Securities, all payments of principal and interest shall be made by the Company by wire transfer of immediately available funds in U.S. Dollars to the Depositary or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered owner of the Registered Global Securities representing such Notes. In the event that definitive Notes shall have been issued, all payments of principal and interest shall be made by the Company by wire transfer of immediately available funds in U.S. Dollars to the accounts of the registered Holders thereof; , that the Company may elect to make such payments at the office of the Paying Agent in The City of New York; and , that the Company may at its option pay interest by check to the registered address of each Holder of a definitive Note.

"Below Investment Grade Rating Event" means the rating on the Notes is lowered by each of the Rating Agencies and the Notes are rated below Investment Grade by each of the Rating Agencies on any day within the 60-day period (which 60-day period will be extended so long as the rating of the Notes is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by any of the Rating Agencies) after the earlier of (1) the occurrence of a Change of Control and (2) public notice of the occurrence of a Change of Control or the Company's
 
 
intention to effect a Change of Control; provided that a Below Investment Grade Rating Event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating shall not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular Change of Control (and thus shall not be deemed a Below Investment Grade Rating Event for purposes of the definition of Change of Control Triggering Event) if the Rating Agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing at its request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable Change of Control (whether or not the applicable Change of Control shall have occurred at the time of the Below Investment Grade Rating Event).

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, issue, assume or guarantee any indebtedness for money borrowed (herein referred to as "Debt") if such Debt is secured by any mortgage, security interest, pledge, lien or other encumbrance (herein referred to as a "mortgage") upon any Operating Property of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or any shares of stock or Debt of any Restricted Subsidiary, whether owned at the date of the issuance of the Notes or thereafter acquired, without effectively securing the Notes equally and ratably with such Debt for at least the period such other Debt is so secured unless, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate amount of all Debt so secured (not including Debt permitted in clauses (1) through (7) in the following sentence), together with all Attributable Debt in respect of Sale and Leaseback Transactions involving Operating Properties pursuant to clause (2) of Section 5.02 in existence at such time would not exceed 15% of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets.
 
The foregoing restriction does not apply to, and therefore shall be excluded in computing secured Debt for the purpose of such restriction, Debt secured by:
 
(1)           mortgages on Operating Property, shares of stock or Debt of any entity existing at the time such entity becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, provided that such mortgages are not incurred in anticipation of such entity's becoming a Restricted Subsidiary;
 
(2)           mortgages on Operating Property, shares of stock or Debt existing at the time of acquisition thereof by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary or mortgages thereon to secure the payment of all or any part of the purchase price thereof, or mortgages on Operating Property, shares of stock or Debt to secure any Debt incurred prior to, at the time of, or within 180 days after, the latest of the acquisition thereof or, in the case of Operating Property, the completion of construction, the completion of improvements or the commencement of substantial commercial operation of such Operating Property for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price thereof, such construction or the making of such improvements;
 
(3)           mortgages to secure Debt owing to the Company or to a Restricted Subsidiary;
(4)           mortgages on Operating Property, shares of stock or Debt existing at the date of the initial issuance of the Notes;
 
(5)           mortgages on Operating Property, shares of stock or Debt of a Person existing at the time such Person is merged into or consolidated with the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary or at the time of a sale, lease or other disposition of the properties of a Person as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, provided that such mortgage was not incurred in anticipation of such merger or consolidation or sale, lease or other disposition;
 
(6)           mortgages on Operating Property, shares of stock or Debt in favor of the United States or any state, territory or possession thereof (or the District of Columbia), or any department, agency, instrumentality or political subdivision of the United States or any state, territory or possession thereof (or the District of Columbia), to secure partial, progress, advance or other payments pursuant to any contract or statute or to secure any Debt incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price or the cost of constructing or improving the Operating Property subject to such mortgages; or
 
(7)           extensions, renewals or replacements, in whole or in part, of any mortgage referred to in the foregoing clauses (1) through (6), provided, however, that the principal amount of Debt secured thereby shall not exceed the principal amount of Debt so secured at the time of such extension, renewal or replacement.
 
Section 5.02
Restrictions on Sale and Leaseback Transactions

Sale and Leaseback Transactions by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary with a third party of any Operating Property are prohibited (except for temporary leases for a term, including renewals, of not more than 60 months and except for leases between the Company and a Restricted Subsidiary or between Restricted Subsidiaries) unless the net proceeds of such Sale and Leaseback Transactions are at least equal to the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company) of the Operating Property to be leased and either:
 
(1)           the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary would (at the time of entering into such arrangement) be entitled, as described in clauses (1) through (7) of the second paragraph of Section 5.01, without equally and ratably securing the Notes, to issue, assume or guarantee Debt secured by a mortgage on such Operating Property;
 
(2)           the Attributable Debt of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of such Sale and Leaseback Transactions (other than such Sale and Leaseback Transactions as are referred to in clause (1) or (3) of this paragraph), plus the aggregate principal amount of Debt secured by mortgages on Operating Properties then outstanding (excluding any such Debt secured by mortgages described in clauses (1) through (7) of the second paragraph of Section 5.01) which do not equally and ratably secure the Notes, would not exceed 15% of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets; or
 
(3)           the Company, within 180 days after the sale or transfer, applies or causes a Restricted Subsidiary to apply an amount equal to the greater of the net proceeds of such sale or transfer or fair market value of the Operating Property (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company) so sold and leased back at the time of entering into such Sale and Leaseback Transaction to
 
 
(a)           retire (other than any mandatory retirement, mandatory repayment or sinking fund payment or by payment at maturity) Notes or other Debt of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Debt subordinated to the Notes) having a Stated Maturity more than 12 months from the date of such application or which is extendible at the option of the obligor thereon to a date more than 12 months from the date of such application or
 
(b)           purchase, construct or develop one or more Operating Properties (other than that involved in such Sale and Leaseback Transaction);
 
provided that the amount to be so applied pursuant to this clause (3) will be reduced by the principal amount of Notes delivered within 180 days after such sale or transfer to the Trustee for retirement and cancellation.
 
Section 5.03
Other Limitations
.
 
(a)           Neither the Company nor any Restricted Subsidiary may transfer an Operating Property or shares of stock or Debt of a Restricted Subsidiary to an Unrestricted Subsidiary.
 
(b)           An Unrestricted Subsidiary may not be designated a Restricted Subsidiary unless, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate amount of all Debt of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries secured by mortgages which would otherwise be subject to the restrictions of Section 5.01 and the Attributable Debt in respect of all Sale and Leaseback Transactions pursuant to clause (2) under Section 5.02 in existence at such time does not at the time exceed 15% of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets.

ECOLAB INC., a Delaware corporation (herein called the "Company"), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & CO., or registered assigns, the principal sum of TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS or such other Principal Amount as shall be set forth on Schedule I hereto on February 15, 2015 and to pay interest thereon at the rate of 4.875% per annum from February 8, 2008 or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing August 15, 2008 (each an "Interest Payment Date"), until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment.
 
The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, except as provided in the Indenture hereinafter referred to, be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which will be the February 1 and August 1, as the case may be, immediately preceding each Interest Payment Date.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this Note to be signed in its name by the manual or facsimile signature of its Chief Executive Officer, its President or one of its Vice Presidents and attested by the manual or facsimile signature of its Secretary or one of its Assistant Secretaries.
 
This is one of the Notes described in the Indenture.
 
 
1.             This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company designated as its 4.875% Notes due 2015 (the "Notes") initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $250,000,000 issued and to be issued under an Amended and Restated Indenture dated as of January 9, 2001 and a supplemental indenture dated February 8, 2008 (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A.
,
as trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor Trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes, and the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. The indebtedness of the Company evidenced by the Notes, including the principal thereof and interest thereon (including post-default interest).
 
2.             The Notes are subject to redemption at any time or from time to time, in whole or in part, at the Company's option at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of:
 
(i)            100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed on the Redemption Date; and
 
(ii)           as determined by the Quotation Agent, the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed on that Redemption Date (not including any portion of those payments of interest accrued as of the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate plus 25 basis points
 
plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on the Notes that are due and payable on Interest Payment Dates falling on or prior to a Redemption Date will be payable on the Interest Payment Date to the registered holders as of the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Date according to the Notes and the Indenture.
 
Any notice to holders of Notes of a redemption pursuant to this paragraph 2 hereof will include the appropriate calculation of the redemption price, but does not need to include the redemption price itself. The actual redemption price, calculated as described above, will be set forth in an Officer's Certificate of the Company delivered to the Trustee no later than two Business Days prior to the redemption date.
 
3.             Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, unless all Notes have been called for redemption pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Note, each Holder of the Notes shall have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part (equal to $1,000 or an
integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of such Notes at an offer price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the date of repurchase. "Change of Control Triggering Event" means the occurrence of both a Change of Control and a Below Investment Grade Rating Event, as such terms are defined in the Indenture. The Change of Control Offer will be made in accordance with the terms specified in the Indenture.
 
4.             If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes may declare the principal of all Notes due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.  The Indenture provides that such declaration and its consequences may, in certain events, be annulled by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes.
 
5.             The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of Notes under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of Notes at the time Outstanding. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in aggregate principal amount of Notes at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Notes, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
 
6.             No reference herein to the Indenture and no provisions of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the times, places and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
 
7.             As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note may be registered on the Security Register of the Company, upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company to be maintained for that purpose in New York, New York, or at such other office or agency as may be established by the Company for such purpose pursuant to the Indenture (initially the principal corporate trust office of the Trustee in New York, New York), duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company, and duly executed by the Holder hereof or such Holder's attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
 
8.             The Notes are issuable only in fully registered form, without coupons, in denominations of $2,000 or any amount in excess thereof which is an integral multiple of $1,000. As provided in the Indenture, and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes in authorized denominations, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
9.             No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
 
10.           Prior to the due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer or exchange, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee, nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
11.           Interest on the Notes shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30- day months. Interest shall be payable to and excluding any Interest Payment Date.
 
12.           The Trustee, in its individual or any other capacity, may make loans to, accept deposits from, and perform services for the Company or its Affiliates, and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates, as if it were not the Trustee.

15.           Each Holder of this Note covenants and agrees by such Holder's acceptance thereof to comply with and be bound by the foregoing provisions.
 
16.           All terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
