Item 1.01 Material Definitive Agreement
.
 
On May 6, 2010, our stockholders voted to approve the Ecolab Inc. 2010 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2010 Plan").  (See also Item 5.07 below.)  The 2010 Plan provides for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, stock unit awards and performance awards to employees, consultants, advisors and independent contractors of the Company and its subsidiaries, as well as to non-employee directors of the Company.  A maximum of 12 million shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance under the 2010 Plan, plus the number of shares remaining available for future grants under a predecessor plan, the Ecolab Inc. 2005 Stock Incentive Plan, in each case subject to adjustment for certain changes in our corporate structure or shares. As of May 6, 2010, there were approximately 1,469,000 shares of our common stock remaining available under the predecessor plan. Unless terminated earlier, the 2010 Plan will terminate on May 6, 2020.  This summary of the 2010 Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2010 Plan, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit (10)A and incorporated by reference herein.  A more detailed summary can also be found in our proxy statement for the 2010 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 19, 2010.  Also attached as Exhibits (10)B, C and D are the forms of agreement for Non-Statutory Stock Options,  Restricted Stock Awards and Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Awards under the 2010 Plan.
 
Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year
.
 
On May 6, 2010, our stockholders voted to approve amendments to Article IV of the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation to (a) eliminate the Company's classified board structure as of the 2013 annual meeting of stockholders and (b) change the standard for removal of directors by the Company's stockholders from "for cause" only to "with or without cause" effective following the 2013 annual meeting of stockholders. (See also Item 5.07 below.) Under the declassification process, the Class I directors whose current terms expire at the 2011 annual meeting of stockholders will be elected to hold office for a two-year term expiring at the 2013 annual meeting and the Class II directors whose current terms expire at the 2012 annual meeting of stockholders will be elected to hold office for a one-year term expiring at the 2013 annual meeting. At and after the 2013 annual meeting, the Class I and Class II directors, as well as the Class IIII directors whose three-year terms expire at the 2013 annual meeting, will be elected to hold office for a one-year term expiring at the next annual meeting, and the Board of Directors will no longer be classified.
 
The Company filed a Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State on May 6, 2010 to effect the amendments approved by the stockholders. A copy of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation is attached hereto as Exhibit (3) and is incorporated herein by reference.

This Restated Certificate of Incorporation restates and integrates and further amends the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation by amending the second and fourth paragraphs of Article IV of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation as follows:

This Restated Certificate of Incorporation was duly proposed by the directors and adopted by shareholders in the manner and by the vote prescribed by Section 242 and duly adopted pursuant to Section 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
4.
            
The text of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, as amended, is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:
 
The name of the Corporation is
Ecolab Inc.
 
The purposes of the Corporation are to engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may be organized under the General Corporation Law of Delaware, and without limiting the foregoing, to hold shares of the capital stock of other corporations and to engage in services of all kinds, and produce, manufacture, develop, construct, transport, buy, hold, sell and generally deal in products, materials and property, both tangible and intangible.
 
The total number of shares of all classes of capital stock which the Corporation shall have authority to issue is four hundred fifteen million (415,000,000) consisting of four hundred million (400,000,000) shares of Common Stock of the par value of One Dollar ($1.00) per share and fifteen million (15,000,000) shares of Preferred Stock without par value.  The number of authorized shares of any class of capital stock may be increased or decreased by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote.
 
The Board of Directors of the Corporation is granted full and complete authority to fix by resolution or resolutions the designation, and the powers, preferences and rights of the Preferred Stock and any series thereof, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions on such powers, preferences and rights.
 
A series of Preferred Stock of the Corporation is hereby created and the designation, amount thereof and the working powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights of the shares of such series, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof are as follows:
 
Section 1.
              
Designation and Amount
. The shares of such series shall be designated as "Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock" and the number of shares constituting such series shall be 400,000.
 
Section 2.
              
Dividends and Distributions
.
 
(A)
         
Subject to the prior and superior rights of the holders of any shares of any series of Preferred Stock, if any, issued from time to time ranking prior and superior to the shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash on the fifteenth day of February, May, August and November in each
year (each such date being referred to herein as a "Quarterly Dividend Payment Date"), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) $10.00 or (b) subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 1000 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 1000 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Common Stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Corporation (the "Common Stock") since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after February 24, 2006 (the "Rights Declaration Date") (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
 
(B)
          
The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock as provided in paragraph (A) above immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock); provided that, in the event no dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the Common Stock during the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of $10.00 per share as such amount may be adjusted pursuant to the last sentence of the preceding paragraph on the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.
 
(C)
          
Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend
or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be no more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.
 
Section 3.
              
Voting Rights
. The holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:
 
(A)
         
Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to 1000 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the number of votes per share to which holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
 
(B)
          
Except as otherwise provided herein or by law, the holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation.
 
(C)
          
(i)  If at any time dividends on any Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be in arrears in an amount equal to six (6) quarterly dividends thereon, the occurrence of such contingency shall mark the beginning of a period (herein called a "default period") which shall extend until such time when all accrued and unpaid dividends for all previous quarterly dividend periods and for the current quarterly dividend period on all shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock then outstanding shall have been declared and paid or set apart for payment. During each default period, all holders of Preferred Stock (including holders of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock) with dividends in arrears in an amount equal to six (6) quarterly dividends thereon, voting as a class, irrespective of series, shall have the right to elect two (2) Directors.
 
(ii)
               
During any default period, such voting right of the holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock may be exercised initially at a special meeting called pursuant to subparagraph (iii) of this Section 3(C) or at any annual meeting of stockholders, and thereafter at annual meetings of stockholders, provided that neither such voting right nor the right of the holders of any other series of Preferred Stock, if any, to increase, in certain cases, the authorized number of Directors shall be exercised unless the holders of ten percent (10%) in number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding shall be present in person or by proxy. The absence of a quorum of the holders of Common Stock shall not affect the exercise by the holders of Preferred Stock of such voting right. At any meeting at which the holders of Preferred Stock shall exercise such voting right initially during an existing default period, they shall have the right, voting as a class, to elect Directors to fill such vacancies, if any, in the Board of Directors as may then exist up to two (2) Directors or, if such right is exercised at an annual meeting, to elect two (2) Directors. If the number which may be so elected at any special meeting does not amount to the required number, the holders of the Preferred Stock shall have the right to make
such increase in the number of Directors as shall be necessary to permit the election by them of the required number. After the holders of the Preferred Stock shall have exercised their right to elect Directors in any default period and during the continuance of such period, the number of Directors shall not be increased or decreased except by vote of the holders of Preferred Stock as herein provided or pursuant to the rights of any equity securities ranking senior to or pari passu with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock.
 
(iii)
              
Unless the holders of Preferred Stock shall, during an existing default period, have previously exercised their right to elect Directors, the Board of Directors may order, or any stockholder or stockholders owning in the aggregate not less than ten percent (10%) of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding, irrespective of series, may request, the calling of a special meeting of the holders of Preferred Stock, which meeting shall thereupon be called by the President, a Vice President or the Secretary of the Corporation. Notice of such meeting and of any annual meeting at which holders of Preferred Stock are entitled to vote pursuant to this paragraph (C) (iii) shall be given to each holder of record of Preferred Stock by mailing a copy of such notice to him at his last address as the same appears on the books of the Corporation. Such meeting shall be called for a time not earlier than 20 days and not later than 60 days after such order or request or in default of the calling of such meeting within 60 days after such order or request, such meeting may be called on similar notice by any stockholder or stockholders owning in the aggregate not less than ten percent (10%) of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (C)(iii), no such special meeting shall be called during the period within 60 days immediately preceding the date fixed for the next annual meeting of the stockholders.
 
(iv)
              
In any default period, the holders of Common Stock, and other classes of stock of the Corporation if applicable, shall continue to be entitled to elect the whole number of Directors until the holders of Preferred Stock shall have exercised their right to elect two (2) Directors voting as a class, after the exercise of which right (x) the Directors so elected by the holders of Preferred Stock shall continue in office until their successors shall have been elected by such holders or until the expiration of the default period, and (y) any vacancy in the Board of Directors may (except as provided in paragraph (C)(ii) of this Section 3) be filled by vote of a majority of the remaining Directors theretofore elected by the holders of the class of stock which elected the Director whose office shall have become vacant. References in this paragraph (C) to Directors elected by the holders of a particular class of stock shall include Directors elected by such Directors to fill vacancies as provided in clause (y) of the foregoing sentence.
 
(v)
               
Immediately upon the expiration of a default period, (x) the right of the holders of Preferred Stock as a class to elect Directors shall cease, (y) the term of any Directors elected by the holders of Preferred Stock as a class shall terminate, and (z) the number of Directors shall be such number as may be provided for in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws irrespective of any increase made pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (C)(ii) of this Section 3 (such number being subject, however, to change thereafter in any manner provided by law or in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws). Any vacancies in the Board of Directors effected by the provisions of clauses (y) and (z) in the preceding sentence may be filled by a majority of the remaining Directors.
(D)
         
Except as set forth herein, holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action.
 
Section 4.
              
Certain Restrictions
.
 
(A)
         
Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or distributions payable on the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2 are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not declared, on shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been paid in full, the Corporation shall not:
 
(i)
                
declare or pay dividends on, make any other distributions on, or redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock;
 
(ii)
               
declare or pay dividends on or make any other distributions on any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are then entitled;
 
(iii)
              
redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, provided that the Corporation may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such parity stock in exchange for shares of any stock of the Corporation ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up) to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock; or
 
(iv)
              
purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, or any shares of stock ranking on a parity with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to all holders of such shares upon such terms as the Board of Directors, after consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the respective series and classes, shall determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or classes.
 
(B)
          
The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the Corporation unless the Corporation could, under paragraph (A) of this Section 4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.
 
Section 5.
              
Reacquired Shares
. Any shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be retired and cancelled promptly after the acquisition thereof. All such shares shall upon
their cancellation become authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock to be created by resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors, subject to the conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth herein.
 
Section 6.
              
Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up
.
 
(A)
         
Upon any liquidation (voluntary or otherwise), dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, no distribution shall be made to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have received $1000 per share, plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of such payment (the "Series A Liquidation Preference"). Following the payment of the full amount of the Series A Liquidation Preference, no additional distributions shall be made to the holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Common Stock shall have received an amount per share (the "Common Adjustment") equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the Series A Liquidation Preference by (ii) 1000 (as appropriately adjusted as set forth in subparagraph (C) below to reflect such events as stock splits, stock dividends and recapitalizations with respect to the Common Stock) (such number in clause (ii), the "Adjustment Number"). Following the payment of the full amount of the Series A Liquidation Preference and the Common Adjustment in respect of all outstanding shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and Common Stock, respectively, holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and holders of shares of Common Stock shall receive their ratable and proportionate share of the remaining assets to be distributed in the ratio of the Adjustment Number to 1 with respect to such Preferred Stock and Common Stock, on a per share basis, respectively.
 
(B)
          
In the event, however, that there are not sufficient assets available to permit payment in full of the Series A Liquidation Preference and the liquidation preferences of all other series of Preferred Stock, if any, which rank on a parity with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, then such remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of such parity shares in proportion to their respective liquidation preferences. In the event, however, that there are not sufficient assets available to permit payment in full of the Common Adjustment, then such remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of Common Stock.
 
(C)
          
In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the Adjustment Number in effect immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such Adjustment Number by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
 
Section 7.
              
Consolidation, Merger, Etc
.  In case the Corporation shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the shares of Common
Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case the shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed in an amount per share (subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth) equal to 1000 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or change of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
 
Section 8.
              
No Redemption
. The shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall not be redeemable.
 
Section 9.
              
Ranking
.  The Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall rank junior to all other series of the Corporation's Preferred Stock which may be issued from time to time as to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets, unless the terms of any such series shall provide otherwise.
 
Section 10.
            
Amendment
.  At any time when any shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock are outstanding, neither the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation nor this Certificate of Designation shall be amended in any manner which would materially alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely without the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority or more of the outstanding shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class.
 
Section 11.
            
Fractional Shares
.  Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock may be issued in fractions of a share which shall entitle the holder, in proportion to such holder's fractional shares, to exercise voting rights, receive dividends, participate in distributions and to have the benefit of all other rights of holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock.
 
No stockholder shall have any preemptive right to subscribe to an additional issue of capital stock or to any security convertible into such capital stock.
 
The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of a Board of Directors. Except to the extent prohibited by law, the Board of Directors shall have the right (which, to the extent exercised, shall be exclusive) to establish the rights, powers, duties, rules and procedures (a) that from time to time shall govern the Board of Directors and each of its members including without limitation the vote required for any action by the Board of Directors, and (b) that from time to time shall affect the directors' power to manage and direct
the business and affairs of the Corporation; and Article V notwithstanding, no By-Law shall be adopted by the stockholders of the Corporation which shall impair or impede the implementation of the foregoing.
 
The Board of Directors shall consist of a number of directors, which number shall be determined from time to time exclusively by the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by affirmative vote of a majority of the entire Board of Directors. The directors shall be divided into three classes as nearly equal in number as possible, designated Class I, Class II and Class III. At the 1983 annual meeting of stockholders, Class I directors shall be elected for a term expiring at the 1984 annual meeting of stockholders, Class II directors shall be elected for a term expiring at the 1985 annual meeting of stockholders, and Class III directors shall be elected for a term expiring at the 1986 annual meeting of stockholders. At each annual meeting of stockholders following such initial classification and election, directors elected to succeed those directors whose terms expire shall be elected for a term of office to expire at the third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders after their election. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) at the 2011 annual meeting of stockholders, the directors whose terms expire at that meeting shall be elected to hold office for a two-year term expiring at the 2013 annual meeting of stockholders; (2) at the 2012 annual meeting of stockholders, the directors whose terms expire at that meeting shall be elected to hold office for a one-year term expiring at the 2013 annual meeting of stockholders; and (3) at the 2013 annual meeting of stockholders and each annual meeting of stockholders thereafter, all directors shall be elected for a one-year term expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders.

No decrease in the number of authorized directors constituting the entire Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director. Subject to the rights of the holders of any class or series of the capital stock then outstanding, (x) until the 2013 annual meeting of stockholders and in accordance with Section 141(k)(1) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, any director, or the entire Board of Directors, may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause and (y) from and after the 2013 annual meeting of stockholders, any director, or the entire Board of Directors, may be removed from office at any time, with or without cause.
 
No director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty by such director as a director; provided, however, that this Article IV shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a director to the extent provided by applicable law (i) for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. No amendment to or repeal of this Article IV shall apply to, or have any effect on, the liability or alleged liability of any director of the Corporation for or with respect to any acts or omissions of such director occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.
 
The Board of Directors may from time to time, by vote of a majority of its members, alter, amend or rescind all or any of the By-Laws of the Corporation, as permitted by law, subject to the power of the stockholders to change or repeal such By-Laws.

Plan Administration.
 
3.1
          
The Committee
.  The Plan will be administered by the Board or by a committee of the Board.  So long as the Company has a class of its equity securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, any committee administering the Plan will consist solely of two or more members of the Board who are "non-employee directors" within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act, who are "independent" as required by the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange and who are "outside directors" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, but any action taken by such a committee shall be valid and effective even if the members of such committee at the time of such action are later determined not to have satisfied all the requirements for membership specified above.  Such a committee, if established, will act by majority approval of the members (unanimous approval with respect to action by written consent), and a majority of the members of such a committee will constitute a quorum.  As used in the Plan, "Committee" will refer to the Board or to such a committee, if established.  To the extent consistent with applicable corporate law of the Company's jurisdiction of incorporation, the Committee may delegate to one or more of its members or to any officers of the Company the
duties, power and authority of the Committee under the Plan pursuant to such conditions or limitations as the Committee may establish; provided, however, that only the Committee may exercise such duties, power and authority with respect to Eligible Recipients who are subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act or whose compensation in the fiscal year may be subject to the limits on deductible compensation pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Code.  The Committee may also delegate to one or more agents or advisors such non-discretionary administrative duties or powers as it deems advisable.  The Committee may exercise its duties, power and authority under the Plan in its sole and absolute discretion without the consent of any Participant or other party, unless the Plan specifically provides otherwise.  Each determination, interpretation or other action made or taken by the Committee pursuant to the provisions of the Plan will be conclusive and binding for all purposes and on all persons, and no member of the Committee will be liable for any action or determination made in good faith with respect to the Plan or any Incentive Award granted under the Plan.
 
3.2
          
Authority of the Committee
.
 
(a)
          
In accordance with and subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee will have the authority to determine all provisions of Incentive Awards as the Committee may deem necessary or desirable and as consistent with the terms of the Plan, including, without limitation, the following:  (i) the Eligible Recipients to be selected as Participants; (ii) the nature and extent of the Incentive Awards to be made to each Participant (including the number of shares of Common Stock to be subject to each Incentive Award, any exercise price, the manner in which Incentive Awards will vest or become exercisable and whether Incentive Awards will be granted in tandem with other Incentive Awards) and the form of written or electronic agreement, if any, evidencing such Incentive Award; (iii) the time or times when Incentive Awards will be granted; (iv) the duration of each Incentive Award; and (v) the restrictions and other conditions to which the payment or vesting of Incentive Awards may be subject.  In addition, the Committee will have the authority under the Plan in its sole discretion to (A) establish, amend or rescind rules to administer the Plan; (B) interpret the Plan and any Incentive Award or related agreement made under the Plan; (C) make all other determinations necessary or desirable for the administration of the Plan; and (D) pay the intrinsic value of any Incentive Award in the form of cash, Common Stock or any combination of both.
 
(b)
          
Subject to Section 3.2(d) below, the Committee will have the authority under the Plan to amend or modify the terms of any outstanding Incentive Award in any manner, including, without limitation, the authority to modify the number of shares or other terms and conditions of an Incentive Award, extend the term of an Incentive Award, accelerate the exercisability or vesting or otherwise terminate any restrictions relating to an Incentive Award, accept the surrender of any outstanding Incentive Award or, to the extent not previously exercised or vested, authorize the grant of new Incentive Awards in substitution for surrendered Incentive Awards; provided, however that (i) the amended or modified terms are permitted by the Plan as then in effect; (ii) any Participant adversely affected by such amended or modified terms shall have consented to such amendment or modification unless such amendment is necessary to comply with applicable law or stock exchange rules; and (iii) the authority to accelerate the exercisability or vesting or
otherwise terminate restrictions relating to an Incentive Award may be exercised only in connection with a Participant's death, Disability or Retirement, in connection with a Change in Control, or to the extent such actions involve an aggregate number of shares of Common Stock not in excess of 5% of the number of shares available for Incentive Awards under the first sentence of Section 4.1.
 
(c)
          
In the event of (i) any reorganization, merger, consolidation, recapitalization, liquidation, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares, rights offering, extraordinary dividend or divestiture (including a spin-off) or any other change in corporate structure or shares; (ii) any purchase, acquisition, sale, disposition or write-down of a significant amount of assets or a significant business; (iii) any change in accounting principles or practices, tax laws or other such laws or provisions affecting reported results; (iv) any uninsured catastrophic losses or extraordinary non-recurring items as described in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30 or in management's discussion and analysis of financial performance appearing in the Company's annual report to stockholders for the applicable year; or (v) any other similar change, in each case with respect to the Company or any other entity whose performance is relevant to the grant or vesting of an Incentive Award, the Committee (or, if the Company is not the surviving corporation in any such transaction, the board of directors of the surviving corporation) may, without the consent of any affected Participant, amend or modify the vesting criteria (including Performance Criteria and related performance goals) of any outstanding Incentive Award that is based in whole or in part on the financial performance of the Company (or any Subsidiary or division or other subunit thereof) or such other entity so as equitably to reflect such event, with the desired result that the criteria for evaluating such financial performance of the Company or such other entity will be substantially the same (in the sole discretion of the Committee or the board of directors of the surviving corporation) following such event as prior to such event; provided, however, that (A) the amended or modified terms are permitted by the Plan as then in effect and (B) with respect to any Incentive Award intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation, any such amendment or modification would not result in such Incentive Award failing to qualify as "performance-based compensation" for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code.
 
(d)
          
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan other than Section 4.3, the Committee may not, without prior approval of the Company's stockholders, seek to effect any re-pricing of any previously granted, "underwater" Option by:  (i) amending or modifying the terms of the Option to lower the exercise price; (ii) canceling the underwater Option and granting either (A) replacement Options or Stock Appreciation Rights having a lower exercise price; (B) Restricted Stock Awards; or (C) Stock Unit Awards or Performance Awards in exchange; or (iii) repurchasing the underwater Options.  For purposes of this Section 3.2(d), an Option will be deemed to be "underwater" at any time when the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock is less than the exercise price of the Option.
 
(e)
          
In addition to the authority of the Committee under Section 3.2(b) and notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Committee may, in its sole
discretion, amend the terms of the Plan or Incentive Awards with respect to Participants resident outside of the United States or employed by a non-U.S. Subsidiary in order to comply with local legal requirements, to otherwise protect the Company's or Subsidiary's interests, or to meet objectives of the Plan, and may, where appropriate, establish one or more sub-plans (including the adoption of any required rules and regulations) for the purposes of qualifying for preferred tax treatment under foreign tax laws.  The Committee shall have no authority, however, to take action pursuant to this Section 3.2(e): (i) to reserve shares or grant Incentive Awards in excess of the limitations provided in Section 4.1; (ii) to effect any re-pricing in violation of Section 3.2(d); (iii) to grant Options having an exercise price less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock on the date of grant in violation of Section 6.2; or (iv) for which stockholder approval would then be required pursuant to Section 422 of the Code or Section 162(m) of the Code or the rules of the New York Stock Exchange.
 
(f)
           
Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, the Committee will determine whether an Incentive Award is subject to the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and, if determined to be subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Committee will make such Incentive Award subject to such written terms and conditions determined necessary or desirable to cause such Incentive Award to comply in form with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.  Further, the Plan, as it relates to Incentive Awards that are subject to Section 409A of the Code, will be administered in a manner that is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and any regulations or rulings issued thereunder.

4.1
          
Maximum Number of Shares Available; Certain Restrictions on Awards
.  Subject to Section 4.2 and to adjustment as provided in Section 4.3 of the Plan, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that will be available for issuance under the Plan will be 12,000,000, plus any Shares of Common Stock remaining available for future grants under the Prior Plan on the effective date of this Plan.  The shares available for issuance under the Plan may, at the election of the Committee, be either treasury shares or shares authorized but unissued, and, if treasury shares are used, all references in the Plan to the issuance of shares will, for corporate law purposes, be deemed to mean the transfer of shares from treasury.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan to the contrary, (i) no Participant in the Plan may be granted Incentive Awards denominated in shares of Common Stock relating to more than 2,000,000 shares of Common Stock in the aggregate during any calendar year; (ii) no Participant in the Plan may be granted Incentive Awards denominated in cash in an amount in excess of $5,000,000 in the aggregate during any calendar year; and (iii) no more than 12,000,000 shares of Common Stock may be issued pursuant to the exercise of Incentive Stock Options granted under the Plan, with the foregoing share limits subject, in each case, to adjustment as provided in Section 4.3 of the Plan.
 
4.2
          
Accounting for Incentive Awards
.  Shares of Common Stock that are issued under the Plan or that are potentially issuable pursuant to outstanding Incentive Awards will be applied to reduce the maximum number of shares of Common Stock remaining available for issuance
under the Plan; provided, however, that (A) the total number of shares remaining available for issuance under the Plan shall be reduced by 2.5 shares for each share issued pursuant to an Incentive Award other than an Option or a Stock Appreciation Right, or potentially issuable pursuant to an outstanding Incentive Award other than an Option or a Stock Appreciation Right; and (B) Substitute Awards shall not reduce the maximum number of shares of Common Stock remaining available for issuance under the Plan.  Any shares of Common Stock subject to an Incentive Award, or to an award granted under the Prior Plan that is outstanding on the effective date of this Plan (a "Prior Plan Award"), that lapses, expires, is forfeited (including issued shares forfeited under a Restricted Stock Award) or for any reason is terminated unexercised or unvested or is settled or paid in cash or any form other than shares of Common Stock shall, to the extent of such lapse, expiration, forfeiture or settlement other than in shares of Common Stock, automatically again become available for issuance under the Plan and correspondingly increase the total number of shares available for issuance under Section 4.1 (with such increase in connection with Incentive Awards other than Options and Stock Appreciation Rights based on the same ratio specified in clause (A) of the proviso to the first sentence of this Section 4.2).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4.2, the following shares of Common Stock will not again become available for issuance under the Plan: (i) any shares which would have been issued upon any exercise of an Option but for the fact that the exercise price was paid by a "net exercise" pursuant to Section 6.4(b) or any Previously Acquired Shares tendered (either actually or by attestation) by a Participant in payment of the exercise price of an Option; (ii) any shares withheld by the Company or Previously Acquired Shares tendered (either actually or by attestation) by a Participant to satisfy any tax withholding obligation with respect to an Incentive Award or a Prior Plan Award; (iii) shares covered by a stock appreciation right issued under the Plan or the Prior Plan that are not issued in connection with the stock settlement of the stock appreciation right upon its exercise; or (iv) shares that are repurchased by the Company using Option exercise proceeds.
 
4.3
          
Adjustments to Shares and Incentive Awards
.  In the event of any equity restructuring (within the meaning of FASB ASC Topic 718, ) that causes the per share value of shares of Common Stock to change, such as a stock dividend, stock split, spinoff, rights offering or recapitalization through an extraordinary dividend, the Committee shall make such adjustments as it deems equitable and appropriate to (i) the aggregate number and kind of shares or other securities issued or reserved for issuance under the Plan, (ii) the number and kind of shares or other securities subject to outstanding Incentive Awards, (iii) the exercise price of outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, and (iv) any maximum limitations prescribed by the Plan with respect to certain types of Incentive Awards or the grants to individuals of certain types of Incentive Awards.  In the event of any other change in corporate capitalization, including a merger, consolidation, reorganization, or partial or complete liquidation of the Company, such equitable adjustments described in the foregoing sentence may be made as determined to be appropriate and equitable by the Committee (or, if the Company is not the surviving corporation in any such transaction, the board of directors of the surviving corporation) to prevent dilution or enlargement of rights of Participants.  In either case, any such adjustment shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes of the Plan.  No adjustment shall be made pursuant to this Section 4.3 in connection with the conversion of any convertible securities of the Company, or in a manner that would cause
Compensation - Stock Compensation
Incentive Stock Options to violate Section 422(b) of the Code or cause an Incentive Award to be subject to adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code.
 
4.4
          
Effect of Plans Maintained by Acquired Companies
.  If a company acquired by the Company or any Subsidiary or with which the Company or any Subsidiary combines has shares available under a pre-existing plan approved by stockholders and not adopted in contemplation of such acquisition or combination, the shares available for grant pursuant to the terms of such pre-existing plan (as adjusted, to the extent appropriate, using the exchange ratio or other adjustment or valuation ratio or formula used in such acquisition or combination to determine the consideration payable to the holders of common stock of the entities party to such acquisition or combination) may be used for Incentive Awards under the Plan and shall not reduce the shares of Common Stock authorized for issuance under the Plan.  Incentive Awards using such available shares shall not be made after the date awards could have been made under the terms of the pre-existing plan, absent the acquisition or combination, and shall only be made to individuals who were not employees of the Company or any Subsidiary or Non-Employee Directors prior to such acquisition or combination.

Eligible Recipients may be granted from time to time one or more Incentive Awards, singly or in combination or in tandem with other Incentive Awards, as may be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.

The Committee may designate whether an Option is to be considered an Incentive Stock Option or a Non-Statutory Stock Option.  To the extent that any Incentive Stock Option granted under the Plan ceases for any reason to qualify as an "incentive stock option" for purposes of Section 422 of the Code, such Incentive Stock Option will continue to be outstanding for purposes of the Plan but will thereafter be deemed to be a Non-Statutory Stock Option.
 
6.2
          
Exercise Price
.  The per share price to be paid by a Participant upon exercise of an Option will be determined by the Committee in its discretion at the time of the Option grant, provided that such price will not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock on the date of grant, except in the case of Substitute Awards.

(b)
          
In the case of a "net exercise" of an Option, the Company will not require a payment of the exercise price of the Option from the Participant but will reduce the number of shares of Common Stock issued upon the exercise by the largest number of whole shares that has a Fair Market Value that does not exceed the aggregate exercise price for the shares exercised under this method. Shares of Common Stock will no longer be outstanding under an Option (and will therefore not thereafter be exercisable) following the exercise of such Option to the extent of (i) shares used to pay the exercise price of an Option under the "net exercise," (ii) shares actually delivered to the Participant as a result of such exercise and (iii) any shares withheld for purposes of tax withholding pursuant to Section 13.1.
 
(c)
          
Previously Acquired Shares tendered or covered by an attestation as payment of an Option exercise price will be valued at their Fair Market Value on the exercise date.

Participant (i.e., cash, Common Stock or any combination thereof) or to consent to or disapprove the election by a Participant of the form of such payment.
 
7.2
          
Exercise Price
.  The exercise price of a Stock Appreciation Right will be determined by the Committee, in its discretion, at the date of grant but may not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock on the date of grant, except as provided in Section 7.4 below and except in the case of Substitute Awards.

Grants in Tandem with Options

A Stock Appreciation Right granted in tandem with an Option shall cover the same number of shares of Common Stock as covered by the Option (or such lesser number as the Committee may determine), shall be exercisable at such time or times and only to the extent that the related Option is exercisable, have the same term as the Option and shall have an exercise price equal to the exercise price for the Option.  Upon the exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right granted in tandem with an Option, the Option shall be canceled automatically to the extent of the number of shares covered by such exercise; conversely, upon exercise of an Option having a related Stock Appreciation Right, the Stock Appreciation Right shall be canceled automatically to the extent of the number of shares covered by the Option exercise.

8.3
          
Dividends and Distributions
.  Unless the Committee determines otherwise in its sole discretion (either in the agreement evidencing the Restricted Stock Award at the time of
grant or at any time after the grant of the Restricted Stock Award), any dividends or distributions (other than regular quarterly cash dividends in the case of Restricted Stock Awards that are subject only to service-based vesting conditions) paid with respect to shares of Common Stock subject to the unvested portion of a Restricted Stock Award will be subject to the same restrictions as the shares to which such dividends or distributions relate.  The Committee will determine in its sole discretion whether any interest will be paid on such restricted dividends or distributions.  In its discretion, the Committee may provide in any award agreement evidencing a Restricted Stock Award for the waiver by the Participant of any right to receive dividends and distributions with respect to shares of Common Stock subject to the unvested portion of the Restricted Stock Award.
 
8.4

Subject to Section 12.5 of the Plan, in the event a Participant's employment or other service is terminated with the Company and all Subsidiaries for any reason other than death, Disability or Retirement, or a Participant is in the employ or service of a Subsidiary and the Subsidiary ceases to be a Subsidiary of the Company (unless the Participant continues in the employ or service of the Company or another Subsidiary):
 
(a)
          
All outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights then held by the Participant will, to the extent exercisable as of such termination, remain exercisable for a period of three months after such termination (but in no event after the expiration date of any such Option or Stock Appreciation Right), and will, to the extent not exercisable as of such termination, terminate and be forfeited.
 
(b)
          
All unvested Restricted Stock Awards, Stock Unit Awards and Performance Awards then held by the Participant will terminate and be forfeited.
 
12.4
        
Modification of Rights Upon Termination
.  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 12, upon a Participant's termination of employment or other service with the Company and all Subsidiaries, the Committee may, in its sole discretion (which may be exercised at any time on or after the date of grant, including following such termination), except as
provided in clauses (ii) and (iii) below, cause Options or Stock Appreciation Rights (or any part thereof) then held by such Participant to terminate, become or continue to become exercisable and/or remain exercisable following such termination of employment or service, and Restricted Stock Awards, Stock Unit Awards or Performance Awards then held by such Participant to terminate, vest and/or continue to vest or become free of restrictions and conditions to payment, as the case may be, following such termination of employment or service, in each case in the manner determined by the Committee; provided, however, that (i) no Incentive Award may remain exercisable or continue to vest for more than two years beyond the date such Incentive Award would have terminated if not for the provisions of this Section 12.4 but in no event beyond its expiration date; (ii) any such action adversely affecting any outstanding Incentive Award will not be effective without the consent of the affected Participant (subject to the right of the Committee to take whatever action it deems appropriate under Sections 3.2(c), 4.3 and 14 of the Plan); and (iii) such actions (other than termination of an Incentive Award) occurring other than in connection with the death, Disability or Retirement of a Participant shall not involve an aggregate number of shares of Common Stock in excess of 5% of the number of shares available for Incentive Awards under the first sentence of Section 4.1).
 
12.5
        
Effects of Actions Constituting Cause
.  Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, in the event that a Participant is determined by the Committee, acting in its sole discretion, to have committed any action which would constitute Cause as defined in Section 2.3, irrespective of whether such action or the Committee's determination occurs before or after termination of such Participant's employment with the Company or any Subsidiary, all rights of the Participant under the Plan and any agreements evidencing an Incentive Award then held by the Participant shall terminate and be forfeited without notice of any kind.  The Company may defer the exercise of any Option, the vesting of any Restricted Stock Award or the payment of any Stock Unit Award or Performance Award for a period of up to forty-five (45) days in order for the Committee to make any determination as to the existence of Cause.
 
12.6
        
Determination of Termination of Employment or Other Service
.
 
(a)
          
The change in a Participant's status from that of an employee of the Company or any Subsidiary to that of a non-employee consultant or advisor of the Company or any Subsidiary will, for purposes of the Plan, be deemed to result in a termination of such Participant's employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries, unless the Committee otherwise determines in its sole discretion.
 
(b)
          
The change in a Participant's status from that of a non-employee consultant or advisor of the Company or any Subsidiary to that of an employee of the Company or any Subsidiary will not, for purposes of the Plan, be deemed to result in a termination of such Participant's service as a non-employee consultant or advisor with the Company and its Subsidiaries, and such Participant will thereafter be deemed to be an employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries until such Participant's employment is terminated, in which event such Participant will be governed by the provisions of this Plan relating to termination of employment (subject to paragraph (a), above).
(c)
          
Unless the Committee otherwise determines in its sole discretion, a Participant's employment or other service will, for purposes of the Plan, be deemed to have terminated on the date recorded on the personnel or other records of the Company or the Subsidiary for which the Participant provides employment or other service, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion based upon such records; provided, however, if distribution or payment of an Incentive Award subject to Section 409A of the Code is triggered by a termination of a Participant's employment, such termination must also constitute a "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.
 
13.
          
Payment of Withholding Taxes.
 
13.1
        
General Rules
.  The Company is entitled to (a) withhold and deduct from future wages of the Participant (or from other amounts that may be due and owing to the Participant from the Company or a Subsidiary), or make other arrangements for the collection of, all legally required amounts necessary to satisfy any and all federal, foreign, state and local withholding and employment-related tax requirements attributable to an Incentive Award, including, without limitation, the grant, exercise or vesting of, or payment of dividends with respect to, an Incentive Award or a disqualifying disposition of stock received upon exercise of an Incentive Stock Option; (b) withhold cash paid or payable or shares of Common Stock from the shares issued or otherwise issuable to the Participant in connection with an Incentive Award; or (c) require the Participant promptly to remit the amount of such withholding to the Company before taking any action, including issuing any shares of Common Stock, with respect to an Incentive Award.
 
13.2
        
Special Rules
.  The Committee may, in its sole discretion and upon terms and conditions established by the Committee, permit or require a Participant to satisfy, in whole or in part, any withholding or employment-related tax obligation described in Section 13.1 of the Plan by electing to tender, or by attestation as to ownership of, Previously Acquired Shares that have been held for the period of time necessary to avoid a charge to the Company's earnings for financial reporting purposes and that are otherwise acceptable to the Committee, by delivery of a Broker Exercise Notice or a combination of such methods.  For purposes of satisfying a Participant's withholding or employment-related tax obligation, Previously Acquired Shares tendered or covered by an attestation will be valued at their Fair Market Value.
 
14.
          
Change in Control.
 
14.1
        
A "Change in Control" shall be deemed to have occurred if the event set forth in any one of the following paragraphs shall have occurred:
 
(a)
          
any "person" as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act (other than  the Company, any trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under any employee benefit plan of the Company or any corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by the stockholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of stock of the Company), is or becomes, including pursuant to a tender or exchange offer for shares of Common Stock pursuant to which purchases are made, the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule l3d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or
indirectly, of securities of the Company representing 25% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding securities, provided, however, that the provisions of this paragraph (a) shall not be applicable to a transaction in which a corporation becomes the owner of all the Company's outstanding securities in a transaction that would not be a Change of Control under paragraph (c) of this Section 14.1; or
 
(b)
          
during any twenty-four (24)consecutive calendar months, individuals who constitute the Board on the first day of such period or any new director (other than a director whose initial assumption of office is in connection with an actual or threatened election contest including, but not limited to, a consent solicitation, relating to the election of directors of the Company) whose appointment or election by the Board or nomination for election by the Company's stockholders was approved or recommended by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the directors then still in office who were either directors on the first day of such period, or whose appointment, election or nomination for election was previously so approved or recommended, shall cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority thereof; or
 
(c)
          
there is consummated a merger or consolidation of the Company or any direct or indirect subsidiary of the Company with any other corporation, other than a merger or consolidation which would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity or any parent thereof) more than 50% of the combined voting power of the securities of the Company or such surviving entity or any parent thereof outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation, and in which no "person" (as defined under paragraph (a) above) acquires 50% or more of the combined voting power of the securities of the Company or such surviving entity or parent thereof outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation; or
 
(d)
          
there is consummated a plan of complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company or there is consummated the sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company's assets, other than a sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company's assets to an entity, more than 50% of the combined voting power of the voting securities of which are owned by stockholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of the Company immediately prior to such sale.
 
14.2
        
Effect of a Change in Control
.  Unless otherwise provided in an agreement evidencing an Incentive Award, the following provisions shall apply to outstanding Incentive Awards in the event of a Change in Control.
 
(a)
          
Continuation, Assumption or Replacement of Incentive Awards
.  In the event of a Change in Control, the surviving or successor entity (or its parent corporation) may continue, assume or replace Incentive Awards outstanding as of the date of the Change in Control (with such adjustments as may be required or permitted by Section
4.3), and such Incentive Awards or replacements therefore shall remain outstanding and be governed by their respective terms, subject to Section 14.2(d) below.  A surviving or successor entity may elect to continue, assume or replace only some Incentive Awards or portions of Incentive Awards.  For purposes of this Section 14.2(a), an Incentive Award shall be considered assumed or replaced if, in connection with the Change in Control and in a manner consistent with Sections 409A and 424 of the Code, either (i) the contractual obligations represented by the Incentive Award are expressly assumed by the surviving or successor entity (or its parent corporation) with appropriate adjustments to the number and type of securities subject to the Incentive Award and the exercise price thereof that preserves the intrinsic value of the Incentive Award existing at the time of the Change in Control, or (ii) the Participant has received a comparable equity-based award that preserves the intrinsic value of the Incentive Award existing at the time of the Change in Control and provides for a vesting or exercisability schedule that is the same as or more favorable to the Participant.
 
(b)
          
Acceleration of Incentive Awards
.  If and to the extent that outstanding Incentive Awards under the Plan are not continued, assumed or replaced in connection with a Change in Control, then (i) outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights issued to the Participant that are not yet fully exercisable shall immediately become exercisable in full and shall remain exercisable in accordance with their terms, (ii) all unvested Restricted Stock Awards, Stock Unit Awards and Performance Awards will become immediately fully vested and non-forfeitable; and (iii) any Performance Criteria applicable to Restricted Stock Awards, Stock Unit Awards and Performance Awards will be deemed to have been satisfied to the maximum degree specified in connection with the applicable Incentive Award.
 
(c)
          
Payment for Incentive Awards
.  If and to the extent that outstanding Incentive Awards under the Plan are not continued, assumed or replaced in connection with a Change in Control, then the Committee may terminate some or all of such outstanding Incentive Awards, in whole or in part, as of the effective time of the Change in Control in exchange for payments to the holders as provided in this Section 14.2(c).  The Committee will not be required to treat all Incentive Awards similarly for purposes of this Section 14.2(c).  The payment for any Incentive Award or portion thereof terminated shall be in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Committee) of the consideration that would otherwise be received in the Change in Control for the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Incentive Award or portion thereof being terminated, or, if no consideration is to be received by the Company's stockholders in the Change in Control, the Fair Market Value of such number of shares immediately prior to the effective date of the Change in Control, over (ii) the aggregate exercise price (if any) for the shares of Common Stock subject to the Incentive Award or portion thereof being terminated.  If there is no excess, the Incentive Award may be terminated without payment.  Any payment shall be made in such form, on such terms and subject to such conditions as the Committee determines in its discretion, which may or may not be the same as the form, terms and conditions applicable to payments to the Company's stockholders in connection with the Change in Control, and may include subjecting such payments to vesting conditions comparable to
those of the Incentive Award surrendered.
 
(d)
          
Termination After a Change in Control
.  If and to the extent that Incentive Awards are continued, assumed or replaced under the circumstances described in Section 14.2(a), and if within two years after the Change in Control a Participant experiences an involuntary termination of employment or other service for reasons other than Cause, or terminates his or her employment or other service for Good Reason, then (i) outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights issued to the Participant that are not yet fully exercisable shall immediately become exercisable in full and shall remain exercisable in accordance with their terms, (ii) all unvested Restricted Stock Awards, Stock Unit Awards and Performance Awards will become immediately fully vested and non-forfeitable; and (iii) any Performance Criteria applicable to Restricted Stock Awards, Stock Unit Awards and Performance Awards will be deemed to have been satisfied to the maximum degree specified in connection with the applicable Incentive Award.
 
15.
          
Rights of Eligible Recipients and Participants; Transferability.
 
15.1
        
Employment or Service
.  Nothing in the Plan will interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Company or any Subsidiary to terminate the employment or service of any Eligible Recipient or Participant at any time, nor confer upon any Eligible Recipient or Participant any right to continue in the employ or service of the Company or any Subsidiary.
 
15.2
        
Rights as a Stockholder; Dividends
.  As a holder of Incentive Awards (other than Restricted Stock Awards), a Participant will have no rights as a stockholder unless and until such Incentive Awards are exercised for, or paid in the form of, shares of Common Stock and the Participant becomes the holder of record of such shares.  Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or otherwise provided by the Committee, no adjustment will be made in the amount of cash payable or in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable under Incentive Awards denominated in or based on the value of shares of Common Stock as a result of cash dividends or distributions paid to holders of Common Stock prior to the payment of, or issuance of shares of Common Stock under, such Incentive Awards.  In its discretion, the Committee may provide in an agreement evidencing a Stock Unit Award or a Performance Award that the Participant will be entitled to receive dividend equivalents, in the form of a cash credit to an account for the benefit of the Participant, for any such dividends and distributions.  The terms of any rights to dividend equivalents will be determined by the Committee and set forth in the agreement evidencing the Stock Unit Award or Performance Award, including the time and form of payment and whether such equivalents will be credited with interest or deemed to be reinvested in Common Stock; provided, however, that dividend equivalents in respect of the unvested portions of Stock Unit Awards and Performance Awards whose vesting is subject to the achievement of specified Performance Criteria will be subject to the same restrictions as the underlying shares or units to which such dividend equivalents relate.  No dividend equivalents may be paid or credited in connection with Options and Stock Appreciation Rights.
15.3
        
Restrictions on Transfer
.
 
(a)
          
Except pursuant to testamentary will or the laws of descent and distribution or as otherwise expressly permitted by subsections (b) and (c) below, no right or interest of any Participant in an Incentive Award prior to the exercise (in the case of Options) or vesting or issuance (in the case of Restricted Stock Awards and Performance Awards) of such Incentive Award will be assignable or transferable, or subjected to any lien, during the lifetime of the Participant, either voluntarily or involuntarily, directly or indirectly, by operation of law or otherwise.
 
(b)
          
A Participant will be entitled to designate a beneficiary to receive an Incentive Award upon such Participant's death, and in the event of such Participant's death, payment of any amounts due under the Plan will be made to, and exercise of any Options (to the extent permitted pursuant to Section 12 of the Plan) may be made by, such beneficiary.  If a deceased Participant has failed to designate a beneficiary, or if a beneficiary designated by the Participant fails to survive the Participant, payment of any amounts due under the Plan will be made to, and exercise of any Options (to the extent permitted pursuant to Section 12 of the Plan) may be made by, the Participant's legal representatives, heirs and legatees.  If a deceased Participant has designated a beneficiary and such beneficiary survives the Participant but dies before complete payment of all amounts due under the Plan or exercise of all exercisable Options, then such payments will be made to, and the exercise of such Options may be made by, the legal representatives, heirs and legatees of the beneficiary.
 
(c)
          
Upon a Participant's request, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, permit a transfer of all or a portion of a Non-Statutory Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right, other than for value, to such Participant's child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, stepparent, grandparent, spouse, former spouse, sibling, niece, nephew, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law, any person sharing such Participant's household (other than a tenant or employee), a trust in which any of the foregoing have more than fifty percent of the beneficial interests, a foundation in which any of the foregoing (or the Participant) control the management of assets, and any other entity in which these persons (or the Participant) own more than fifty percent of the voting interests.  Any permitted transferee will remain subject to all the terms and conditions applicable to the Participant prior to the transfer.  A permitted transfer may be conditioned upon such requirements as the Committee may, in its sole discretion, determine, including, but not limited to execution and/or delivery of appropriate acknowledgements, opinion of counsel, or other documents by the transferee.
 
15.4
        
Non-Exclusivity of the Plan
.  Nothing contained in the Plan is intended to modify or rescind any previously approved compensation plans or programs of the Company or create any limitations on the power or authority of the Board to adopt such additional or other compensation arrangements as the Board may deem necessary or desirable.
16.
          
Securities Law and Other Restrictions.
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or any agreements entered into pursuant to the Plan, the Company will not be required to issue any shares of Common Stock under this Plan, and a Participant may not sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to Incentive Awards granted under the Plan, unless (a) there is in effect with respect to such shares a registration statement under the Securities Act and any applicable securities laws of a state or foreign jurisdiction or an exemption from such registration under the Securities Act and applicable state or foreign securities laws, and (b) there has been obtained any other consent, approval or permit from any other U.S. or foreign regulatory body which the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems necessary or advisable.  The Company may condition such issuance, sale or transfer upon the receipt of any representations or agreements from the parties involved, and the placement of any legends on certificates representing shares of Common Stock, as may be deemed necessary or advisable by the Company in order to comply with such securities law or other restrictions.
 
17.
          
Performance-Based Compensation Provisions.
 
The Committee, when it is comprised solely of two or more outside directors meeting the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code, in its sole discretion, may designate whether any Restricted Stock Awards, Stock Unit Awards or Performance Awards to be made to Covered Employees are intended to be Performance-Based Compensation.  The vesting of such Incentive Awards and the distribution of cash, shares of Common Stock or other property pursuant thereto, as applicable, will, to the extent required by Section 162(m) of the Code, be conditioned upon the achievement of performance goals based on one or more Performance Criteria specified in Section 2.20.  Such Performance Criteria will be selected and performance goals established by the Committee within the time period prescribed by, and will otherwise comply with the requirements of, Section 162(m) of the Code.  Following completion of an applicable performance period, the Committee shall certify in writing, in the manner and to the extent required by Section 162(m) of the Code, that the applicable performance goals based on the selected Performance Criteria have been met prior to payment of the compensation, and may adjust downward, but not upward, any amount determined to be otherwise payable in connection with such an Incentive Award.
 
18.
          
Compliance with Section 409A
.
 
It is intended that the Plan and all Incentive Awards hereunder be administered in a manner that will comply with Section 409A of the Code, including the final regulations and other guidance issued by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service with respect thereto.  The Committee is authorized to adopt rules or regulations deemed necessary or appropriate to qualify for an exception from or to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code (including any transition or grandfather rules relating thereto).  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 18 to the contrary, with respect to any Incentive Award subject to Section 409A of the Code, no amendment to or payment under such Incentive Award will be made unless permitted under Section 409A of the Code and the regulations or rulings issued thereunder.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if any amount shall be payable with
respect to any Incentive Award hereunder as a result of a Participant's "separation from service" at such time as the Participant is a "specified employee" (as those terms are defined for purposes of Section 409A of the Code) and such amount is subject to the provisions of Section 409A of the Code, then no payment shall be made, except as permitted under Section 409A of the Code, prior to the first day of the seventh calendar month beginning after the Participant's separation from service (or the date of his or her earlier death).  The Company may adopt a specified employee policy that will apply to identify the specified employees for all deferred compensation plans subject to Section 409A of the Code; otherwise, specified employees will be identified using the default standards contained in the regulations under Section 409A of the Code.
 
19.
          
Plan Amendment, Modification and Termination.
 
The Board may suspend or terminate the Plan or any portion thereof at any time.  In addition to the authority of the Committee to amend the Plan under Section 3.2(e), the Board may amend the Plan from time to time in such respects as the Board may deem advisable in order that Incentive Awards under the Plan will conform to any change in applicable laws or regulations or in any other respect the Board may deem to be in the best interests of the Company; provided, however, that no such amendments to the Plan will be effective without approval of the Company's stockholders if: (i) stockholder approval of the amendment is then required pursuant to Section 422 of the Code or Section 162(m) of the Code or the rules of the New York Stock Exchange; or (ii) such amendment seeks to modify Section 3.2(d) hereof.  No termination, suspension or amendment of the Plan may adversely affect any outstanding Incentive Award without the consent of the affected Participant; provided, however, that (i) this sentence will not impair the right of the Committee to take whatever action it deems appropriate under Sections 3.2(c), 4.3 and 14 of the Plan, and (ii) no consent of any affected Participant shall be required if such amendment is necessary to comply with applicable law or stock exchange rules.
 
20.
          
Effective Date and Duration of the Plan.
 
The Plan will be effective as of May 6, 2010, or such later date on which the Plan is initially approved by the Company's stockholders.  The Plan will terminate at midnight on the tenth (10th) anniversary of such effective date, and may be terminated prior to such time by Board action.  No Incentive Award will be granted after termination of the Plan.  Incentive Awards outstanding upon termination of the Plan may continue to be exercised, earned or become free of restrictions, according to their terms.

A.
                                  
The Company has adopted the Ecolab Inc. 2010 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), authorizing the Board of Directors of the Company, or a committee as provided for in the Plan (the Board or such a committee to be referred to as the "Committee"), to grant non-statutory stock options to employees, consultants, advisors and independent contractors of the Company and its Subsidiaries.
 
B.

Period of Exercisability
.  Subject to Section 3.2 below, the Option will become exercisable, on a cumulative basis, as to one-third of the Option Shares (excluding any fractional portion less than one share), on each of the first
and second anniversaries of the Date of Grant and as to the remaining Option Shares on the third anniversary of the Date of Grant, provided the Optionee remains in the
continuous employ of or service with the Company or any Subsidiary
.  This Option will expire and will no longer be exercisable as to any unexercised Option Shares at 5:00 p.m. (St. Paul, Minnesota time) on the earliest of:

Notice
.  This Option may be exercised by the Optionee in whole or in part from time to time, subject to the conditions contained in the Plan and in this Agreement, by giving written or electronic notice of exercise (in person, by mail, by facsimile or by electronic transmission) to the Company at its principal executive office in St. Paul, Minnesota (Attention:  Sr. Vice President-Human Resources), or through the procedures established with any Company-appointed third-party administrator.  Such notice will be in a form satisfactory to the Committee, will identify the Option, will specify the number of Option Shares with respect to which the Option is being exercised, and will be signed (Including, if applicable, by electronic signature as provided in Section 11.7 of this Agreement) by the person or persons so exercising the Option.

The Company hereby grants to the Grantee a performance-based restricted Stock Unit Award (the "Award") consisting of                          units (the "Award Units"), each of which is a bookkeeping entry representing the right to receive one share of the Company's common stock, par value $1.00 per share (the "Common Stock").  The Award and Award Units are subject to the terms, conditions, restrictions and risk of forfeiture set forth in this Agreement and in the Plan.
 
ARTICLE 2.
                             
VESTING OF AWARD UNITS
.
 
2.1
                
Subject to Article 5 below, some or all of the Award Units will vest and become non-forfeitable ("Vested") on December 31, 20     (the "Vesting Date"), provided that (a) the Committee has certified that the Company has achieved a level of average annual Return on Invested Capital (as defined below) of at least          percent for the three (3) year period from January 1, 20     to December 31, 20     (the "Performance Period"), and (b) the Grantee remains in the continuous employ of or service with the Company or any Subsidiary until the Vesting Date.  The number of Award Units that will Vest on the Vesting Date will be determined in accordance with Section 2.2 below.
 
2.2
                
The following chart sets forth the percentage of the Award Units (or of a portion of the Award Units as provided in Section 5.1 of this Agreement) that will vest on the Vesting Date based upon the Company's level of achievement of average annual Return on Invested Capital for the Performance Period:
 
 
The actual percentage of Award Units that will Vest based upon the Company's achievement of average annual Return on Invested Capital between the Threshold Level and Maximum Level will be interpolated on a straight line basis, with the corresponding number of Vested Award Units resulting from such determination rounded up to the next whole Award Unit.  If the average annual Return on Invested Capital for the Performance Period is below the Threshold Level, no Award Units will Vest.  Any Award Units that do not Vest on the Vesting Date will be forfeited.
2.3
                
The Committee shall certify the level of average annual Return on Invested Capital for the Performance Period and the percentage of Award Units that Vest as provided in Section 2.2 above no later than March 1, 20    .
 
2.4
                
For the purposes of this Agreement, average annual Return on Invested Capital is calculated by dividing (i) the average of the Company's Net Operating Profit After Taxes (as defined below) for each of the three fiscal years during the Performance Period, by (ii) the average of the Company's Invested Capital (as defined below) as of the last day of the fiscal quarter immediately preceding the Performance Period and of each fiscal quarter during the Performance Period.  "Net Operating Profit After Taxes" is defined as the Company's operating income multiplied by 1 minus the Company's effective tax rate, each as reported in the Company's consolidated financial statements for each fiscal year during the Performance Period, adjusted to eliminate the after-tax effects
of
any acquisition during the Performance Period that was approved by the Board as well as
(a) 
the cumulative effects of accounting or tax changes, (b) gains and losses from discontinued operations, (c) extraordinary gains or losses, and (d) charges for restructurings, each as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and as identified in the Company's financial statements (including accompanying notes), management's discussion and analysis or other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission by the Company
.  "
Invested Capital" is defined as the Company's (a) total assets less cash and cash equivalents, minus (b) total liabilities less short-term and long-term debt, each as reported by the Company as of the end of the fiscal quarters described above and adjusted to eliminate the impact of the same factors identified in the previous sentence.
 
2.5
                
The Committee may adjust the calculation of Return on Invested Capital applicable to the Award Units under the circumstances, for the purpose and to the extent contemplated by Section 3.2(c) of the Plan.  Further, the actual number of Award Units that become Vested based upon achieving the specified level of average annual Return on Invested Capital during the Performance Period may be adjusted (but only downward if the Grantee is a Covered Employee and this Award is intended to be Performance-Based Compensation subject to Section 17 of the Plan) by the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion based on such factors as the Committee determines to be appropriate and/or advisable.
 
ARTICLE 3.
                             
SETTLEMENT OF VESTED AWARD UNITS
.
 
Except as may otherwise be provided in Section 5.2 below, Vested Award Units will be paid to the Grantee by no later than March 15, 20    .  Each Vested Award Unit will be paid to the Grantee in one share of Common Stock, provided that the Company will have no obligation to issue shares of Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement unless and until the Grantee has satisfied any applicable tax obligations pursuant to Article 9 below and such issuance otherwise complies with all applicable law.  Prior to the time the Vested Award Units are settled, the Grantee will have no rights other than those of a general creditor of the Company.  The Award Units represent an unfunded and unsecured obligation of the Company.

If the Grantee's employment by or other service with the Company and all Subsidiaries is terminated by the Company or any Subsidiary without Cause prior to the Vesting Date, then (i) for purposes of Section 2.1(b) of this Agreement, the Grantee will be deemed to have been in the continuous employ of or service with the Company or any Subsidiary until the Vesting Date with respect to one-third of the Award Units if such termination occurs during the second year of the Performance Period and with respect to two-thirds of the Award Units if the such termination occurs during the third year of the Performance Period, and (ii) for purposes of determining the number of Vested Award Units on the Vesting Date under Section 2.2 of this Agreement, the Vested Award Unit Percentage determined in accordance with Section 2.2 will be applied to the number of Award Units as to which the service-based vesting condition is deemed satisfied in accordance with clause (i) of this sentence, rather than to the total number of Award Units.
 
5.2

PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION
