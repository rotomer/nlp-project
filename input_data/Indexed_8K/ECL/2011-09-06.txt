Exhibit 99
 
 
News Release
 
Ecolab Inc.
370 Wabasha Street North
St. Paul, Minnesota 55102
 
ST. PAUL, Minn., September 6, 2011: Ecolab Inc. announced it plans to undertake a $1 billion share repurchase program upon the consummation of the previously announced Nalco Holding Company merger.  The repurchase program is expected to be completed by year-end 2012.
 
Ecolab recently announced its Board of Directors had increased the company's share repurchase authorization by 10 million shares to nearly 28 million shares, contingent upon consummation of the Nalco merger. Ecolab had approximately 232 million shares outstanding on July 31, 2011, and will issue approximately 69 million additional shares in the Nalco merger.
 
Ecolab expects to conduct its purchases under the planned program in the open market; in privately negotiated transactions from time to time, depending on the market conditions; and through purchases made in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. No further details regarding the planned repurchase program were announced.
 
Commenting on the announcement, Douglas M. Baker, Jr., Ecolab's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We have successfully completed much of the preparation work for the financing of our planned merger with Nalco. We continue to expect favorable credit markets, including both credit availability and rates. These
 
 
conditions will enable us to move forward with a buyback plan capitalizing on an attractive stock price while still retaining a strong financial position. We expect this share repurchase plan will provide enhanced shareholder returns while also maintaining our financial flexibility to make key investments in our combined business going forward."
