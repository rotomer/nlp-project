Item 2.03.  Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
.
 
On November 2, 2011, Ecolab Inc. ("Ecolab") commenced issuing commercial paper  to fund the cash component of the merger consideration for the Company's merger with Nalco Holding Company and refinance Nalco's existing credit facility (collectively, approximately $2.8 billion) upon completion of the merger. Ecolab previously announced that it expects to fund such activities through commercial paper borrowings backed by its new syndicated credit facilities totaling $3.5 billion, which were announced on September 8, 2011, or by borrowings under such facilities, and through the planned issuance prior to the completion of the merger of $250 million 3.69% seven year private placement notes and $250 million 4.32% twelve year private placement notes, which were announced on October 28, 2011.
 
Ecolab also expects to refinance a substantial portion of Nalco's other outstanding debt (currently estimated at approximately $1.7 billion) following completion of the merger. Ecolab currently expects to borrow the amounts required to refinance Nalco's other outstanding debt through commercial paper borrowings backed by its syndicated credit facilities, borrowings under such credit facilities, the issuance of publicly or privately held debt securities or a combination of the foregoing.
 
Ecolab and Nalco currently expect the closing of the merger to occur in the fourth quarter of 2011. However, the merger is subject to various regulatory clearances and the satisfaction or waiver of other conditions as described in the merger agreement, and it is possible that factors outside the control of Ecolab and Nalco could result in the merger being completed at a later time or not at all.

  These statements are based on the current expectations of management of Ecolab and Nalco, as applicable. There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements included in this communication. These risks and uncertainties include (i) the risk that the stockholders of Nalco may not adopt the merger agreement, (ii) the risk that the stockholders of Ecolab may not approve the issuance of Ecolab common stock to Nalco stockholders in the merger, (iii) the risk that the companies may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals required for the merger, or that required regulatory approvals may delay the merger or result in the imposition of conditions that could have a material adverse effect on the combined company or cause the companies to abandon the merger, (iv) the risk that the conditions to the closing of the merger may not be satisfied, (v) the risk that a material adverse change, event or occurrence may affect Ecolab or Nalco prior to the closing of the merger and may delay the merger or cause the companies to abandon the merger, (vi) the risk that an unsolicited offer by another company to acquire shares or assets of Ecolab or Nalco could interfere with or prevent the merger, (vii) problems that may arise in successfully integrating the businesses of the companies, which may result in the combined company not operating as effectively and efficiently as expected, (viii) the possibility that the merger may involve unexpected costs, unexpected liabilities or unexpected delays, (ix) the risk that the credit ratings of the combined company or its subsidiaries may be different from what the companies currently expect, (x) the risk that the businesses of the companies may suffer as a result of uncertainty surrounding the merger and (xi) the risk that disruptions from the transaction will harm relationships with customers, employees and suppliers.
 
Other unknown or unpredictable factors could also have material adverse effects on future results, performance or achievements of Ecolab, Nalco and the combined company. For a further discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties applicable to the respective businesses of Ecolab and Nalco, see the Annual Reports on Form 10-K of Ecolab and Nalco for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 and the companies' other public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").

On or about October 31, 2011, Nalco and Ecolab began mailing the definitive joint proxy statement/prospectus to stockholders of record as of the close of business on October 11, 2011. In light of these risks, uncertainties, assumptions and factors, the forward-looking events discussed in this communication may not occur. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this communication. Neither Ecolab nor Nalco undertakes, and each of them expressly disclaims, any duty to update any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or changes in their respective expectations, except as required by law.
