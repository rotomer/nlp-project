Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On December 5, 2011, Ecolab Inc. (the "Company") entered into an underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as representatives of the several underwriters listed therein (the "Underwriters"), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell to the Underwriters $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 2.375% Notes due 2014 (the "2014 Notes"), $1,250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 3.000% Notes due 2016 (the "2016 Notes"), $1,250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 4.350% Notes due 2021 (the "2021 Notes") and $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 5.500% Notes due 2041 (the "2041 Notes" and together with the 2014 Notes, the 2016 Notes and the 2021 Notes, the "Notes"). The Notes will be issued pursuant to an Amended and Restated Indenture (the "Base Indenture"), dated January 9, 2001, by and between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (formerly known as The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as successor in interest to J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association and Bank One, National Association), as trustee (the "Original Trustee"), as amended by the second supplemental indenture, dated December 8, 2011 (the "Second Supplemental Indenture," and together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"), among the Company, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, and the Original Trustee, as original trustee.
 
The 2014 Notes bear interest at a rate of 2.375% per annum, payable semiannually on June 8 and December 8, beginning on June 8, 2012. The 2014 Notes will mature on December 8, 2014 and are redeemable at the Company's option in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a make-whole redemption price specified in the Indenture.
 
The 2016 Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.000% per annum, payable semiannually on June 8 and December 8, beginning on June 8, 2012. The 2016 Notes will mature on December 8, 2016 and are redeemable at the Company's option in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a make-whole redemption price specified in the Indenture.
 
The 2021 Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.350% per annum, payable semiannually on June 8 and December 8, beginning on June 8, 2012. The 2021 Notes will mature on December 8, 2021 and are redeemable at the Company's option in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a make-whole redemption price specified in the Indenture.
 
The 2041 Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.500% per annum, payable semiannually on June 8 and December 8, beginning on June 8, 2012. The 2041 Notes will mature on December 8, 2041 and are redeemable at the Company's option in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a make-whole redemption price specified in the Indenture.
 
Under the Indenture, specified changes of control involving the Company, when accompanied by a downgrade of a series of the Notes below investment grade rating by both Moody's Investors Services, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services within a specified time period, constitute change of control repurchase events. Upon the occurrence of a change of control repurchase event with respect to a series of the Notes, unless the Company has exercised its option to redeem such Notes, it will be required to offer to repurchase them at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase.
 
The Indenture contains covenants that limit, among other things, the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to incur liens on certain properties to secure debt, to engage in sale and leaseback transactions
and to transfer certain property, stock or debt of any restricted subsidiary to any unrestricted subsidiary (each as defined in the Indenture). The Indenture also provides for customary events of default, which include (subject in certain cases to a customary grace and cure periods), among others, nonpayment of principal or interest on the Notes; failure to comply with certain other covenants or agreements under the Indenture; certain defaults on other indebtedness; and specified events of bankruptcy or insolvency. In the case of an event of default, the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of a series of the Notes then outstanding may declare all such Notes to be due and payable immediately.
 
The Notes will be senior unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Company and will rank equally with all other senior and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company from time to time outstanding.
 
The public offering price of the Notes was 99.940% of the principal amount of the 2014 Notes, 99.802% of the principal amount of the 2016 Notes, 99.936% of the principal amount of the 2021 Notes and 98.971% of the principal amount of the 2041 Notes. The Company received net proceeds (after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and the Company's offering expenses) of approximately $3.7 billion and expects to use such net proceeds (i) to repay approximately $1.5 billion of its commercial paper borrowings, which were issued to finance a portion of the Company's acquisition of Nalco Holding Company and to repay outstanding borrowings under Nalco's credit facility, (ii) to repay approximately $1.7 billion of Nalco's senior notes, which were issued to refinance other indebtedness and (iii) for general corporate purposes, which may include the repurchase of shares of its common stock pursuant to it previously announced share repurchase program.
 
The Notes were offered and sold pursuant to the Company's automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-178273) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which was filed and became effective on December 2, 2011. The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a prospectus supplement, dated December 6, 2011, together with the accompanying prospectus, dated December 2, 2011, relating to the offering and sale of the Notes.
 
The above description of the Underwriting Agreement, the Base Indenture, the Second Supplemental Indenture and the Notes is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Underwriting Agreement, the Base Indenture, the Second Supplemental Indenture and the form of Notes, each of which is incorporated herein by reference and are attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibits 1.1, 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3, respectively.
 
Some of the Underwriters and their affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, investment banking and other commercial dealings in the ordinary course of business with the Company or affiliates of the Company. They have received, or may in the future receive, customary fees and commissions for these transactions. In particular, an affiliate of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC or one of its affiliates acts as co-syndication agent and joint lead arranger and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated or one of its affiliates acts as administrative agent, co-syndication agent and joint lead arranger, in each case of the Company's $2.0 billion 364-day credit agreement and $1.5 billion multicurrency credit agreement.
 
In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Underwriters and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments, including serving as counterparties to certain derivative and hedging arrangements, and may actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Company or the Company's affiliates. The Underwriters and their affiliates may also make investment
recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.
 
Douglas M. Baker, Jr., Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and two other directors of the Company, Joel W. Johnson and Jerry W. Levin, also serve as directors of U.S. Bancorp, the parent of U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc., one of the Underwriters.

This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.

(b)
                                
Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity.  This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have.  The Company acknowledges that the (i) list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities under the heading "Underwriting," (ii) sentences related to concessions and reallowances under the heading "Underwriting" and (iii) paragraphs under the heading "Underwriting" related to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in any Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
 
(c)
                                 
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above.  The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party; , , that in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in

further
the same jurisdiction, the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to local counsel) for all such indemnified parties.  Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party.  The indemnifying party under this Section 8 shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by Section 8(c) hereof, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d)
                                
In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending the same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be
provided
however
responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder.  If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus.  Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission.  The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).

Default by an Underwriter
.  If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule I hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule I hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company.  In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the
provided
however
Representatives and the Company shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.

(2)           the Attributable Debt of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of such Sale and Leaseback Transactions (other than such Sale and Leaseback Transactions as are referred to in clause (1) or (3) of this paragraph), plus the aggregate principal amount of Debt secured by mortgages on Operating Properties then outstanding (excluding any such Debt secured by mortgages described in clauses (1) through (7) of the second paragraph of Section 5.01) which do not equally and ratably secure the Notes, would not exceed 15% of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets; or
 
(3)           the Company, within 180 days after the sale or transfer, applies or causes a Restricted Subsidiary to apply an amount equal to the greater of the net proceeds of such sale or transfer or fair market value of the Operating Property (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company) so sold and leased back at the time of entering into such Sale and Leaseback Transaction to

100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed on the Redemption Date; and
 
(ii)

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as special counsel to Ecolab Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the public offering of $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 2.375% Notes due 2014, $1,250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 3.000% Notes due 2016, $1,250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 4.350% Notes due 2021 and $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 5.500% Notes due 2041 (collectively, the "Notes"), which will be issued under the Amended and Restated Indenture, dated as of January 9, 2001 (the "Base Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (formerly known as The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as successor in interest to J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association and Bank One, National Association) (the "Original Trustee"), as supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of December 8, 2011 (the "Second Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"), among the Company, the Original Trustee and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee").
 
This opinion is being furnished in accordance with the requirements of Item 601(b)(5) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").
 
In rendering the opinion stated herein, we have examined and relied upon the following:
 
 
(i)
                                    
the registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-178273) of the Company relating to the Notes filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on December 2, 2011 under the Securities Act allowing for delayed offerings pursuant to Rule 415 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Act (the "Rules and Regulations"), including the information deemed to be a part of the registration statement pursuant to Rule 430B of the Rules and Regulations (such registration statement being hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement");
 
(ii)
                                 
an executed copy of the Indenture;
 
(iii)
                              
an executed copy of the Underwriting Agreement, dated December 5, 2011 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), between J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as representatives of the several underwriters named therein, and the Company;
 
(iv)
                             
the form of global certificate evidencing the Notes (the "Note Certificate") included in the Indenture;
 
(v)
                                
a copy of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as certified by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and by the Assistant Secretary of the Company;
 
(vi)
                             
a copy of the Company's By-Laws, as amended and in effect as of the date hereof and as certified by the Assistant Secretary of the Company; and
 
(vii)
                          
copies of certain resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company, adopted on August 4, 2011, and of the Finance Committee thereof, adopted on December 1, 2011, each as certified by the Assistant Secretary of the Company.
 
We have also examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such records of the Company and such agreements, certificates and receipts of public officials, certificates of officers or other representatives of the Company and others, and such other documents as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinion stated below.
 
In our examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures including endorsements, the legal capacity and competency of all natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as facsimile, electronic, certified or photostatic copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such copies.  As to any facts relevant to the opinion stated herein that we did not
 
independently establish or verify, we have relied upon statements and representations of officers and other representatives of the Company and others and of public officials.
 
We do not express any opinion with respect to the laws of any jurisdiction other than (i) the laws of the State of New York and (ii) the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and to the extent that judicial or regulatory orders or decrees or consents, approvals, licenses, authorizations, validations, filings, recordings or registrations with governmental authorities are relevant, to those required under such laws (all of the foregoing being referred to as "Opined on Law").  We do not express any opinion as to the effect of any law (other than Opined on Law) on the opinion stated herein.  Insofar as the opinion expressed herein relates to matters governed by laws other than Opined on Law, we have assumed, without having made any independent investigation, that such laws do not affect the opinion set forth herein.  The opinion expressed herein is based on laws in effect on the date hereof, which laws are subject to change with possible retroactive effect, and we disclaim any undertaking to advise you of any subsequent changes in the facts stated or assumed herein or of any subsequent changes in applicable laws.
,
 
The Indenture and the Note Certificate are referred to herein together as the "Transaction Documents."
 
Based upon the foregoing and subject to the limitations, qualifications, exceptions and assumptions stated herein, we are of the opinion that when the Note Certificate for each series of Notes is duly authenticated by the Trustee and issued and delivered by the Company against payment therefor in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture, the Notes will constitute the valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms under the laws of the State of New York.
 
The opinion stated herein is subject to the following qualifications:
 
(a)
                                 
the opinion stated herein is limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer, preference and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in equity or at law);
 
(b)
                                
except to the extent expressly stated in the opinion contained herein, we do not express any opinion with respect to the effect on the opinion stated herein of (i) the compliance or non-compliance of any party to any of the Transaction Documents with any laws, rules or regulations applicable to such party or (ii) the legal status or legal capacity of any such party to any of the Transaction Documents;
 
(c)
                                 
except to the extent expressly stated in the opinion contained herein, we have assumed that each of the Transaction Documents constitutes the valid and binding obligation of each party to such Transaction Document, enforceable against such party in accordance with its terms;
 
(d)
                                
in rendering the opinion set forth above, we have assumed that the Trustee's certificate of authentication of the Note Certificates will have been manually signed by one of the Trustee's authorized officers and that the Note Certificates conform to the specimens thereof examined by us; and
 
(e)
                                 
to the extent that the opinion set forth above relates to the enforceability of the choice of New York law and choice of New York forum provisions contained in any Transaction Agreement, the opinion stated herein is rendered solely in reliance upon New York General Obligations Law sections 5-1401 and 5-1402 and is subject to the qualification that such enforceability may be limited by the terms of such sections 5-1401 and 5-1402, as well as by principles of public policy, comity or constitutionality.
 
In addition, in rendering the foregoing opinion we have assumed that:
 
(a)
                             
the Company has complied with and will comply with all aspects of the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization in connection with the transactions contemplated by, and the performance of its obligations under, the Transaction Documents; and
 
(b)
                                
neither the execution and delivery by the Company of the Transaction Documents nor the performance by the Company of its obligations under the Transaction Documents (i) constitutes or will constitute a violation of, or a default under, any lease, indenture, instrument or other agreement to which the Company or its property is subject, (ii) contravenes or will contravene any order or decree of any governmental authority to which the Company or its property is subject, (iii) violates or will violate any law, rule or regulation to which the Company or its property is subject or (iv) requires the consent, approval, licensing or authorization of, or any filing, recording or registration with, any governmental authority under any law, rule or regulation of any jurisdiction.
 
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion with the Commission as an exhibit to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K being filed on the date hereof and incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement.  We also hereby consent to use of our name under the heading "Legal Matters" in the prospectus forming a part of the Registration Statement.  In giving this consent, we do not thereby admit that we are within the category of persons whose consent is
 
required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder.
