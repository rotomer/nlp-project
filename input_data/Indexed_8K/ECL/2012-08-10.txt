Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
.
 
On August 10, 2012, Ecolab Inc. ("Ecolab") entered into a $500 million unsecured 364-day revolving credit facility that matures in August 2013 (the "364-Day Facility"), among the lenders party thereto, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. and Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, as co-syndication agents.
 
The 364-Day Facility replaces Ecolab's $1.0 billion 364-day revolving credit facility, dated as of September 8, 2011, which was to expire on September 6, 2012 and was terminated on August 10, 2012 (the "Terminated Agreement").
 
The 364-Day Facility will be used for general corporate purposes and support of commercial paper issuances.  The 364-Day Facility includes an incremental expansion facility that permits Ecolab to increase the commitments under the 364-Day Facility by up to $250 million.
 
Borrowings under the 364-Day Facility bear interest, at Ecolab's option, at (i) the base rate (which is equal to the highest of (a) the Bank of America, N.A. prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (c) one-month LIBOR plus 1.0%) plus an applicable margin or (ii) LIBOR plus an applicable margin.
 
In connection with the 364-Day Facility, Ecolab must pay a facility fee at a rate per annum which may range from 0.06% to 0.225% of the average daily commitment of each lender.  The applicable rate for this fee will be determined based on Ecolab's credit rating, as described in the 364-Day Facility.  Provided certain conditions are met and at Ecolab's option, the outstanding principal amount of loans under the 364-Day Facility on the maturity date may be converted to a term loan which will be due in a single payment up to 12 months from the maturity date.  Ecolab will pay a fee equal to 1.0% of the outstanding principal amount of loans under the 364-Day Facility that are converted into a term loan.
 
The 364-Day Facility contains a financial covenant that requires Ecolab to maintain a minimum interest expense coverage ratio.  The 364-Day Facility also contains customary conditions to funding, events of default, affirmative covenants and negative covenants, including restrictions on liens and subsidiary indebtedness.
 
In the ordinary course of their respective businesses, one or more of the lenders under the 364-Day Facility, or their affiliates, have or may have various relationships with Ecolab and its subsidiaries involving the provision of financial services, including cash management, investment banking and trust services, for which they received, or will receive, customary fees and expenses.
 
The foregoing description is not intended to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 364-Day Facility, which is incorporated herein by reference and attached as Exhibit 10.1 hereto.

(c)        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Borrower may rescind any notice of prepayment under clause (a) above if such prepayment would have resulted from a refinancing of the facilities hereunder, which refinancing shall not be consummated or shall otherwise be delayed.
 
SECTION 2.15(a) If, due to a Change in Law (other than any change by way of imposition or increase of reserve requirements or, in the case of Eurodollar Advances, included in the

Eurodollar Rate Reserve Percentage) there shall be any increase on or after the date hereof in the cost to any Bank of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Eurodollar Advances or to any Bank, by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then the Borrower shall from time to time, within 15 days after demand by such Bank, accompanied by the certificate required therefor under Section 2.15(c) (with a copy of such demand and such certificate to the Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of such Bank additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Bank for such increased cost.

(c)        Each Bank will promptly notify the Borrower and the Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle such Bank to compensation pursuant to this Section and will designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the reasonable judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank.  In determining such amount, such Bank may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.  A certificate of any Bank claiming compensation under this Section and setting forth in reasonable detail the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder and the basis for the calculation thereof shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.
 
(d)        The Borrower shall not be obligated to pay any additional amounts with respect to a demand under Section 2.15(a) or 2.15(b) that are attributable to the period (the "") ending 120 days prior to the Borrower's receipt of the certificate with respect to such demand required under Section 2.15(c); , that to the extent such additional amounts accrue during the Excluded Period because of the retroactive effect of the applicable law, rule, regulation, guideline or request promulgated during the 120 day period prior

SECTION 2.16(a) In the event that any Bank, as applicable, shall have determined (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be final, conclusive and binding upon all parties) at any time that the making or continuance of its Eurodollar Advances has become unlawful because of the
.  Illegality. 
introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation or because of the assertion of unlawfulness by any central bank or other governmental authority, then, in any such event, such Bank shall give prompt notice (by telephone confirmed in writing) to the Borrower and to the Agent of such determination (which notice the Agent shall promptly transmit to the other Banks).
 
(b)        Upon the giving of the notice to the Borrower referred to in subsection (a) above, then (i) the obligation of the Banks to make, or to Convert Advances into or to continue Advances as, Eurodollar Advances, shall be suspended until the applicable Bank notifies the Agent and the Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Banks that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, and (ii) if any affected Eurodollar Advances are then outstanding, the Borrower shall, upon at least one Business Day's written notice to the Agent and the affected Bank, or if permitted by applicable law no later than the date permitted thereby, in the Borrower's sole discretion, either (i) prepay the principal amount of all outstanding Eurodollar Advances of such Bank to which such notice related, together with accrued interest thereon to the date of payment or (ii) Convert each such Eurodollar Advance into a Base Rate Advance, and in each case be obligated to reimburse the Banks in respect thereof pursuant to Section 9.04(b) hereof.  If more than one Bank gives notice pursuant to Section 2.16(a) at any time, then all outstanding Eurodollar Advances of such Banks must be treated the same by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.16(b).  Any Base Rate Advance arising by reason of this Section 2.16(b) shall have an Interest Period assigned to it that ends on the date that the Eurodollar Advance for which it shall have been substituted would have expired, and the principal thereof and interest thereon shall be payable on the date that principal and interest would otherwise have been payable on such Eurodollar Advance.  Such Base Rate Advance may not be prepaid at any time prior to the date that the Eurodollar Advances comprising a part of such Borrowing shall be prepaid.

(New York City time) on the day when due in Dollars to the Agent in same day funds, without set-off or counterclaim, by deposit of such funds to the Agent's account maintained at the Payment Office in New York City.  The Agent will give the Borrower prior notice of the due date of the principal of any Advance and of the due date and amount of any fees payable hereunder; that the failure to give any such prior notice shall not limit the Borrower's liability for such payment, but shall delay the due date of such payment for purposes of Sections 6.01(a) or (b), as applicable, by the number of days after such due date that such notice is given.  The Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal, interest or fees ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.11, 2.15 or 2.20 or as contemplated by Section 2.24) to the applicable Banks for the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other

Each determination by the Agent (or, in the case of Section 2.11, by a Bank) of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.
 
(c)        Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such cases be included in the computation of payment of interest or fees, as the case may be; , if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Eurodollar Advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day.
provided, however
 
(d)        Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due from the Borrower to the Banks hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to it on such date and it may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause (but shall not be required to cause) to be distributed to each Bank on such due date an amount equal to the amount
then due such Bank.  If and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Agent as applicable, each Bank shall repay to the Agent as applicable, forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Bank together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Bank until the date such Bank repays such amount to the Agent at the Overnight Rate, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged in connection with the foregoing.
 
SECTION 2.18If any Bank shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of the Advances made by it (other than pursuant to Section 2.11, 2.15 or 2.20 or as contemplated by Section 2.24) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the Advances held by all the Banks, such Bank shall forthwith purchase from the other Banks such participations in the Advances made by them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Bank to share the excess payment ratably with each of them, , that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such

The Borrower agrees that any Bank so purchasing a participation from another Bank pursuant to this Section 2.18 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Bank were a Bank hereunder in the amount of such participation.

(b)        In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes, charges and similar levies which arise from any payment made by the Borrower under any Loan Document or from the execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as "").

provided, however
from the date such Bank or the Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor by delivering a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the amount of the indemnification to be made hereunder and the basis for the calculation thereof, which certificate shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  The Borrower shall not be obligated to pay any indemnification with respect to a demand under this Section 2.20(c) relating to amounts incurred more than 120 days prior to the Borrower's receipt of the certificate with respect to such demand required under this Section 2.20(c);, that if the circumstances giving rise to such demand are retroactive, then the 120-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect.

(e)        Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrower contained in this Section 2.20 shall survive the payment in full of principal and interest hereunder and under the Notes.
 
(f)        (i) On or prior to the Closing Date (or, in the case of any assignee party to an Assignment and Acceptance, on the effective date of its becoming a "Bank" hereunder), each Bank organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States of America shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, provide the Agent and the Borrower with the forms prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service of the United States of America certifying such Bank's exemption from withholding taxes imposed by the United States of America with respect to all payments to be made to such Bank (as the case may be) under any Loan Document, and each such Bank shall thereafter provide the Agent and the Borrower with such supplements and amendments thereto and such additional forms, certificates, statements or documents as may from time to time be required by applicable law.  If a Bank that is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States of America shall fail to deliver, or improperly delivers, the forms, certificates, statements or documents required to be delivered by this Section 2.20(f)(i), then Section 2.20(a) shall not apply with respect to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes imposed on any payments made to or for the account of such Bank under any Loan Document to the extent that such taxes would not have been imposed but for such Bank's failure to deliver or deliver properly the forms, certificates, statements or documents required to be delivered by this Section 2.20(f)(i), during the period that such failure or deficiency shall continue, and the Borrower or the Agent shall be permitted to withhold United States

If a Bank that is organized under the laws of the United States of America (or any state or political subdivision thereof) shall fail to deliver, or improperly delivers, the forms, certificates, statements or documents required to be delivered by this Section 2.20(f)(ii), then (a) shall not apply with respect to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes imposed on any payments made to or for the account of such Bank under any Loan Document to the extent that such taxes would not have been imposed but for such Bank's failure to deliver or deliver properly the forms, certificates, statements or documents required to be delivered by this Section 2.20(f)(ii), during the period that such failure or deficiency shall continue, and the Borrower or the Agent shall be permitted to withhold United States federal, state and local income taxes from any payments made, under any Loan Document at the applicable statutory rate.
 
(g)        If any Bank determines, in its sole discretion, that it has actually and finally realized, by reason of a refund, deduction or credit of any Taxes or Other Taxes paid or reimbursed by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.20 in respect of payments under any Loan Document, a current monetary benefit that it would otherwise not have obtained but for such refund, deduction or credit, and that would result in the total payments under this Section 2.20 exceeding the amount needed to make such Bank whole, such Bank shall pay to the Borrower, with reasonable promptness following the date on which it actually realizes such benefit, an amount equal to the lesser of the amount of such benefit or the amount of such excess, in each case net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in securing such refund, deduction or credit; that (i) such Bank shall not be obligated to disclose to the Borrower any information regarding its tax affairs or computations and (ii) nothing contained in this Section 2.20(g) shall be construed so as to interfere with the right of any Bank to arrange its tax affairs as it deems appropriate.
provided, however,
 
(h)        Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, for any period with respect to which any Bank (including any assignee party to an
Assignment and Acceptance that becomes a "Bank" hereunder) has failed to deliver, or has improperly delivered, to the Borrower or the Agent (as the case may be) the appropriate form, certificate, statement or document required to be delivered in Section 2.20(f) or Section 2.20(k), such Bank shall not be entitled to indemnification under Section 2.20(c) for any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by reason of such failure or improper delivery.
 
(i)         Any Bank claiming any indemnification or additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.20 will designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such indemnification or additional amounts and will not, in the reasonable judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank.
 
(j)         Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, if any Bank changes its residence, principal place of business or Applicable Lending Office or takes any similar action (other than at the Borrower's request or pursuant to Section 2.20(i)), and the effect of such change or action, as of the date thereof, would be to increase the additional amounts or indemnification that the Borrower is required to pay under Section 2.20(a) and Section 2.20(c) then the Borrower shall not be obligated to pay the amount of such increase.
 
(k)        If any payment made pursuant to the Loan Documents would be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if the recipient were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, as applicable), such recipient shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent, such documentation prescribed by applicable law
(including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such recipient has complied with such recipient's obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this Section 2.20(k), "FATCA" shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.  If a recipient of any payment made pursuant to any Loan Document shall fail to deliver, or improperly delivers, the forms, certificates, statements or documents required to be delivered by this Section 2.20(k), then Section 2.20(a) shall not apply with respect to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes imposed on any payments made to or for the account of such recipient under any Loan Document to the extent that such taxes would not have been imposed but for such recipient's failure to deliver or deliver properly the forms, certificates, statements or documents required to be delivered by this Section 2.20(k), during the period that such failure or deficiency shall continue, and the Borrower or the Agent shall
be permitted to withhold United States federal, state and local income taxes from any payments made under any Loan Document at the applicable statutory rate.
 
(l)         Each Bank shall severally indemnify the Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any taxes attributable to such Bank (but only to the extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified the Agent for such taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (ii) any taxes attributable to such Bank's failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.08(e) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any other taxes attributable to such Bank, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Bank by the Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Bank hereby authorizes the Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Bank under this Agreement or otherwise payable by the Agent to the Bank from any other source against any amount due to the Agent under this paragraph (l).
 
SECTION 2.21In the event that (w) any Bank shall not have consented to any amendment to this Agreement requiring the consent of all Banks whereas the Majority Banks have consented; (x) any one or more Banks, pursuant to Section 2.15 hereof, incurs any increased costs, receives a reduced payment or is required to make any payment for which any such Bank demands compensation pursuant to such Section, or makes a claim for indemnity or compensation under Section 2.20 hereof with respect to a payment when no other Bank makes a claim for indemnity or compensation under Section 2.20 with respect to such payment, in any such case which compensation or indemnity increases the effective lending rate of such Bank with respect to its share of the Advances in excess of the effective lending rate of the other Banks, and such
.  Substitution of Banks. 
Bank has not mitigated such increased costs, reduced payment or additional payment within 30 days after receipt by such Bank from the Borrower of a written notice that such Bank's effective lending rate has so exceeded the effective lending rate of the other Banks; (y) any one or more Banks have determined pursuant to Section 2.16(a) that it may not make or maintain all or certain of its Eurodollar Advances at such time (and the other Banks shall continue to be able to make or maintain their corresponding Eurodollar Advances at such time) and the inability of such Bank, as applicable, to make or maintain such Eurodollar Advances continues for 30 or more days after the receipt by the Borrower from such Bank of written notice of such inability and the Borrower's request that such Bank alleviate such inability; or (z) any Bank is a Defaulting Bank; then and in any such event, the Borrower may substitute for such Bank an existing Bank, or another financial institution which is reasonably acceptable to the Agent, to assume the Commitment of such Bank and to purchase the Note of such Bank
hereunder, without recourse to or warranty (other than as to unencumbered ownership) by, or expense to, such Bank for a purchase price equal to the outstanding principal amount of the Advances then payable to such Bank plus any accrued but unpaid interest and accrued but unpaid fees with respect thereto; that in the case of clause (w) above, such substitute Bank shall have provided the applicable consent.  Such purchase shall be effected by execution and delivery by such Bank and its replacement of an Assignment and Acceptance, and shall otherwise be made in the manner described in Section 9.08.  Upon such purchase, to the extent of the rights and benefits assigned, such Bank shall no longer be a party hereto or have any rights or benefits hereunder (except for rights or benefits that such Bank would retain hereunder upon termination of this Agreement) and the replacement Bank shall succeed to the rights and benefits, and shall assume the obligations, of such Bank hereunder and under its Note.

To each of the Lenders party
to the Credit Agreement
referred to below
 
Re: 
Ecolab Inc.
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to Section 3.01(a)(v) of the 364-Day Credit Agreement, dated as of the date hereof (the "Credit Agreement"), among Ecolab Inc. (the "Company"), the financial institutions party thereto as lenders from time to time (the "Lenders"), Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. and Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, as co-syndication agents (the "Syndication Agents") and Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent for the Lenders (in such capacity, the "Agent").  Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein as so defined.
 
As Chief Compliance Officer, Associate General Counsel and Assistant Secretary of the Company, I am familiar with the corporate history and organization of the Company and its Subsidiaries and the proceedings relating to the authorization, preparation, execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement.
 
In that connection, I or attorneys under my supervision have examined:
 
(1)
                              
The Credit Agreement.
 
(2)
                              
The documents furnished by the Company pursuant to Article 3 of the Credit Agreement.
 
(3)
                              
The Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company and all amendments thereto through the date hereof (the "Charter").
 
(4)
                              
The By-Laws of the Company and all amendments thereto through the date hereof (the "By-Laws").
 
(5)
                              
A certificate of the Secretary of State of Delaware, dated [     ], 2012, attesting to the continued corporate existence and good standing of the Company in that State.
 
In addition, I or attorneys under my supervision have examined the originals, or copies certified to my satisfaction, of such other corporate records of the Company, certificates of public officials and of officers of the Company, and agreements, instruments and other documents as I have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions with respect to the Company expressed below.
 
As to questions of fact material to such opinions, I have, when relevant facts were not independently established by me, relied upon certificates of the Company or its officers or of public officials.  I have assumed the due execution and delivery, pursuant to due authorization, of the Credit Agreement by the Lenders, the Syndication Agents and the Agent.
 
Based upon the foregoing and upon such investigation as I have deemed necessary, I am of the following opinion:
 
(1)
                              
The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
 
(2)
                              
The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Credit Agreement and the Company's Notes are within the Company's corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and, to my knowledge, will not (i) conflict with the Charter or the By-Laws, (ii) violate any Applicable Law of the State of Minnesota, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or any Applicable Law of the United States of America, (iii) cause a default under any material contractual restriction binding on or, to my knowledge, affecting the Company or to which any of its property may
 
be subject or (iv) to my knowledge, except where such contravention would not result in a Material Adverse Effect, contravene any judicial or administrative order or decree of any governmental authority to which the Company is subject.  The Credit Agreement and the Company's Notes have been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Company under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
 
(3)
                              
No authorization, consent or other approval of, notice to or filing with any court, governmental authority or regulatory body pursuant to the Applicable Laws of the State of Minnesota, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or the Applicable Laws of the United States of America, which has not been obtained or taken and is not in full force and effect, is required to authorize or is required in connection with the execution, delivery or performance by the Company of the Credit Agreement, the Company's Notes, or the transactions contemplated thereby.
 
(4)
                              
To my knowledge, there are no pending actions, suits or proceedings against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries before any court or arbitrator or any governmental body, agency or official in which there is (in my best judgment) a reasonable possibility of an adverse decision which would affect (i) the business, consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries to the extent that there is (in my best judgment) a reasonable possibility that such decision would prevent the Company from repaying its obligations under the Credit Agreement and the Company's Notes in accordance with the terms thereof, or (ii) the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of the Credit Agreement or any of the Company's Notes.
 
The opinion set forth above is subject to the following qualifications:
 
(a)
                                 
In rendering this opinion, my examination of matters of law has been limited to the Applicable Laws of the State of Minnesota, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the Applicable Laws of the United States of America.  "Applicable Laws" shall mean those laws, rules and regulations which are normally applicable to
 
transactions of the type contemplated by the Credit Agreement, as such laws are in effect on the date hereof.
 
(b)
                                
For purposes of my opinion in paragraph (2) above, "material contractual restriction" shall mean the restrictions in the contracts filed by the Company as exhibits to the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 and in reports and registration statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission since such date, and, if not included among such exhibits, restrictions in contracts of the Company for borrowed money in an amount in excess of $10,000,000.
 
(c)
                                 
Whenever a statement or opinion herein is qualified by "to my knowledge" or a similar phrase, it is intended to indicate that I and members of the Company's legal department under my supervision who have rendered substantive legal services in connection with the Credit Agreement do not have actual knowledge of the accuracy or inaccuracy of such statement or opinion.
 
I am aware that Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP will rely upon the opinions set forth herein in rendering its opinion furnished pursuant to Section 3.01(a)(v) of the Credit Agreement.
 
Except as set forth in the foregoing paragraph, the opinion contained herein is for the sole benefit of the Agent, the Syndication Agents, and the Lenders and their respective successors and assigns, and may not be relied upon by any other person.
 
 
This SUBSIDIARY GUARANTY AGREEMENT, dated as of                             , 201    , is made by each of the entities that are signatories hereto (the ""), in favor of BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., as administrative agent (in such capacity, the "") for the banks (collectively, the "") parties to the 364-Day Credit Agreement, dated as of August 10, 2012 (as the same may be amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the ""), among Ecolab Inc.
