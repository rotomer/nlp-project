Item 1.01
                  
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On November 30, 2012, Ecolab Inc. ("Ecolab") entered into an amendment (the "Amendment") to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") for the previously announced merger (the "Merger") between Permian Mud Service, Inc. ("Permian" and, together with its Champion Technologies, Inc. and Corsicana Technologies, Inc. subsidiaries and their respective subsidiaries, the "acquired companies") and OFC Technologies Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ecolab, which subject to standard closing conditions, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals, is expected to close prior to year end.
 
The Amendment provides for the pre-Merger spin-off by the acquired companies of their downstream process and water solutions business (the "Downstream Business") to a new company to be owned by the current Permian stockholders or a subset thereof (the "Downstream Business Company") in lieu of transferring the Downstream Business to Ecolab as a part of the Merger. The transaction value will be reduced accordingly from $2.2 billion to $2.16 billion (subject to the adjustments as provided in the Merger Agreement).  The Amendment further provides for the acquired companies to furnish certain transitional and other services, licensing and supply arrangements in support of the Downstream Business and for the Downstream Business Company to furnish certain licensing arrangements in support of the acquired companies to operate their businesses (other than the Downstream Business) following closing of the Merger. Additionally, the Amendment modifies certain non-competition arrangements to permit current owners and/or employees of the acquired companies to be owners and/or employees of the Downstream Business Company following completion of the Merger.  Lastly, the Amendment modifies the Merger Agreement to reflect the agreement of Ecolab and the acquired companies not to use certain proprietary information of the Downstream Business from and after the Closing, except as expressly agreed.
 
The foregoing description of the Amendment does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amendment, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
The acquired companies' Downstream Business sales were approximately $50M in 2011.

On December 3, 2012, Ecolab issued the news release attached to this Current Report as Exhibit 99.1.
 
Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Information
 
This communication and the news release attached to this Current Report as Exhibit 99.1 contain certain statements relating to future events and our intentions, beliefs, expectations and predictions for the future which are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words or phrases such as "will likely result," "are expected to," "will continue," "is anticipated," "we believe," "we expect," "estimate," "project," "may," "will," "intend," "plan," "believe," "target," "forecast" (including the negative or variations thereof) or similar terminology used in connection with any discussion of future plans, actions or events generally identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding expected earnings per share
 
accretion from the Champion acquisition, deal economics and the expected timing of completion of the Champion acquisition. These statements are based on the current expectations of management of the company. There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements included in this communication. These risks and uncertainties include (i) the risk that the regulatory approvals or clearances required for the acquisition may not be obtained, or that required regulatory approvals may delay the acquisition or result in the imposition of conditions that could have a material adverse effect on the company or cause the company to abandon the acquisition, (ii) the risk that the conditions to the closing of the acquisition may not be satisfied, (iii) the risk that a material adverse change, event or occurrence may affect the company or Champion prior to the closing of the acquisition and may delay the acquisition or cause the company to abandon the acquisition, (iv) problems that may arise in successfully integrating the businesses of the company and Champion, which may result in the combined business not operating as effectively and efficiently as expected, (v) the possibility that the acquisition may involve unexpected costs, unexpected liabilities or unexpected delays, (vi) the risk that the businesses of the company or Champion may suffer as a result of uncertainty surrounding the acquisition and (vii) the risk that disruptions from the transaction will harm relationships with customers, employees and suppliers. In particular, the ultimate results of any Champion integration and business improvement actions, including cost synergies, depend on a number of factors, including the development of final plans, the impact of local regulatory requirements regarding employee terminations, the time necessary to develop and implement the integration and other business improvement initiatives and the level of success achieved through such actions in improving competitiveness, efficiency and effectiveness.
 
Additional risks and uncertainties that may affect operating results and business performance are set forth under Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-Q, our current report on Form 8-K filed October 12, 2012 and the company's other public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and include our ability to integrate Nalco and realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition as well as to close and integrate the proposed acquisition of Champion; our ability to attract and retain high caliber management talent to lead our business; difficulty in procuring raw materials or fluctuations in raw material costs; our ability to execute key business initiatives; vitality of the markets we serve; the impact of worldwide economic factors such as the worldwide economy, credit markets, interest rates and foreign currency risk; exposure to economic, political and legal risks related to our international operations; the costs and effects of complying with laws and regulations relating to the environment and to the manufacture, storage, distribution, sale and use of our products; changes in laws, regulations or accounting standards; our ability to develop competitive advantages through innovation; our substantial indebtedness; information technology systems failures; the ability to acquire complementary businesses and to effectively integrate such businesses; restraints on pricing flexibility due to contractual obligations; pressure on operations from consolidation of customers, vendors or competitors; public health epidemics; potential losses arising from the impairment of goodwill or other assets; potential loss of deferred tax assets; the occurrence of litigation or claims, including related to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill; acts of war, terrorism, severe weather or natural or man-made disasters; the loss or insolvency of a major customer, supplier or distributor; and other uncertainties or risks reported from time to time in our reports to the SEC. In light of these risks, uncertainties, assumptions and factors, the forward-looking events discussed in this communication may not occur. We caution that undue reliance should not be placed on Forward-Looking Statements, which speak only as of the date made. Ecolab does not undertake, and expressly disclaims, any duty to update any forward-
looking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or changes in expectations, except as required by law.
 
Non-Solicitation
 
This communication and the news release attached to this Current Report as Exhibit 99.1 do not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.

approaches the party for employment without any solicitation by the party or who is solicited by the party after their employment relationship with the Company or the Retained Subsidiaries or the Downstream Company or its Affiliates has been terminated.  With the exception of the Downstream Restructuring Tax Liabilities (which are expressly taken into account in determining Pending Pre-Closing Tax Period Taxes),the Downstream Business Restructuring Liabilities shall not (unless otherwise mutually agreed by Parent and the Company) be taken into consideration in calculating Working Capital or the Closing Adjustment Amount.  In connection with and as a condition to completing the Restructuring and the Downstream Business Restructuring, the Company or the applicable Retained Subsidiaries will enter into a Transition Services Agreement with the Downstream Business Company and Johnson & Lindley, LLC in such form as may be mutually agreed between Parent, the Downstream Business Company and Johnson & Lindley, LLC prior to the Closing of the Merger, pursuant to which (i) the Company and the applicable Retained Subsidiaries will agree to provide transitional services to Johnson & Lindley, LLC and its Subsidiaries, (ii) the Company and the applicable Retained Subsidiaries will agree to provide transitional services and licensing arrangements as may be required by the Downstream Business Company to operate the Downstream Business as an independent, competitive business following the Downstream Business Restructuring in substantially the same manner as presently conducted; that (x) the Transition Services Agreement will provide that transitional services may be provided, in the discretion of Parent, by other Affiliates of Parent, (y) except for a 120 day license of the "Champion" and "Champ" names and certain associated trade names, trademarks and service marks for the limited purpose of permitting the Downstream Business Company to wind down and cease use of the "Champion" and "Champ" names and all similar names and derivations thereof, the Company and the Retained Subsidiaries shall not license to the Downstream Business Company any rights to the name "Champion," "Champ" or any similar names or derivations thereof, including any similar or associated (whether registered or unregistered) trade names, trademarks or service marks, and (z) the intellectual property, technology rights and proprietary information of the Company and the Retained Subsidiaries to be licensed to the Downstream Business Company for continued use in the Downstream Business will be that which, as of the date of the Downstream Business Restructuring, is used in the conduct of Downstream Business, and; that Parent acknowledges and agrees that the Downstream Business Company may, following the Closing, own and use trademarks, tradenames and service marks substantially used in the Downstream Business so long as they do not (following the Closing) include any reference to the name "Champion," "Champ" or any derivations thereof or to Champion Technologies or any of the Retained Subsidiaries, and (iii) the Downstream Business Company will agree to provide licensing arrangements as may be required by the Company and the Retained Subsidiaries to continue to operate their businesses (other than the Downstream Business) in substantially the same manner as presently conducted; that the Downstream Business Proprietary Information to be licensed to the Company and the Retained Subsidiaries for continued use in the Business (other than the Downstream Business) and Parent's Energy Services business (other than Parent's and its Affiliates' downstream business), will be that which, as of the date of the Downstream Business Restructuring, is used in the conduct of the Business (other than the Downstream Business).  All licensing arrangements between the Company and the Retained Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Downstream Business Company, on the other hand, shall be fully paid, royalty free, perpetual and worldwide licenses.  Transitional services shall be provided, as applicable, at a cost equal to the Company's, the applicable Retained Subsidiary's or the Downstream Business Company's actual cost

for a period of one year following the Effective Time, and such transitional services shall include such services as may be mutually agreed by the parties, potentially including the services referenced as Transition Services on ; that each of Johnson & Lindley, LLC and the Downstream Business Company will have the option, exercisable within 60 days prior to expiration of the Transition Services Agreement, to extend the transitional services for a period up to an additional twelve months, such transitional services would be provided at a cost plus structure to be mutually agreed upon by Parent and the Downstream Business Company and Johnson & Lindley, LLC, and reflected in the Transition Services Agreement.  Such services shall also, if requested by the Downstream Business Company, include commercial services and supply arrangements for the provision by the Company or the applicable Retained Subsidiaries of certain commercial services and supply arrangements for a period of two years following the Effective Time in such form as may be mutually agreed between Parent and the Downstream Business Company.  In providing these commercial services and supply arrangements, the Company will charge raw materials components at cost based on historical cost levels applicable for the 90 day period immediately preceding the Closing Date (but subject to market movements) and conversion costs shall be calculated on the same basis and including the same cost components as currently being used by the Company to calculate such conversion fee, in year two the conversion costs shall be increased by a percentage as mutually agreed by Parent and the Company and reflected in the definitive agreement covering commercial services.  For purposes of clarity, the parties acknowledge that in calculating conversion costs, Parent will not include the stepped-up basis of the Company's or the Retained Subsidiaries' assets resulting from the Merger in such calculation.  The parties further acknowledge that their objective in establishing the pricing of the commercial services and supply arrangements will be for the Downstream Business to as nearly as possible have available to it the pricing that would be available to the Downstream Business if the Downstream Business Restructuring had not occurred.  The Transition Services Agreement will provide that each of Johnson & Lindley, LLC and the Downstream Business Company can eliminate or terminate any service prior to expiration of the term of the Transition Services Agreement by giving at least 60 days prior written notice to the Company.

(d)           The parties acknowledge that the intent of the parties is that any Downstream Business Proprietary Information which was originally created, developed (or is under active development) or acquired by, or expressly on behalf of, the Downstream Business for products produced and sold by the Downstream Business shall be deemed to be primarily used in the Downstream Business and conveyed to the Downstream Business, notwithstanding that such asset may now be used in the Company's upstream business even if the use of such asset in the upstream business generates higher revenues than the current use in the Downstream Business.  Nothing in this section shall limit the Downstream Business Company's agreement herein to license technology to the Company for continuing use by the Company's or its Affiliates' businesses following the Closing.  Parent and the Company agree to cooperate and use reasonable efforts to mutually agree upon and complete all of the definitive agreements required in connection with the Restructuring and Downstream Business Restructuring prior to December 10, 2012 including (1) the identification of the assets to be assigned
 
and conveyed to the Downstream Business Company, (2) the description of the transition services to be provided by Parent, the Company and the Retained Subsidiaries to Johnson & Lindley, LLC, the Downstream Business Company and the terms of the transition services agreement, (3) the terms of the commercial agreements and licensing agreements to be entered into between Parent, the Company or the Retained Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Downstream Business Company on the other hand, (4) identification of the employees to be transferred to the Downstream Business Company, and (5) modification of schedules to the Agreement as necessary to reflect the Downstream Business Restructuring.  Parent and the Company acknowledge and agree that their common goal is to provide the Downstream Business Company with such tangible and intangible assets, rights and benefits to enable the Downstream Business Company to function and compete as an independent company in substantially the same manner as the Downstream Business is presently conducted and to permit the Company and its Affiliates to conduct their non-Downstream Businesses as presently conducted.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
ST. PAUL, Minn., December 3, 2012 - Ecolab Inc. announced it has amended its acquisition agreement with Permian Mud Service, the parent company of Champion Technologies and Corsicana Technologies (hereafter collectively referred to as Champion), such that Champion's downstream process and water solutions business will be spun-off to Permian's shareholders prior to the acquisition by Ecolab, and Ecolab will not acquire those specific operations.  2011 sales for the downstream business, which primarily serves refineries, were approximately $50 million.
 
Accordingly, the value of the transaction will be reduced to $2.16 billion from $2.2 billion, subject to further adjustment as provided in the acquisition agreement.   Ecolab believes the amendment will not have a significant impact on the deal economics, and continues to expect the transaction to deliver approximately $0.12 accretion to adjusted diluted earnings per share in 2013 increasing to approximately $0.50 per share by 2016.
 
Ecolab continues to expect closing of the Champion acquisition to occur by year-end 2012, subject to regulatory clearance and other customary closing conditions.
 
With 2011 pro forma sales of $11 billion and more than 40,000 employees, Ecolab Inc. (NYSE: ECL) is the global leader in water, hygiene and energy technologies and services that provide and protect clean water, safe food, abundant energy and healthy environments. Ecolab delivers comprehensive programs and services to the food, energy, healthcare, industrial and hospitality markets in more than 160 countries.

Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Information
 
This communication contains certain statements relating to future events and our intentions, beliefs, expectations and predictions for the future which are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words or phrases such as "will likely result," "are expected to," "will continue," "is anticipated," "we believe," "we expect," "estimate," "project," "may," "will," "intend," "plan," "believe," "target," "forecast" (including the negative or variations thereof) or similar terminology used in connection with any discussion of future plans, actions or events generally identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding expected earnings per share accretion from the Champion acquisition, deal economics and the expected timing of completion of the Champion acquisition. These statements are based on the current expectations of management of the company. There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements included in this
 
communication. These risks and uncertainties include (i) the risk that the regulatory approvals or clearances required for the acquisition may not be obtained, or that required regulatory approvals may delay the acquisition or result in the imposition of conditions that could have a material adverse effect on the company or cause the company to abandon the acquisition, (ii) the risk that the conditions to the closing of the acquisition may not be satisfied, (iii) the risk that a material adverse change, event or occurrence may affect the company or Champion prior to the closing of the acquisition and may delay the acquisition or cause the company to abandon the acquisition, (iv) problems that may arise in successfully integrating the businesses of the company and Champion, which may result in the combined business not operating as effectively and efficiently as expected, (v) the possibility that the acquisition may involve unexpected costs, unexpected liabilities or unexpected delays, (vi) the risk that the businesses of the company or Champion may suffer as a result of uncertainty surrounding the acquisition and (vii) the risk that disruptions from the transaction will harm relationships with customers, employees and suppliers. In particular, the ultimate results of any Champion integration and business improvement actions, including cost synergies, depend on a number of factors, including the development of final plans, the impact of local regulatory requirements regarding employee terminations, the time necessary to develop and implement the integration and other business improvement initiatives and the level of success achieved through such actions in improving competitiveness, efficiency and effectiveness.
 
Additional risks and uncertainties that may affect operating results and business performance are set forth under Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-Q, our current report on Form 8-K filed October 12, 2012 and the company's other public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and include our ability to integrate Nalco and realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition as well as to close and integrate the proposed acquisition of Champion; our ability to attract and retain high caliber management talent to lead our business; difficulty in procuring raw materials or fluctuations in raw material costs; our ability to execute key business initiatives; vitality of the markets we serve; the impact of worldwide economic factors such as the worldwide economy, credit markets, interest rates and foreign currency risk; exposure to economic, political and legal risks related to our international operations; the costs and effects of complying with laws and regulations relating to the environment and to the manufacture, storage, distribution, sale and use of our products; changes in laws, regulations or accounting standards; our ability to develop competitive advantages through innovation; our substantial indebtedness; information technology systems failures; the ability to acquire complementary businesses and to effectively integrate such businesses; restraints on pricing flexibility due to contractual obligations; pressure on operations from consolidation of customers, vendors or competitors; public health epidemics; potential losses arising from the impairment of goodwill or other assets; potential loss of deferred tax assets; the occurrence of litigation or claims, including related to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill; acts of war, terrorism, severe weather or natural or man-made disasters; the loss or insolvency of a major customer, supplier or distributor; and other uncertainties or risks reported from time to time in our reports to the SEC. In light of these risks, uncertainties, assumptions and factors, the forward-looking events discussed in this communication may not occur. We caution that undue reliance should not be placed on Forward-Looking Statements, which speak only as of the date made. Ecolab does not undertake, and expressly disclaims, any duty to update any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or changes in expectations, except as required by law.
