You also agree that the restraints imposed by this Agreement are reasonable and necessary to protect Ecolab's business and the jobs of other Ecolab employees.
 
Therefore, in consideration of the covenants and agreements contained herein, you and Ecolab agree as follows:
 
1.

For a period of one (1) year after termination of your employment with Ecolab:

(i)
                                    
you may accept employment with a Conflicting Organization whose business is diversified and which, as to that part of its business in which you will be employed, is not a Conflicting Organization, provided that Ecolab, prior to your beginning such employment, receives separate written assurances satisfactory to Ecolab from such Conflicting Organization and from you stating that you will not render services, directly or indirectly in connection with any Conflicting Product or Service for the one (1) year noncompete period; and
 
(ii)

You will fully and promptly communicate to Ecolab in writing all inventions, improvements, devices, processes, treatments, formula, and compounds, whether patentable or not (hereinafter "Inventions") which are first conceived or first reduced to practice by you, whether individually or jointly with others, during your employment and which pertain to Ecolab's business.  Inventions shall be deemed to pertain to Ecolab's business if they relate to any business in which Ecolab is actively engaged, to any business in which Ecolab is conducting research or considering conducting research and development, or to any business which is directly related to any work actually assigned to you by Ecolab.  All such Inventions shall be the sole and exclusive property of Ecolab and you hereby assign all right, title and interest in and to such Inventions to Ecolab.  Any Inventions, which relate to the business of Ecolab, first disclosed by you to anyone within one (1) year after termination of your employment with Ecolab shall be deemed to have been first conceived by you during your employment with Ecolab.  The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to an Invention for which no equipment, supplies, facilities or trade secret information of Ecolab was used and which was developed entirely on your own time and (1) which does not relate to Ecolab's business or development, or (2) which does not result from any work performed by you for Ecolab.
 
10.
                              
You will keep and maintain adequate and current written records of all Inventions at all stages of development, in the form of notes, sketches, drawings and reports relating thereto.  All such records shall be and remain the property of Ecolab at all times.  Upon termination of employment, you agree to return all such records to Ecolab and shall not keep copies of such records.  You will also, during and after your employment by Ecolab, at the request of Ecolab, assist Ecolab in every way proper to obtain and to vest in it title to patents on such Inventions in all countries by executing and delivering all documents necessary or desirable to accomplish such end.  If Ecolab becomes involved in any litigation, arbitration proceeding or any administrative proceeding that requires your assistance, you will cooperate with Ecolab both during and after your employment and will render such assistance and advice to Ecolab as Ecolab may deem necessary or desirable.  Ecolab will reimburse you for all expenses reasonably incurred by you in performing the acts for Ecolab described in this paragraph and if you are no longer employed by Ecolab at the time,  Ecolab shall compensate you at an hourly rate commensurate with your then current rate of salary.
 
11.
                              
Upon termination of your employment, you will immediately return in good order all Ecolab property including but not limited to all Confidential Information in tangible form.  You shall also immediately return all credit cards, keys, automobiles and any other Ecolab property in your possession.
 
12.
                              
All of the provisions of the Agreement which are to be effective following termination of your employment, shall be effective whether or not such termination was voluntary or involuntary.  You warrant that prior to entering into this Agreement you have disclosed to Ecolab any agreements with any previous employers which would prevent you from performing any duties for Ecolab.
 
13.
                              
This Agreement shall not become effective or be binding upon you and Ecolab until accepted on behalf of Ecolab by the signature hereon of a corporate, group or division officer of Ecolab in St. Paul, Minnesota.  This Agreement supersedes any previous agreements between you and Ecolab, written or oral, relating to this subject matter and may be amended or modified only by a writing signed by you and a corporate, group or division officer of Ecolab.  Notwithstanding the previous sentence, should a court of competent jurisdiction invalidate or find unenforceable the noncompetition provision(s) of this Agreement, the next most recent agreement between you and Ecolab containing noncompetition provision(s), if any, shall remain in full force and effect.
 
14.
                              
This Agreement shall be considered as made in the State of Minnesota, and shall be governed by the laws of the State of Minnesota.  All references to Ecolab shall be construed to include subsidiaries and affiliates of Ecolab.  If any of the provisions of this Agreement are held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such holding shall not invalidate any of the other provisions of this Agreement.  The provision held to be invalid or unenforceable shall be deemed modified to the minimum
 
extent necessary to make that provision consistent with applicable law, and in its modified form, that provision shall then be enforceable.
 
15.
                              
If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the non-competition restrictions of this Agreement are too broad as to either time or other terms, then such restrictions shall be enforced to the full extent permitted by law as determined by said court.  In any successful proceeding brought to enforce Ecolab's rights under this Agreement, Ecolab shall recover court costs and reimbursement of Ecolab's attorney's fee and disbursements.  These damages are in addition to any other relief, including injunctive relief, to which Ecolab may be entitled.
