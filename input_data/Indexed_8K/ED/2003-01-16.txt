- 2 - INFORMATION TO BE INCLUDED IN THE REPORT ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS Unaudited net income for common stock for Consolidated Edison, Inc. ("Con Edison") for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $ 646.0 million compared with $682.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Con Edison's unaudited net income for common stock for the quarter ended December 31, 2002 was $118.3 million compared with $125.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2001. Excluding the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, Con Edison's unaudited net income for common stock for the year and quarter ended December 31, 2002 was $ 668.1 million and $120.2 million, respectively. The changes in accounting principles were the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," and the ceasing to apply Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98-10, "Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities" (which was rescinded). See Note I to the Con Edison financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of the combined Con Edison, Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc, and Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2002 (the "Form 10-Q") Reference is made to "Application of Critical Accounting Policies - Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits" in Con Edison's Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation in Part I, Item 2 of the Form 10-Q. Con Edison expects a decrease of $54 million in after-tax net credits to net income for pensions and other postretirement benefits in 2003, as compared to 2002, reflecting a decline of 8.6 percent in the market value of Con Edison's pension plan assets for 2002 and a decrease in the expected annual return on plan assets from the 2002 assumption of 9.2 percent to 8.8 percent. At December 31, 2002, the fair value of the company's pension plan assets exceeded the plan's accumulated benefit obligation. The company did not make a cash contribution to its pension plan in 2002, and is not required to do so in 2003. The preceding paragraph includes forward-looking statements of future expectation. Actual results might differ materially from those expected because of factors such as those identified in "Forward-Looking Statements" in Part I of the Form 10-Q. ITEM 7.

[CON EDISON LOGO] FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Con Edison Reports Solid Results for 2002; Increases Dividend for the 29th Consecutive Year Consolidated Edison, Inc. (NYSE: ED) today (THURSDAY, JANUARY 16, 2003) reported year 2002 net income for common stock of $668.1 million or $3.14 a share, before the cumulative effect of two changes in accounting principles, compared with earnings of $682.2 million or $3.22 a share in 2001. The company also declared a quarterly dividend of 56 cents a share on its common stock, payable March 15, 2003 to shareholders of record as of February 12, 2003, an annualized increase of 2 cents over the previous annual dividend of $2.22 a share. This represents the company's 29th consecutive annual increase in its dividend to shareholders. The total effect of the two changes in accounting principles is a non-cash, after-tax charge of $22.1 million, related to previously reported goodwill impairment on certain unregulated generating assets ($20.2 million), and the reversal of mark-to-market gains on certain energy contracts to reflect the rescinding of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 98-10, "Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities" ($1.9 million). Including these one-time charges, net income for 2002 was $646.0 million or $3.03 per share. "Con Edison had another solid year in 2002, despite continued recovery from September 11 and the relatively weak economy. Our electric, gas and steam systems continue to perform reliably as we remain focused on the basics of our business," said Eugene R. McGrath, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We are proud of our company's operational performance as reflected in Con Edison of New York recently being named the "Most Reliable Utility in North America" and "Energy Company of the Year." These awards are a tribute to the dedication and resourcefulness of the thousands of men and women who work for our company. Our financial condition remains strong, with a solid balance sheet, good liquidity and above average debt ratings." "Our shareholders benefited from an 11.9 percent total return in 2002, which is especially notable in a year of turmoil in the industry and the financial markets," said Joan S. Freilich, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. "Today's increase in the dividend reflects our confidence in Con Edison's future." For the fourth quarter of 2002, the company's net income for common stock was $118.3 million or $0.55 a share, compared with $125.1 million or $0.59 a share for the fourth quarter of 2001. Excluding the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $1.9 million after-tax from the early adoption of the rescission of EITF 98-10, fourth quarter 2002 earnings would have been $120.2 million or $0.56 per share, $4.9 million or $0.03 per share lower than the 2001 period.
Electric delivery volumes by Con Edison of New York, after adjusting for variations in weather and billing days in each period, increased by 0.5 percent, while adjusted firm gas and steam delivery volumes decreased 1.5 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively, for 2002 when compared to the prior year. Earnings for the year 2002 reflect the impact of the mild winter weather in the first quarter of 2002 and the soft economy, offset in part by the hot summer weather and productivity improvements. The company's earnings are generated substantially from its core regulated transmission and distribution business. Con Edison expects its earnings for the year 2003 to be in the range of $2.90 to $3.05 a share. This forecast reflects the company's expectations for the timing of recovery from the current economic downturn. It also reflects an anticipated decrease of $54 million in after-tax net credits for pensions and other post-retirement benefits in 2003, or $0.25 per share, from 2002 levels. This decrease reflects, among other factors, a decline of 8.6 percent in the market value of Con Edison's pension plan assets for the year 2002, attributable to the overall stock market decline, and a decrease in the assumed future annual return on plan assets from the 2002 assumption of 9.2 percent to 8.8 percent. At December 31, 2002, the fair value of pension plan assets exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation. Con Edison did not make a cash contribution to its pension plan in 2002 and is not required to do so in 2003. Capital expenditures for 2003 are budgeted at $1.313 billion, compared with $1.447 billion for 2002. This press release contains forward-looking statements of future expectations. Actual results might differ materially from those projected because of factors such as those identified in reports the company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Consolidated Edison, Inc. is one of the nation's largest investor-owned energy companies, with more than $8 billion in annual revenues and approximately $19 billion in assets.
