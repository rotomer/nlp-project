[CON EDISON LOGO] FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Con Edison, Inc. Reports First Quarter Earnings Company Reaffirms 2003 Earnings Projection Consolidated Edison, Inc. today reported net income for common stock for the first quarter of 2003 of $154 million or 72 cents a share, compared with earnings of $146 million or 68 cents a share, for the first quarter of 2002. Net income for the 2002 period includes a one-time goodwill impairment charge of $20 million after-tax, related to certain unregulated generating assets. Excluding this non-cash charge, net income for the first quarter of 2002 was $166 million or 78 cents a share. The company also declared a quarterly dividend of 56 cents a share on its common stock payable June 15, 2003 to stockholders of record as of May 14, 2003. "Con Edison's performance for the first quarter represents a solid start for the year," said Eugene R. McGrath, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "In these uncertain times, Con Edison's steady focus on operational excellence and financial strength continues to build value for our customers and our shareholders." The company's net income for common stock for the 12 months ended March 31, 2003 was $654 million or $3.07 a share, compared with $650 million or $3.06 a share, for the 12 months ended March 31, 2002. Absent the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles in 2002, earnings for the 12 months ended March 31, 2003 and March 31, 2002 would have been $3.08 and $3.16 a share, respectively. The company's earnings for the first quarter of 2003 were positively affected by increased sales related to the cold winter weather, as compared with the mild winter weather in the first quarter of 2002. Offsetting the impact of higher sales was a reduction in net pension and other post-retirement benefits credit. Volumes of electricity, gas and steam delivered by Con Edison of New York, after adjusting for variations in weather and billing days in the period, increased 3.1 percent, 3.3 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively, for the first three months of 2003 compared with the prior year. The company's 10 highest winter electric peak loads all occurred this winter, and a new record winter peak of 8,514 MW was set in January 2003.
The following table represents an analysis of the major factors affecting earnings per share for the 1st Quarter of 2003 compared with 2002: Earnings Per Share 1st Quarter 2003 Compared With 2002 ($) - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Con Edison of New York: Impact of cold winter weather in 2003 on net revenues versus mild winter weather in 2002 (estimated) 0.13 Sales growth from factors other than weather (estimated) 0.06 Reduced net credit for pensions & other post-retirement benefits (0.08) Regulatory accounting/amortizations (0.09) Higher depreciation and property tax expense (0.03) Amortization of divestiture gain in 2002 (0.06) Orange & Rockland Utilities 0.02 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for goodwill impairment in 2002 0.10 Other (0.01) - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Total $0.04 - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- For the full year 2003, the Company confirms its previous forecast of earnings in the range of $2.90 to $3.05 per share.
