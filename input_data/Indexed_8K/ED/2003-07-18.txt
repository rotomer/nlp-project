ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS
Second Quarter Financial Results
        Consolidated Edison, Inc.'s unaudited net revenues (operating revenues less purchased power, fuel and gas purchased for resale), operating income and net income for common stock for the three months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002 were as follows:
        The results for the three months ended June 30, 2003, as compared to the 2002 period, reflect lower electric deliveries related to cooler weather and a reduction in net credits for pension and other post-retirement benefits.
O&R New Jersey Electric Rate Decision
        On July 16, 2003, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) ruled upon the petitions of Rockland Electric Company (RECO), the New Jersey utility subsidiary of Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. (O&R), for an increase in electric rates and recovery of deferred purchased power costs. O&R is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Consolidated Edison, Inc. See "Rate and Restructuring AgreementsElectric" and "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the Con Edison and O&R financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the combined Consolidated Edison, Inc., Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. and O&R Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002. The NJBPU ordered a $7.2 million decrease in RECO's electric base rates, effective August 2003, authorized RECO's recovery of approximately $83.4 million of previously deferred purchased power costs and associated interest and disallowed recovery of approximately $18.6 million of such costs and associated interest. The company at December 31, 2002, had accrued a reserve for most of the disallowance, and at June 30, 2003 was fully reserved for the disallowance. The NJBPU has not yet issued a written order on these rulings.
ITEM 9. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE (INFORMATION IS BEING PROVIDED UNDER ITEM 12)
        On July 17, 2003, Consolidated Edison, Inc. issued the following press release:
        NEW YORKConsolidated Edison, Inc. (NYSE: ED) today reported net income for common stock for the second quarter of 2003 of $66 million or 29 cents a share, compared with earnings of $98 million or 46 cents a share, for the second quarter of 2002. The company also declared a quarterly dividend of 56 cents a share on its common stock payable September 15, 2003 to stockholders of record as of August 13, 2003.
        "Our energy delivery systems continue to perform very well," said Eugene R. McGrath, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Our earnings were impacted by the unseasonably cool spring weather.
We see continued growth in demand for our services, and on June 26, we set a new all-time electric peak load for that month."
        The company's net income for common stock for the first six months of 2003 was $220 million or $1.01 a share, compared with $244 million or $1.14 a share for the first six months of 2002. Net income for the 2002 period includes a one-time goodwill impairment charge of $20 million after-tax, related to certain unregulated generating assets. Excluding this non-cash charge, net income for the first six months of 2002 was $264 million or $1.24 a share.
        The company's earnings for the second quarter of 2003 were negatively affected by lower electric deliveries related to the exceptionally cool weather. For the first six months of 2003, this reduction partially offset the positive impact of increased energy sales in the first quarter, as compared with the corresponding 2002 period, related to colder than normal winter weather. In addition, earnings for both 2003 periods were impacted by a reduction in net credits for pension and other post-retirement benefits as compared with 2002.
        For the three months ended June 30, 2003, amounts of electricity, gas and steam delivered by Con Edison of New York, after adjusting for variations in weather and billing days in the period increased 0.3 percent, 0.5 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively, as compared to the 2002 period.
        For the first six months of 2003, amounts of electricity, gas and steam delivered by Con Edison of New York, after adjusting for variations in weather and billing days in the period, increased 1.7 percent, 2.3 percent and 1.0 percent, respectively, as compared to the 2002 period.
        For the full year 2003, the company reaffirms its previous forecast of earnings in the range of $2.82 to $2.97 per share.
        The following table represents an analysis of the major factors affecting earnings per share for the second quarter of 2003 compared with 2002:
        The following table represents an analysis of the major factors affecting earnings per share for year-to-date 2003 compared with 2002:
