- 2 - This Debenture is one of a duly authorized series of an issue of unsecured debt securities of the Company designated as its 3.625% Debentures, Series 2003 A (hereinafter called the "Debentures"), issued and to be issued under an Indenture dated as of April 1, 2002 (hereinafter called the "Indenture"), between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, Trustee (hereinafter called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture). Reference is made to the Indenture and any supplemental indenture thereto for the provisions relating, among other things, to the respective rights of the Company, the Trustee and the holders of the Debentures, and the terms on which the Debentures are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. The Company may redeem the Debentures in whole or in part, at its option at any time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Debentures being redeemed or (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate (as defined below) plus 15 basis points, plus accrued interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the redemption date. "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security or securities selected by an Independent Investment Banker (as defined below) as having an actual or interpolated maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Debentures being redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Debentures. "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption date, (1) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations (as defined below) for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Trustee obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations. "Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers (as defined below) appointed by the Trustee after consultation with the Company. "Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, their respective successors, and two other primary U.S. Government securities dealers in The City of New York (each a "Primary Treasury Dealer") selected by the Company. If any Reference Treasury Dealer shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company will substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer for that dealer. "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 3:30 p.m. New York time on the third business day preceeding such redemption date. "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity or interpolated (on a day count basis) of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date.
-3- Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date interest will cease to accrue on the Debentures or portions thereof called for redemption. If an Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture) shall have occurred and be continuing with respect to the Debentures, the principal hereof may be declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with such effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture. Any such declaration may be rescinded by holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Debentures if all Events of Default with respect to the Debentures (other than the non-payment of principal of the Debentures which shall have become due by such declaration) shall have been remedied. The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Debentures at the time outstanding, evidenced as in the Indenture provided, to execute supplemental indentures adding any provisions to the Indenture or to any supplemental indenture with respect to the Debentures, or modifying in any manner the rights of the holders of the Debentures; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall (i) extend the maturity of any Debenture, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, or make the principal thereof, or interest thereon, payable in any coin or currency other than that in the Debentures provided, without the consent of the holder of each Debenture so affected, or (ii) reduce the aforesaid principal amount of Debentures, the holders of which are required to consent to any such supplemental indenture without the consent of the holders of all Debentures then outstanding. The Debentures are issuable as registered Debentures only, in the denomination of $1000 and any integral multiples of $1000 approved by the Company, such approval to be evidenced by the execution thereof. This Debenture is transferable by the registered holder hereof in person or by his attorney duly authorized in writing on the books of the Company at the office or agency to be maintained by the Company for that purpose, but only in the manner, subject to the limitations and upon payment of any tax or governmental charge for which the Company may require reimbursement as provided in the Indenture, and upon surrender and cancellation of this Debenture. Upon any registration of transfer, a new registered Debenture or Debentures, of authorized denomination or denominations, and in the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the transferee in exchange therefor. The Company, the Trustee, any paying agent and any Security registrar may deem and treat the registered holder hereof as the absolute owner of this Debenture (whether or not this Debenture shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notations of ownership or other writing hereon made by anyone other than the Security registrar) for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal hereof and interest due hereon as herein provided and for all other purposes, and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any paying agent nor any Security registrar shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.
-4- No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or interest on this Debenture, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, against any incorporator or against any past, present or future stockholder, officer or member of the Board of Directors, as such, of the Company, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof, expressly waived and released. This Debenture shall be deemed to be a contract made under the laws of the State of New York, and for all purposes shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. All terms used in this Debenture which are defined in the Indenture and not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
