(O&R, and together with Con Edison and Con Edison of New York, the Companies) were as follows: The Companies' results for the three months ended September 30, 2003, as compared to the 2002 period, were negatively affected by the lower than normal number of hot days during the summer of 2003 compared to an exceptionally warm summer in 2002, higher depreciation and property tax expense and the August 2003 power outage. For Con Edison and Con Edison of New York, the results also reflect a reduction in net credits for pension and other post-retirement benefits. In addition, for Con Edison, results were negatively affected by the current weak margins in the wholesale electric markets affecting sales from unregulated generation assets. ITEM 7.

CON EDISON, INC. REPORTS THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS AND DECLARES DIVIDEND NEW YORK - Consolidated Edison, Inc. (Con Edison) [NYSE: ED] today reported net income for common stock for the third quarter of 2003 of $257 million or $1.17 a share compared with earnings of $284 million or $1.34 a share for the third quarter of 2002. The company also declared a quarterly dividend of 56 cents a share on its common stock payable December 15, 2003 to stockholders of record as of November 12, 2003. "We're seeing the underlying strength of the New York City economy reflected in signs of recovery from the recent economic decline," said Eugene R. McGrath, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "For example, in the first half of 2003, housing permits issued in Con Edison of New York's service area were running at an 18-year high and were approximately 70 percent ahead of the level of five years ago." The company's net income for common stock for the first nine months of 2003 was $478 million or $2.18 a share, compared with $528 million or $2.48 a share for the first nine months of 2002. Net income for the 2002 period included a one-time goodwill impairment charge of $20 million after-tax, related to certain unregulated generating assets. Excluding this non-cash charge, net income for the first nine months of 2002 was $548 million or $2.58 a share. The company's earnings for the third quarter of 2003 were negatively affected by the multi-regional August power outage and the lower-than-normal number of hot days during the summer of 2003 compared with an exceptionally warm summer in 2002. The lower third quarter and nine month results also reflect the reduction in net credits for pensions and other post-retirement benefits and the current weak margins in the wholesale electric markets affecting sales from unregulated generation assets. For the first nine months of 2003, the negative impact on earnings from the weather in both the second and third quarters partially offset the positive impact of cooler-than-normal winter weather in the first quarter. Electric delivery volumes by Con Edison of New York decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2003, after adjusting for variations in weather and billing days in each period and the August power outage, by 0.6 percent, while adjusted firm gas and steam delivery volumes increased 4.3 percent and 2.2 percent, respectively, when compared with the prior year. - more -
CON EDISON THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS PAGE 2 For the first nine months of 2003, amounts of electricity, gas and steam delivered by Con Edison of New York, after adjusting for variations in weather and billing days in the period and the August power outage, increased 0.8 percent, 2.6 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively, as compared with the 2002 period. For the full year 2003, the Company expects its earnings to be near the lower end of its previously communicated forecast range of $2.82 to $2.97 per share. The following table represents an analysis of the major factors affecting earnings per share for the third quarter of 2003 compared with 2002: - more -
