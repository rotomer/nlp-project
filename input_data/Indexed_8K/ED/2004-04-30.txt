INFORMATION TO BE INCLUDED IN THE REPORT ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS AND REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE On April 30, 2004, Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. (Con Edison of New York), a regulated utility subsidiary of Consolidated Edison, Inc. (Con Edison) filed a request with the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC) to increase charges for electric service by $550 million (6.7 percent increase), effective April 2005. The filing with the PSC reflects a return on equity of 12 percent and an equity ratio of 48.8 percent. The filing includes a proposal for a multi-year rate plan to continue the proposed level of charges through March 2008 provided that charges would be adjusted, effective April 2006 and April 2007, to reflect additions to utility plant in service, property taxes, changes in pension and retiree health expense, and the impact, if any, of reconciling certain cost elements from the prior rate year. In addition, the filing would continue the provisions pursuant to which fuel and purchased power costs are recovered from customers on a current basis. Con Edison and Con Edison of New York are continuing a review of their financing plans, which may include an issuance of Con Edison common stock. The review, which may be completed in the near term, involves the consideration of various factors, including the electric rate proceeding initiated by the filing discussed above, the Con Edison of New York gas and steam rate proceedings initiated in November 2003 and the capital expenditures of more than a $1 billion a year that Con Edison of New York expects to continue to make for the next few years. Con Edison has registered $925 million of securities, including debt, preferred stock and common stock, for sale under the Securities Act of 1933 pursuant to "shelf" Registration Statements on Form S-3. Con Edison of New York has registered $825 million of its debt securities. ITEM 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS 99. Information Sheet for Electric Rate Case Filing ITEM 9.
