ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS AND REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE
 
On May 28, 2004, Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. (Con Edison of New York), a regulated utility subsidiary of Consolidated Edison, Inc., entered into a Joint Proposal with the staff of the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC) and other parties with respect to the rates the company can charge its customers for gas and steam services. The Joint Proposal is subject to PSC approval.
 
The Joint Proposal, as it relates to the company's gas business, covers the three-year period from October 1, 2004 through September 30, 2007, and provides that the PSC may select one of two alternatives for increases in gas base rates (which from the company's perspective are economically equivalent): (A) increases of $28.7 million, $18.4 million and $18.3 million, effective October 1, 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively, or (B) an increase of $46.8 million, effective October 1, 2004, with deferral accounting to be used to allocate the income statement effect of the increase over the term of the agreement. The gas rate increases shown above are net of $17.5 million (pre-tax) the company agreed to apply for customer benefit to resolve various issues, for which the company will recognize a charge in 2004. In addition to these rate increases, the company will retain the first $35 million of net revenues from non-firm customer transactions for each year of the rate plan.
 
The Joint Proposal, as it relates to the company's steam business, covers the two-year period from October 1, 2004 through September 30, 2006, and provides for increases in steam base rates of $49.6 million, effective October 1, 2004, and $27.4 million effective, October 1, 2005. The steam rate increases shown above are net of $6.2 million (pre-tax) the company agreed to apply for customer benefit to resolve various issues, for which the company will recognize a charge in 2004.
 
Additional provisions of the Joint Proposal include:
