NEW YORK  Consolidated Edison, Inc. (Con Edison) [NYSE: ED] today reported net income for common stock for the second quarter of 2004 of $86 million or 37 cents a share, compared with earnings of $66 million or 29 cents a share for the second quarter of 2003. The company also declared a quarterly dividend of 56 cents a share on its common stock payable September 15, 2004 to stockholders of record as of August 11, 2004.
 
"Our solid performance in the second quarter is consistent with our earnings forecast for the year," said Eugene R. McGrath, chairman and chief executive officer. "In operations, we energized three new substations, the most in three decades. These events were just a part of our preparation for our growing summer peak loads. They also represent another milestone in our multi-billion dollar investment in the most reliable electric system in the country," he said.
 
The company's net income for common stock for the first six months of 2004 was $241 million or $1.05 a share compared with $220 million or $1.01 a share for the first six months of 2003.
 
The following table represents an analysis of the major factors affecting basic earnings per share for the second quarter of 2004 compared with 2003:
 
 
 
The earnings per share variations shown above include the dilutive effect of a higher weighted average number of common shares outstanding in the 2004 period (234 million shares) than in the 2003 period (219 million shares).
 
The following table represents an analysis of the major factors affecting basic earnings per share for the first six months of 2004 compared with 2003:
 
 
The earnings per share variations shown above include the dilutive effect of a higher weighted average number of common shares outstanding in the 2004 period (231 million shares) than in the 2003 period (217 million shares).
 
For the second quarter and the first six months of 2004, Con Edison of New York's earnings variances reflect two significant factors. Higher net revenues in 2004 are due primarily to ongoing sales growth and the warm spring weather as compared with spring 2003. There was more than twice the number of cooling degree days in the second quarter of 2004 billing cycles as in the prior period. Higher depreciation and property taxes in 2004 reflect large continuing investments in energy delivery infrastructure.
 
The performance of the unregulated subsidiaries and parent in the second quarter and the first six months of 2004 compared with the 2003 periods reflect lower gross margins on electric sales and higher interest expense.
 
For the full year 2004, the company reaffirms its previous forecast of earnings in the range of $2.50 to $2.70 per share. The forecast reflects increased costs in the second half of the year for pensions and other post-retirement benefits, depreciation and property taxes, and the continued impact of the dilutive effect of common equity issuances. These factors are all addressed in Con Edison of New York's gas and steam proposed agreements and in the current electric rate proceeding.
 
 
For the three months ended June 30, 2004, amounts of electricity and gas delivered by Con Edison of New York, after adjusting for variations in weather and billing days in the period, increased 1.9 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively, while adjusted steam delivery volumes decreased 1.2 percent, as compared to the 2003 period.
 
For the first six months of 2004, amounts of electricity, gas and steam delivered by Con Edison of New York, after adjusting for variations in weather and billing days in the period, increased 1.8 percent, 0.8 percent and 0.3 percent, respectively, as compared to the 2003 period.
 
During the second quarter of 2004, the company issued 14 million shares of common stock under a public offering, resulting in net proceeds of $513 million.
 
Refer to attachments to this press release for the condensed consolidated balance sheets at June 30, 2004 and December 31, 2003 and the consolidated income statements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003.
 
The press release contains forward-looking statements of future expectations. Actual results might differ materially from those projected because of factors such as those identified in reports the company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
