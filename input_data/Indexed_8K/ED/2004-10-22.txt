ITEM 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
On October 21, 2004, Consolidated Edison, Inc. (Con Edison) issued a press release reporting, among other things, results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2004. Con Edison's summary consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2004 and 2003 and consolidated income statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003 were attached to the press release. The press release (including its attachments) is "furnished" as an exhibit to this report pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K.
 
ITEM 8.01 Other Events
 
Unaudited net revenues (operating revenues less purchased power, fuel and gas purchased for resale), operating income and net income for common stock for the three months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003 for Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. (Con Edison of New York) were as follows:
 
 
Con Edison of New York's results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2004, as compared with the 2003 period, were negatively affected by the recognition in the 2004 period of a charge for the $24 million ($15 million after tax) the company agreed to apply for customer benefit in accordance with new gas and steam rate plans approved in September 2004. Results in the 2004 period also reflect a lower-than-normal number of hot days during the summer months, reduced net credits for pensions and other post-retirement benefits and higher depreciation and property taxes, offset in part by increased other income and decreased taxes and interest on long-term debt.
 
Con Edison of New York has updated its pending electric rate petition to reduce its rate increase request from $550 million to $472 million, primarily to reflect lower projected property tax and insurance costs and an increase in anticipated customer credits arising from transmission auctions conducted by the New York Independent System Operator.
 
For additional information about Con Edison of New York's new gas and steam rate plans and its pending electric rate request, see Note C to the financial statements in the company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2004.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99
 
 
 
NEW YORK - Consolidated Edison, Inc. (Con Edison) [NYSE: ED] today reported earnings from ongoing operations of $261 million for the third quarter of 2004 or $1.09 a share, compared with earnings of $257 million or $1.17 a share for the third quarter of 2003. Excluded from the 2004 results is the impact of one-time non-cash charges totaling $15 million after tax related to the Con Edison of New York gas and steam rate plans approved by the Public Service Commission in September. Including these charges, net income for common stock for the third quarter of 2004 was $246 million or $1.02 a share. The company also declared a quarterly dividend of 56

/
2
cents a share on its common stock payable December 15, 2004 to stockholders of record as of November 10, 2004.
 
"Con Edison's electric, gas and steam systems continue to perform well as New York's energy needs grow," said Eugene R. McGrath, chairman and chief executive officer. "Continued regulatory support for the upgrade and expansion of critical infrastructure will foster new economic growth," he said.
 
For the first nine months of 2004, the company's earnings from ongoing operations were $502 million or $2.15 a share compared with $478 million or $2.18 a share for the 2003 period. Including the one-time non-cash charges noted above, net income for common stock for the first nine months of 2004 was $487 million or $2.08 a share, compared with earnings of $478 million or $2.18 a share for the 2003 period.
 
The following table is a reconciliation of Con Edison's earnings and earnings per share from ongoing operations to reported net income for common stock and earnings per share.
 
 
 
The following table represents an analysis of the major factors affecting Con Edison's earnings per share for the third quarter and first nine months of 2004 compared with the 2003 periods:
 
 
The earnings per share variations shown above include the dilutive effect of higher weighted average number of common shares outstanding in the third quarter and first nine months of 2004. The weighted average numbers of common shares are 242 million shares and 234 million shares for the third quarter and first nine months, compared with 225 million shares and 220 million shares in the 2003 periods, respectively. The dilutive effect on earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 2004 is $0.10 and $0.14, respectively.
 
The company's earnings for the third quarter of 2004 were negatively affected by the lower-than-normal number of hot days during the summer months, which offset the benefit of the unusually warm spring. The lower third quarter and nine month results also reflect a reduction in net credits for pensions and other post-retirement benefits. In addition, higher depreciation and property taxes in 2004 reflect large continuing investments in energy delivery infrastructure.
 
 
The new three-year Con Edison of New York gas rate plan provides for a single increase in base rates of $46.8 million, effective October 1, 2004, with base rates then frozen for two years. The two-year steam rate plan provides for increases in base rates of $49.6 million effective October 1, 2004 and $27.4 million effective October 1, 2005. In accordance with New York regulatory procedure, the company recently updated its April request for an increase in electric rates. The company reduced its rate increase request from $550 million to $472 million, primarily to reflect lower projected property tax and insurance costs and an increase in anticipated customer credits arising from transmission auctions conducted by the New York Independent System Operator.
 
The performance of the unregulated subsidiaries and parent for the first nine months of 2004 compared with the 2003 period reflects lower gross margins on electric sales and higher interest expense, offset in part by higher mark-to-market gains on forward transactions.
 
For the full year 2004, the company reaffirms its previous forecast of earnings in the range of $2.50 to $2.70 per share.
 
For the three months ended September 30, 2004, amounts of gas and steam delivered by Con Edison of New York, after adjusting for variations in weather and billing days in the period, decreased 1.4 percent and 3.9 percent, respectively, as compared to the 2003 period. Electricity delivered, after adjusting for variations in weather and billing days in the period, was equivalent to the 2003 period. The 2003 amounts of electricity, gas and steam delivered were also adjusted for the August 2003 regional power outage.
 
For the first nine months of 2004, amounts of electricity and gas delivered by Con Edison of New York, after adjusting for variations in weather and billing days in the period, increased 1.1 percent and 0.5 percent, respectively, while steam decreased 0.9 as compared to the 2003 period. The 2003 amounts of electricity, gas and steam delivered were also adjusted for the August 2003 regional power outage.
