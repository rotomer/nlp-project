ITEM 8.01 Other Events
 
On December 2, 2004, Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. (Con Edison of New York), a regulated utility subsidiary of Consolidated Edison, Inc. (Con Edison), entered into a Joint Proposal with the staff of the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC) and other parties with respect to the rates the company can charge its customers for electric service. The Joint Proposal is subject to PSC approval.
 
The Joint Proposal covers the three-year period from April 1, 2005 through March 31, 2008, and provides for increases in delivery service rates of $104.6 million, effective April 1, 2005, and $220.4 million, effective April 1, 2007. In addition, the company will retain the first $60 million of proceeds from the auction of transmission rights (transmission congestion contracts) in each of the three years. The rate increases are lower than they otherwise would have been as a result of the amortization of certain regulatory assets and liabilities, the net effect of which will be to increase recorded electric revenues by $128 million, $232 million and $190 million in each of the 12-month periods ended March 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively.
 
Additional provisions of the Joint Proposal include:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Neither Con Edison nor Con Edison of New York anticipates any material changes to its 2005 financing plans as a result of the Joint Proposal.
