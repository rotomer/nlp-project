Exhibit 99
 
 
 
NEW YORK  Consolidated Edison, Inc. (Con Edison) [NYSE: ED] today reported net income for common stock for the first quarter of 2005 of $181 million or 75 cents a share, compared with earnings of $155 million or 69 cents a share for the first quarter of 2004. The company also declared a quarterly dividend of 57 cents a share on its common stock payable June 15, 2005 to stockholders of record as of May 18, 2005.
 
"Our improved performance for the first quarter reflects the continued strengthening of the local economy and Con Edison of New York's new gas and steam rate plans, which have their greatest effect in the winter months," said Eugene R. McGrath, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
 
The following table shows the major factors affecting basic earnings per share for the first quarter of 2005 compared with 2004:
 
 
The earnings per share variations shown above reflect the dilutive effect of a higher weighted average number of common shares outstanding in the 2005 period (243 million shares) than in the 2004 period (226 million shares).
 
 
For the three months ended March 31, 2005, amounts of electricity, firm gas and steam delivered by Con Edison of New York, after adjusting for variations in weather and billing days in the period, increased 2.2 percent, 3.8 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively, as compared with the 2004 period.
 
For Con Edison of New York, the variation in pension and other postretirement benefit costs reflects primarily lower net pension credits from the amortization of previous years' net investment gains and losses. Higher operation and maintenance expense includes costs of moving facilities to avoid interfering with government projects. The gas and steam rate plans that went into effect in October 2004 and the new electric rate plan described below address these increased cost levels.
 
In March, the New York Public Service Commission approved a three-year electric rate plan for Con Edison of New York's electric delivery service. Under this plan, rates were increased $104.6 million, effective April 1, 2005, and will be increased $220.4 million effective April 1, 2007. Additional plan provisions include amortization of certain regulatory assets and liabilities, which will increase electric revenues by $128 million, $173 million and $249 million in the first, second and third rate years, respectively; retention by the company of the first $60 million per year of proceeds from the sale of transmission rights; retention of a portion of earnings in excess of an 11.4 percent return on common equity; annual reconciliations of utility plant carrying cost, pension and other postretirement benefit costs and certain other costs to levels reflected in rates (with the difference, in some cases subject to certain limitations, deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities); and potential earnings adjustments if the company meets specified standards in its retail access and demand side management programs or fails to meet specified operational standards.
 
For the year 2005, the Company confirms its previous forecast of earnings in the range of $2.75 to $2.90 per share.
