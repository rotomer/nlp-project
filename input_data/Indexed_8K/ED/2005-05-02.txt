This presentation contains certain forward-looking statements of future expectations and financial measures not determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (non-GAAP) financial measures. Actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements because of factors such as those identified in reports the company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. "Earnings from ongoing operations" excludes the impact of unusual items. Earnings from ongoing operations should not be considered as an alternative to net income, which is an indicator of operating performance determined in accordance with GAAP. Management uses earnings and earnings per share from ongoing operations to facilitate the analysis of the company's ongoing performance as compared to its internal budgets and previously reported financial results. Management believes that earnings from ongoing operations, although a non-GAAP measure, are also useful and meaningful to investors. Other companies may use different measures to present financial performance.
