NEW YORK - Consolidated Edison, Inc. (Con Edison) [NYSE: ED] today reported 2005 third quarter earnings from ongoing operations of $287 million or $1.17 a share, compared with earnings from ongoing operations of $265 million or $1.11 cents a share for the third quarter of 2004. Excluded from the 2004 results is the impact of non-cash charges totaling $15 million after-tax related to the Con Edison of New York gas and steam rate plans. Also excluded from these results are the discontinued operations of Con Edison Communications (CEC). Including the 2004 charges and losses from CEC, net income for common stock for the third quarter of 2005 was $285 million or $1.17 a share compared with $246 million or $1.02 a share in 2004. The company also declared a quarterly dividend of 57 cents a share on its common stock payable December 15, 2005 to stockholders of record as of November 16, 2005.
 
"Warmer than normal summer weather pushed electricity usage in our service territories to record levels," said Kevin Burke, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer. "We are investing more than $1 billion a year to maintain reliability and upgrade our transmission and distribution systems. Our infrastructure investments are essential to support New York's economic growth, as well as to provide the power necessary for a better quality of life for our customers," he said.
 
The company's earnings from ongoing operations for the first nine months of 2005 were $586 million or $2.41 a share compared with earnings from ongoing operations of $512 million or $2.19 a share for the first nine months of 2004. Including the 2004 charges and discontinued operations of CEC, net income for common stock for the first nine months of 2005 was $581 million or $2.39 a share compared with $487 million or $2.08 a share in the 2004 period.
 
The company expects its earnings for 2005 to be in the range of $2.85 to $2.95 a share. The company's previously forecasted 2005 earnings range was $2.75 to $2.90 per share.
 
The following table is a reconciliation of Con Edison's earnings and earnings per share from ongoing operations to reported net income for common stock and earnings per share.
 
 
CON EDISON, INC. REPORTS 2005 THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS
 
The following table represents an analysis of the major factors affecting Con Edison's earnings per share from ongoing operations for the third quarter and first nine months of 2005 compared with the 2004 periods:
 
 
The earnings per share variations shown above reflect the dilutive effect of a higher weighted average number of common shares outstanding in the 2005 three-month and nine-month periods (244 million shares in each period) than in the 2004 three-month and nine-month periods (242 million and 234 million shares, respectively).
 
For Con Edison of New York, increased revenues under the electric rate plan that took effect in April 2005 and the gas and steam rate plans that took effect in October 2004 address the recovery of higher expenses for pensions and other postretirement benefits, ongoing operations and maintenance, depreciation and property taxes, and provide a return on capital invested in the energy infrastructure. The increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs reflect primarily lower net pension credits from the amortization of previous years' net investment gains and losses. Higher depreciation and property taxes reflect continuing infrastructure investment programs and the commercial start-up of the East River Repowering Project.
 
The performance of the unregulated energy subsidiaries for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2005, compared with the 2004 periods, reflects primarily the effect of mark-to-market accounting for electricity sales. For these sales, prices are fixed and fuel costs have been hedged.
