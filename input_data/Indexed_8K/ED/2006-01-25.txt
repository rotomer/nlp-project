(Con Edison of New York) were increased as follows: Eugene R. McGrath, Chairman, to $1,588,000; Kevin Burke, Chief Executive Officer, to $1,000,000; Robert N. Hoglund, Chief Financial Officer, to $535,000 and Charles E. McTiernan, Jr., General Counsel, to $360,000. In addition, the salaries of the following officers were increased as follows: Stephen B.

McMahon, President of Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. (O&R), to $665,000.
 
On January 19, 2006, Messrs. McGrath, Burke, Rana, Hoglund and McTiernan and Ms. McCartney and Joan S. Freilich, Vice Chairman of Con Edison and Con Edison of New York, were awarded $2,250,000, $600,000, $335,000, $265,000, $170,000, $175,000 and $387,000, respectively, pursuant to Con Edison of New York's 2005 Executive Incentive Plan (EIP). In addition, Mr. Bram was awarded $295,000 pursuant to Con Edison's Annual Incentive Plan and Mr. McMahon was awarded $391,000 pursuant to O&R's Annual Team Incentive Plan.
 
On January 19, 2006, awards were granted under the Con Edison Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) as follows: to Mr. McGrath, 80,000 restricted stock units; to Mr. Burke, 35,000 restricted stock units and options covering 280,000 shares; to Ms. Freilich, 8,700 restricted stock units; to Mr. Rana, 6,300 restricted stock units and options covering 50,000 shares; to Mr. Hoglund, 3,000 restricted stock units and options covering 25,000 shares; to Mr. Bram, 10,000 restricted stock units; to Mr. McTiernan, 2,000 restricted stock units and options covering 16,000 shares; to Ms. McCartney, 1,800 restricted stock units and options covering 18,000 shares; and to Mr. McMahon, 7,200 restricted stock units and options covering 57,000 shares.
 
Each restricted stock unit represents the right to receive, upon vesting, one share of Con Edison common shares, the cash value of a share or a combination thereof. The number of units in each award is subject to adjustment as follows: (i) fifty percent of the units awarded will be multiplied by a factor that may range from 0 to 150 percent based on Con Edison's total shareholder return relative to the Standard & Poor's Electric Utilities Index during a three-year performance period; and (ii) fifty percent of the units awarded will be multiplied by a factor that may range from 0 to 150 percent based on determinations made in connection with the EIP (or for Mr. McMahon, the O&R's Annual Team Incentive Plan; and for Mr. Bram, Con Edison's Annual Incentive Plan). Units generally vest when the performance period ends.
 
The stock options granted represent the right, generally for the period from the third through tenth anniversaries of the grant date, to purchase a specified number of Con Edison common shares at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of a common share when the options were granted. Upon exercise of a stock option, the option holder may receive Con Edison common shares, cash, or a combination of both. The exercise price may be adjusted only in the event of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, reorganization, combination or exchange of equity securities or other distribution.
 
The EIP was included as Exhibit 10.1 in the Current Report on Form 8-K, dated December 29, 2005. O&R's Annual Team Incentive Plan policy was included as Exhibit 10.3 in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003. Con Edison's Annual Incentive Plan was included as Exhibit 10.1.11 in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003.
