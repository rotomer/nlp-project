ITEM 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
On June 22, 2006, Consolidated Edison, Inc. ("Con Edison") and its subsidiaries Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. ("Con Edison of New York") and Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. ("O&R," and along with Con Edison and Con Edison of New York, each a "Company" and collectively, the "Companies") entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of June 22, 2006, (the "Credit Agreement") among the Companies, the banks party thereto (the "Banks") and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent. A copy of the Credit Agreement is included as an exhibit to this report, and the description of the Credit Agreement that follows is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement.
The Credit Agreement amends and restates the 5-Year Credit Agreement, dated as of April 14, 2005, among the Companies, the banks party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent. The Credit Agreement terminates the 3-Year Credit Agreement dated as of November 26, 2003 among the Companies, the banks party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as agent.
Under the Credit Agreement, the Banks committed to provide loans and letters of credit, on a revolving credit basis, in an aggregate amount of up to $2.25 billion, with $1.5 billion available to Con Edison of New York (subject to increase to the full amount if the necessary regulatory approvals are requested and obtained), $1 billion available to Con Edison and $200 million available to O&R. Subject to certain conditions, the Companies and one or more Banks or additional banks may increase by up to $500 million the aggregate principal amount of loans and letters of credit available under the Credit Agreement, with availability to each of the Companies proportionate to availability prior to the increase. Each Company will be severally obligated with respect to loans made to it, and letters of credit issued on its behalf, under the Credit Agreement. None of the Companies is responsible for the obligations under the Credit Agreement of any Company other than itself.
The Companies intend to use the Credit Agreement to support their commercial paper programs. Loans and letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement may also be used for general corporate purposes. See Note D to the financial statements included in Item 8 of the Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005 of Con Edison and Con Edison of New York (Commission File Nos. 1-14514 and 1-1217, respectively). Any borrowings under the Credit Agreement would generally be at variable interest rates. Interest and fees for loans and letters of credit under the Credit Agreement generally reflect the respective credit ratings of the Companies.
The Banks' commitments under the Credit Agreement to make a loan to, or issue a letter of credit on behalf of, a Company terminate on June 22, 2011, unless extended for additional oneyear terms as provided therein, and are subject to certain conditions, including that there be no Event of Default (see below) or event which with notice or the lapse of time would become an event of default with respect to that Company, that the representations and warranties of the Company contained in the Credit Agreement (not including that the Company did not have a material adverse change) be true on and as of the date of such loan or issuance and, in the case of Con Edison of New York and O&R, that the Company shall have received required regulatory approvals.
Upon a change of control of a Company, each Bank may terminate its commitments to that Company under the Credit Agreement and declare the loans, accrued interest and any other amounts owed by that Company under the Credit Agreement immediately due and payable in the manner, with such effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Credit Agreement.
 
If an event of default under the Credit Agreement (an "Event of Default") with respect to a Company occurs and is continuing, the Banks may terminate their commitments to that Company under the Credit Agreement and declare the loans (including accrued interest) under the Credit Agreement to that Company immediately due and payable in the manner, with such effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Credit Agreement.

In determining such amount, such Bank may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.
(d) The "" of a Borrower with respect to any amount payable hereunder is the sum of (i) to the extent such amount is properly allocable to Loans and Letter of Credit outstanding hereunder, the portion of such amount properly allocable to the Loans and Letter of Credit outstanding to such Borrower, and (ii) to the extent such amount is not properly allocable to Loans and Letters of Credit outstanding hereunder, the Appropriate Share shall be the Availability Share of such Borrower.

Dear Sirs:
I am the Vice President  Legal Services of Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc., a New York corporation (the "") and as such am familiar with the legal affairs of the Company. I and other members of the Company's Law Department have represented the Company in connection with the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of June 22, 2006 (the "") among the Company, Consolidated Edison, Inc., Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc., the Banks party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent.

Credit Agreement
In connection with this opinion letter, I have examined an execution copy of the Credit Agreement and originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records and certificates of public officials and have discussed the foregoing documents and such other matters with such personnel of the Law Department and such officials of the Company, as I considered necessary or appropriate to enable me to express the opinions stated in this letter. In such examination, I have assumed the genuineness of all documents submitted to me as originals, and the conformity to the originals of all documents submitted to me as copies.
Based on the foregoing and subject to the other qualifications, assumptions and limitations stated herein, it is my opinion that:
1. The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of New York and has all corporate powers and all material governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals required to carry on its business as now conducted.
 
2. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Credit Agreement and the Notes are within the Company's corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action and require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or official (except (i) the approval of the PSC for borrowings with a maturity of more than one year, which has been obtained for borrowings prior to December 31, 2009 under one or more revolving credit agreements in amounts at any time outstanding of up to $1.5 billion; (ii) the authorization by the FERC of short-term borrowings, which has been obtained for borrowings prior to December 31, 2007 in amounts at any time outstanding of up to $1.5 billion; and (iii) the filing of such reports with the PSC and the FERC as may be required under law), and do not contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision of applicable law or regulation or of the Company's certificate of incorporation or by-laws or of any agreement, judgment, injunction, order, decree or other instrument binding upon the Company or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Company.
3. The Credit Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company and each Note issued thereunder today constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company, in each case enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and general principles of equity.
4. Except as otherwise disclosed in the Company's periodic reports under the Exchange Act, to the best of my knowledge, there is no action, suit or proceeding pending or threatened against or affecting the Company before any court or arbitrator or any governmental body, agency or official, in which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse decision which could materially adversely affect the business, consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, considered as a whole, or which in any manner draws into question the validity of the Credit Agreement or the Notes.
