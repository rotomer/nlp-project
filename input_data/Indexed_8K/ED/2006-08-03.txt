Exhibit 99
 
 
NEW YORK - Consolidated Edison, Inc. (Con Edison) [NYSE: ED] today reported 2006 second quarter earnings of $124 million or $0.50 a share, compared with earnings of $115 million or $0.47 cents a share for the second quarter of 2005.
"We are spending more than $1.8 billion this year to improve our energy delivery systems," said Kevin Burke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "These investments reflect our commitment to our customers and our determination to meet New York's growing demand for energy," he said.
The company's net income for common stock for the first six months of 2006 was $305 million or $1.24 a share compared with $297 million or $1.22 a share for the first six months of 2005.
During a July 2006 heat wave, electric service to a number of customers in Con Edison of New York's Long Island City distribution network in Queens, New York was interrupted. The company now expects its earnings for the year 2006 to be in the range of $2.75 to $3.00 per share. The company's previous forecast of 2006 earnings was in the range of $2.90 to $3.10 per share.
The Companies' results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006, as compared with the 2005 periods, reflect growth in weather-adjusted sales, milder winter and spring weather, the Companies' rate plans (including the electric rate plan that took effect in April 2005) and, for Con Edison, the results of the competitive energy businesses' including net mark-to-market losses. The following table presents the effect on earnings per share and net income for the second quarter and first six months of 2006, as compared to the 2005 periods, resulting from these and other major factors:
 
The earnings per share variations shown above reflect the dilutive effect of a higher weighted average number of common shares outstanding in the 2006 three-month and six-month periods (246 million shares in each period) than in the 2005 three-month and six-month periods (243 million shares in each period).
For the three months ended June 30, 2006, amounts of electricity and steam delivered by Con Edison of New York, after adjusting for variations in weather and billing days in the period, increased by 2.0 percent and 0.3 percent compared with the 2005 period, respectively. Gas deliveries, after adjusting for variations in weather and billing days in the period, decreased 2.2 percent compared with the prior period.
For the first six months of 2006, amounts of electricity delivered by Con Edison of New York, after adjusting for variations in weather and billing days in the period, increased 1.3 percent. Gas and steam deliveries, after adjusting for variations in weather and billing days in the period, decreased 0.4 percent and 1.0 percent, respectively, as compared with the 2005 period.
Refer to the attachments to this press release for the consolidated balance sheets at June 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005 and the consolidated income statements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006 and 2005.
