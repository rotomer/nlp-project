ITEM 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.
The material attached hereto as Exhibit 99, which is incorporated in this Item 7.01 by reference thereto, is furnished pursuant to Regulation FD.
ITEM 8.01. Other Events.
On May 4, 2007, Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. (Con Edison of New York) filed a request with the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC) for an electric rate increase of $1.2 billion effective April 1, 2008. The filing reflects a return on common equity of 11.5 percent and a common equity ratio of 48.7 percent. The filing also includes a proposal for a three-year rate plan, with additional increases of $335 million and $390 million effective April 1, 2009 and 2010, respectively.
The company's current electric rate plan, the 2005 Electric Rate Agreement, is effective through March 31, 2008. For a description of the 2005 Electric Rate Agreement, see "Rate Agreements  Con Edison of New York  Electric" in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8 of the combined Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006 of Consolidated Edison, Inc. and Con Edison of New York (File Nos. 1-14514 and 1-1217), which is incorporated in this Item 8.01 by reference thereto.
Of the requested first year rate increase, $515 million is attributable to provisions of the 2005 Electric Rate Agreement:
 
 
The requested first year rate increase also includes recovery for increased operating costs and new and or expanded operating programs, including environmental remediation programs ($280 million); carrying charges on additional infrastructure investments ($235 million); and an increased return on equity as compared to the 2005 Electric Rate Agreement ($115 million).
The company is requesting that the provisions of the 2005 Electric Rate Agreement under which certain operating costs are reconciled to amounts reflected in rates be continued. The company is also proposing to implement a revenue decoupling mechanism that eliminates the direct relationship between the company's level of delivery revenues and profits. Under the proposed mechanism actual delivery revenues billed to customers, on a weather-normalized basis, would be compared to the forecasted revenues used to establish new rates. Shortfalls would be subject to recovery from customers and over-collections would be deferred for future customer benefit.
