Exhibit 99
 
 
NEW YORK - Consolidated Edison, Inc. (Con Edison) [NYSE: ED] today reported 2007 second quarter earnings of $154 million or $0.58 a share, compared with earnings of $124 million or $0.50 cents a share for the second quarter of 2006.
"Our financial performance in the second quarter reflects continued strength in our local economy, the impact of weather on our business, and overall, is consistent with our expectations for the year," said Kevin Burke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.
The company's net income for common stock for the first six months of 2007 was $410 million or $1.57 a share compared with $305 million or $1.24 a share for the first six months of 2006.
For the year 2007, the company confirms its previous forecast of earnings in the range of $3.05 to $3.25 per share, excluding the net mark-to-market effects of the competitive energy businesses, which are not presently determinable.
Con Edison's results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007, as compared with the 2006 period, reflect sales growth, colder winter and warmer spring weather, the utilities' rate plans (which are designed to recover increases in certain operations and maintenance expenses, depreciation and property taxes, and interest charges), the impact of storms and the results of the competitive energy businesses including net mark-to-market effects. The following table presents the estimated effect on earnings per share and net income for the second quarter and first six months of 2007 as compared to the 2006 periods, resulting from these and other major factors:
 
The earnings per share variations shown above reflect the dilutive effect of a higher weighted average number of common shares outstanding in the 2007 three-month and six-month periods (265 million and 262 million shares, respectively) than in the 2006 three-month and six-month periods (246 million shares in each period).
For the three months ended June 30, 2007, amounts of electricity, gas and steam delivered by Con Edison of New York, after adjusting for variations in weather and billing days in the period (and for gas, net transfers to firm service), increased by 2.1 percent, 6.0 percent and 1.1 percent compared with the 2006 period, respectively. For the three months ended June 30, 2007, amounts of electricity and gas delivered by O&R, after adjusting for variations in weather and billing days in the period, increased 1.8 percent and 0.9 percent compared with the 2006 period, respectively.
 
For the first six months of 2007, amounts of electricity, gas and steam delivered by Con Edison of New York, after adjusting for variations in weather and billing days in the period (and for gas, net transfers to firm service), increased 2.4 percent, 2.6 percent and 0.7 percent compared with the 2006 period, respectively. For the first six months of 2007, amounts of electricity and gas delivered by O&R, after adjusting for variations in weather and billing days in the period, increased 1.3 percent for electricity and decreased 0.1 percent for gas compared with the 2006 period, respectively.
Refer to the company's Second Quarter Form 10-Q, which will be filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission, for the consolidated balance sheets at June 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006 and the consolidated income statements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007 and 2006.
