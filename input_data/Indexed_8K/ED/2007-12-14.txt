If, at any time prior to the Break-up Damages Stop Date (unless the Closing shall have occurred), the Credit Rating of the bank issuing a Break-up L/C falls below the level specified in the Letter of Credit Requirements or such bank repudiates its obligations under, or fails to honor or pay against, a Break-up L/C, the Buyer shall cause to be furnished to Seller a substitute Break-up L/C promptly (and, in any event, within three (3) Business Days) after written notice demanding such substitute Break-up L/C has been given to Buyer.
