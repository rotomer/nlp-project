On June 20, 2008, Consolidated Edison, Inc. (Con Edison) issued $326.3 million aggregate principal amount of 8.71% unsecured notes, due June 30, 2022, in exchange for a like amount of project debt in connection with the purchase by a subsidiary of Consolidated Edison Development, Inc. (Con Edison Development) of a 525 MW generating project in Newington, New Hampshire (the Newington Project). Upon completion of the exchange, the project debt was cancelled. Previously, the Newington Project had been leased by the subsidiary and Con Edison had guaranteed the payment of certain obligations in connection with the Newington Project. See Notes H and P to the financial statements in Item 8 of Con Edison's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007 (File No. 1-14514). As reported in Item 8.01 below, Con Edison Development subsequently completed the sale of its ownership interests in the Newington Project.
The new notes will be, and the project debt had been, included in Con Edison's consolidated balance sheet. The new notes were issued pursuant to the Note Assumption and Exchange Agreement, dated as of June 20, 2008, between Con Edison and the institutional investors listed in Schedule I thereto (the Note Agreement). The description of the new notes in this Item 2.03 is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Note Agreement, a copy of which is included as an exhibit to this report and incorporated in this Item 2.03 by reference thereto.
The new notes, which rank with Con Edison's other unsecured indebtedness, mature, bear interest and are subject to substantially the same terms as the project debt (other than terms relating to the project being leased or security for the debt), including the payment of a make-whole premium in connection with any optional prepayment. If an event of default under the Note Agreement occurs and is continuing, the note holders may declare the unpaid principal amount, together with any accrued and unpaid interest and applicable make-whole premium, forthwith due and payable in the manner, with such effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Note Agreement. Events of default under the Note Agreement include, among others, customary events of default and also the failure by Con Edison (or any permitted successor) to continue to beneficially own and operate, directly or indirectly, at least 51 percent of the electricity distribution business of Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. in New York City; Con Edison's ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated capital exceeding 0.675 to 1; and events of default of other indebtedness of Con Edison or its material subsidiaries having a then outstanding principal balance in excess of $100 million.

On June 23, 2008, Con Edison Development completed the sale of its ownership interests in the Newington Project. The Newington Project sale was the final stage of Con Edison Development's sale of its ownership interests in power generating projects with an aggregate capacity of 1,706 megawatts (MW). The first stage, the sale of Con Edison Development's interests in 1,181 MW of generating projects (Rock Springs, Ocean Peaking Power, CEEMI and Lakewood), was completed in May 2008.

Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability pursuant to Title I or IV of ERISA or the penalty or excise tax provisions of the Code relating to employee benefit plans (as defined in section 3 of ERISA), other than such liabilities as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be Material, and no event, transaction or condition has occurred or exists that could reasonably be expected to result in the incurrence of any such liability by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, or in the imposition of any Lien on any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, in either case pursuant to Title I or IV of ERISA or to such penalty or excise tax provisions or to Section 401(a)(29) or 412 of the Code, other than such liabilities or Liens as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be Material.

(e) The execution and delivery of this Agreement will not involve any transaction that is subject to the prohibitions of section 406 of ERISA or in connection with which a tax could be imposed pursuant to Section 4975(c)(1)(A)-(D) of the Code. The representation by the Company in the first sentence of this Section 3.14(e) is made in reliance upon and subject to the accuracy of the representations of the Noteholders in Section 2.2 of this Agreement as to the sources of the funds used to pay the purchase price of the Hawkeye Notes to be surrendered by them in exchange for the Notes hereunder.
 
Since 2005, neither the Company nor anyone authorized to act on its behalf has offered the Notes or any similar securities for sale or exchange to, or solicited any offer to buy or exchange any of the same from, or otherwise approached or negotiated in respect thereof with, any Person other than the Hawkeye Noteholders. Neither the Company nor anyone authorized to act on its behalf has taken, or will take, any action that would subject the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the issuance or exchange of the Notes to the registration requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act.
 
Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in default, and no waiver of default is currently in effect, in the payment of any principal or interest on any Indebtedness of the Company or such Subsidiary and no event or condition exists with respect to any such Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary that would permit one or more Persons to cause such Indebtedness to become due and payable before its stated maturity, except in each case for any default, event or condition which, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on (i) the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Notes and the Indemnity Letter, (ii) the business, assets, properties, financial condition, operations or prospects of the Company, or (iii) the rights or interests of the Noteholders under this Agreement, the Notes and the Indemnity Letter.
 
(a) Neither the exchange of the Hawkeye Notes for the Notes by the Company hereunder nor its use of the proceeds thereof will violate the Trading with the Enemy Act, as amended, or any of the foreign assets control regulations of the United States Treasury Department (31 CFR, Subtitle B, Chapter V, as amended) or any enabling legislation or executive order relating thereto.
(b) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary (i) is a Person described or designated in the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List of the Office of Foreign Assets Control or in Section 1 of the Anti-Terrorism Order or (ii) engages in any dealings or transactions with any such Person. The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance, in all material respects, with the USA Patriot Act.
(c) No part of the proceeds from the exchange of the Hawkeye Notes for the Notes hereunder will be used, directly or indirectly, for any payments to any governmental official or employee, political party, official of a political party, candidate for political office, or anyone else acting in an official capacity, in order to obtain, retain or direct business or obtain any improper advantage, in violation of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended.
 
The Company has not directly or indirectly, paid or caused to be paid any consideration (as supplemental or additional interest, a fee or otherwise) to any holder of Hawkeye Notes in order to induce such holder to enter into this Agreement, surrender its Hawkeye Notes or give its consent or take any other action in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, nor has the Company agreed to make any such payment.
 
After giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each of the other agreements described in Section 4.4 hereof, no Potential Default or Event of Default with respect to the Company shall have occurred.

Subject to Section 7.2 hereof, payments of principal, Make-Whole Premium, if any, and interest becoming due and payable on the Notes shall be made in New York City at the principal office of Citibank, N.A. The Company may at any time thereafter, by notice to each holder of a Note, change the place of payment of the Notes so long as the place of payment shall be either the principal office of the Company in the United States or the principal office of a bank or trust company in the United States.
 
So long as you or your nominee shall be the holder of any Note, and notwithstanding anything contained in Section 7.1 hereof or in such Note to the contrary, the Company will pay all sums becoming due on such Note for principal or Make-Whole Premium, if any, and interest by the method and at the address specified for such purpose below your name in , or by such other method or at such other address as you shall have from time to time specified to the Company in writing for such purpose, without the presentation or surrender of such Note or the making of any notation thereon, except that upon written request of the Company made concurrently with or reasonably promptly after payment or prepayment in full of any Note, you shall surrender such Note for cancellation, reasonably promptly after any such request, to the Company at its principal executive office or at the place of payment most recently designated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1 hereof. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, any such payment made on any date after noon (local time) on such date shall be deemed made on the next following Business Day. Prior to any sale or other disposition of any Note held by you or your nominee you will, at your election, either endorse thereon the
Schedule I
 
amount of principal paid thereon and the last date to which interest has been paid thereon or surrender such Note to the Company in exchange for a new Note or Notes pursuant to Section 7.4 hereof. The Company will afford the benefits of this Section 7.2 to any Institutional Investor that is the direct or indirect transferee of any Note exchanged by you under this Agreement and that has made the same agreement relating to such Note as you have made in this Section 7.2.
 
The Company shall keep at its principal executive office a register for the registration and registration of transfers of Notes. The name and address of each holder of one or more Notes, each transfer thereof and the name and address of each transferee of one or more Notes shall be registered in such register. Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer, the Person in whose name any Note shall be registered shall be deemed and treated as the owner and holder thereof for all purposes hereof, and the Company shall not be affected by any notice or knowledge to the contrary. The Company shall give to any holder of a Note that is an Institutional Investor promptly upon request therefor, a complete and correct copy of the names and addresses of all registered holders of Notes.
 
Upon surrender of any Note at the principal executive office of the Company for registration of transfer or exchange (and in the case of a surrender for registration of transfer, accompanied by a written instrument of transfer duly executed by the registered holder of such Note or such holder's attorney duly authorized in writing and accompanied by the address for notices of each transferee of such Note or part thereof), the Company shall execute and deliver, at the Company's expense (except as provided below), one or more new Notes (as requested by the holder thereof) in exchange therefor, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unpaid principal amount of the surrendered Note. Each such new Note shall be payable to such Person as such holder may request. Each such new Note shall be dated and bear interest from the date to which interest shall have been paid on the surrendered Note or dated the date of the surrendered Note if no interest shall have been paid thereon. Each such new Note delivered after the first Note Payment Date shall have annexed thereto as Schedule A a revised amortization schedule for the Notes giving effect to the installment payments of principal previously made on the Note surrendered in exchange therefor. The Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any stamp tax or governmental charge imposed in respect of any such transfer of Notes. Notes shall not be transferred in denominations of less than $100,000, provided that if necessary to enable the registration of transfer by a holder of its entire holding of Notes, one Note may be in a denomination of less than $100,000. Any transferee, by acceptance of a Note registered in its name (or the name of its nominee) shall be deemed to have made the representations set forth in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 in respect of such transferee's purchase, and the Source, of such Note.
 
Upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of the ownership of and the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of any Note (which evidence shall be, in the case of an Institutional Investor, notice from such Institutional Investor of such ownership and such loss, theft, destruction or mutilation), and
 
(a) in the case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it (provided that if the holder of such Note is, or is a nominee for, an Institutional Investor or another holder of a Note with a minimum net worth of at least $50,000,000, such Person's own unsecured agreement of indemnity shall be deemed to be satisfactory), or
(b) in the case of mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation thereof,
the Company at its own expense shall execute and deliver, in lieu thereof, a new Note, dated and bearing interest from the date to which interest shall have been previously paid on such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note or dated the date of such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note if no interest shall have been previously paid thereon. Each such new Note delivered after the first Note Payment Date shall have annexed thereto as Schedule A a revised amortization schedule giving effect to the installment payments of principal previously made on such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note.
 
In addition to the payment of the entire unpaid principal amount of the Notes at the final maturity thereof, the Company will make required installment payments on account of the Notes on Note Payment Dates and will make required prepayments in respect of the Notes and may make optional prepayments in respect of the Notes, all as hereinafter provided.
 
On June 30 and December 30 in each year, commencing on June 30, 2008 (each such date being called a "") and continuing thereafter to and including the penultimate Note Payment Date (December 30, 2021), the Company will make installment payments on account of the Notes, each consisting of an installment payment of principal and a payment of accrued interest in the aggregate amount set forth in the amortization schedule for the Notes attached as hereto (as the same may from time to time be revised pursuant to Section 8.3 hereof to give effect to any partial prepayment of the Notes pursuant to Section 8.2). Each such installment payment on account of the Notes shall be applied first to the payment in full of accrued interest on the Notes and any balance shall be applied to the prepayment of principal. In the event any such Note Payment Date is not a Business Day, the installment payment due on such Note Payment Date shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day (with interest being calculated as though the payment were made on the specified Note Payment Date).
Note Payment Date
Schedule 8.1
 
The Company may at any time, upon notice as provided in Section 8.3 hereof, prepay the Notes, in whole or in part (in a minimum principal amount of $10,000,000 and otherwise in multiples of $50,000), at the principal amount being so prepaid, together with interest accrued on such principal amount being prepaid to the date of such prepayment, plus the applicable Make-Whole Premium (if any) for each such Note.
 
Notice of each prepayment of Notes pursuant to Section 8.2 hereof shall be given by the Company not less than 20 nor more than 40 days before the date fixed for such prepayment, by giving to each Noteholder an irrevocable notice of prepayment specifying the date of such prepayment (which shall be a Business Day), stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be prepaid on such date and the principal amount of the Notes to be prepaid on such date held by the Noteholder to whom such notice is sent, the accrued interest applicable to such prepayment and a preliminary calculation of the Make-Whole Premium for the Notes (calculated as of the date of such notice and setting forth in reasonable detail the calculations used in computing such Make-Whole Premium and including a copy of the source of market data used in determining the Reinvestment Yield). In the case of a prepayment pursuant to Section 8.2 hereof, a written calculation of the Make-Whole Premium for the Notes shall be sent to each holder of Notes to be prepaid two Business Days prior to the prepayment date (setting forth as of such date in reasonable detail the calculations used in computing such Make-Whole Premiums and including a copy of the source of market data used in determining the Reinvestment Yield).
Concurrently with each such notice of any partial prepayment of the Notes pursuant to Section 8.2 hereof, the Company will obtain and deliver to each holder of Notes a new amortization schedule with respect to the Notes showing the respective allocations (as between principal and interest) of installment payments for subsequent Note Payment Dates after giving effect to such prepayment, it being understood that such allocation as between principal and interest for Note Payment Dates prior to the final maturity of the Notes may be determined on an optimized basis, without changing the Remaining Average Life (as such term is defined in Section 8.7 hereof) of all payments prior to the final maturity of the Notes.
 
In the case of each prepayment of Notes pursuant to this Section 8 the principal amount of each Note to be prepaid shall mature and become due and payable on the date fixed for such prepayment, together with interest on such principal amount accrued to such date and the applicable Make-Whole Premium, if any. From and after such date, unless the Company shall fail to pay such principal amount when so due and payable, together with the interest and Make-Whole Premium, if any, as aforesaid, interest on such principal amount shall cease to accrue. Any Note paid or prepaid in full shall be surrendered to the Company and canceled and shall not be reissued, and no Note shall be issued in lieu of any prepaid principal amount of any Note.
 
In the case of a partial payment or prepayment of Notes pursuant to Section 8.1 or 8.2 hereof, the principal amount of the Notes to be paid or prepaid, as the case may be, shall be allocated among all Notes at the time outstanding in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the respective unpaid principal amounts thereof not theretofore called for payment or prepayment.
 
The Company will not and will not permit any Affiliate to purchase, redeem, prepay or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, any of the outstanding Notes except upon the payment or prepayment of the Notes in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Notes. The Company will promptly cancel all Notes acquired by it pursuant to any payment, prepayment or purchase of Notes pursuant to any provision of this Agreement and no Notes may be issued in substitution or exchange for any such Notes.
 
The term "" means, with respect to any Note, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Discounted Value of the Remaining Scheduled Payments with respect to the Called Principal of such Note over the amount of such Called Principal, provided that the Make-Whole Premium may in no event be less than zero. For the purposes of determining the Make-Whole Premium, the following terms have the following meanings:
Make-Whole Premium
"" means, with respect to any Note, the principal of the Note that is to be prepaid pursuant to Section 8.2 hereof, or has become or is declared to be immediately due and payable pursuant to Section 11.2 hereof.
Called Principal
"" means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, the amount obtained by discounting all Remaining Scheduled Payments with respect to such Called Principal from their respective scheduled due dates to the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, in accordance with accepted financial practice and at a discount factor (applied on a semiannual basis) equal to the Reinvestment Yield with respect to such Called Principal.
Discounted Value
means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, 0.50% (50 basis points) over the yield to maturity implied by (i) the yields reported as of 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the second Business Day preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, on the display designated as "Page PX1" (or such other display as may replace Page PX1) on Bloomberg Financial Markets for the most recently issued actively traded on the run U.S. Treasury securities having a maturity equal to the Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal as of such Settlement Date, or (ii) if such yields are not reported as of such time or the yields reported as of such time are not ascertainable (including by way of interpolation), the Treasury Constant Maturity Series Yields reported, for the latest day for which such yields have been so reported as of the second Business Day preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, in Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (or any comparable successor publication) for U.S. Treasury securities having a constant maturity equal to the Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal as of such Settlement Date.
"Reinvestment Yield"
In the case of each determination under clause (i) or clause (ii), as the case may be, of the preceding paragraph, such implied yield will be determined, if necessary, by (a) converting U.S. Treasury bill quotations to bond equivalent yields in accordance with accepted financial practice and (b) interpolating linearly between (1) the applicable U.S.
 
Treasury security with the maturity closest to and greater than such Remaining Average Life and (2) the applicable U.S. Treasury security with the maturity closest to and less than such Remaining Average Life. The Reinvestment Yield shall be rounded to the number of decimal places as appears in the interest rate of the applicable Note.
"" means, with respect to any Called Principal, the number of years (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth year) obtained by dividing (i) such Called Principal into (ii) the sum of the products obtained by multiplying (a) the principal component of each Remaining Scheduled Payment with respect to such Called Principal by (b) the number of years (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth year) that will elapse between the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal and the scheduled due date of such Remaining Scheduled Payment.
Remaining Average Life
"" means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, all payments of such Called Principal and interest thereon that would be due after the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal if no payment of such Called Principal were made prior to its scheduled due date, provided that if such Settlement Date is not a date on which interest payments are due to be made under the terms of the Notes, then the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued to such Settlement Date and required to be paid on such Settlement Date pursuant to Section 8.2 or 11.2 hereof.
Remaining Scheduled Payments
"" means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, the date on which such Called Principal is to be prepaid pursuant to Section 8.2 hereof, or has become or is declared to be immediately due and payable pursuant to Section 11.2 hereof.
