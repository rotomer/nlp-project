Exhibit 99
 
 
NEW YORKConsolidated Edison, Inc. (Con Edison) [NYSE: ED] today reported 2008 earnings of $1,196 million or $4.38 a share compared with $929 million or $3.49 a share in 2007. Excluding items identified in the table below, earnings from ongoing operations were $820 million or $3.00 a share compared with $930 million or $3.50 a share in 2007.
For the fourth quarter of 2008, the company's earnings were $160 million or $0.58 a share compared with $207 million or $0.76 a share for the fourth quarter of 2007. Excluding items identified in the table below, earnings from ongoing operations were $200 million or $0.72 a share compared with $191 million or $0.71 a share in the 2007 fourth quarter.
"Our 2008 financial performance reflects the significant capital investments we have made in our infrastructure to meet the growing energy needs of our customers and the successful completion of the sale of our investment in Con Edison Development's generation projects," said Kevin Burke, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "In addition, we are continuing to monitor the economic conditions in our operating areas."
The company also today declared a quarterly dividend of 59 cents a share on its common stock, payable March 15, 2009 to shareholders of record as of February 18, 2009, an annualized increase of 2 cents over the previous annual dividend of $2.34 a share. "The increase in the dividend, the 35th consecutive annual increase, reflects our acknowledgement of those who have invested in our company for the benefit of our customers, while retaining the balance of our earnings to reinvest in our system," said Robert Hoglund, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
 
The following table is a reconciliation of Con Edison's reported earnings per share and reported net income to earnings per share and earnings from ongoing operations for the three months and year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the 2007 periods.
 
For 2009, the company expects to spend $2.6 billion for capital investments, virtually all of which will be spent at the company's regulated utilities. The company also expects to issue common stock of between $300 million and $550 million in addition to stock issuances under the company's dividend reinvestment and employee stock plans. The company also intends to issue long-term debt at its utility subsidiaries of between $1.1 billion and $1.8 billion in addition to debt issuances for maturing securities. After the New York Public Service Commission's ruling in Con Edison of New York's pending electric rate case, which is expected in late March 2009, the company intends to issue its forecast of 2009 earnings.
Results of operations for the year-end periods include the gain on the sale of Con Edison Development's generation projects in 2008, an additional reserve in 2008 related to the Long Island City power outage, the resolution in 2008 of litigation with Northeast Utilities, the resolution in 2007 of a deferred tax amortization petition and the impact of discontinued operations in each of 2008 and 2007. The results of operations for the three months and year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the 2007 period, also reflect changes in the company's rate plans (including lower allowed returns on equity and additional revenues designed to recover increases in certain operations and maintenance expenses, depreciation and property taxes, and interest charges) and the operating results of the competitive energy businesses (including net mark-to-market effects). Operations and maintenance expenses were higher in the three months and year ended December 31, 2008 compared with the 2007 periods reflecting primarily higher costs, which are generally reflected in rates, such as pension and other post-retirement benefits, the support and maintenance of company underground facilities to accommodate municipal projects, the write-off of uncollectible accounts and additional operating programs. Depreciation and property taxes were higher in the three months and year ended December 31, 2008 compared with the 2007 periods reflecting primarily the impact from increased capital expenditures. The following table presents the estimated effect on earnings per share and net income for the fourth quarter and year 2008 compared with the 2007 period, resulting from these and other major factors:
 
 
 
The earnings per share variations shown above include the dilutive effect of a higher weighted average number of common shares outstanding in the three months and year ended December 31, 2008 periods. The weighted average number of common shares was 274 million shares and 273 million shares for the three months and year ended December 31, 2008, compared with 272 million shares and 266 million shares in the 2007 periods, respectively. The dilutive effect on earnings per share for the three months and year ended December 31, 2008 is $0.00 and $0.11, respectively. These amounts per share do not reflect the offsetting benefits of avoided interest expense.
 
 
The changes in the amounts of energy delivered by the company's utility subsidiaries, for actual and as adjusted for variations in weather and billing days, for the three months and year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the 2007 periods were as follows (expressed as a percentage of 2007 amounts):

This press release contains forward-looking statements that reflect expectations and not facts. Actual results may differ materially from those expectations because of factors such as those identified in reports the company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
This press release also contains a financial measure, earnings from ongoing operations. This non-GAAP measure should not be considered as an alternative to net income, which is an indicator of operating performance determined in accordance with GAAP. Management uses this non-GAAP measure to facilitate the analysis of the company's ongoing performance as compared to its internal budgets and previously reported financial results. Management believes that this non-GAAP measure is also useful and meaningful to investors.
