On November 2, 2009, Consolidated Edison, Inc. issued a press release reporting, among other things, its results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2009. The press release is "furnished" as an exhibit to this report pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K.
 
On November 6, 2009, Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. (Con Edison of New York) filed a request with the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC) for a three-year gas rate plan, with level annual rate increases effective October 2010, 2011 and 2012 of $115.5 million per year. The filing reflects a return on common equity of 11.3 percent and a common equity ratio of 48.2 percent. In the alternative, the company requested a net increase in the rates it charges for gas service, effective October 2010, of $160.8 million that would cover the period October 2010 through September 2011. The filing proposes continuation of the current gas rate plan's revenue decoupling mechanism and provisions with respect to recovery from customers of the cost of purchased gas and the reconciliation of actual expenses allocable to the gas business to the amounts for such expenses reflected in gas rates for pension and other postretirement benefit costs, environmental remediation expenses, property taxes and municipal infrastructure support.
On November 6, 2009, Con Edison of New York filed a request with the PSC for a four-year steam rate plan, with level annual rate increases effective October 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 of $66.1 million per year. The filing reflects a return on common equity of 11.4 percent and a common equity ratio of 48.2 percent. In the alternative, the company requested a net increase in the rates it charges for steam service, effective October 2010, of $128.8 million that would cover the period October 2010 through September 2011. The filing proposes implementation of a revenue decoupling mechanism for steam and the continuation of the current steam rate plan's provisions with respect to recovery from customers of the cost of fuel and purchased steam and the reconciliation of actual expenses allocable to the steam business to the amounts for such expenses reflected in steam rates for pension and other postretirement benefit costs, environmental remediation expenses, property taxes and municipal infrastructure support.

Exhibit 99
 
 
NEW YORK - Consolidated Edison, Inc. (Con Edison) [NYSE: ED] today reported third quarter earnings from ongoing operations, which excludes items discussed in the table below, were $319 million or $1.16 a share compared with $269 million or $0.98 a share in 2008. The company's net income for common stock was $336 million or $1.22 a share compared with $182 million or $0.66 a share in 2008.
Excluding items discussed in the table below, earnings from ongoing operations for the first nine months of 2009 were $665 million or $2.43 a share compared with $620 million or $2.27 a share for the first nine months of 2008. The company's net income for common stock was $666 million or $2.43 a share compared with $1,036 million or $3.80 a share for the first nine months of 2008.
"Reliability, energy efficiency, and infrastructure investments remained priorities as the company performed well, and delivered results in line with expectations, during a relatively mild summer," said Kevin Burke, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "The $136 million smart grid stimulus grant, for which the company has been selected by the U.S. Department of Energy, will help promote economic vitality and new employment opportunities, complementing other investments we are already making in our energy delivery systems."
The following table is a reconciliation of Con Edison's reported earnings per share and reported net income for common stock to earnings per share and earnings from ongoing operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008.
 
For the year 2009, the company confirms its previous forecast of earnings per share from ongoing operations in the range of $3.00 to $3.20 a share. Earnings per share from ongoing operations excludes the net mark-to-market effects of the competitive energy businesses.
 
 
The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009, as compared with the 2008 period, also reflect changes in the company's rate plans (including additional revenues designed to recover increases in certain operations and maintenance expenses, depreciation and property taxes, interest charges and the impact of revenue decoupling mechanisms) and the operating results of the competitive energy businesses (including net mark-to-market effects). The results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2009, include a higher allowed electric return on common equity for Con Edison of New York as compared with the 2008 period reflecting increased capital costs. The results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 as compared with the 2008 period include a higher allowed return for the second and third quarters of 2009, offset in part by a lower allowed electric return on equity for Con Edison of New York for the first quarter of 2009. Operations and maintenance expenses were higher in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 compared with the 2008 period reflecting primarily higher costs, which are generally reflected in rates, such as pension and other post-retirement benefits and uncollectible accounts that were offset in part by austerity initiatives reflecting the general economic downturn. Depreciation and property taxes were higher in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 compared with the 2008 period reflecting primarily the impact from increased capital expenditures and higher property tax rates. Results of operations for the nine months ended September 2008 include the gain on the sale of generation projects, the impact of discontinued operations and resolution of litigation with Northeast Utilities. The following table presents the estimated effect on earnings per share and net income for common stock for the 2009 period compared with the 2008 period, resulting from these and other major factors:
 
 
 
The changes in the amounts of energy delivered by the company's utility subsidiaries, for actual and as adjusted for variations in weather and billing days, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009, as compared with the 2008 period were as follows (expressed as a percentage of 2008 amounts):
 
Refer to the company's Third Quarter Form 10-Q, which will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, for the consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008 and the consolidated income statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008.

This press release contains forward-looking statements that reflect expectations and not facts. Actual results may differ materially from those expectations because of factors such as those identified in reports the company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
This press release also contains a financial measure, earnings from ongoing operations. This non-GAAP measure should not be considered as an alternative to net income for common stock, which is an indicator of operating performance determined in accordance with GAAP. Management uses this non-GAAP measure to facilitate the analysis of the company's ongoing performance as compared to its internal budgets and previously reported financial results. Management believes that this non-GAAP measure is also useful and meaningful to investors.
