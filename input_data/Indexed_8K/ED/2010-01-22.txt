Exhibit 99
 
 
NEW YORK - Consolidated Edison, Inc. (Con Edison) [NYSE: ED] today reported 2009 net income for common stock of $868 million or $3.16 a share compared with $1,196 million or $4.38 a share in 2008. Excluding items identified in the table below, earnings from ongoing operations were $849 million or $3.09 a share compared with $820 million or $3.00 a share in 2008.
For the fourth quarter of 2009, the company's net income for common stock was $202 million or $0.73 a share compared with $160 million or $0.58 a share in the 2008 fourth quarter. Excluding items discussed in the table below, earnings from ongoing operations for the fourth quarter of 2009 were $184 million or $0.67 a share compared with $200 million or $0.72 a share for the fourth quarter of 2008.
"Our 2009 financial performance, in a difficult economic environment, reflects the capital investments we have made in our energy infrastructure to meet the expectations of our customers for safe and reliable service," said Kevin Burke, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our innovative smart grid pilot project in Long Island City will demonstrate new ways that these emerging technologies can help provide a more flexible, cost-effective, and reliable energy future for our service areas."
The company also today declared a quarterly dividend of 59 1/2 cents a share on its common stock, payable March 15, 2010 to shareholders of record as of February 17, 2010, an annualized increase of 2 cents over the previous annualized dividend of $2.36 a share. "The increase in the dividend, the 36th consecutive annual increase, both acknowledges those who have invested in our company and encourages new investors to provide the capital we require to meet the needs of our customers," said Robert Hoglund, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
 
The following table is a reconciliation of Con Edison's reported earnings per share to earnings per share from ongoing operations and reported net income to earnings from ongoing operations for the three months and year ended December 31, 2009, as compared with the 2008 periods.
 
The company expects its earnings from ongoing operations for 2010 to be in the range of $3.10 to $3.30 a share. Earnings per share from ongoing operations excludes the net mark-to-market effects of the competitive energy businesses. The forecast reflects capital investments of $2,300 million, substantially all of which will be spent at the company's regulated utilities. The company also expects to issue common stock of between $300 million and $500 million in addition to stock issuances under the company's dividend reinvestment and employee stock plans, and long-term debt issuances of between $600 million and $900 million in addition to debt issuances for $680 million of maturing securities.
The results of operations for the three months and year ended December 31, 2009, as compared with the 2008 period, reflect changes in the company's rate plans (including additional revenues designed to recover increases in certain operations and maintenance expenses, depreciation and property taxes, interest charges and the impact of revenue decoupling mechanisms), a regulatory reserve in December 2009 relating to the New York State Public Service Commission's review of capital spent during the period April 2005 through March 2008, and the operating results of the competitive energy businesses (including net mark-to-market effects). The results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2009, include a higher allowed electric return on common equity for Con Edison of New York as compared with the 2008 period reflecting increased capital costs. The results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared with the 2008 period include a higher allowed return for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2009, offset in part by a lower allowed electric return on common equity for Con Edison of New York for the first quarter of 2009. Operations and maintenance expenses were higher in the three months and year ended December 31, 2009 compared with the 2008 period reflecting primarily higher costs, which are generally reflected in rates, such as pension and other post-retirement benefits and uncollectible accounts that were offset in part by austerity initiatives reflecting the general economic downturn. Depreciation and property taxes were higher in the three months and year ended December 31, 2009 compared with the 2008 period reflecting primarily the impact from increased capital expenditures and higher property tax rates. Results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 include the gain on the sale of generation projects, the impact of discontinued operations and resolution of litigation with Northeast Utilities. The following table presents the estimated effect on earnings per share and net income for common stock for the 2009 period compared with the 2008 period, resulting from these and other major factors:
 
 
 
The earnings per share variations shown above include the dilutive effect of a higher weighted average number of common shares outstanding in the three months and year ended December 31, 2009 periods. The weighted average number of common shares was 277 million shares and 275 million shares for the three months and year ended December 31, 2009, compared with 274 million shares and 273 million shares for the respective 2008 periods. The dilutive effect on earnings per share for year ended December 31, 2009 is $0.02. There is no dilutive effect on earnings per share for the three months ended December 31, 2009. These amounts per share do not reflect the offsetting benefits of avoided interest expense.
 
 
The changes in the amounts of energy delivered by the company's utility subsidiaries, for actual and as adjusted for variations in weather and billing days, for the three months and year ended December 31, 2009, as compared with the 2008 periods were as follows (expressed as a percentage of 2008 amounts):

This press release contains forward-looking statements that reflect expectations and not facts. Actual results may differ materially from those expectations because of factors such as those identified in reports the company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
This press release also contains a financial measure, earnings from ongoing operations. This non-GAAP measure should not be considered as an alternative to net income, which is an indicator of operating performance determined in accordance with GAAP. Management uses this non-GAAP measure to facilitate the analysis of the company's ongoing performance as compared to its internal budgets and previously reported financial results. Management believes that this non-GAAP measure is also useful and meaningful to investors.
