Exhibit 99
 
 
NEW YORK - Consolidated Edison, Inc. (Con Edison) [NYSE: ED] today reported net income for common stock for the second quarter of 2010 of $183 million or $0.65 a share compared with $150 million or $0.55 a share in 2009. Earnings from ongoing operations, which exclude the net mark-to-market effects of the competitive energy businesses, were $144 million or $0.51 a share in the second quarter of 2010 compared with $131 million or $0.48 a share in 2009.
For the first six months of 2010, net income for common stock was $409 million or $1.45 a share compared with $330 million or $1.20 a share in the first six months of 2009. Earnings from ongoing operations, which exclude the net mark-to-market effects of the competitive energy businesses, were $408 million or $1.45 a share in 2010 compared with $346 million or $1.26 a share in 2009.
"We continue to focus on providing safe and reliable energy service to our customers," said Kevin Burke, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Second quarter results reflect cost control at our utilities as well as stronger than forecasted performance at our competitive energy businesses."
The following table is a reconciliation of Con Edison's reported earnings per share to earnings per share from ongoing operations and reported net income to earnings from ongoing operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 and 2009.
 
 
The company now expects its earnings for the year 2010 to be in the range of $3.25 to $3.45 per share. The company's previous forecast of 2010 earnings was in the range of $3.10 to $3.30 per share. The higher range reflects, among other things, stronger than forecasted financial performance at Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. (CECONY), reflecting primarily savings in certain operating expenses through cost control efforts and stronger than forecasted financial performance at the competitive energy businesses. Earnings per share from ongoing operations exclude the net mark-to-market effects of the competitive energy businesses.
The results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, as compared with the 2009 period, reflect changes in the rate plans of Con Edison's utility subsidiaries, including an increase in the allowed electric return on common equity for CECONY. The rate plans provide for additional revenues to cover expected increases in certain operations and maintenance expenses, depreciation and property taxes and interest charges. The results of operations include the operating results of the competitive energy businesses, including net mark-to-market effects.
The increases in operations and maintenance expenses reflect higher costs for pension and other post-retirement benefits, demand side management programs and regulatory assessments in the 2010 period, offset in part by savings in certain operating expenses through cost control efforts. Depreciation and property taxes were higher in the 2010 period reflecting primarily the impact from higher utility plant balances. Interest charges were higher for the six months ended June 30, 2010 period reflecting increased outstanding long-term debt.
 
The following table presents the estimated effect on earnings per share and net income for common stock for the 2010 period compared with the 2009 period, resulting from these and other major factors:
 
 
The earnings per share variations shown above include the dilutive effects ($0.01 per share and $0.04 per share, respectively, exclusive of offsetting benefits of avoided interest expense) of a higher weighted average number of common shares outstanding in the three and six months ended June 30, 2010. The weighted average number of common shares was 281 million shares and 274 million shares for the three months ended June 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and 282 million share and 274 million shares for the six months ended June 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
 
The changes in the energy delivered by the company's utility subsidiaries, both for actual amounts and as adjusted for variations in weather and billing days, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, as compared with the 2009 period were as follows (expressed as a percentage of 2009 amounts):
 
Refer to the company's Second Quarter Form 10-Q, which is being filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, for the consolidated balance sheets at June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009 and the consolidated income statements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 and 2009.

This press release contains forward-looking statements that reflect expectations and not facts. Actual results may differ materially from those expectations because of factors such as those identified in reports the company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
This press release also contains a financial measure, earnings from ongoing operations. This non-GAAP measure should not be considered as an alternative to net income, which is an indicator of operating performance determined in accordance with GAAP. Management uses this non-GAAP measure to facilitate the analysis of the company's ongoing performance as compared to its internal budgets and previously reported financial results. Management believes that this non-GAAP measure is also useful and meaningful to investors.
