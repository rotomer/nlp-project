Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. (CECONY), a subsidiary of Consolidated Edison, Inc. (together with CECONY, the Companies), has commenced an internal investigation relating to the August 5, 2010 arrest of a retired employee for participating in a bribery scheme in which the employee received payments from a bidder that was selected to supply materials to the company. CECONY has provided information to governmental authorities in connection with their ongoing investigation of this conspiracy to defraud the company. Because the company's investigation is in its early stages, the company is unable to predict the impact of any unlawful conduct on the company's internal controls, business, results of operations or financial position. For information about the January 2009 arrests of certain other employees, including an ongoing New York State Public Service Commission proceeding, see "Other Regulatory Matters" in Note B and "Investigation of Contractor Payments" in Note H to the financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of the Companies' Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2010 (File Nos. 1-14514 and 1-1217).
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
