Exhibit 99
 
 
NEW YORK - Consolidated Edison, Inc. (Con Edison) [NYSE: ED] today reported net income for common stock for the second quarter of $165 million or $0.57 a share compared with $183 million or $0.65 a share in 2010. Earnings from ongoing operations, which exclude the net mark-to-market effects of the competitive energy businesses, were $166 million or $0.57 a share in the second quarter of 2011 compared with $144 million or $0.51 a share in 2010.
For the first six months of 2011, net income for common stock was $477 million or $1.63 a share compared with $409 million or $1.45 a share in the first six months of 2010. Earnings from ongoing operations, which exclude the net mark-to-market effects of the competitive energy businesses, were $456 million or $1.56 a share in 2011 compared with $408 million or $1.45 a share in 2010.
"We continued to meet financial expectations in the second quarter, while our 14,000 employees worked hard to prepare our delivery systems for the summer. Their preparation and dedication responding to scattered outages during record-breaking heat in July kept the power flowing reliably to most of our 3.2 million customers," said Kevin Burke, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Con Edison's energy efficiency programs continue to help customers lower their bills, reduce peak demand, defer additional capital investments and improve the environment. Cost management strategies also are working to keep our operations efficient and our company strong and sustainable."
The following table is a reconciliation of Con Edison's reported earnings per share to earnings per share from ongoing operations and reported net income to earnings from ongoing operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010.
 
For the year 2011, the company reaffirms its previous forecast of earnings per share from ongoing operations in the range of $3.45 to $3.65 a share. Earnings per share from ongoing operations exclude the net mark-to-market effects of the competitive energy businesses.
 
The results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011, as compared with the 2010 period, reflect changes in the rate plans of Con Edison's utility subsidiaries. The rate plans provide for additional revenues to cover expected increases in certain operations and maintenance expenses, and depreciation and property taxes. The results of operations include the operating results of the competitive energy businesses, including net mark-to-market effects.
Operations and maintenance expenses were higher for the periods reflecting higher costs for pension and other postretirement benefits and employee health insurance, offset in part by savings from cost control efforts in the 2011 period. Depreciation and property taxes were higher in the 2011 periods reflecting primarily higher utility plant balances.
The following table presents the estimated effect on earnings per share and net income for common stock for the 2011 period compared with the 2010 period, resulting from these and other major factors:
 
 
The earnings per share variations shown above include the dilutive effect ($0.02 per share and $0.06 per share, respectively, exclusive of offsetting benefits of avoided interest expense) of a higher weighted average number of common shares outstanding in the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 period. The weighted average number of common shares was 293 million shares and 281 million shares for the three months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and 292 million shares and 282 million shares for the six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
 
The changes in the energy delivered by the company's utility subsidiaries, both for actual amounts and as adjusted for variations in weather and billing days, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011, as compared with the 2010 period were as follows (expressed as a percentage of 2010 amounts):

This press release contains forward-looking statements that reflect expectations and not facts. Actual results may differ materially from those expectations because of factors such as those identified in reports the company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
This press release also contains a financial measure, earnings from ongoing operations. This non-GAAP measure should not be considered as an alternative to net income, which is an indicator of operating performance determined in accordance with GAAP. Management uses this non-GAAP measure to facilitate the analysis of the company's ongoing performance as compared to its internal budgets and previously reported financial results. Management believes that this non-GAAP measure is also useful and meaningful to investors.
