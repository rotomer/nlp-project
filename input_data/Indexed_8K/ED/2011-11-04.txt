Exhibit 99
 
 
NEW YORK - Consolidated Edison, Inc. (Con Edison) [NYSE: ED] today reported net income for common stock for the third quarter of $383 million or $1.31 a share compared with $350 million or $1.24 a share in 2010. Earnings from ongoing operations, which exclude the net mark-to-market effects of the competitive energy businesses, were $390 million or $1.33 a share in the third quarter of 2011 compared with $372 million or $1.32 a share in 2010.
For the first nine months of 2011, net income for common stock was $860 million or $2.94 a share compared with $759 million or $2.69 a share in the first nine months of 2010. Earnings from ongoing operations, which exclude the net mark-to-market effects of the competitive energy businesses, were $846 million or $2.89 a share in 2011 compared with $780 million or $2.77 a share in 2010.
"Con Edison's utility and competitive energy businesses are continuing to perform well," said Chairman, President and CEO Kevin Burke. "Our employees did a great job meeting the challenges of this summer, keeping the power flowing through record-breaking heat, and responding well to Hurricane Irene. Meanwhile, energy efficiency programs have helped customers lower their bills and improve the environment, and effective cost management strategies are keeping our operations efficient."
The following table is a reconciliation of Con Edison's reported earnings per share to earnings per share from ongoing operations and reported net income to earnings from ongoing operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010.
 
The company expects its earnings from ongoing operations for the year 2011 to be in the range of $3.55 to $3.65 per share. The company's previous forecast of 2011 earnings was in the range of $3.45 to $3.65 a share. Earnings per share from ongoing operations exclude the net mark-to-market effects of the competitive energy businesses. In addition, the company does not expect to issue any long-term debt to fund its capital requirements for the remainder of 2011 due to tax benefits and refunds received from accelerated deductions for income tax purposes of certain expenditures which resulted in more cash flows from operating activities.
 
 
The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, as compared with the 2010 period, reflect changes in the rate plans of Con Edison's utility subsidiaries. The rate plans provide for additional revenues to cover expected increases in certain operations and maintenance expenses, and depreciation and property taxes. The results of operations include the operating results of the competitive energy businesses, including net mark-to-market effects.
Operations and maintenance expenses were higher for the 2011 periods reflecting higher costs for pension and other postretirement benefits and employee health insurance, offset in part by savings from cost control efforts in the 2011 periods. Depreciation and property taxes were higher in the 2011 periods reflecting primarily higher utility plant balances.
The following table presents the estimated effect on earnings per share and net income for common stock for the 2011 period compared with the 2010 period, resulting from these and other major factors:
 
 
The earnings per share variations shown above include the dilutive effect ($0.04 per share and $0.10 per share, respectively, exclusive of offsetting benefits of avoided interest expense) of a higher weighted average number of common shares outstanding in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011 period. The weighted average number of common shares was 293 million shares and 283 million shares for the three months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and 293 million shares and 282 million shares for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
 
 
The changes in the energy delivered by the company's utility subsidiaries, both for actual amounts and as adjusted for variations in weather and billing days, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, as compared with the 2010 period were as follows (expressed as a percentage of 2010 amounts):
 
Refer to the company's Third Quarter Form 10-Q, which is being filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, for the consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010 and the consolidated income statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010.

This press release contains forward-looking statements that reflect expectations and not facts. Actual results may differ materially from those expectations because of factors such as those identified in reports the company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
This press release also contains a financial measure, earnings from ongoing operations. This non-GAAP measure should not be considered as an alternative to net income, which is an indicator of operating performance determined in accordance with GAAP. Management uses this non-GAAP measure to facilitate the analysis of the company's ongoing performance as compared to its internal budgets and previously reported financial results. Management believes that this non-GAAP measure is also useful and meaningful to investors.
