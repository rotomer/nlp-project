Exhibit 99
 
 
NEW YORK - Consolidated Edison, Inc. (Con Edison) [NYSE: ED] today reported second quarter earnings of $214 million or $0.73 a share compared with $165 million or $0.57 a share in 2011. Earnings from ongoing operations, which exclude the net mark-to-market effects of the competitive energy businesses, were $178 million or $0.61 a share compared with $166 million or $0.57 a share in 2011.
For the first six months of 2012, net income for common stock was $491 million or $1.68 a share compared with $477 million or $1.63 a share in the first six months of 2011. Earnings from ongoing operations, which exclude the net mark-to-market effects of the competitive energy businesses, were $473 million or $1.62 a share in 2012 compared with $456 million or $1.56 a share in 2011.
"The financial strength of the Company allows us to continue to invest in our infrastructure to provide safe and reliable energy service to our customers. Our energy infrastructure is necessary for economic development and job growth in New York," said Con Edison's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Kevin Burke. "Our field operations benefited from a milder than normal winter to prepare our delivery systems for the summer, while providing the reliability our customers expect and deserve. We have continued to promote energy efficiency programs and oil-to-gas conversions, both of which will serve to save customers money while improving the area's air quality and environment."
The following table is a reconciliation of Con Edison's reported earnings per share to earnings per share from ongoing operations and reported net income to earnings from ongoing operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011.
 
For the year 2012, the company reaffirms its previous forecast of earnings per share from ongoing operations in the range of $3.65 to $3.85 a share. Earnings per share from ongoing operations exclude the net mark-to-market effects of the competitive energy businesses.
 
 
The results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, as compared with the 2011 periods, reflect changes in the rate plans of Con Edison's utility subsidiaries and the effects of the milder winter weather on steam revenues. The rate plans provide for additional revenues to cover expected increases in certain operations and maintenance expenses, and depreciation. The results of operations include the operating results of the competitive energy businesses, including net mark-to-market effects.
Operations and maintenance expenses were higher in the 2012 periods due to pension costs and the support and maintenance of company underground facilities to accommodate municipal projects and, in the six month period were offset in part, by lower operating costs attributable to the milder winter weather. Depreciation was higher in the 2012 periods reflecting the impact from higher utility plant balances.
The following table presents the estimated effect on earnings per share and net income for common stock for the 2012 period compared with the 2011 period, resulting from these and other major factors:
 
 
The weighted average number of common shares was 293 million shares for the three months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 and 293 million shares and 292 million shares for the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
 
 
The changes in the energy delivered by the company's utility subsidiaries, both for actual amounts and as adjusted primarily for variations in weather and billing days, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, as compared with the 2011 period were as follows (expressed as a percentage of 2011 amounts):
 
Refer to the company's Second Quarter Form 10-Q, which is being filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, for the consolidated balance sheets at June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011 and the consolidated income statements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011.

This press release contains forward-looking statements that reflect expectations and not facts. Actual results may differ materially from those expectations because of factors such as those identified in reports the company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
This press release also contains a financial measure, earnings from ongoing operations. This non-GAAP measure should not be considered as an alternative to net income, which is an indicator of operating performance determined in accordance with GAAP. Management uses this non-GAAP measure to facilitate the analysis of the company's ongoing performance as compared to its internal budgets and previously reported financial results. Management believes that this non-GAAP measure is also useful and meaningful to investors.
