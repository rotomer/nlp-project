Item 1.01  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
closing of a trade receivables securitization transaction.  Under the revolving credit facility provided as part of the transaction, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Equifax, Equifax Receivables Finance LLC (ERF), may borrow, subject to certain terms and conditions, up to the lesser of a calculated funding base or $125 million. ERF has granted the lender a security interest in domestic trade receivables that it will purchase from time to time from its parent company, Equifax Capital Management, Inc., a subsidiary of Equifax (ECM), as part of the credit facility, together with certain related rights and proceeds thereof. The credit facility will be revolving in nature and all or a portion of collections of receivables purchased by ERF under the credit facility will be applied to repay outstanding borrowings and other amounts under the credit facility.  Net proceeds of borrowings by ERF under the credit facility may be used to pay a portion of the purchase price for trade receivables and related rights purchased by ERF from ECM from time to time, to pay ERFs operating expenses and, subject to certain restrictions, to make certain advances and distributions.  Equifax will use the resulting net proceeds of the purchase price received by it from the sale of trade receivables under the securitization transaction for general corporate purposes.  As of September 8, 2004, there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility.
(a) On September 8, 2004, Equifax Inc. (Equifax) announced the
       
The facility will be funded on a non-committed basis by Blue Ridge Funding Corporation (Blue Ridge), a multi-seller commercial paper conduit, and on a back-up basis by Wachovia Bank, National Association and certain other Liquidity Lenders from time to time.  Wachovia Bank, National Association also acts as the Agent for Blue Ridge and the other lenders under the credit facility.  The credit facility has an expiration date of September 6, 2005, but such facility may upon request by ERF be extended for an additional period of up to three years provided that certain specified conditions are satisfied. Loans will bear interest based on prevailing commercial paper rates, LIBOR or base rates plus a specified margin or costs. ECM provides for the servicing of the receivables.  The credit facility may be terminated and the maturity date of amounts owing thereunder accelerated if ERF does not maintain a required minimum receivables balance, if certain ratios related to the collectibility of the receivables are not maintained, if there is a breach of certain representations, warranties or covenants, or under certain other specified circumstances. Equifax has guaranteed the performance of ECM as Servicer of the trade receivables.  Outstanding debt under the ERF credit facility will be consolidated on Equifaxs balance sheet for financial reporting purposes.
Filed herewith as Exhibits 10.1 through 10.4 are the principal agreements entered into by Equifax in connection with the trade receivables financing transaction.  A copy of the press release dated September 8, 2004 relating to the trade receivables transaction is attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01.

CREDIT AND SECURITY AGREEMENT THIS CREDIT AND SECURITY AGREEMENT, dated as of September 7, 2004 is entered into by and among: (a) Equifax Receivables Finance LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("BORROWER"), (b) Equifax Capital Management, Inc., a Georgia corporation ("ECM"), as initial Servicer (the Servicer together with Borrower, the "LOAN PARTIES" and each, a "LOAN PARTY"), (c) The entities listed on Schedule A to this Agreement (together with any of their respective successors and assigns hereunder, the "LIQUIDITY BANKS"), (d) Blue Ridge Asset Funding Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("BLUE RIDGE"), and (e) Wachovia Bank, National Association, as agent for the Lenders hereunder or any successor agent hereunder (together with its successors and assigns hereunder, the "AGENT"). UNLESS DEFINED ELSEWHERE HEREIN, CAPITALIZED TERMS USED IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL HAVE THE MEANINGS ASSIGNED TO SUCH TERMS IN EXHIBIT I. PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS Borrower desires to borrow from the Lenders from time to time. Blue Ridge may, in its absolute and sole discretion, make Advances to the Borrower from time to time. In the event that Blue Ridge declines to make any Advance, the Liquidity Banks shall, at the request of Borrower, make Advances from time to time. Wachovia Bank, National Association has been requested and is willing to act as Agent on behalf of Blue Ridge and the Liquidity Banks in accordance with the terms hereof. ARTICLE I. THE ADVANCES Section 1.1 CREDIT FACILITY. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, from time to time prior to the Facility Termination Date:
(i) Borrower may, at its option, request Advances from the Lenders in an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding not to exceed the lesser of the Aggregate Commitment and the Borrowing Base (such lesser amount, the "BORROWING LIMIT"); and (ii) Blue Ridge may, at its option, make the requested Advance, or if Blue Ridge shall decline to make any Advance, except as otherwise provided in Section 1.2, the Liquidity Banks severally agree to make Loans in an aggregate principal amount equal to the requested Advance. Each of the Advances, and all other Obligations, shall be secured by the Collateral as provided in Article XIII. It is the intent of Blue Ridge to fund all Advances by the issuance of Commercial Paper. (b) Borrower may, upon at least 5 Business Days' written notice to the Agent, terminate in whole or reduce in part, ratably among the Liquidity Banks, the unused portion of the Aggregate Commitment; PROVIDED THAT each partial reduction of the Aggregate Commitment shall be in an amount equal to $5,000,000 (or a larger integral multiple of $1,000,000 if in excess thereof) and shall reduce the Commitments of the Liquidity Banks ratably in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares. Section 1.2 INCREASES. Borrower shall provide the Agent with at least two (2) Business Days' prior notice in a form set forth as Exhibit II-A hereto of each Advance (each, a "BORROWING NOTICE"). Each Borrowing Notice shall be subject to Section 6.2 hereof and, except as set forth below, shall be irrevocable and shall specify the requested increase in Aggregate Principal (which shall not be less than $1,000,000 or a larger integral multiple of $100,000) and the Borrowing Date and, in the case of an Advance to be funded by the Liquidity Banks, the requested Interest Rate and Interest Period. Following receipt of a Borrowing Notice, the Agent will determine whether Blue Ridge agrees to make the requested Advance. If Blue Ridge declines to make a proposed Advance, Borrower may cancel the Borrowing Notice or, in the absence of such a cancellation, the Advance will be made by the Liquidity Banks. On the date of each Advance, upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Article VI, Blue Ridge or the Liquidity Banks, as applicable, shall authorize the release of a wire transfer, in immediately available funds to be deposited into the Facility Account, by 3:00 p.m. (New York time), an amount equal to (i) in the case of Blue Ridge, the principal amount of the requested Advance or (ii) in the case of a Liquidity Bank, such Liquidity Bank's Pro Rata Share of the principal amount of the requested Advance. Section 1.3. DECREASES. Except as provided in Section 1.4, Borrower shall provide the Agent with prior written irrevocable notice in conformity with the Required Notice Period in the form set forth as Exhibit II-B hereto (a "REDUCTION NOTICE") of any proposed reduction of Aggregate Principal. Such Reduction Notice shall designate (i) the date (the "PROPOSED REDUCTION DATE") upon which any such reduction of Aggregate Principal shall occur (which date shall give effect to the applicable Required Notice Period), and (ii) the amount of Aggregate Principal to be reduced which shall be applied ratably to the Loans of Blue Ridge and the Liquidity Banks in accordance with the amount of principal (if any) owing to Blue Ridge, on the one hand, and the amount of principal (if any) owing to the Liquidity Banks (ratably, based on
their respective Pro Rata Shares), on the other hand (the "AGGREGATE REDUCTION"). Only one (1) Reduction Notice shall be outstanding at any time. Section 1.4 DEEMED COLLECTIONS; BORROWING LIMIT. If as of the last day of any Settlement Period: (a) the aggregate Outstanding Balance of the Receivables as reflected in the preceding Monthly Report (net of any positive adjustments) has been reduced or cancelled for any of the following reasons: (i) as a result of any rejected, defective or returned services or merchandise, any cash discount or any other adjustment by the Borrower, the applicable Originator or any Affiliate thereof (regardless of whether the same is treated by such Originator or Affiliate as a write-off), or as a result of any surcharge or other governmental or regulatory action, or (ii) as a result of any setoff or breach of the underlying agreement in respect of any claim by the Obligor thereof against the Borrower, the applicable Originator or any Affiliate thereof (whether such claim arises out of the same or a related or an unrelated transaction), or (iii) on account of the obligation of the Borrower, the applicable Originator or any Affiliate thereof to pay to the related Obligor any rebate or refund, or (iv) the Outstanding Balance of any Receivable is less than the amount included in calculating the Net Pool Balance for purposes of any Monthly Report (for any reason other than such Receivable becoming a Defaulted Receivable), or (v) any of the representations or warranties of the Borrower set forth in Section 5.1(i), (j), (r), (s), (t) or (u) were not true when made with respect to any Receivable. then, in such event, the Borrower shall be deemed to have received a Collection in an amount equal to (A) the amount of such reduction, cancellation or overstatement, in the case of the preceding clauses (a)(i), (a)(ii), (a)(iii) and (a)(iv) or the difference between the actual Outstanding Balance and the amount included in respect of such Receivable in calculating the Net Pool Balance, as applicable, and (B) in the full amount of the Outstanding Balance of such Receivable in the case of the preceding clause (b). (b) Borrower shall ensure that the Aggregate Principal at no time exceeds the Borrowing Limit. If at any time the Aggregate Principal exceeds the Borrowing Limit, Borrower shall pay to the Agent not later than the next succeeding Settlement Date an amount to be applied to reduce the Aggregate Principal (as allocated by the Agent), such that after giving effect to such payment the Aggregate Principal is less than or equal to the Borrowing Limit. 3
Section 1.5 PAYMENT REQUIREMENTS. All amounts to be paid or deposited by any Loan Party pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be paid or deposited in accordance with the terms hereof no later than 1:00 p.m. (New York time) on the day when due in immediately available funds, and if not received before 1:00 p.m. (New York time) shall be deemed to be received on the next succeeding Business Day. If such amounts are payable to a Lender they shall be paid to the Agent's Account, for the account of such Lender, until otherwise notified by the Agent. Upon notice to Borrower, the Agent may debit the Facility Account for all amounts due and payable hereunder. All computations of CP Costs, Interest, PER ANNUM fees calculated as part of any CP Costs, PER ANNUM fees hereunder and PER ANNUM fees under the Fee Letter shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of days elapsed. If any amount hereunder shall be payable on a day which is not a Business Day, such amount shall be payable on the next succeeding Business Day. Section 1.6 RATABLE LOANS; FUNDING MECHANICS; LIQUIDITY FUNDINGS. (a) Each Advance hereunder shall consist of one or more Loans made by Blue Ridge and/or the Liquidity Banks. (b) Each Lender funding any Loan shall wire transfer the principal amount of its Loan to the Agent in immediately available funds not later than 12:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the applicable Borrowing Date and, subject to its receipt of such Loan proceeds, the Agent shall authorize the release of a wire transfer, in immediately available funds to the account specified by the Borrower in its Borrowing Request by 3:00 p.m. (New York City time) on such Borrowing Date. (c) While it is the intent of Blue Ridge to fund each requested Advance through the issuance of its Commercial Paper, the parties acknowledge that if Blue Ridge is unable, or determines in good faith that it is undesirable, to issue Commercial Paper to fund all or any portion of its Loans, or is unable to repay such Commercial Paper upon the maturity thereof, Blue Ridge may put all or any portion of its Loans to the Liquidity Banks at any time pursuant to the Liquidity Agreement to finance or refinance the necessary portion of its Loans through a Liquidity Funding to the extent available. The Liquidity Fundings may be Alternate Base Rate Loans or LIBO Rate Loans, or a combination thereof, selected by the Borrower in accordance with Article IV, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that each Liquidity Funding shall be an Alternate Base Rate Loan at least for the first two (2) Business Days after it is funded. Regardless of whether a Liquidity Funding constitutes the direct funding of a Loan, an assignment of a Loan made by Blue Ridge or the sale of one or more participations in a Loan made by Blue Ridge, each Liquidity Bank participating in a Liquidity Funding shall have the rights of a "Lender" hereunder with the same force and effect as if it had directly made a Loan to the Borrower in the amount of its Liquidity Funding. (d) Nothing herein shall be deemed to commit Blue Ridge to make Loans. Section 1.7. EXTENSION OF THE LIQUIDITY TERMINATION DATE. Borrower may request that the Liquidity Banks extend the Liquidity Termination Date for a period of three (3) years from the most recent to occur of the date hereof or the then-existing Liquidity Termination Date. Approval of such request shall be subject to final internal credit approval of the Liquidity Banks; 4
however, such approval shall otherwise be deemed to have been granted, if (1) EIS or the Parent receives a notice from CSC that CSC will exercise the CSC Put, or the Parent, EIS and CSC shall have entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which CSC's credit reporting operations shall be purchased by the Parent, EIS or one of their Affiliates and (2) no Amortization Event exists and all other terms and conditions of the Transaction Documents have been met at the time of such request or at the time of the effectiveness of any such extension. The Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees that the facility usage and unused facility fees set forth in the Fee Letter shall be adjusted based on the then current market conditions as determined by the Agent in its reasonable credit judgment. ARTICLE II. PAYMENTS AND COLLECTIONS Section 2.1 PAYMENTS. Borrower hereby promises to pay: (a) the Aggregate Principal on and after the Facility Termination Date as and when Collections are received; (b) the fees set forth in the Fee Letter on the dates specified therein; (c) all accrued and unpaid Interest on the Alternate Base Rate Loans on each Settlement Date applicable thereto; (d) all accrued and unpaid Interest on the LIBO Rate Loans on the last day of each Interest Period applicable thereto; (e) all accrued and unpaid CP Costs on the CP Rate Loans on each Settlement Date; and (f) all Broken Funding Costs and Indemnified Amounts upon demand. Section 2.2. COLLECTIONS PRIOR TO AMORTIZATION; REPAYMENT OF CERTAIN DEMAND ADVANCES. Without limiting the Agent's or any Lender's recourse to Borrower for payment of any and all Obligations: (a) If any Monthly Report reveals that a mandatory prepayment is required under Section 1.4(b), not later than the 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the next succeeding Settlement Date, the Servicer shall turn over to the Agent, for distribution a portion of the Collections received as of the Monthly Reporting Date on which such Monthly Report was due and not previously so distributed equal to the amount of such required mandatory prepayment; (b) If, on any Settlement Date, any Loans are to be voluntarily prepaid in accordance with Section 1.3, or if the aggregate principal amount of the Advances outstanding is to be reduced, the Servicer shall turn over to the Agent, for distribution to the Lenders, a portion of the Collections equal to the aggregate amount of such voluntary prepayment or reduction and any other amounts required to be paid in connection with such voluntary prepayment or reduction; and 5
(c) In addition to, but without duplication of, the foregoing, on (i) each Settlement Date and (ii) each other date on which any principal of or interest on any of the Loans becomes due (whether by acceleration or otherwise) and, in the case of principal, has not been reborrowed pursuant to Section 1.1, the Servicer shall turn over to the Agent, for distribution to the Lenders the portion of the Collections equal to the aggregate amount of all other Obligations that are due and owing on such date. If the Collections and proceeds of new Loans are insufficient to make all payments required under clauses (a), (b) and (c) and to pay the Servicing Fees and, if applicable, all expenses due and owing to any replacement Servicer under Section 8.1 (all of the foregoing, collectively, the "REQUIRED AMOUNTS") and Borrower has made any Demand Advances, Borrower shall make demand upon ECM for payment of the Demand Advances in an amount equal to the lesser of the Required Amounts or the aggregate outstanding principal balance of such Demand Advances (plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon) and, upon receipt of any such amounts, Borrower shall pay them to the Agent for distribution in accordance with this Section 3.2. (d) If the aggregate amount of Collections and payments on Demand Advances received by the Agent on any Settlement Date are insufficient to pay all Required Amounts, the aggregate amount received shall be applied to the items specified in the subclauses below, in the order of priority of such subclauses: (i) to any accrued and unpaid interest on the Loans that is then due and owing, including any previously accrued interest which was not paid on its applicable due date; (ii) if the Servicer is not Parent or an Affiliate thereof, to any accrued and unpaid Servicing Fee that is then due and owing to such Servicer, together with any invoiced expenses of the Servicer due and owing pursuant to Section 10.3; (iii) to the Facility Fee and the Usage Fee accrued during such Settlement Period, plus any previously accrued Facility Fee and Usage Fee not paid on a prior Settlement Date; (iv) to the payment of the principal of any Loans that are then due and owing; (v) to other Obligations that are then due and owing; and (vi) if the Servicer is Parent or one of its respective Affiliates, to the accrued and unpaid Servicing Fee that is then due and owing to such Servicer. (e) In addition to, but without duplication of, the foregoing, on (i) each Settlement Date and (ii) each other date on which any principal of or interest on any of the Loans becomes due (whether by acceleration or otherwise), the Servicer shall turn over to the Agent, for distribution to the Lenders, a portion of the Collections equal to the aggregate amount of all Obligations that are due and owing on such date. 6
Section 2.3 REPAYMENT OF DEMAND ADVANCES ON THE AMORTIZATION DATE; COLLECTIONS FOLLOWING AMORTIZATION. (a) On the Amortization Date, ECM hereby agrees to repay the aggregate outstanding principal balance of all Demand Advances, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, to the Agent's Account, without demand or notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by ECM. (b) On the Amortization Date and on each day thereafter, the Servicer shall set aside and hold in trust, for the Secured Parties, all Collections received on such day. On and after the Amortization Date, the Servicer shall, on each Settlement Date and on each other Business Day specified by the Agent (after deduction of any accrued and unpaid Servicing Fee as of such date): (i) remit to the Agent's Account the amounts set aside pursuant to the preceding two sentences, and (ii) apply such amounts to reduce the Obligations as follows: FIRST, to the reimbursement of the Agent's actual and reasonable costs of collection and enforcement of this Agreement, SECOND, ratably to the payment of all accrued and unpaid CP Costs, Interest and Broken Funding Costs, THIRD, ratably to the payment of all accrued and unpaid fees under the Fee Letter, FOURTH, to the ratable reduction of Aggregate Principal, FIFTH, for the ratable payment of all other unpaid Obligations, and SIXTH, after the Obligations have been indefeasibly reduced to zero, to Borrower. Collections applied to the payment of Obligations shall be distributed in accordance with the aforementioned provisions, and, giving effect to each of the priorities set forth above in this Section 2.3(b), shall be shared ratably (within each priority) among the Agent and the Lenders in accordance with the amount of such Obligations owing to each of them in respect of each such priority. Section 2.4 PAYMENT RECISSION. No payment of any of the Obligations shall be considered paid or applied hereunder to the extent that, at any time, all or any portion of such payment or application is rescinded by application of law or judicial authority, or must otherwise be returned or refunded for any reason. Borrower shall remain obligated for the amount of any payment or application so rescinded, returned or refunded, and shall promptly pay to the Agent (for application to the Person or Persons who suffered such recission, return or refund) the full amount thereof, plus Interest on such amount at the Default Rate from the date of any such recission, return or refunding. 7
ARTICLE III. BLUE RIDGE FUNDING Section 3.1 CP COSTS. Borrower shall pay CP Costs with respect to the principal balance of Blue Ridge's Loans from time to time outstanding. Each Loan of Blue Ridge that is funded substantially with Pooled Commercial Paper will accrue CP Costs each day on a pro rata basis, based upon the percentage share that the principal in respect of such Loan represents in relation to all assets held by Blue Ridge and funded substantially with related Pooled Commercial Paper. Section 3.2 CALCULATION OF CP COSTS. Not later than the 3rd Business Day immediately preceding each Monthly Reporting Date, Blue Ridge shall calculate the aggregate amount of CP Costs applicable to its CP Rate Loans for the Calculation Period then most recently ended and shall notify Borrower of such aggregate amount. Section 3.3 CP COSTS PAYMENTS. On each Settlement Date, Borrower shall pay to the Agent (for the benefit of Blue Ridge) an aggregate amount equal to all accrued and unpaid CP Costs in respect of the principal associated with all CP Rate Loans for the Calculation Period then most recently ended in accordance with Article II. Section 3.4 DEFAULT RATE. From and after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Amortization Event, all Loans of Blue Ridge shall accrue Interest at the Default Rate and shall cease to be CP Rate Loans. ARTICLE IV. LIQUIDITY BANK FUNDING Section 4.1 LIQUIDITY BANK FUNDING. Prior to the occurrence of an Amortization Event, the outstanding principal balance of each Liquidity Funding shall accrue interest for each day during its Interest Period at either the LIBO Rate or the Alternate Base Rate in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof. Until Borrower gives notice to the Agent of another Interest Rate in accordance with Section 4.4, the initial Interest Rate for any Loan transferred to the Liquidity Banks by Blue Ridge pursuant to the Liquidity Agreement shall be the Alternate Base Rate (unless the Default Rate is then applicable). If the Liquidity Banks acquire by assignment from Blue Ridge any Loan pursuant to the Liquidity Agreement, each Loan so assigned shall each be deemed to have an Interest Period commencing on the date of any such assignment. Section 4.2 INTEREST PAYMENTS. On the Settlement Date for each Liquidity Funding, Borrower shall pay to the Agent (for the benefit of the Liquidity Banks) an aggregate amount equal to the accrued and unpaid Interest for the entire Interest Period of each such Liquidity Funding in accordance with Article II. 8
Section 4.3 SELECTION AND CONTINUATION OF INTEREST PERIODS. (a) With consultation from (and approval by) the Agent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), Borrower shall from time to time request Interest Periods for the Liquidity Fundings, PROVIDED THAT if at any time any Liquidity Funding is outstanding, Borrower shall always request Interest Periods such that at least one Interest Period shall end on the date specified in clause (A) of the definition of Settlement Date. (b) Borrower or the Agent, upon notice to and consent by the other received at least three (3) Business Days prior to the end of an Interest Period (the "TERMINATING TRANCHE") for any Liquidity Funding, may, effective on the last day of the Terminating Tranche: (i) divide any such Liquidity Funding into multiple Liquidity Fundings, (ii) combine any such Liquidity Funding with one or more other Liquidity Fundings that have a Terminating Tranche ending on the same day as such Terminating Tranche or (iii) combine any such Liquidity Funding with a new Liquidity Funding to be made by the Liquidity Banks on the day such Terminating Tranche ends. Section 4.4 LIQUIDITY BANK INTEREST RATES. Borrower may select the LIBO Rate or the Alternate Base Rate for each Liquidity Funding. Borrower shall by 12:00 noon (New York time): (i) at least three (3) Business Days prior to the expiration of any Terminating Tranche with respect to which the LIBO Rate is being requested as a new Interest Rate and (ii) at least one (1) Business Day prior to the expiration of any Terminating Tranche with respect to which the Alternate Base Rate is being requested as a new Interest Rate, give the Agent irrevocable notice of the new Interest Rate for the Liquidity Funding associated with such Terminating Tranche.

actual use to the extent practicable and, to the extent such allocation is not practicable, on a basis reasonably related to actual use; (vi) at all times have a Board of Directors consisting of three members, at least one member of which is an Independent Director; (vii) observe all corporate formalities as a distinct entity, and ensure that all corporate actions relating to (A) the selection, maintenance or replacement of the Independent Director, (B) the dissolution or liquidation of Borrower or (C) the initiation of, participation in, acquiescence in or consent to any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar proceeding involving Borrower, are duly authorized by unanimous vote of its Board of Directors (including the Independent Director); (viii) maintain Borrower's books and records separate from those of each Originator and any Affiliate thereof and otherwise readily identifiable as its own assets rather than assets of any Originator or any Affiliate thereof; (ix) prepare its financial statements separately from those of each Originator and insure that any consolidated financial statements of any Originator or any Affiliate thereof that include Borrower and that are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other governmental agency have notes clearly stating that Borrower is a separate corporate entity and that its assets will be available first and foremost to satisfy the claims of the creditors of Borrower; (x) except as herein specifically otherwise provided, maintain the funds or other assets of Borrower separate from, and not commingled with, those of any Originator or any Affiliate thereof and only maintain bank accounts or other depository accounts to which Borrower alone is the account party, into which Borrower alone makes deposits and from which Borrower alone (or the Agent hereunder) has the power to make withdrawals; (xi) pay all of Borrower's operating expenses from Borrower's own assets (except for certain payments by any Originator or other Persons pursuant to allocation arrangements that comply with the requirements of this Section 7.1(i)); (xii) operate its business and activities such that: it does not engage in any business or activity of any kind, or enter into any transaction or indenture, mortgage, instrument, agreement, contract, lease or other undertaking, other than the transactions contemplated and authorized by this Agreement and the Receivables Sale Agreements (and Borrower many own nominal non-passive assets to the extent necessary so that it is not characterized as a "qualifying special purpose entity" within the meaning of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140); and does not create, incur, guarantee, assume or suffer to exist any indebtedness or other liabilities, whether direct or contingent, other than (1) as a result of the endorsement of negotiable instruments for deposit or collection or similar transactions in the ordinary course of business, (2) the incurrence of obligations under this Agreement, (3) the incurrence of obligations, as expressly contemplated in the Receivables Sale Agreement, to make payment to the applicable Originator thereunder or ECM for the purchase of Receivables from such Originator or ECM under the Receivables Sale Agreement, and (4) the 21
incurrence of operating expenses in the ordinary course of business of the type otherwise contemplated by this Agreement; (xiii) maintain its corporate charter in conformity with this Agreement, such that it does not amend, restate, supplement or otherwise modify its Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws in any respect that would materially impair its ability to comply with the terms or provisions of any of the Transaction Documents, including, without limitation, Section 7.1(i) of this Agreement; (xiv) maintain the effectiveness of, and continue to perform under the Receivables Sale Agreements and the Performance Undertaking, such that it does not amend, restate, supplement, cancel, terminate or otherwise modify the Receivables Sale Agreements or the Performance Undertaking, or give any consent, waiver, directive or approval thereunder or waive any default, action, omission or breach under the Receivables Sale Agreements or the Performance Undertaking or otherwise grant any indulgence thereunder, without (in each case) the prior written consent of the Agent; (xv) maintain its corporate separateness such that it does not merge or consolidate with or into, or convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of (whether in one transaction or in a series of transactions, and except as otherwise contemplated herein) all or substantially all of its assets (whether now owned or hereafter acquired) to, or acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, any Person, nor at any time create, have, acquire, maintain or hold any interest in any Subsidiary. (xvi) maintain at all times the Required Capital Amount (as defined in the Second Step Receivables Sale Agreement) and refrain from making any dividend, distribution, redemption of capital stock or payment of any subordinated indebtedness which would cause the Required Capital Amount to cease to be so maintained; and (xvii) take such other actions as are necessary on its part to ensure that the facts and assumptions set forth in the opinion issued by Kilpatrick Stockton LLP, as counsel for Borrower, in connection with the closing or initial Advance under this Agreement and relating to substantive consolidation issues, and in the certificates accompanying such opinion, remain true and correct in all material respects at all times. (j) COLLECTIONS. Such Loan Party will cause (1) all proceeds from all Lock-Boxes to be directly deposited by a Collection Bank into a Collection Account and (2) each Lock-Box and Collection Account to be subject at all times to a Collection Account Agreement that is in full force and effect. In the event any payments relating to the Collateral are remitted directly to Borrower or any Affiliate of Borrower, Borrower will remit (or will cause all such payments to be remitted) directly to a Collection Bank and deposited into a Collection Account within two (2) Business Days following receipt thereof, and, at all times prior to such remittance, Borrower will itself hold or, if applicable, will cause such payments to be held in trust for the exclusive benefit of the Agent and the Lenders. Borrower will maintain exclusive ownership, dominion and control (subject to the terms of this Agreement) of each Lock-Box and Collection Account and shall not grant the right to take dominion and control of any Lock-Box or 22
Collection Account at a future time or upon the occurrence of a future event to any Person, except to the Agent as contemplated by this Agreement. (k) TAXES. Unless otherwise filed by the Performance Guarantor, such Loan Party will file all material tax returns and reports required by law to be filed by it and will promptly pay all material taxes and governmental charges at any time owing, except taxes which are not yet delinquent or (i) that are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which such Loan Party has set aside on its books adequate reserves or (ii) to the extent the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

With respect to any Receivable purchased by ECM from any Originator or purchased by Borrower from ECM, such sale shall be effected under, and in strict compliance with the terms of, the applicable Receivables Sale Agreement, including, without limitation, the terms relating to the amount and timing of payments to be made to such Originator or ECM in respect of the purchase price for such Receivable.

(c) MODIFICATIONS TO RECEIVABLES AND CREDIT AND COLLECTION POLICY. Such Loan Party will not, and will not permit any Originator to, make any material change to the Credit and Collection Policy that could adversely affect the collectibility of the Receivables or decrease the credit quality of any newly created Receivables.

modify the terms of any Receivable other than in accordance with the Credit and Collection Policy. (d) SALES, LIENS.

ARTICLE VIII. ADMINISTRATION AND COLLECTION Section 8.1 DESIGNATION OF SERVICER. (a) The servicing, administration and collection of the Receivables shall be conducted by such Person (the "SERVICER") so designated from time to time in accordance with this Section 8.1. ECM is hereby designated as, and hereby agrees to perform the duties and obligations of, the Servicer pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. The Agent may at any time following the occurrence of an Amortization Event designate as Servicer any Person to succeed ECM or any successor Servicer PROVIDED THAT the Rating Agency Condition is satisfied. (b) ECM may delegate, and ECM hereby advises the Lenders and the Agent that it has delegated, to the other Originators, as sub-servicers of the Servicer, certain of its duties and responsibilities as Servicer hereunder in respect of the Receivables originated by such other Originator. Without the prior written consent of the Agent and the Required Liquidity Banks, ECM shall not be permitted to delegate any of its duties or responsibilities as Servicer to any Person other than (i) Borrower, (ii) the other Originators, (iii) solely with respect to invoice generation and mailing, an outside billing agent in accordance with its customary practices, and (iv) with respect to certain Defaulted Receivables, outside collection agencies in accordance with its customary practices. Neither Borrower nor any Originator shall be permitted to further delegate to any other Person any of the duties or responsibilities of the Servicer delegated to it by ECM. If at any time the Agent shall designate as Servicer any Person other than ECM, all duties and responsibilities theretofore delegated by ECM to Borrower or the other Originators may, at the discretion of the Agent, be terminated forthwith on notice given by the Agent to ECM and to Borrower and the other Originators. (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing subsection (b): (i) ECM shall be and remain primarily liable to the Agent and the Lenders for the full and prompt performance of all duties and responsibilities of the Servicer hereunder and (ii) the Agent and the Lenders shall be entitled to deal exclusively with ECM in matters relating to the discharge by the Servicer of its duties and responsibilities hereunder. The Agent and the Lenders shall not be required to give notice, demand or other communication to any Person other than ECM in order for communication to the Servicer and its sub-servicer or other delegate with respect thereto to be accomplished. ECM, at all times that it is the Servicer, shall be responsible for providing any sub-servicer or other delegate of the Servicer with any notice given to the Servicer under this Agreement. Section 8.2 DUTIES OF SERVICER. (a) The Servicer shall take or cause to be taken all such actions as may be necessary or advisable to collect each Receivable from time to time, all in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, with reasonable care and diligence, and in accordance with the Credit and Collection Policy. 25
(b) The Servicer will instruct all Obligors to pay all Collections directly to a Lock-Box or Collection Account. The Servicer shall effect a Collection Account Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit VI with each bank party to a Collection Account at any time. In the case of any remittances received in any Lock-Box or Collection Account that shall have been identified, to the satisfaction of the Servicer, to not constitute Collections or other proceeds of the Receivables or the Related Security, the Servicer shall promptly remit such items to the Person identified to it as being the owner of such remittances. From and after the date the Agent delivers to any Collection Bank a Collection Notice pursuant to Section 8.3, the Agent may request that the Servicer, and the Servicer thereupon promptly shall instruct all Obligors with respect to the Receivables, to remit all payments thereon to a new depositary account specified by the Agent and, at all times thereafter, Borrower and the Servicer shall not deposit or otherwise credit, and shall not permit any other Person to deposit or otherwise credit to such new depositary account any cash or payment item other than Collections. (c) The Servicer shall administer the Collections in accordance with the procedures described herein and in Article II. The Servicer shall set aside and hold in trust for the account of Borrower and the Lenders their respective shares of the Collections in accordance with Article II. The Servicer shall, upon the request of the Agent, segregate, in a manner acceptable to the Agent, all cash, checks and other instruments received by it from time to time constituting Collections from the general funds of the Servicer or Borrower prior to the remittance thereof in accordance with Article II. If the Servicer shall be required to segregate Collections pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Servicer shall segregate and deposit with a bank designated by the Agent such allocable share of Collections of Receivables set aside for the Lenders on the first Business Day following receipt by the Servicer of such Collections, duly endorsed or with duly executed instruments of transfer. (d) The Servicer may, in accordance with the Credit and Collection Policy, extend the maturity of any Receivable or adjust the Outstanding Balance of any Receivable as the Servicer determines to be appropriate to maximize Collections thereof; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such extension or adjustment shall not alter the status of such Receivable as a Delinquent Receivable or Defaulted Receivable or limit the rights of the Agent or the Lenders under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Agent shall have the absolute and unlimited right to direct the Servicer to commence or settle any legal action with respect to any Receivable or to foreclose upon or repossess any Related Security; PROVIDED FURTHER THAT (i) in lieu of commencing any such action or taking other enforcement action, the Servicer may, at its option, elect to pay to the Agent an amount equal to the Outstanding Balance of such Receivable and (ii) the Servicer shall not, unless indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders, be obligated to commence or take any legal action that is in contravention of applicable law or regulation, or to settle any action that would entail an admission by the Servicer, Borrower or any Originator of legal wrongdoing or culpability or require the payment of damages by any Originator or the Servicer to any third party. (e) The Servicer shall hold in trust for Borrower and the Lenders all Records that (i) evidence or relate to the Receivables, the related Contracts and Related Security or (ii) are otherwise necessary or desirable to collect the Receivables and shall, as soon as practicable upon demand of the Agent at any time when an Amortization Event exists, deliver or make available to the Agent all such Records, at a place selected by the Agent. The Servicer shall, as 26
soon as practicable following receipt thereof turn over to Borrower any cash collections or other cash proceeds received with respect to Indebtedness not constituting Receivables. The Servicer shall, from time to time at the request of any Lender, furnish to the Lenders (promptly after any such request) a calculation of the amounts set aside for the Lenders pursuant to Article II. (f) Any payment by an Obligor in respect of any indebtedness owed by it to Originator or Borrower shall, except as otherwise specified by such Obligor or otherwise required by contract or law and unless otherwise instructed by the Agent, be applied as a Collection of any Receivable of such Obligor (starting with the oldest such Receivable) to the extent of any amounts then due and payable thereunder before being applied to any other receivable or other obligation of such Obligor. Section 8.3 COLLECTION NOTICES. (a) The Agent is authorized at any time after an Incipient Bankruptcy Event or Amortization Event has occurred and is continuing to date and to deliver to the Collection Banks the Collection Notices. Borrower hereby transfers to the Agent for the benefit of the Lenders, effective when the Agent delivers such notice, the exclusive ownership and control of each Lock-Box and the Collection Accounts. In case any authorized signatory of Borrower whose signature appears on a Collection Account Agreement shall cease to have such authority before the delivery of such notice, such Collection Notice shall nevertheless be valid as if such authority had remained in force. Borrower hereby authorizes the Agent, and agrees that the Agent shall be entitled (i) at any time after delivery of the Collection Notices, to endorse Borrower's name on checks and other instruments representing Collections, (ii) at any time when an Amortization Event has occurred and is continuing, to enforce the Receivables, the related Contracts and the Related Security, and (iii) at any time when an Amortization Event has occurred and is continuing, to take such action as shall be necessary or desirable to cause all cash, checks and other instruments constituting Collections of Receivables to come into the possession of the Agent rather than Borrower. (b) Borrower hereby authorizes the Agent or its designee to file one or more financing or continuation statements, and amendments thereto and assignments thereof, relative to all or any of the Receivables and the Related Security now existing or hereafter arising in the name of Borrower without any signature of Borrower. If Borrower fails to perform any of its agreements or obligations under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, the Agent or its designee may (but shall not be required to) itself perform, or cause performance of, such agreement or obligation, and the expenses of the Agent or its designee incurred in connection therewith shall be payable by Borrower as provided herein. Section 8.4 RESPONSIBILITIES OF BORROWER. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the exercise by the Agent and the Lenders of their rights hereunder shall not release the Servicer, any Originator or Borrower from any of their duties or obligations with respect to any Receivables or under the related Contracts. The Lenders shall have no obligation or liability with respect to any Receivables or related Contracts, nor shall any of them be obligated to perform the obligations of Borrower. 27
Section 8.5 MONTHLY REPORTS. The Servicer shall prepare and forward to the Agent (i) on each Monthly Reporting Date, a Monthly Report and an electronic file of the data contained therein and (ii) at such times as the Agent shall request, a listing by Obligor of all Receivables together with an aging of such Receivables; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if an Unmatured Amortization Event or an Amortization Event shall exist and be continuing, the Agent may request a Monthly Report be prepared and forwarded to the Agent more frequently than monthly. Section 8.6 SERVICING FEE. As compensation for the Servicer's servicing activities on their behalf, the Lenders hereby agree to pay the Servicer the Servicing Fee, which fee shall be paid in arrears on each Settlement Date.

Without limiting any other rights that the Agent or any Lender may have hereunder or under applicable law, (A) Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify (and pay upon demand to) the Agent, Blue Ridge, each of the Liquidity Banks and each of the respective assigns, officers, directors, agents and employees of the foregoing (each, an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") from and against any and all damages, losses, claims, taxes, liabilities, costs, expenses and for all other amounts payable, including actual and reasonable attorneys' fees (which attorneys may be employees of the Agent or such Lender) and disbursements (all of the foregoing being collectively referred to as "INDEMNIFIED AMOUNTS") awarded against or incurred by any of them arising out of or as a result of this Agreement or the acquisition, either directly or indirectly, by a Lender of an interest in the Receivables, and (B) the Servicer hereby agrees to indemnify (and pay upon demand to) each Indemnified Party for Indemnified Amounts awarded against or incurred by any of them arising out of the Servicer's activities as Servicer hereunder EXCLUDING, HOWEVER, in all of the foregoing instances under the preceding clauses (A) and (B): (a) Indemnified Amounts to the extent a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction holds that such Indemnified Amounts resulted from gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Indemnified Party seeking indemnification provided that the Loan Parties shall not be obligated to indemnify and Indemnified Party under this Section 10.1 in connection with any claim under any cause of action by or against such Indemnified Party with respect to which any Loan Party is an adverse party and such Loan Party is the prevailing party with respect to such claim under such cause of action; (b) Indemnified Amounts to the extent the same includes losses in respect of Receivables that are uncollectible on account of the insolvency, bankruptcy or lack of creditworthiness of the related Obligor; or (c) (i) income and franchise taxes imposed on (or measured by) any Indemnified Party's net income by the United States of America or by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Indemnified Party is organized or its principal office is located, or is or should be qualified to do business or any political subdivision thereof, or in the case of any Lender, in which its applicable Lending Office is located (PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no Lender shall be deemed to be located in any jurisdiction solely as a result of taking any action related to the Transaction Documents) and (ii) any branch profits taxes imposed by the United States of America or any similar tax imposed by any other jurisdiction described in clause (i) above, in each of the foregoing cases to the extent that the computation of such income, franchise or branch profit taxes is consistent with the characterization for such income, franchise or branch profit tax purposes of the acquisition by the Lenders of Loans as a loan or loans by the Lenders to Borrower secured by the Receivables, the Related Security, the Collection Accounts and the Collections; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing contained in this sentence shall limit the liability of any Loan Party or limit the recourse of the Lenders to any Loan Party for amounts otherwise specifically 32
provided to be paid by such Loan Party under the terms of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing indemnification, Borrower shall indemnify the Agent and the Lenders for Indemnified Amounts (including, without limitation, losses in respect of uncollectible receivables, regardless of whether reimbursement therefor would constitute recourse to Borrower or the Servicer) relating to or resulting from: (i) any representation or warranty made by any Loan Party or any Originator (or any officers of any such Person) under or in connection with this Agreement, any other Transaction Document or any other information or report delivered by any such Person pursuant hereto or thereto, which shall have been false or incorrect when made or deemed made; (ii) the failure by Borrower, the Servicer or any Originator to comply with any applicable law, rule or regulation with respect to any Receivable or Contract related thereto, or the nonconformity of any Receivable or Contract included therein with any such applicable law, rule or regulation or any failure of any Originator to keep or perform any of its obligations, express or implied, with respect to any Contract; (iii) any failure of Borrower, the Servicer or any Originator to perform its duties, covenants or other obligations in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document; (iv) any products liability, personal injury or damage suit, or other similar claim arising out of or in connection with merchandise, insurance or services that are the subject of any Contract or any Receivable; (v) any dispute, claim, offset or defense (other than discharge in bankruptcy of the Obligor) of the Obligor to the payment of any Receivable (including, without limitation, a defense based on such Receivable or the related Contract not being a legal, valid and binding obligation of such Obligor enforceable against it in accordance with its terms), or any other claim resulting from the sale of the merchandise or service related to such Receivable or the furnishing or failure to furnish such merchandise or services; (vi) the commingling of Collections of Receivables at any time with other funds; (vii) any investigation, litigation or proceeding related to or arising from this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, the transactions contemplated hereby, the use of the proceeds of any Advance, the Collateral or any other investigation, litigation or proceeding relating to Borrower, the Servicer or any Originator in which any Indemnified Party becomes involved as a result of any of the transactions contemplated hereby; (viii) any inability to litigate any claim against any Obligor in respect of any Receivable as a result of such Obligor being immune from civil and commercial law and suit on the grounds of sovereignty or otherwise from any legal action, suit or proceeding; (ix) any Amortization Event; 33
(x) any failure of Borrower to acquire and maintain legal and equitable title to, and ownership of any of the Collateral from the applicable Originator, free and clear of any Adverse Claim (other than as created hereunder); or any failure of ECM or Borrower to give reasonably equivalent value to any Originator or ECM (as applicable) under the Receivables Sale Agreement in consideration of the transfer by such Originator or ECM (as applicable) of any Receivable, or any attempt by any Person to void such transfer under statutory provisions or common law or equitable action; (xi) any failure to vest and maintain vested in the Agent for the benefit of the Lenders, or to transfer to the Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties, a valid first priority perfected security interests in the Collateral, free and clear of any Adverse Claim (except as created by the Transaction Documents); (xii) the failure to have filed, or any delay in filing, financing statements or other similar instruments or documents under the UCC of any applicable jurisdiction or other applicable laws with respect to any Collateral, and the proceeds thereof, whether at the time of any Advance or at any subsequent time; (xiii) any action or omission by any Loan Party which reduces or impairs the rights of the Agent or the Lenders with respect to any Collateral or the value of any Collateral (for any reason other than the application of Collections thereto or charge-off of any Receivable as uncollectible); (xiv) any attempt by any Person to void any Advance or the Agent's security interest in the Collateral under statutory provisions or common law or equitable action; and (xv) the failure of any Receivable included in the calculation of the Net Pool Balance as an Eligible Receivable to be an Eligible Receivable at the time so included. Section 10.2 INCREASED COST AND REDUCED RETURN. If after the date hereof, any Regulatory Change shall occur: (i) that subjects any Funding Source to any charge or withholding on or with respect to any Funding Agreement or a Funding Source's obligations under a Funding Agreement, or on or with respect to the Receivables, or changes the basis of taxation of payments to any Funding Source of any amounts payable under any Funding Agreement (except for changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of a Funding Source or taxes excluded by Section 10.1) or (ii) that imposes, modifies or deems applicable any reserve, assessment, insurance charge, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of a Funding Source, or credit extended by a Funding Source pursuant to a Funding Agreement or (iii) that imposes any other condition the result of which is to increase the cost to a Funding Source of performing its obligations under a Funding Agreement, or to reduce the rate of return on a Funding Source's capital as a consequence of its obligations under a Funding Agreement, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by a Funding Source under a Funding Agreement or to require any payment calculated by reference to the amount of interests or loans held or interest received by it, then, upon demand by the Agent, Borrower shall pay to the Agent, for the benefit of the relevant Funding Source, such amounts charged to such Funding Source 34
for such amounts to otherwise compensate such Funding Source for such increased cost or such reduction. In determining any amount provided for or referred to in this Section 10.2, a Funding Source may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods that it (in its sole discretion) shall deem applicable. Within 90 days after the latest to occur of (a) discovery of a Regulatory Change covered by this Section 10.2, (b) incurrence of any increased cost, tax, reserve or other amount described above, or (c) the date on which such increased cost, tax, reserve or other amount is required to be paid or established, any Funding Source wishing to make a claim under this Section 10.2 shall submit to Borrower a certificate as to such actual increased cost or actual reduced return (including calculation thereof in reasonable detail), which shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and biding upon Borrower. Borrower shall not be responsible for any amount claimed under this Section unless such certificate was delivered in such 90-day period. If requested by Borrower, each Funding Source will use reasonable efforts (subject to the overall policy considerations of such Funding Source) to designate an alternate Lending Office with respect to Loans affected by any of the matters or circumstances prescribed in this Section 10.2 in order to reduce the liability of Borrower under this Section 10.2 or to avoid the results provided in this Section 10.2 so long as such designation is not disadvantageous to such Funding Source as determined by such Funding Source, which determination, if made in good faith, shall be conclusive and binding on all parties hereto. Nothing in this Section 10.2 shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of Borrower hereunder or any right of any Funding Source hereunder. Section 10.3 OTHER COSTS AND EXPENSES. Borrower shall pay to the Agent and Blue Ridge on demand all costs and out-of-pocket expenses actually incurred in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery and administration of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby and the other documents to be delivered hereunder, including without limitation, the cost of Blue Ridge's auditors auditing the books, records and procedures of Borrower, reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of legal counsel for Blue Ridge and the Agent (which such counsel may be employees of Blue Ridge or the Agent) with respect thereto and with respect to advising Blue Ridge and the Agent as to their respective rights and remedies under this Agreement. Borrower shall pay to the Agent on demand any and all reasonable costs and expenses of the Agent and the Lenders, if any, including actual and reasonable counsel fees and expenses in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement and the other documents delivered hereunder and in connection with any restructuring or workout of this Agreement or such documents, or the administration of this Agreement following an Amortization Event. Borrower shall reimburse Blue Ridge on demand for all other reasonable costs and expenses actually incurred by Blue Ridge ("OTHER COSTS"), including, without limitation, the cost of auditing Blue Ridge's books by certified public accountants, the cost of rating the Commercial Paper by independent financial rating agencies, and the reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of counsel for Blue Ridge or any counsel for any shareholder of Blue Ridge with respect to advising Blue Ridge or such shareholder as to matters relating to Blue Ridge's operations. Section 10.4 ALLOCATIONS. Blue Ridge shall allocate the liability for (a) increased costs covered by Section 10.2 arising under Funding Agreements that are not specifically related solely to this Agreement ("SHARED INCREASED COSTS") and (b) Other Costs among Borrower and other Persons with whom Blue Ridge has entered into agreements to purchase interests in or finance receivables and other financial assets ("OTHER CUSTOMERS"). If any Other Costs are attributable to Borrower and not attributable to any Other Customer or any Shared Increased 35
Costs are attributable to the facility evidenced by this Agreement and not to any Other Customers' facilities, Borrower shall be solely liable for such Other Costs or Shared Increased Costs. However, if Other Costs or Shared Increased Costs are attributable to Other Customers and their facilities but not attributable to Borrower or the facility evidenced hereby, such Other Customer shall be solely liable for such Other Costs or Shared Increased Costs, as the case may be. All allocations to be made pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Article X shall be made by Blue Ridge in its sole discretion and shall be binding on Borrower and the Servicer. ARTICLE XI. THE AGENT Section 11.1 AUTHORIZATION AND ACTION. Each Lender hereby designates and appoints Wachovia to act as its agent under the Transaction Documents and under the Liquidity Agreement, and authorizes the Agent to take such actions as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Agent by the terms of the Liquidity Agreement or the Transaction Documents, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth in the Liquidity Agreement or in any Transaction Document, or any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities on the part of the Agent shall be read into the Liquidity Agreement or any Transaction Document or otherwise exist for the Agent. In performing its functions and duties under the Liquidity Agreement and the Transaction Documents, the Agent shall act solely as agent for the Lenders and does not assume nor shall be deemed to have assumed any obligation or relationship of trust or agency with or for any Loan Party or any of such Loan Party's successors or assigns. The Agent shall not be required to take any action that exposes the Agent to personal liability or that is contrary to the Liquidity Agreement or any Transaction Document or applicable law. The appointment and authority of the Agent hereunder shall terminate upon the indefeasible payment in full of all Obligations. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Agent to execute each of the UCC financing statements, each Collection Account Agreement on behalf of such Lender (the terms of which shall be binding on such Lender). Section 11.2 DELEGATION OF DUTIES. The Agent may execute any of its duties under the Liquidity Agreement and each Transaction Document by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care. Section 11.3 EXCULPATORY PROVISIONS. Neither the Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be (i) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection with the Liquidity Agreement or any Transaction Document (except for its, their or such Person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct), or (ii) responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by any Loan Party contained in the Liquidity Agreement, any Transaction Document or any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received under or in connection with, any Transaction Document or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of the Liquidity Agreement or any 36
Transaction Document or any other document furnished in connection therewith, or for any failure of any Loan Party to perform its obligations under any Transaction Document, or for the satisfaction of any condition specified in Article VI, or for the perfection, priority, condition, value or sufficiency of any collateral pledged in connection herewith. The Agent shall not be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements or covenants contained in, or conditions of, any Transaction Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of the Loan Parties. The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any Amortization Event or Unmatured Amortization Event unless the Agent has received notice from a Loan Party or a Lender. Section 11.4 RELIANCE BY AGENT. The Agent shall in all cases be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including, without limitation, counsel to Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by the Agent. The Agent shall in all cases be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under the Liquidity Agreement or any Transaction Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of Blue Ridge or the Required Liquidity Banks or all of the Lenders, as applicable, as it deems appropriate and it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders, PROVIDED THAT unless and until the Agent shall have received such advice, the Agent may take or refrain from taking any action, as the Agent shall deem advisable and in the best interests of the Lenders. The Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, in accordance with a request of Blue Ridge or the Required Liquidity Banks or all of the Lenders, as applicable, and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders. Section 11.5 NON-RELIANCE ON AGENT AND OTHER LENDERS. Each Lender expressly acknowledges that neither the Agent, nor any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates has made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by the Agent hereafter taken, including, without limitation, any review of the affairs of any Loan Party, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the Agent. Each Lender represents and warrants to the Agent that it has and will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, operations, property, prospects, financial and other conditions and creditworthiness of Borrower and made its own decision to enter into the Liquidity Agreement, the Transaction Documents and all other documents related thereto. Section 11.6 REIMBURSEMENT AND INDEMNIFICATION. The Liquidity Banks agree to reimburse and indemnify the Agent and its officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents ratably according to their Pro Rata Shares, to the extent not paid or reimbursed by the Loan Parties (i) for any amounts for which the Agent, acting in its capacity as Agent, is entitled to reimbursement by the Loan Parties hereunder and (ii) for any other expenses incurred by the Agent, in its capacity as Agent and acting on behalf of the Lenders, in connection with the administration and enforcement of the Liquidity Agreement and the Transaction Documents. Section 11.7 AGENT IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY. The Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with Borrower or 37
any Affiliate of Borrower as though the Agent were not the Agent hereunder. With respect to the making of Loans pursuant to this Agreement, the Agent shall have the same rights and powers under the Liquidity Agreement and this Agreement in its individual capacity as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent, and the terms "LIQUIDITY BANK," "LENDER," "LIQUIDITY BANKS" and "LENDERS" shall include the Agent in its individual capacity. Section 11.8 SUCCESSOR AGENT. The Agent, upon five (5) days' notice to the Loan Parties and the Lenders, may voluntarily resign and may be removed at any time, with or without cause, by the Required Liquidity Lenders; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Wachovia shall not voluntarily resign as the Agent so long as any of the Liquidity Commitments remain in effect or Blue Ridge has any outstanding Loans. If the Agent (other than Wachovia) shall voluntarily resign or be removed as Agent under this Agreement, then the Required Liquidity Lenders during such five-day period shall appoint, with the consent of the Borrower from among the remaining Liquidity Banks, a successor Agent, whereupon such successor Agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the Agent and the term "Agent" shall mean such successor agent, effective upon its appointment, and the former Agent's rights, powers and duties as Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement. Upon resignation or replacement of any Agent in accordance with this Section 11.8, the retiring Agent shall execute such UCC-3 assignments and amendments, and assignments and amendments of the Liquidity Agreement and the Transaction Documents, as may be necessary to give effect to its replacement by a successor Agent. After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Article XI and Article X shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this Agreement. ARTICLE XII. ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS Section 12.1 ASSIGNMENTS. (a) Each of the Agent, the Loan Parties and the Liquidity Banks hereby agrees and consents to the complete or partial assignment by Blue Ridge of all or any portion of its rights under, interest in, title to and obligations under this Agreement to the Liquidity Banks pursuant to the Liquidity Agreement. (b) Any Liquidity Bank may at any time and from time to time assign to one or more Eligible Assignees (each, a "PURCHASING LIQUIDITY BANK") all or any part of its rights and obligations under this Agreement pursuant to an assignment agreement substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit VII hereto (an "ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT") executed by such Purchasing Liquidity Bank and such selling Liquidity Bank; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any assignment of a Liquidity Bank's rights and obligations hereunder shall include a pro rata assignment of its rights and obligations under the Liquidity Agreement. The consent of Blue Ridge (and, if no Amortization Event then exists, Borrower, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required prior to the effectiveness of any such assignment. Each assignee of a Liquidity Bank must (i) be an Eligible Assignee and (ii) agree to deliver to the Agent, promptly following any request therefor by the Agent or Blue Ridge, an enforceability opinion in form and 38
substance satisfactory to the Agent and Blue Ridge. Upon delivery of an executed Assignment Agreement to the Agent, such selling Liquidity Bank shall be released from its obligations hereunder and under the Liquidity Agreement to the extent of such assignment. Thereafter the Purchasing Liquidity Bank shall for all purposes be a Liquidity Bank party to this Agreement and the Liquidity Agreement and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Liquidity Bank hereunder and thereunder to the same extent as if it were an original party hereto and thereto and no further consent or action by Borrower, the Lenders or the Agent shall be required. Agent shall give Borrower and the Parent prior notice of each assignment made under this Section. (c) Each of the Liquidity Banks agrees that in the event that it shall suffer a Downgrading Event, such Downgraded Liquidity Bank shall be obliged, at the request of Blue Ridge or the Agent, to (i) collateralize its Commitment and its Liquidity Commitment in a manner acceptable to the Agent, or (ii) assign all of its rights and obligations hereunder and under the Liquidity Agreement to an Eligible Assignee nominated by the Agent or a Loan Party and acceptable to Blue Ridge (and, if no Amortization Event then exists, Borrower, which acceptance shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and willing to participate in this Agreement and the Liquidity Agreement through the Liquidity Termination Date in the place of such Downgraded Liquidity Bank; PROVIDED THAT the Downgraded Liquidity Bank receives payment in full, pursuant to an Assignment Agreement, of an amount equal to such Liquidity Bank's Pro Rata Share of the Obligations owing to the Liquidity Banks. (d) No Loan Party may assign any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Agent and each of the Lenders and without satisfying the Rating Agency Condition. Section 12.2 PARTICIPATIONS. Any Liquidity Bank may, in the ordinary course of its business at any time sell to one or more Persons (each, a "PARTICIPANT") participating interests in its Pro Rata Share of the Aggregate Commitment, its Loans, its Liquidity Commitment or any other interest of such Liquidity Bank hereunder or under the Liquidity Agreement. Notwithstanding any such sale by a Liquidity Bank of a participating interest to a Participant, such Liquidity Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement and the Liquidity Agreement shall remain unchanged, such Liquidity Bank shall remain solely responsible for the performance of its obligations hereunder and under the Liquidity Agreement, and the Loan Parties, Blue Ridge and the Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Liquidity Bank in connection with such Liquidity Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement and the Liquidity Agreement. Each Liquidity Bank agrees that any agreement between such Liquidity Bank and any such Participant in respect of such participating interest shall not restrict such Liquidity Bank's right to agree to any amendment, supplement, waiver or modification to this Agreement, except for any amendment, supplement, waiver or modification described in Section 14.1(b)(i). Section 12.3 FOREIGN LENDERS. Each Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower as will permit all payments under this Agreement to be made without withholding. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Foreign Lender agrees that it will deliver to the Agent and the Borrower (or in the case of a Participant, to the Lender from which the 39
related participation shall have been purchased) (i) two (2) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or W-8BEN, or any successor form thereto, as the case may be, certifying in each case that such Foreign Lender is entitled to receive payments made by any Borrower hereunder without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes and (ii) a duly completed Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 or W-9, or any successor form thereto, as the case may be, to establish an exemption from United States backup withholding tax. Each such Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent such forms on or before the date that it becomes a party to this Agreement (or in the case of a Participant, on or before the date such Participant purchases the related participation). In addition, each such Lender shall deliver such forms promptly upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Lender. Each such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Agent at any time that it determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any previously delivered certificate to the Borrower (or any other form of certification adopted by the U.S. taxing authorities for such purpose). ARTICLE XIII. SECURITY INTEREST Section 13.1 GRANT OF SECURITY INTEREST. To secure the due and punctual payment of the Obligations, whether now or hereafter existing, due or to become due, direct or indirect, or absolute or contingent, including, without limitation, all Indemnified Amounts, in each case pro rata according to the respective amounts thereof, the Borrower hereby grants to the Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, a security interest in, all of the Borrower's right, title and interest, whether now owned and existing or hereafter arising in and to all of the Receivables, the Related Security, the Collections and all proceeds of the foregoing (collectively, the "COLLATERAL"). Section 13.2 TERMINATION AFTER FINAL PAYOUT DATE. Each of the Secured Parties hereby authorizes the Agent, and the Agent hereby agrees, promptly after the Final Payout Date to execute and deliver to the Borrower such UCC termination statements as may be necessary to terminate the Agent's security interest in and Lien upon the Collateral, all at the Borrower's expense. Upon the Final Payout Date, all right, title and interest of the Agent and the other Secured Parties in and to the Collateral shall terminate. ARTICLE XIV. MISCELLANEOUS Section 14.1 WAIVERS AND AMENDMENTS. (a) No failure or delay on the part of the Agent or any Lender in exercising any power, right or remedy under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power, right or remedy preclude any other further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other power, right or remedy. The rights and remedies herein 40
provided shall be cumulative and nonexclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law. Any waiver of this Agreement shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given. (b) No provision of this Agreement may be amended, supplemented, modified or waived except in writing in accordance with the provisions of this Section 14.1(b). Blue Ridge, Borrower and the Agent, at the direction of the Required Liquidity Banks, may enter into written modifications or waivers of any provisions of this Agreement, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such modification or waiver shall: (i) without the consent of each affected Lender, (A) extend the Liquidity Termination Date or the date of any payment or deposit of Collections by Borrower or the Servicer, (B) reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of Interest or any CP Costs (or any component of Interest or CP Costs), (C) reduce any fee payable to the Agent for the benefit of the Lenders, (D) except pursuant to Article XII hereof, change the amount of the principal of any Lender, any Liquidity Bank's Pro Rata Share or any Liquidity Bank's Commitment, (E) amend, modify or waive any provision of the definition of Required Liquidity Banks or this Section 14.1(b), (F) consent to or permit the assignment or transfer by Borrower of any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement, (G) change the definition of "ELIGIBLE RECEIVABLE," "LOSS RESERVE," "DILUTION RESERVE," "YIELD RESERVE," "SERVICING RESERVE," "SERVICING FEE RATE," "REQUIRED RESERVE" or "REQUIRED RESERVE FACTOR FLOOR" or (H) amend or modify any defined term (or any defined term used directly or indirectly in such defined term) used in clauses (A) through (G) above in a manner that would circumvent the intention of the restrictions set forth in such clauses; or (ii) without the written consent of the then Agent, amend, modify or waive any provision of this Agreement if the effect thereof is to affect the rights or duties of such Agent, AND ANY MATERIAL AMENDMENT, WAIVER OR OTHER MODIFICATION OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL REQUIRE SATISFACTION OF THE RATING AGENCY CONDITION. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) without the consent of the Liquidity Banks, but with the consent of Borrower, the Agent may amend this Agreement solely to add additional Persons as Liquidity Banks hereunder and (ii) the Agent, the Required Liquidity Banks and Blue Ridge may enter into amendments to modify any of the terms or provisions of Article XI, Article XII, Section 14.13 or any other provision of this Agreement without the consent of Borrower, PROVIDED THAT such amendment has no negative impact upon Borrower. Any modification or waiver made in accordance with this Section 14.1 shall apply to each of the Lenders equally and shall be binding upon Borrower, the Lenders and the Agent. Section 14.2 NOTICES. Except as provided in this Section 14.2, all communications and notices provided for hereunder shall be in writing (including bank wire, telecopy or electronic facsimile transmission or similar writing) and shall be given to the other parties hereto at their respective addresses or telecopy numbers set forth on the signature pages hereof or at such other address or telecopy number as such Person may hereafter specify for the purpose of notice to each of the other parties hereto. Each such notice or other communication shall be effective (i) if given by telecopy, upon the receipt thereof, (ii) if given by mail, three (3) Business Days after 41
the time such communication is deposited in the mail with first class postage prepaid or (iii) if given by any other means, when received at the address specified in this Section 14.2. Borrower hereby authorizes the Agent to effect Advances and Interest Period and Interest Rate selections based on telephonic notices made by any Person whom the Agent in good faith believes to be acting on behalf of Borrower. Borrower agrees to deliver promptly to the Agent a written confirmation of each telephonic notice signed by an authorized officer of Borrower; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, the absence of such confirmation shall not affect the validity of such notice. If the written confirmation differs from the action taken by the Agent, the records of the Agent shall govern absent manifest error. Section 14.3 RATABLE PAYMENTS. If any Lender, whether by setoff or otherwise, has payment made to it with respect to any portion of the Obligations owing to such Lender (other than payments received pursuant to Section 10.2 or 10.3) in a greater proportion than that received by any other Lender entitled to receive a ratable share of such Obligations, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to purchase for cash without recourse or warranty a portion of such Obligations held by the other Lenders so that after such purchase each Lender will hold its ratable proportion of such Obligations; PROVIDED THAT if all or any portion of such excess amount is thereafter recovered from such Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. Section 14.4 PROTECTION OF AGENT'S SECURITY INTEREST. (a) Borrower agrees that from time to time, at its expense, it will promptly execute and deliver all instruments and documents, and take all actions, that may be necessary or desirable, or that the Agent may reasonably request, to perfect, protect or more fully evidence the Agent's security interest in the Collateral, or to enable the Agent or the Lenders to exercise and enforce their rights and remedies hereunder. At any time when an Amortization Event has occurred and is continuing, the Agent may, or the Agent may direct Borrower or the Servicer to, notify the Obligors of Receivables, at Borrower's expense, of the ownership or security interests of the Lenders under this Agreement and may also direct that payments of all amounts due or that become due under any or all Receivables be made directly to the Agent or its designee. Borrower or the Servicer (as applicable) shall, at any Lender's request, withhold the identity of such Lender in any such notification. (b) If any Loan Party fails to perform any of its obligations hereunder, the Agent or any Lender may (but shall not be required to) perform, or cause performance of, such obligations, and the Agent's or such Lender's actual and reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith shall be payable by Borrower as provided in Section 10.3. Each Loan Party irrevocably authorizes the Agent at any time and from time to time in the sole discretion of the Agent, and appoints the Agent as its attorney-in-fact, to act on behalf of such Loan Party (i) to execute on behalf of Borrower as debtor and to file financing statements necessary or desirable in the Agent's reasonable judgment to perfect and to maintain the perfection and priority of the interest of the Lenders in the Receivables and (ii) to file a carbon, photographic or other reproduction of this Agreement or any financing statement with respect to the Receivables as a financing statement in such offices as the Agent in its reasonable judgment deems necessary or desirable to perfect and to maintain the perfection and priority of the Agent's security interest in the Collateral, for the benefit of the Secured Parties.

All such Transaction Documents and communications relating to any Interest owed by Borrower and all figures set forth therein shall, for the sole purpose of computing the extent of obligations hereunder and under the other Transaction Documents be automatically recomputed by Borrower, and by any court considering the same, to give effect to the adjustments or credits required by this Section 14.14.

Prime Rate plus 2% PER ANNUM, such rate of interest changing when and as the Prime Rate changes. Section 4. WAIVERS BY PERFORMANCE GUARANTOR. Performance Guarantor waives notice of acceptance of this Undertaking, notice of any action taken or omitted by Recipient (or its assigns) in reliance on this Undertaking, and any requirement that Recipient (or its assigns) be diligent or prompt in making demands under this Undertaking, giving notice of any Termination Event, Amortization Event, other default or omission by any Originator or ECM or asserting any other rights of Recipient under this Undertaking. Performance Guarantor warrants that it has adequate means to obtain from each Originator or ECM, on a continuing basis, information concerning the financial condition of such Person and that it is not relying on Recipient to provide such information, now or in the future. Performance Guarantor also irrevocably waives all defenses (i) that at any time may be available in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations by virtue of any statute of limitations, valuation, stay, moratorium law or other similar law now or hereafter in effect or (ii) that arise under the law of suretyship, including impairment of collateral. Recipient (and its assigns) shall be at liberty, without giving notice to or obtaining the assent of Performance Guarantor and without relieving Performance Guarantor of any liability under this Undertaking, to deal with each Originator or ECM and with each other party who now is or after the date hereof becomes liable in any manner for any of the Guaranteed Obligations, in such manner as Recipient in its sole discretion deems fit, and to this end Performance Guarantor agrees that the validity and enforceability of this Undertaking, including without limitation, the provisions of Section 7 hereof, shall not be impaired or affected by any of the following: (a) any extension, modification or renewal of, or indulgence with respect to, or substitutions for, the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof or any agreement relating thereto at any time; (b) any failure or omission to enforce any right, power or remedy with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof or any agreement relating thereto, or any collateral securing the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof; (c) any waiver of any right, power or remedy or of any Termination Event, Amortization Event, or default with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof or any agreement relating thereto; (d) any release, surrender, compromise, settlement, waiver, subordination or modification, with or without consideration, of any other obligation of any person or entity with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof; (e) the enforceability or validity of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof or the genuineness, enforceability or validity of any agreement relating thereto or with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof; (f) the application of payments received from any source to the payment of any payment Obligations of any Originator or ECM or any part thereof or amounts which are not covered by this Undertaking even though Recipient (or its assigns) might lawfully have elected to apply such payments to any part or all of the payment Obligations of such Originator or ECM or to amounts which are not covered by this Undertaking; (g) the existence of any claim, setoff or other rights which Performance Guarantor may have at any time against any Originator or ECM in connection herewith or any unrelated transaction; (h) any assignment or transfer of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof; or (i) any failure on the part of any Originator or ECM to perform or comply with any term of the Agreements or any other document executed in connection therewith or delivered thereunder, all whether or not Performance Guarantor shall have had notice or knowledge of any act or omission referred to in the foregoing clauses (a) through (i) of this Section 4. 94
Section 5. UNENFORCEABILITY OF GUARANTEED OBLIGATIONS AGAINST ORIGINATORS. Notwithstanding (a) any change of ownership of any Originator or ECM or the insolvency, bankruptcy or any other change in the legal status of any Originator or ECM; (b) the change in or the imposition of any law, decree, regulation or other governmental act which does or might impair, delay or in any way affect the validity, enforceability or the payment when due of the Guaranteed Obligations; (c) the failure of any Originator, ECM or Performance Guarantor to maintain in full force, validity or effect or to obtain or renew when required all governmental and other approvals, licenses or consents required in connection with the Guaranteed Obligations or this Undertaking, or to take any other action required in connection with the performance of all obligations pursuant to the Guaranteed Obligations or this Undertaking; or (d) if any of the moneys included in the Guaranteed Obligations have become irrecoverable from any Originator or ECM for any other reason other than final payment in full of the payment Obligations in accordance with their terms, this Undertaking shall nevertheless be binding on Performance Guarantor. This Undertaking shall be in addition to any other guaranty or other security for the Guaranteed Obligations, and it shall not be rendered unenforceable by the invalidity of any such other guaranty or security. In the event that acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Originator or for any other reason with respect to any Originator or ECM, all such amounts then due and owing with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations under the terms of the Agreements, or any other agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with the Guaranteed Obligations, shall be immediately due and payable by Performance Guarantor. Section 6. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Performance Guarantor hereby represents and warrants to Recipient that: (a) EXISTENCE AND STANDING. Performance Guarantor is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its state of incorporation. Performance Guarantor is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation, and has and holds all corporate power and all governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals required to carry on its business in each jurisdiction in which its business is conducted except where the failure to so qualify or so hold could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. (b) AUTHORIZATION, EXECUTION AND DELIVERY; BINDING EFFECT. The execution and delivery by Performance Guarantor of this Undertaking, and the performance of its obligations hereunder, are within its corporate powers and authority and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on its part. This Undertaking has been duly executed and delivered by Performance Guarantor. This Undertaking constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Performance Guarantor enforceable against Performance Guarantor in accordance with their respective terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws relating to or limiting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law). (c) NO CONFLICT; GOVERNMENT CONSENT. The execution and delivery by Performance Guarantor of this Undertaking, and the performance of its obligations hereunder do not contravene or violate (i) its certificate or articles of incorporation or by-laws, (ii) any law, 95
rule or regulation applicable to it, (iii) any restrictions under any agreement, contract or instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of its property is bound, or (iv) any order, writ, judgment, award, injunction or decree binding on or affecting it or its property, and do not result in the creation or imposition of any Adverse Claim on assets of Performance Guarantor or its Subsidiaries (except as created hereunder) except, in any case, where such contravention or violation could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. (d) FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. The consolidated financial statements of Performance Guarantor and its consolidated Subsidiaries dated as of December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2003 heretofore delivered to Recipient have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied and fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Performance Guarantor and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of such dates and for the periods ended on such dates. Since the later of (i) March 31, 2004 and (ii) the last time this representation was made or deemed made, and except as disclosed in the reports made by the Performance Guarantor to the Securities and Exchange Commission, no event has occurred which would or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. (e) TAXES. Performance Guarantor has filed all United States federal tax returns and all other tax returns which are required to be filed and have paid all taxes due pursuant to said returns or pursuant to any assessment received by Performance Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries, except taxes (i) that are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which Performance Guarantor has set aside on its books adequate reserves or (ii) to the extent the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this Agreement, the United States income tax returns of Performance Guarantor have been audited by the Internal Revenue Service through the fiscal year ended December 31, 1995. No federal or state tax liens have been filed and no claims are being asserted with respect to any such taxes. The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of Performance Guarantor in respect of any taxes or other governmental charges are, in the judgment of Performance Guarantor, adequate. (f) LITIGATION AND CONTINGENT OBLIGATIONS. Except as disclosed in the filings made by Performance Guarantor with the Securities and Exchange Commission, there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to the best of Performance Guarantor's knowledge threatened against or affecting Performance Guarantor or any of its properties, in or before any court, arbitrator or other body, that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on (i) the business, properties, condition (financial or otherwise) or results of operations of Performance Guarantor and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (ii) the ability of Performance Guarantor to perform its obligations under this Undertaking, or (iii) the validity or enforceability of any of this Undertaking or the rights or remedies of Recipient hereunder. Performance Guarantor does not have any material Contingent Obligations not provided for or disclosed in the financial statements referred to in Section 6(d). Section 7. SUBROGATION; SUBORDINATION. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, until the Guaranteed Obligations are paid in full Performance Guarantor: (a) will not enforce or otherwise exercise any right of subrogation to any of the rights of Recipient, the Agent or any Lender against any Originator or ECM, (b) hereby waives all rights of 96
subrogation (whether contractual, under Section 509 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, at law or in equity or otherwise) to the claims of Recipient, the Agent and the Lenders against any Originator or ECM and all contractual, statutory or legal or equitable rights of contribution, reimbursement, indemnification and similar rights and "claims" (as that term is defined in the United States Bankruptcy Code) which Performance Guarantor might now have or hereafter acquire against any Originator or ECM that arise from the existence or performance of Performance Guarantor's obligations hereunder, (c) will not claim any setoff, recoupment or counterclaim against any Originator or ECM in respect of any liability of Performance Guarantor to such Originator or ECM and (d) waives any benefit of and any right to participate in any collateral security which may be held by Secured Parties, the Agent or the Lenders. The payment of any amounts due with respect to any indebtedness of any Originator or ECM now or hereafter owed to Performance Guarantor is hereby subordinated to the prior payment in full of all of the Guaranteed Obligations. Performance Guarantor agrees that, after the occurrence of any default in the payment or performance of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, Performance Guarantor will not demand, sue for or otherwise attempt to collect any such indebtedness of any Originator or ECM to Performance Guarantor until all of the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been paid and performed in full. If, notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, Performance Guarantor shall collect, enforce or receive any amounts in respect of such indebtedness while any Obligations are still unperformed or outstanding, such amounts shall be collected, enforced and received by Performance Guarantor as trustee for Recipient (and its assigns) and be paid over to Recipient (or its assigns) on account of the Guaranteed Obligations without affecting in any manner the liability of Performance Guarantor under the other provisions of this Undertaking. The provisions of this Section 7 shall be supplemental to and not in derogation of any rights and remedies of Recipient under any separate subordination agreement which Recipient may at any time and from time to time enter into with Performance Guarantor. Section 8. TERMINATION OF PERFORMANCE UNDERTAKING. Performance Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall continue in full force and effect until the Final Payout Date, PROVIDED THAT this Undertaking shall continue to be effective or shall be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment or other satisfaction of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned upon the bankruptcy, insolvency, or reorganization of any Originator or ECM or otherwise, as though such payment had not been made or other satisfaction occurred, whether or not Recipient (or its assigns) is in possession of this Undertaking. No invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability by reason of the federal bankruptcy code or any insolvency or other similar law, or any law or order of any government or agency thereof purporting to reduce, amend or otherwise affect the Guaranteed Obligations shall impair, affect, be a defense to or claim against the obligations of Performance Guarantor under this Undertaking. Section 9. EFFECT OF BANKRUPTCY. This Performance Undertaking shall survive the insolvency of any Originator or ECM and the commencement of any case or proceeding by or against any Originator or ECM under the federal bankruptcy code or other federal, state or other applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization statutes. No automatic stay under the federal bankruptcy code with respect to any Originator or ECM or other federal, state or other applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization statutes to which any Originator or ECM is subject shall postpone the obligations of Performance Guarantor under this Undertaking. 97
Section 10. SETOFF. Regardless of the other means of obtaining payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, Recipient (and its assigns) is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, but only during the existence of an Amortization Event, without notice to Performance Guarantor (any such notice being expressly waived by Performance Guarantor) and to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any deposits and other sums against the obligations of Performance Guarantor under this Undertaking then past due for more than two (2) Business Days. Section 11. TAXES. All payments to be made by Performance Guarantor hereunder shall be made free and clear of any deduction or withholding (except for taxes excluded under Section 10.1 of the Credit and Security Agreement). If Performance Guarantor is required by law to make any deduction or withholding on account of tax (except for taxes excluded under Section 10.1 of the Credit and Security Agreement) or otherwise from any such payment, the sum due from it in respect of such payment shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that, after the making of such deduction or withholding, Recipient receive a net sum equal to the sum which they would have received had no deduction or withholding been made. Section 12. FURTHER ASSURANCES. Performance Guarantor agrees that it will from time to time, at the request of Recipient (or its assigns), provide information relating to the business and affairs of Performance Guarantor as Recipient may reasonably request. Performance Guarantor also agrees to do all such things and execute all such documents as Recipient (or its assigns) may reasonably consider necessary or desirable to give full effect to this Undertaking and to perfect and preserve the rights and powers of Recipient hereunder. Section 13. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. This Performance Undertaking shall be binding upon Performance Guarantor, its successors and permitted assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by Recipient and its successors and assigns. Performance Guarantor may not assign or transfer any of its obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each of Recipient and the Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, Recipient may assign or otherwise transfer the Agreements, any other documents executed in connection therewith or delivered thereunder or any other agreement or note held by them evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with the Guaranteed Obligations, or sell participations in any interest therein, to any other entity or other person, and such other entity or other person shall thereupon become vested, to the extent set forth in the agreement evidencing such assignment, transfer or participation, with all the rights in respect thereof granted to the Secured Parties herein. Section 14. AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Undertaking nor consent to any departure by Performance Guarantor therefrom shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by Recipient, the Agent and Performance Guarantor. No failure on the part of Recipient to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. 98
Section 15. NOTICES. All notices and other communications provided for hereunder shall be made in writing and shall be addressed as follows: if to Performance Guarantor, at the address set forth beneath its signature hereto, and if to Recipient, at the addresses set forth beneath its signature to the Credit and Security Agreement, or at such other addresses as each of Performance Guarantor or any Recipient may designate in writing to the other.

Section 16. GOVERNING LAW. THIS UNDERTAKING SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS (AND NOT THE LAW OF CONFLICTS) OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. Section 17. CONSENT TO JURISDICTION. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EACH OF PROVIDER AND RECIPIENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY UNITED STATES FEDERAL OR NEW YORK STATE COURT SITTING IN THE BOROUGH OF MANHATTAN IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS UNDERTAKING, THE AGREEMENTS OR ANY OTHER DOCUMENT EXECUTED IN CONNECTION THEREWITH OR DELIVERED THEREUNDER AND EACH OF THE PERFORMANCE GUARANTOR AND RECIPIENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN ANY SUCH COURT AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE AS TO THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A COURT OR THAT SUCH COURT IS AN INCONVENIENT FORUM. Section 18. BANKRUPTCY PETITION. Performance Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding senior Indebtedness of Conduit, it will not institute against, or join any other Person in instituting against, Conduit any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings or other similar proceeding under the laws of the United States or any state of the United States. Section 19. MISCELLANEOUS. This Undertaking constitutes the entire agreement of Performance Guarantor with respect to the matters set forth herein. The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law or any other agreement, and this Undertaking shall be in addition to any other guaranty of or collateral security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations. The provisions of this Undertaking are severable, and in any action or proceeding involving any state corporate law, or any state or federal bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other law affecting the rights of creditors generally, if the obligations of Performance Guarantor hereunder would otherwise be held or determined to be avoidable, invalid or unenforceable on account of the amount of Performance Guarantor's liability under this Undertaking, then, notwithstanding any other provision of this Undertaking to the contrary, the amount of such liability shall, without any further action by Performance Guarantor or Recipient, be automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount 99
that is valid and enforceable as determined in such action or proceeding. Any provisions of this Undertaking which are prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. Unless otherwise specified, references herein to "SECTION" shall mean a reference to sections of this Undertaking. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Performance Guarantor has caused this Undertaking to be executed and delivered as of the date first above written. EQUIFAX INC.

Each of the Originators and Buyer intend the transactions contemplated hereby to be true sales to Buyer by such Originator of the Receivables originated by it, providing Buyer with the full benefits of ownership of such Receivables, and none of the Originators nor Buyer intends these transactions to be, or for any purpose to be characterized as, loans from Buyer to such Originator.

Except for the Purchase Price Credits owed to Buyer pursuant to SECTION 1.4, the sale of Receivables hereunder by each Originator is made without recourse to such Originator; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) such Originator shall be liable to Buyer for all representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities made by such Originator pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Documents to which such Originator is a party, and (ii) such sale does not constitute and is not intended to result in an assumption by Buyer or any assignee thereof of any 2
obligation of such Originator or any other Person arising in connection with the Receivables, the related Contracts and/or other Related Security or any other obligations of such Originator. In view of the intention of the parties hereto that each Purchase of Receivables made hereunder shall constitute a sale of such Receivables rather than loans secured thereby, each Originator agrees that it will, on or prior to the date hereof and in accordance with SECTION 4.1(E)(II), mark its books and records including aged trial balance with respect to the Receivables originated by it with a legend acceptable to Buyer and to the Agent (as Buyer's assignee), evidencing that Buyer has purchased such Receivables as provided in this Agreement and to note in its financial statements that its Receivables have been sold to Buyer. Upon the request of Buyer or the Agent (as Buyer's assignee), each Originator will execute and file such financing or continuation statements, or amendments thereto or assignments thereof, and such other instruments or notices, as may be necessary or appropriate to perfect and maintain the perfection of Buyer's ownership interest in the Receivables originated by such Originator and the Related Security and Collections with respect thereto, or as Buyer or the Agent (as Buyer's assignee) may reasonably request. Section 1.3 PAYMENT FOR THE PURCHASES. (a) The Purchase Price for the Purchase from each Originator of its Receivables in existence as of the close of business on the Initial Cutoff Date (other than the Initial Contributed Receivables) shall be payable in full by Buyer to such Originator on the date hereof, and shall be paid to such Originator in the following manner: (i) by delivery of immediately available funds, and (ii) the balance, by delivery of the proceeds of a revolving loan from such Originator to Buyer (a "REVOLVING LOAN") in an amount not to exceed the least of (A) the remaining unpaid portion of such Purchase Price, (B) the maximum Revolving Loan that could be borrowed without rendering Buyer insolvent, and (C) fifteen percent (15%) of such Purchase Price. Each Originator is hereby authorized by Buyer to endorse on the schedule attached to its Revolving Note an appropriate notation evidencing the date and amount of each advance thereunder, as well as the date of each payment with respect thereto, PROVIDED THAT the failure to make such notation shall not affect any obligation of Buyer thereunder. The Purchase Price for each Receivable coming into existence after the Initial Cutoff Date shall be due and owing in full by Buyer to the applicable Originator or its designee on the date each such Receivable came into existence (except that Buyer may, with respect to any such Purchase Price, offset against such Purchase Price any amounts owed by such Originator to Buyer hereunder and which have become due but remain unpaid) and shall be paid to such Originator in the manner provided in the following paragraphs (b), (c) and (d). (b) With respect to any Receivables coming into existence after the Initial Cutoff Date, on each Settlement Date, Buyer shall pay the applicable Originator the Purchase Price therefor in accordance with SECTION 1.3(D) and in the following manner: 3
FIRST, by delivery to the applicable Originator or its designee of immediately available funds, to the extent of funds available to Buyer from cash on hand; SECOND, by delivery to the applicable Originator or its designee of the proceeds of a Revolving Loan, PROVIDED THAT the making of any such Revolving Loan shall be subject to the provisions set forth in SECTION 1.3(A)(II); and THIRD, solely in the case of Receivables originated by EIS, unless the Termination Date has occurred in accordance with this Agreement, by accepting a contribution to its capital in an amount equal to the remaining unpaid balance of such Purchase Price. Subject to the limitations set forth in SECTION 1.3(A)(II), each Originator irrevocably agrees to advance each Revolving Loan requested by Buyer on or prior to the Termination Date. The Revolving Loans owing to each Originator shall be evidenced by, and shall be payable in accordance with the terms and provisions of its Revolving Note and shall be payable solely from funds which Buyer is not required under the Credit and Security Agreement to set aside for the benefit of, or otherwise pay over to, the Lenders. (c) From and after the Termination Date, (i) no Originator shall be obligated to (but may, at its option) sell Receivables to Buyer, or (ii) EIS shall not be obligated to (but may, at its option) contribute Receivables to Buyer's capital pursuant to clause THIRD of SECTION 1.3(B). (d) Although the Purchase Price for each Receivable coming into existence after the Initial Cutoff Date shall be due and payable in full by Buyer to the applicable Originator on the date such Receivable came into existence, settlement of the Purchase Price between Buyer and such Originator shall be effected on a monthly basis on Settlement Dates with respect to all Receivables originated by such Originator during the same Calculation Period and based on the information contained in the Purchase Report delivered by such Originator for the Calculation Period then most recently ended. Although settlement shall be effected on Settlement Dates, increases or decreases in the amount owing under the Revolving Note made pursuant to SECTION 1.3 and any contribution of capital by EIS to Buyer made pursuant to SECTION 1.3(B) shall be deemed to have occurred and shall be effective as of the last Business Day of the Calculation Period to which such settlement relates. Section 1.4 PURCHASE PRICE CREDIT ADJUSTMENTS. If on any day: (a) the Outstanding Balance of a Receivable purchased from any Originator is: (i) reduced as a result of any defective or rejected or returned goods or services, any discount or any adjustment or otherwise by such Originator (other than as a result of such Receivable becoming a Defaulted Receivable or to reflect cash Collections on account of such Receivable), 4
(ii) reduced or canceled as a result of a setoff in respect of any claim by any Person (whether such claim arises out of the same or a related transaction or an unrelated transaction), or (b) any of the representations and warranties set forth in SECTIONS 2.1(H), (I), (J), (L), (R), (S), (T), (U), the second sentence of SECTION 2.1(Q) hereof and the last clause (relating to bulk sales laws) of SECTION 2.1(C) are not true when made or deemed made with respect to any Receivable, then, in such event, Buyer shall be entitled to a credit (each, a "PURCHASE PRICE CREDIT") against the Purchase Price otherwise payable to the applicable Originator hereunder equal to (x) in the case of a partial reduction, the amount of such reduction, and (y) in the case of a total reduction or cancellation, the lesser of the total Purchase Price paid for and the Outstanding Balance of such Receivable (calculated before giving effect to the applicable reduction or cancellation). If such Purchase Price Credit exceeds the Original Balance of the Receivables originated by the applicable Originator on any day, such Originator shall pay the remaining amount of such Purchase Price Credit in cash immediately, PROVIDED THAT if the Termination Date has not occurred, such Originator shall be allowed to deduct the remaining amount of such Purchase Price Credit from any indebtedness owed to it under its Revolving Note. Section 1.5 PAYMENTS AND COMPUTATIONS, ETC. All amounts to be paid or deposited by Buyer hereunder shall be paid or deposited in accordance with the terms hereof on the day when due in immediately available funds to the account of the applicable Originator designated from time to time by such Originator or as otherwise directed by such Originator. In the event that any payment owed by any Person hereunder becomes due on a day that is not a Business Day, then such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day. If any Person fails to pay any amount hereunder when due, such Person agrees to pay, on demand, the Default Fee in respect thereof until paid in full; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such Default Fee shall not at any time exceed the maximum rate permitted by applicable law. All computations of interest payable hereunder shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of days (including the first but excluding the last day) elapsed. Section 1.6 LICENSE OF SOFTWARE. (a) To the extent that any software used by any Originator to account for the Receivables originated by it is non-transferable, such Originator hereby grants to each of Buyer, the Agent and the Servicer an irrevocable, non-exclusive license to use, without royalty or payment of any kind, all such software used by such Originator to account for such Receivables, to the extent necessary to administer such Receivables, whether such software is owned by such Originator or is owned by others and used by such Originator under license agreements with respect thereto, PROVIDED THAT should the consent of any licensor of such software be required for the grant of the license described herein to be effective: (x) the license granted herein shall not apply to such software unless and until such consent is obtained, and (y) such Originator hereby agrees that, upon the request of Buyer (or Buyer's assignee) made at any time during the continuation of a Termination Event or an Amortization Event, such Originator will use its reasonable efforts (i) to obtain the consent of such third-party licensor, and (ii) in advance of obtaining such consent, in connection with each Review pursuant to SECTION 4.1(D), 5
to make personnel who are covered by such Originator's license of such software and knowledgeable about its use, available to Buyer (or Buyer's assignee) to test data or generate such reports relating the Receivables that may be reasonably requested. The license granted hereby shall be irrevocable until the later to occur of (i) indefeasible payment in full of the Obligations (as defined in the Credit and Security Agreement), and (ii) the date each of this Agreement, the Second Step Receivables Sale Agreement and the Credit and Security Agreement terminates in accordance with its terms. (b) Each Originator (i) shall take such action requested by Buyer and/or the Agent (as Buyer's assignee), from time to time hereafter, that may be necessary or appropriate to ensure that Buyer and its assigns under the Credit and Security Agreement have an enforceable ownership or security interest in the Records relating to the Receivables purchased from such Originator hereunder, and (ii) shall use its reasonable efforts to ensure that Buyer, the Agent and the Servicer each has an enforceable right (whether by license or sublicense or otherwise) in accordance with SECTION 1.6(A) to use all of the computer software used to account for such Receivables and/or to recreate such Records. Section 1.7 CHARACTERIZATION. If, notwithstanding the intention of the parties expressed in SECTION 1.2(c), any sale or contribution by an Originator to Buyer of Receivables hereunder shall be characterized as a secured loan and not a sale or such sale shall for any reason be ineffective or unenforceable, then this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute a security agreement under the UCC and other applicable law. For this purpose and without being in derogation of the parties' intention that the sale of Receivables by each Originator hereunder shall constitute a true sale thereof, such Originator hereby grants to Buyer a duly perfected security interest in all of such Originator's right, title and interest in, to and under all Receivables of such Originator which are now existing or hereafter arising, all Collections and Related Security with respect thereto, each Lock-Box and Collection Account, all other rights and payments relating to such Receivables and all proceeds of the foregoing to secure the prompt and complete payment of a loan deemed to have been made in an amount equal to the Purchase Price of the Receivables purchased from such Originator together with all other obligations of such Originator hereunder, which security interest shall be prior to all other Adverse Claims thereto. Buyer and its assigns shall have, in addition to the rights and remedies which they may have under this Agreement, all other rights and remedies provided to a secured creditor under the UCC and other applicable law, which rights and remedies shall be cumulative. ARTICLE II REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES Section 2.1 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ORIGINATORS.

Each Receivable, together with the Contract related thereto, does not contravene any laws, rules or regulations applicable thereto (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, laws, rules and regulations relating to truth in lending, fair credit billing, fair credit reporting, equal credit opportunity, fair debt collection practices and privacy), and no part of such Contract is in violation of any such law, rule or regulation, except where such contravention or violation could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. (r) COMPLIANCE WITH CREDIT AND COLLECTION POLICY. Such Originator has complied in all material respects with the Credit and Collection Policy with regard to each Receivable originated by it and the related Contract, and has not made any material change to 9
such Credit and Collection Policy, except such material change as to which Buyer (or its assigns) has been notified in accordance with SECTION 4.1(A)(VII). (s) PAYMENTS TO SUCH ORIGINATOR. With respect to each Receivable originated by such Originator and sold to Buyer hereunder, the Purchase Price received by such Originator constitutes reasonably equivalent value in consideration therefor.

The manner in which such Originator accounts for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in its financial statements does not jeopardize the characterization of the transactions contemplated herein as being true sales. ARTICLE III CONDITIONS OF PURCHASE Section 3.1 CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO PURCHASE.

Section 3.2 CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO SUBSEQUENT PAYMENTS. Buyer's obligation to pay for Receivables coming into existence after the Initial Cutoff Date shall be subject to the further conditions precedent that: (a) the Facility Termination Date shall not have occurred under the Credit and Security Agreement; (b) Buyer (or its assigns) shall have received such other approvals, opinions or documents as it may reasonably request and (c) on the date such Receivable came into existence, the following statements shall be true (and acceptance of the proceeds of any payment for such Receivable shall be deemed a representation and warranty by such Originator that such statements are then true): (i) the representations and warranties set forth in ARTICLE II are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the date such Receivable came into existence as though made on and as of such date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the preceding 10

The failure of such Originator to satisfy any of the foregoing conditions precedent, however, shall give rise to a right of Buyer to rescind the related purchase and direct such Originator to pay to Buyer an amount equal to the Purchase Price payment that shall have been made with respect to any Receivables related thereto.

(c) MODIFICATIONS TO CONTRACTS AND CREDIT AND COLLECTION POLICY.

RECEIVABLES SALE AGREEMENT THIS RECEIVABLES SALE AGREEMENT, dated as of September 7, 2004 (as the same may from time to time hereafter be amended, supplemented, restated or otherwise modified, this "AGREEMENT" or the "SECOND STEP RECEIVABLES SALE AGREEMENT"), is by and among EQUIFAX CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC., a Georgia corporation ("SELLER" or "ECM"), and Equifax Receivables Finance LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("BUYER"). UNLESS DEFINED ELSEWHERE HEREIN, CAPITALIZED TERMS USED IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL HAVE THE MEANINGS ASSIGNED TO SUCH TERMS IN EXHIBIT I HERETO (OR, IF NOT DEFINED IN EXHIBIT I HERETO, THE MEANING ASSIGNED TO SUCH TERM IN EXHIBIT I TO THE CREDIT AND SECURITY AGREEMENT). PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS Pursuant to a Receivables Sale Agreement dated as of September 7, 2004, by and among Equifax Inc., a Georgia corporation ("PARENT"), Equifax Information Services LLC, a Georgia limited liability company ("EIS"), Equifax Direct Marketing Solutions, a Georgia limited liability company, Equifax Information Services of Puerto Rico Inc., a Georgia corporation, and Compliance Data Center, Inc., a Georgia corporation (each of the foregoing, an "ORIGINATOR" and collectively, the "ORIGINATORS"), and Equifax Capital Management, Inc., a Georgia corporation ("BUYER") (as the same may from time to time hereafter be amended, supplemented, restated or otherwise modified, the "FIRST STEP RECEIVABLES SALE AGREEMENT"), Seller has acquired from the Originators, and from time to time hereafter will acquire from the Originators, Receivables, together with the Related Security and Collections with respect thereto. Seller wishes to sell and assign to Buyer, and Buyer wishes to purchase from Seller, all of Seller's right, title and interest in and to the Receivables, together with the Related Security and Collections with respect thereto. Seller and Buyer intend the transactions contemplated hereby to be true sales to Buyer by Seller of the Receivables, providing Buyer with the full benefits of ownership of such Receivables, and neither Seller nor Buyer intends these transactions to be, or for any purpose to be characterized as, loans from Buyer to Seller. Buyer may finance a portion of the Purchase Price of the Receivables by pledging the Receivables and borrowing under the Credit and Security Agreement. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the mutual agreements herein contained and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows: 1
ARTICLE I AMOUNTS AND TERMS OF THE PURCHASE Section 1.1 INITIAL CONTRIBUTION OF RECEIVABLES. On the date hereof, Seller does hereby contribute, assign, transfer, set-over and otherwise convey to Buyer, and Buyer does hereby accept from Seller as a contribution to Buyer's capital, all of Seller's right, title and interest in and to the Initial Contributed Receivables, together with all Related Security relating thereto and all Collections thereof. Section 1.2 PURCHASE OF RECEIVABLES. (a) Effective on the date hereof, in consideration for the Purchase Price paid to Seller and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, Seller does hereby sell, assign, transfer, set-over and otherwise convey to Buyer, without recourse (except to the extent expressly provided herein), and Buyer does hereby purchase from Seller, all of Seller's right, title and interest in and to all Receivables in which Seller has any rights as of the date hereof (other than the Initial Contributed Receivables) and all Receivables in which Seller hereafter acquires any rights through and including the Termination Date, together, in each case, with all Related Security relating thereto and all Collections thereof. In accordance with the preceding sentence, on the date hereof Buyer shall acquire all of Seller's right, title and interest in and to all Receivables (other than the Initial Contributed Receivables) in which Seller has any rights as of the date hereof and all Receivables in which Seller thereafter acquires any rights through and including the Termination Date, together with all Related Security relating thereto and all Collections thereof. Buyer shall be obligated to pay the Purchase Price for the Receivables purchased hereunder in accordance with SECTION 1.3. (b) On the 20th day of each month hereafter (or if any such day is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day thereafter, Seller shall (or shall require the Servicer to) deliver to Buyer a report in substantially the form of Exhibit VII hereto (each such report being herein called a "PURCHASE REPORT") with respect to the Receivables sold by Seller to Buyer during the Settlement Period then most recently ended. In addition to, and not in limitation of, the foregoing, in connection with the payment of the Purchase Price for any Receivables purchased hereunder, Buyer may request that Seller deliver, and Seller shall deliver, such approvals, opinions, information or documents as Buyer may reasonably request. (c) It is the intention of the parties hereto that each Purchase of Receivables from Seller made hereunder shall constitute a sale, which sale is absolute and irrevocable and provides Buyer with the full benefits of ownership of the Receivables. Except for the Purchase Price Credits owed to Buyer pursuant to SECTION 1.4, the sale of Receivables hereunder by Seller is made without recourse to Seller; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) Seller shall be liable to Buyer for all representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities made by Seller pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Documents to which Seller is a party, and (ii) such sale does not constitute and is not intended to result in an assumption by Buyer or any assignee thereof of any obligation of Seller or any other Person arising in connection with the Receivables, the related Contracts and/or other Related Security or any other obligations of Seller. In view of the intention of the parties hereto that each Purchase of Receivables made hereunder shall constitute a sale of such Receivables rather than loans secured thereby, Seller agrees that it will, on or prior to the date 2
hereof and in accordance with SECTION 4.1(E)(II), mark its books and records including aged trial balance with respect to the Receivables with a legend acceptable to Buyer and to the Agent (as Buyer's assignee), evidencing that Buyer has purchased such Receivables as provided in this Agreement and to note in its financial statements that its Receivables have been sold to Buyer. Upon the request of Buyer or the Agent (as Buyer's assignee), Seller will execute and file such financing or continuation statements, or amendments thereto or assignments thereof, and such other instruments or notices, as may be necessary or appropriate to perfect and maintain the perfection of Buyer's ownership interest in the Receivables and the Related Security and Collections with respect thereto, or as Buyer or the Agent (as Buyer's assignee) may reasonably request. Section 1.3 PAYMENT FOR THE PURCHASES. (a) The Purchase Price for the Purchase from Seller of Receivables as of the date hereof (other than the Initial Contributed Receivables) shall be payable in full by Buyer to Seller on the date hereof, and shall be paid to Seller in the following manner: (i) by delivery of immediately available funds, and (ii) the balance, by delivery of the proceeds of a subordinated revolving loan from Seller to Buyer (a "SUBORDINATED LOAN") in an amount not to exceed the least of (A) the remaining unpaid portion of such Purchase Price, (B) the maximum Subordinated Loan that could be borrowed without rendering Buyer's Net Worth less than the Required Capital Amount, and (C) fifteen percent (15%) of such Purchase Price. Seller is hereby authorized by Buyer to endorse on the schedule attached to its Subordinated Note an appropriate notation evidencing the date and amount of each advance thereunder, as well as the date of each payment with respect thereto, PROVIDED THAT the failure to make such notation shall not affect any obligation of Buyer thereunder. The Purchase Price for each Receivable acquired by Seller after the date hereof shall be due and owing in full by Buyer to Seller or its designee on the date each such Receivable is acquired by Seller (except that Buyer may, with respect to any such Purchase Price, offset against such Purchase Price any amounts owed by Seller to Buyer hereunder and which have become due but remain unpaid) and shall be paid to Seller in the manner provided in the following paragraphs (b), (c) and (d). (b) With respect to any Receivables acquired by Seller after the date hereof, on each Settlement Date, Buyer shall pay Seller the Purchase Price therefor in accordance with SECTION 1.3(D) and in the following manner: FIRST, by delivery to Seller or its designee of immediately available funds, to the extent of funds available to Buyer from cash on hand or from borrowings under the Credit and Security Agreement; SECOND, by delivery to Seller or its designee of the proceeds of a Subordinated Loan, PROVIDED THAT the making of any such Subordinated Loan shall be subject to the provisions set forth in SECTION 1.3(A)(II); and 3
THIRD, unless the Termination Date has occurred in accordance with this Agreement, by accepting a contribution to its capital in an amount equal to the remaining unpaid balance of such Purchase Price. Subject to the limitations set forth in SECTION 1.3(A)(II), Seller irrevocably agrees to advance each Subordinated Loan requested by Buyer on or prior to the Termination Date. The Subordinated Loans owing to Seller shall be evidenced by, and shall be payable in accordance with the terms and provisions of its Subordinated Note and shall be payable solely from funds which Buyer is not required under the Credit and Security Agreement to set aside for the benefit of, or otherwise pay over to, the Lenders. (c) From and after the Termination Date, Seller shall not be obligated to (but may, at its option) sell or contribute Receivables to Buyer. (d) Although the Purchase Price for each Receivable acquired by Seller after the date hereof shall be due and payable in full by Buyer to Seller on the date such Receivable was acquired by Seller, settlement of the Purchase Price between Buyer and Seller shall be effected on a monthly basis on Settlement Dates with respect to all Receivables acquired by Seller during the same Calculation Period and based on the information contained in the Purchase Report delivered by Seller for the Calculation Period then most recently ended. Although settlement shall be effected on Settlement Dates, increases or decreases in the amount owing under the Subordinated Note made pursuant to SECTION 1.3 and any contribution of capital to Buyer made pursuant to SECTION 1.3(B) shall be deemed to have occurred and shall be effective as of the last Business Day of the Calculation Period to which such settlement relates. Section 1.4 PURCHASE PRICE CREDIT ADJUSTMENTS. If on any day: (a) the Outstanding Balance of a Receivable purchased from Seller is: (i) reduced as a result of any defective or rejected or returned goods or services, any discount or any adjustment or otherwise by Seller (other than as a result of such Receivable becoming a Defaulted Receivable or to reflect cash Collections on account of such Receivable), (ii) reduced or canceled as a result of a setoff in respect of any claim by any Person (whether such claim arises out of the same or a related transaction or an unrelated transaction), or (b) any of the representations and warranties set forth in SECTIONS 2.1(H), (I), (J), (L), (R), (S), (T), (U), the second sentence of SECTION 2.1(Q) hereof and the last clause (relating to bulk sales laws) of SECTION 2.1(C) are not true when made or deemed made with respect to any Receivable, then, in such event, Buyer shall be entitled to a credit (each, a "PURCHASE PRICE CREDIT") against the Purchase Price otherwise payable to Seller hereunder equal to (x) in the case of a partial reduction, the amount of such reduction, and (y) in the case of a total reduction or cancellation, the lesser of the total Purchase Price paid for and the Outstanding Balance of such Receivable (calculated before giving effect to the applicable reduction or cancellation). If such Purchase 4
Price Credit exceeds the Original Balance of the Receivables sold by Seller on any day, Seller shall pay the remaining amount of such Purchase Price Credit in cash immediately, PROVIDED that if the Termination Date has not occurred, Seller shall be allowed to deduct the remaining amount of such Purchase Price Credit from any indebtedness owed to it under its Subordinated Note. Section 1.5 PAYMENTS AND COMPUTATIONS, ETC. All amounts to be paid or deposited by Buyer hereunder shall be paid or deposited in accordance with the terms hereof on the day when due in immediately available funds to the account of Seller designated from time to time by Seller or as otherwise directed by Seller. In the event that any payment owed by any Person hereunder becomes due on a day that is not a Business Day, then such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day. If any Person fails to pay any amount hereunder when due, such Person agrees to pay, on demand, the Default Fee in respect thereof until paid in full; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such Default Fee shall not at any time exceed the maximum rate permitted by applicable law. All computations of interest payable hereunder shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of days (including the first but excluding the last day) elapsed. Section 1.6 LICENSE OF SOFTWARE. (a) To the extent that any software used by Seller to account for the Receivables is non-transferable, Seller hereby grants to each of Buyer, the Agent and the Servicer an irrevocable, non-exclusive license to use, without royalty or payment of any kind, all such software used by Seller to account for such Receivables, to the extent necessary to administer such Receivables, whether such software is owned by Seller or is owned by others and used by Seller under license agreements with respect thereto, PROVIDED THAT should the consent of any licensor of such software be required for the grant of the license described herein to be effective: (x) the license granted herein shall not apply to such software unless and until such consent is obtained, and (y) Seller hereby agrees that, upon the request of Buyer (or Buyer's assignee) made at any time during the continuation of a Termination Event or an Amortization Event, Seller will use its reasonable efforts (i) to obtain the consent of such third-party licensor, and (ii) in advance of obtaining such consent, in connection with each Review pursuant to SECTION 4.1(D), to make personnel who are covered by Seller's license of such software and knowledgeable about its use, available to Buyer (or Buyer's assignee) to test data or generate such reports relating the Receivables that may be reasonably requested. The license granted hereby shall be irrevocable until the later to occur of (i) indefeasible payment in full of the Obligations (as defined in the Credit and Security Agreement), and (ii) the date each of the First Step Receivables Sale Agreement, this Agreement and the Credit and Security Agreement terminates in accordance with its terms. (b) Seller (i) shall take such action requested by Buyer and/or the Agent (as Buyer's assignee), from time to time hereafter, that may be necessary or appropriate to ensure that Buyer and its assigns under the Credit and Security Agreement have an enforceable ownership or security interest in the Records relating to the Receivables, and (ii) shall use its reasonable efforts to ensure that Buyer, the Agent and the Servicer each has an enforceable right (whether by license or sublicense or otherwise) in accordance with SECTION 1.6(A) to use all of the computer software used to account for such Receivables and/or to recreate such Records. 5
Section 1.7 CHARACTERIZATION. If, notwithstanding the intention of the parties expressed in SECTION 1.2(c), any sale or contribution by Seller to Buyer of Receivables hereunder shall be characterized as a secured loan and not a sale or such sale shall for any reason be ineffective or unenforceable, then this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute a security agreement under the UCC and other applicable law. For this purpose and without being in derogation of the parties' intention that the sale of Receivables by Seller hereunder shall constitute a true sale thereof, Seller hereby grants to Buyer a duly perfected security interest in all of Seller's right, title and interest in, to and under all Receivables of Seller which are now existing or hereafter arising, all Collections and Related Security with respect thereto, each Lock-Box and Collection Account, all other rights and payments relating to such Receivables and all proceeds of the foregoing to secure the prompt and complete payment of a loan deemed to have been made in an amount equal to the Purchase Price of the Receivables purchased from Seller together with all other obligations of Seller hereunder, which security interest shall be prior to all other Adverse Claims thereto. Buyer and its assigns shall have, in addition to the rights and remedies which they may have under this Agreement, all other rights and remedies provided to a secured creditor under the UCC and other applicable law, which rights and remedies shall be cumulative. ARTICLE II REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES Section 2.1 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER. Seller hereby represents and warrants to Buyer on the date hereof, on the date of each Purchase from Seller hereunder and on each date that any Receivable is acquired by Seller on or after the date of such Purchase, that: (a) EXISTENCE AND POWER. Seller is a limited liability company, duly organized under the laws of the jurisdiction set forth after its name in the preamble to this Agreement (the "APPLICABLE JURISDICTION"), and no other jurisdiction, and as to which such Applicable Jurisdiction must maintain a public record showing the limited liability company to have been organized. Seller is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its Applicable Jurisdiction and is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign entity, and has and holds all power and all governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals required to carry on its business in each jurisdiction in which its business is conducted except where the failure to so qualify or so hold could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. (b) POWER AND AUTHORITY; DUE AUTHORIZATION, EXECUTION AND DELIVERY. The execution and delivery by Seller of this Agreement and each other Transaction Document to which it is a party, and the performance of its obligations hereunder and thereunder, and Seller's use of the proceeds of the Purchases made from it hereunder, are within its organizational powers and authority and have been duly authorized by all necessary organizational action on its part. This Agreement and each other Transaction Document to which Seller is a party has been duly executed and delivered by Seller. (c) NO CONFLICT. The execution and delivery by Seller of this Agreement and each other Transaction Document to which it is a party, and the performance of its obligations hereunder and thereunder do not contravene or violate (i) its Organizational Documents, (ii) any law, rule or regulation applicable to it, (iii) any restrictions under any agreement, contract or 6
instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of its property is bound, or (iv) any order, writ, judgment, award, injunction or decree binding on or affecting it or its property, and do not result in the creation or imposition of any Adverse Claim on assets of Seller or its Subsidiaries (except as created hereunder) except, in any case, where such contravention or violation could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; and no transaction contemplated hereby requires compliance with any bulk sales act or similar law. (d) GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORIZATION. Other than the filing of the financing statements required hereunder, no authorization or approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body is required for the due execution and delivery by Seller of this Agreement and each other Transaction Document to which it is a party and the performance of its obligations hereunder and thereunder. (e) ACTIONS, SUITS. There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending, or to the best of Seller's knowledge, threatened, against or affecting Seller, or any of its properties, in or before any court, arbitrator or other body, that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Seller is not in default with respect to any order of any court, arbitrator or governmental body. (f) BINDING EFFECT. This Agreement and each other Transaction Document to which Seller is a party constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of Seller enforceable against Seller in accordance with their respective terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws relating to or limiting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law). (g) ACCURACY OF INFORMATION. All information heretofore furnished by Seller or any of its Affiliates to Buyer (or its assigns) for purposes of or in connection with this Agreement, any of the other Transaction Documents or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby is, and all such information hereafter furnished by Seller or any of its Affiliates to Buyer (or its assigns) will be, true and accurate in every material respect on the date such information is stated or certified and does not and will not contain any material misstatement of fact or omit to state a material fact or any fact necessary to make the statements contained therein, taken as a whole, not misleading; provided that, with respect to any projected financial information, Seller represents only that such information was prepared in good faith based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time. (h) USE OF PROCEEDS. No portion of any Purchase Price payment hereunder will be used by Seller (i) for a purpose that violates, or would be inconsistent with, any law, rule or regulation applicable to Seller or (ii) to acquire any margin stock in violation of Regulation T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. (i) GOOD TITLE. Immediately prior to the applicable Purchase from Seller hereunder and upon the creation of each Receivable acquired by Seller after the date hereof, Seller (i) is the legal and beneficial owner of such Receivables and (ii) is the legal and beneficial owner of the Related Security with respect thereto or possesses a valid and perfected security interest therein, in each case, free and clear of any Adverse Claim, except 7
Permitted Encumbrances. There have been duly filed all financing statements or other similar instruments or documents necessary under the UCC (or any comparable law) of all appropriate jurisdictions to perfect Seller's ownership interest in each such Receivable, its Collections and the Related Security. (j) PERFECTION. This Agreement, together with the filing of the financing statements contemplated hereby, is effective to transfer to Buyer (and Buyer shall acquire from Seller) (i) legal and equitable title to, with the right to sell and encumber each Receivable, whether now existing and hereafter arising, together with the Collections with respect thereto, and (ii) all of Seller's right, title and interest in the Related Security associated with each such Receivable, in each case, free and clear of any Adverse Claim, except as created by the Transactions Documents. There have been duly filed all financing statements or other similar instruments or documents necessary under the UCC (or any comparable law) of all appropriate jurisdictions to perfect Buyer's ownership interest in such Receivables, the Related Security and the Collections. Originator's jurisdiction of organization is a jurisdiction whose law generally requires information concerning the existence of a nonpossessory security interest to be made generally available in a filing, record or registration system as a condition or result of such a security interest's obtaining priority over the rights of a lien creditor which respect to collateral. (k) PLACES OF BUSINESS AND LOCATIONS OF RECORDS. The principal places of business and chief executive office and jurisdiction of organization of Seller and the offices where it keeps all of its Records are located at the address(es) listed on EXHIBIT II or such other locations of which Buyer has been notified in accordance with SECTION 4.2(A) in jurisdictions where all action required by SECTION 4.2(A) has been taken and completed. Seller's Federal Employer Identification Number and organizational identification number are correctly set forth on EXHIBIT II. (l) COLLECTIONS. The conditions and requirements set forth in SECTION 4.1(J) have at all times been satisfied and duly performed. The names and addresses of all Collection Banks, together with the account numbers of the Collection Accounts of Seller at each Collection Bank and the post office box number of each Lock-Box, are listed on EXHIBIT III. Seller has not granted any Person, other than Buyer (and its assigns) dominion and control of any Lock-Box or Collection Account, or the right to take dominion and control of any such Lock-Box or Collection Account at a future time or upon the occurrence of a future event. (m) MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT. Since March 31, 2004, and except as disclosed in the reports made by the Parent to the Securities and Exchange Commission prior to the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. (n) NAMES. The name in which Seller has executed this Agreement is identical to the name of Seller as indicated on the public record of its jurisdiction of organization which shows Seller to have been organized. In the past five (5) years, Seller has not used any limited liability company names, trade names or assumed names other than the name in which it has executed this Agreement except as disclosed on Exhibit II attached hereto. 8
(o) OWNERSHIP OF BUYER. Parent owns, directly or indirectly, 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of EIS. EIS owns directly 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Buyer. Such equity interests are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and there are no options, warrants or other rights to acquire securities of Buyer. (p) NOT A HOLDING COMPANY OR AN INVESTMENT COMPANY. Seller is not a "HOLDING COMPANY" or a "SUBSIDIARY HOLDING COMPANY" of a "HOLDING COMPANY" within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended, or any successor statute. Seller is not an "INVESTMENT COMPANY" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or any successor statute. (q) COMPLIANCE WITH LAW. Seller has complied in all respects with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, orders, writs, judgments, injunctions, decrees or awards to which it may be subject, except where the failure to so comply could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each Receivable, together with the Contract related thereto, does not contravene any laws, rules or regulations applicable thereto (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, laws, rules and regulations relating to truth in lending, fair credit billing, fair credit reporting, equal credit opportunity, fair debt collection practices and privacy), and no part of such Contract is in violation of any such law, rule or regulation, except where such contravention or violation could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. (r) COMPLIANCE WITH CREDIT AND COLLECTION POLICY. Seller has complied in all material respects with the Credit and Collection Policy with regard to each Receivable and the related Contract, and has not made any material change to such Credit and Collection Policy, except such material change as to which Buyer (or its assigns) has been notified in accordance with SECTION 4.1(A)(VII). (s) PAYMENTS TO SELLER. With respect to each Receivable sold to Buyer hereunder, the Purchase Price received by Seller constitutes reasonably equivalent value in consideration therefor. No transfer hereunder by Seller of any Receivable is or may be voidable under any section of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 (11 U.S.C. ss.ss. 101 ET SEQ.), as amended. (t) ENFORCEABILITY OF CONTRACTS. Each Contract with respect to each Receivable is effective to create, and has created, a legal, valid and binding obligation of the related Obligor to pay the Outstanding Balance of the Receivable created thereunder and any accrued interest thereon, enforceable against the Obligor in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws relating to or limiting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law). (u) ELIGIBLE RECEIVABLES. Each Receivable reflected in any Purchase Report as an Eligible Receivable was an Eligible Receivable on the date of sale or contribution to Buyer hereunder. (v) ACCOUNTING. The manner in which Seller accounts for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in its financial statements does not jeopardize the characterization of the transactions contemplated herein as being true sales. 9
ARTICLE III CONDITIONS OF PURCHASE Section 3.1 CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO PURCHASE. The Purchases under this Agreement are subject to the conditions precedent that (a) Buyer shall have been capitalized with the Initial Contributed Receivables, (b) Buyer shall have received on or before the date of such purchase those documents listed on SCHEDULE A and (c) all of the conditions to the initial loan under the Credit and Security Agreement shall have been satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms thereof.

The failure of Seller to satisfy any of the foregoing conditions precedent, however, shall give rise to a right of Buyer to rescind the related purchase and direct Seller to pay to Buyer an amount equal to the Purchase Price payment that shall have been made with respect to any Receivables related thereto.

(c) The execution and delivery by Seller of the Receivables Sale Agreement and each other Transaction Document to which it is a party and its performance of its obligations thereunder have been duly authorized by all necessary organizational action and proceedings on the part of Seller and will not: (i) require any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or official (other than the filing of UCC financing statements); (ii) contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision of applicable law or regulation or of its Organizational Documents or of any agreement, judgment, injunction, order, decree or other instrument binding upon Seller; or (iii) result in the creation or imposition of any Adverse Claim on assets of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (except as contemplated by the Receivables Sale Agreement and the Credit and Security Agreement). (d) The Receivables Sale Agreement and each other Transaction Document to which it is a party has been duly executed and delivered by Seller and constitutes the legally valid, and binding obligation of Seller enforceable in accordance with its terms, except to the extent the enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and subject also to the availability of equitable remedies if equitable remedies are sought. (e) In the event that the Receivables Sale Agreement is held to create a transfer for security purposes rather than a true sale or other outright assignment, the provisions of the Receivables Sale Agreement are effective to create valid security interests in favor of Buyer in all of Seller's right, title and interest in and to the Receivables and Related Security described therein which constitute "accounts," "chattel paper" or "general intangibles" (each as defined in the UCC) (collectively, the "OPINION COLLATERAL"), as security for the payment of a loan deemed to have been made by Buyer to Seller in an amount equal to the Purchase Price (as defined therein) of the Receivables (as defined therein) acquired from Seller, together with all other obligations of Seller thereunder. (f) Each of the UCC-1 Financing Statements naming Seller as debtor, Buyer, as assigning secured party, and Agent, as total assignee of secured party to be filed in the [describe filing offices], is in appropriate form for filing therein. Upon filing of such UCC-1 Financing 43
Statements in such filing offices and payment of the required filing fees, the security interest in favor of Buyer in the Opinion Collateral will be perfected and assigned of record to the Agent. (g) Based solely on our review of the [describe UCC Search Reports], and assuming (i) the filing of the Financing Statements and payment of the required filing fees in accordance with paragraph (f) and (ii) the absence of any intervening filings between the date and time of the Search Reports and the date and time of the filing of the Financing Statements, the security interest of Buyer in the Opinion Collateral is prior to any security interest granted in the Opinion Collateral by Seller, the priority of which is determined solely by the filing of a financing statement in the [describe filing offices]. (h) To the best of the opinion giver's knowledge, there is no action, suit or other proceeding against Seller or any Affiliate of Seller, which would materially adversely affect the business or financial condition of Seller and its Affiliates taken as a whole or which would materially adversely affect the ability of Seller to perform its obligations under the Receivables Sale Agreement. (i) Seller is not an "investment company" as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. 8. A "TRUE SALE" opinion and "SUBSTANTIVE CONSOLIDATION" opinion of counsel for Seller with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Receivables Sale Agreement. 9. A Certificate of Seller's [chief financial officer] certifying that, as of the closing date, no Termination Event or Unmatured Termination Event exists and is continuing. 10. Executed copies of (i) all consents from and authorizations by any Persons and (ii) all waivers and amendments to existing credit facilities, that are necessary in connection with the Receivables Sale Agreement. 11. Executed Subordinated Note by Buyer in favor of Seller. 44

EXHIBIT 10. 4 PERFORMANCE UNDERTAKING THIS PERFORMANCE UNDERTAKING (this "UNDERTAKING"), dated as of September 7, 2004, is executed by Equifax Inc., a Georgia corporation (the "PERFORMANCE GUARANTOR") in favor of Equifax Receivables Finance LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (together with its successors and assigns, "RECIPIENT"). RECITALS 1. Equifax Inc. (the "PARENT"), Equifax Information Services LLC, Equifax Direct Marketing Solutions LLC Equifax Information Services of Puerto Rico Inc., Compliance Data Center, Inc. (collectively, the "ORIGINATORS"), and Equifax Capital Management, Inc. ("ECM") have entered in to a Receivables Sale Agreement, dated as of September 7, 2004 (as amended, restated or otherwise modified from time to time, the "FIRST STEP SALE AGREEMENT"), pursuant to which Originators, subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, are selling their respective right, title and interest in their accounts receivable to ECM. 2. ECM and Recipient have entered into a Receivables Sale Agreement, dated as of September 7, 2004 (as amended, restated or otherwise modified from time to time, the "SECOND STEP SALE AGREEMENT"; the First Step Sale Agreement and the Second Step Sale Agreement being herein collectively called the "SALE AGREEMENTS"), pursuant to which ECM, subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, is selling and/or contributing its right, title and interest in such accounts receivable to Recipient. 3. Performance Guarantor, directly or indirectly, owns one hundred percent (100%) of the capital stock or other equity interest of each of the other Originators, ECM and Recipient, and accordingly, Performance Guarantor, is expected to receive substantial direct and indirect benefits from their sale or contribution of receivables to ECM and Recipient pursuant to the Sale Agreements (which benefits are hereby acknowledged). 4. As an inducement for ECM to acquire Originators' accounts receivable pursuant to the First Step Sale Agreement and for Recipient to acquire such accounts receivable pursuant to the Second Step Sales Agreement, Performance Guarantor has agreed to guaranty the due and punctual performance by the other Originators and ECM of their respective obligations under the Sale Agreements. 5. Performance Guarantor wishes to guaranty the due and punctual performance by the other Originators of their obligations to ECM under or in respect of the First Step Sale Agreement and the due and punctual performance by ECM of its obligations to Recipient under or in respect of the Second Step Sale Agreement.
AGREEMENT NOW, THEREFORE, Performance Guarantor hereby agrees as follows: Section 1. DEFINITIONS. Capitalized terms used herein and not defined herein shall the respective meanings assigned thereto in the Sale Agreement or the Credit and Security Agreement (as hereinafter defined). In addition: "GUARANTEED OBLIGATIONS" means, collectively: all covenants, agreements, terms, conditions and indemnities to be performed and observed by any Originator (other than the Parent in its capacity as an Originator) or ECM under and pursuant to any of the Sale Agreements and each other document executed and delivered by any Originator (other than the Parent in its capacity as an Originator) or ECM pursuant to any of the Sale Agreements, including, without limitation, the due and punctual payment of all sums which are or may become due and owing by any Originator (other than the Parent in its capacity as an Originator) or ECM under any of the Sale Agreements, whether for fees, expenses (including counsel fees), indemnified amounts or otherwise, whether upon any termination or for any other reason. Section 2. GUARANTY OF PERFORMANCE OF GUARANTEED OBLIGATIONS. Performance Guarantor hereby guarantees to Recipient, the full and punctual payment and performance by each Originator and ECM of its respective Guaranteed Obligations. This Undertaking is an absolute, unconditional and continuing guaranty of the full and punctual performance of all Guaranteed Obligations of each Originator under the Agreements and each other document executed and delivered by any Originator pursuant to the Agreements and is in no way conditioned upon any requirement that Recipient first attempt to collect any amounts owing by any Originator or ECM to Recipient, the Agent or the Lenders from any other Person or resort to any collateral security, any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of Recipient, the Agent or any Lender in favor of any Originator, ECM or any other Person or other means of obtaining payment. Should any Originator or ECM default in the payment or performance of any of its Guaranteed Obligations, Recipient (or its assigns) may cause the immediate performance by Performance Guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations and cause any payment Guaranteed Obligations to become forthwith due and payable to Recipient (or its assigns), without demand or notice of any nature (other than as expressly provided herein), all of which are hereby expressly waived by Performance Guarantor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Undertaking is not a guarantee of the collection of any of the Receivables and Performance Guarantor shall not be responsible for any Guaranteed Obligations to the extent the failure to perform such Guaranteed Obligations by any Originator or ECM results from Receivables being uncollectible on account of the insolvency, bankruptcy or lack of creditworthiness of the related Obligor; PROVIDED THAT nothing herein shall relieve any Originator or ECM from performing in full its Guaranteed Obligations under the Agreements or Performance Guarantor of its undertaking hereunder with respect to the full performance of such duties. Section 3. PERFORMANCE GUARANTOR'S FURTHER AGREEMENTS TO PAY. Performance Guarantor further agrees, as the principal obligor and not as a guarantor only, to pay to Recipient (and its assigns), forthwith upon demand in funds immediately available to Recipient, all reasonable costs and expenses (including court costs and reasonable legal expenses) actually incurred or expended by Recipient in connection with the Guaranteed Obligations, this Undertaking and the enforcement thereof, together with interest on amounts recoverable under this Undertaking from the time when such amounts become due until payment, at a rate of 2
interest (computed for the actual number of days elapsed based on a 360 day year) equal to the Prime Rate plus 2% PER ANNUM, such rate of interest changing when and as the Prime Rate changes. Section 4. WAIVERS BY PERFORMANCE GUARANTOR. Performance Guarantor waives notice of acceptance of this Undertaking, notice of any action taken or omitted by Recipient (or its assigns) in reliance on this Undertaking, and any requirement that Recipient (or its assigns) be diligent or prompt in making demands under this Undertaking, giving notice of any Termination Event, Amortization Event, other default or omission by any Originator or ECM or asserting any other rights of Recipient under this Undertaking. Performance Guarantor warrants that it has adequate means to obtain from each Originator or ECM, on a continuing basis, information concerning the financial condition of such Person and that it is not relying on Recipient to provide such information, now or in the future. Performance Guarantor also irrevocably waives all defenses (i) that at any time may be available in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations by virtue of any statute of limitations, valuation, stay, moratorium law or other similar law now or hereafter in effect or (ii) that arise under the law of suretyship, including impairment of collateral. Recipient (and its assigns) shall be at liberty, without giving notice to or obtaining the assent of Performance Guarantor and without relieving Performance Guarantor of any liability under this Undertaking, to deal with each Originator or ECM and with each other party who now is or after the date hereof becomes liable in any manner for any of the Guaranteed Obligations, in such manner as Recipient in its sole discretion deems fit, and to this end Performance Guarantor agrees that the validity and enforceability of this Undertaking, including without limitation, the provisions of Section 7 hereof, shall not be impaired or affected by any of the following: (a) any extension, modification or renewal of, or indulgence with respect to, or substitutions for, the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof or any agreement relating thereto at any time; (b) any failure or omission to enforce any right, power or remedy with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof or any agreement relating thereto, or any collateral securing the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof; (c) any waiver of any right, power or remedy or of any Termination Event, Amortization Event, or default with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof or any agreement relating thereto; (d) any release, surrender, compromise, settlement, waiver, subordination or modification, with or without consideration, of any other obligation of any person or entity with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof; (e) the enforceability or validity of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof or the genuineness, enforceability or validity of any agreement relating thereto or with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof; (f) the application of payments received from any source to the payment of any payment Obligations of any Originator or ECM or any part thereof or amounts which are not covered by this Undertaking even though Recipient (or its assigns) might lawfully have elected to apply such payments to any part or all of the payment Obligations of such Originator or ECM or to amounts which are not covered by this Undertaking; (g) the existence of any claim, setoff or other rights which Performance Guarantor may have at any time against any Originator or ECM in connection herewith or any unrelated transaction; (h) any assignment or transfer of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof; or (i) any failure on the part of any Originator or ECM to perform or comply with any term of the Agreements or any other document executed in connection therewith or delivered thereunder, all whether or not Performance Guarantor shall have had notice or knowledge of any act or omission referred to in the foregoing clauses (a) through (i) of this Section 4. 3
Section 5. UNENFORCEABILITY OF GUARANTEED OBLIGATIONS AGAINST ORIGINATORS. Notwithstanding (a) any change of ownership of any Originator or ECM or the insolvency, bankruptcy or any other change in the legal status of any Originator or ECM; (b) the change in or the imposition of any law, decree, regulation or other governmental act which does or might impair, delay or in any way affect the validity, enforceability or the payment when due of the Guaranteed Obligations; (c) the failure of any Originator, ECM or Performance Guarantor to maintain in full force, validity or effect or to obtain or renew when required all governmental and other approvals, licenses or consents required in connection with the Guaranteed Obligations or this Undertaking, or to take any other action required in connection with the performance of all obligations pursuant to the Guaranteed Obligations or this Undertaking; or (d) if any of the moneys included in the Guaranteed Obligations have become irrecoverable from any Originator or ECM for any other reason other than final payment in full of the payment Obligations in accordance with their terms, this Undertaking shall nevertheless be binding on Performance Guarantor. This Undertaking shall be in addition to any other guaranty or other security for the Guaranteed Obligations, and it shall not be rendered unenforceable by the invalidity of any such other guaranty or security. In the event that acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Originator or for any other reason with respect to any Originator or ECM, all such amounts then due and owing with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations under the terms of the Agreements, or any other agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with the Guaranteed Obligations, shall be immediately due and payable by Performance Guarantor. Section 6. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Performance Guarantor hereby represents and warrants to Recipient that: (a) EXISTENCE AND STANDING. Performance Guarantor is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its state of incorporation. Performance Guarantor is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation, and has and holds all corporate power and all governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals required to carry on its business in each jurisdiction in which its business is conducted except where the failure to so qualify or so hold could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. (b) AUTHORIZATION, EXECUTION AND DELIVERY; BINDING EFFECT. The execution and delivery by Performance Guarantor of this Undertaking, and the performance of its obligations hereunder, are within its corporate powers and authority and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on its part. This Undertaking has been duly executed and delivered by Performance Guarantor. This Undertaking constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Performance Guarantor enforceable against Performance Guarantor in accordance with their respective terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws relating to or limiting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law). (c) NO CONFLICT; GOVERNMENT CONSENT. The execution and delivery by Performance Guarantor of this Undertaking, and the performance of its obligations hereunder do not contravene or violate (i) its certificate or articles of incorporation or by-laws, (ii) any law, 4
rule or regulation applicable to it, (iii) any restrictions under any agreement, contract or instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of its property is bound, or (iv) any order, writ, judgment, award, injunction or decree binding on or affecting it or its property, and do not result in the creation or imposition of any Adverse Claim on assets of Performance Guarantor or its Subsidiaries (except as created hereunder) except, in any case, where such contravention or violation could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. (d) FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. The consolidated financial statements of Performance Guarantor and its consolidated Subsidiaries dated as of December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2003 heretofore delivered to Recipient have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied and fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Performance Guarantor and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of such dates and for the periods ended on such dates. Since the later of (i) March 31, 2004 and (ii) the last time this representation was made or deemed made, and except as disclosed in the reports made by the Performance Guarantor to the Securities and Exchange Commission, no event has occurred which would or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. (e) TAXES. Performance Guarantor has filed all United States federal tax returns and all other tax returns which are required to be filed and have paid all taxes due pursuant to said returns or pursuant to any assessment received by Performance Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries, except taxes (i) that are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which Performance Guarantor has set aside on its books adequate reserves or (ii) to the extent the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this Agreement, the United States income tax returns of Performance Guarantor have been audited by the Internal Revenue Service through the fiscal year ended December 31, 1995. No federal or state tax liens have been filed and no claims are being asserted with respect to any such taxes. The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of Performance Guarantor in respect of any taxes or other governmental charges are, in the judgment of Performance Guarantor, adequate. (f) LITIGATION AND CONTINGENT OBLIGATIONS. Except as disclosed in the filings made by Performance Guarantor with the Securities and Exchange Commission, there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to the best of Performance Guarantor's knowledge threatened against or affecting Performance Guarantor or any of its properties, in or before any court, arbitrator or other body, that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on (i) the business, properties, condition (financial or otherwise) or results of operations of Performance Guarantor and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (ii) the ability of Performance Guarantor to perform its obligations under this Undertaking, or (iii) the validity or enforceability of any of this Undertaking or the rights or remedies of Recipient hereunder. Performance Guarantor does not have any material Contingent Obligations not provided for or disclosed in the financial statements referred to in Section 6(d). Section 7. SUBROGATION; SUBORDINATION. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, until the Guaranteed Obligations are paid in full Performance Guarantor: (a) will not enforce or otherwise exercise any right of subrogation to any of the rights of Recipient, the Agent or any Lender against any Originator or ECM, (b) hereby waives all rights of 5
subrogation (whether contractual, under Section 509 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, at law or in equity or otherwise) to the claims of Recipient, the Agent and the Lenders against any Originator or ECM and all contractual, statutory or legal or equitable rights of contribution, reimbursement, indemnification and similar rights and "claims" (as that term is defined in the United States Bankruptcy Code) which Performance Guarantor might now have or hereafter acquire against any Originator or ECM that arise from the existence or performance of Performance Guarantor's obligations hereunder, (c) will not claim any setoff, recoupment or counterclaim against any Originator or ECM in respect of any liability of Performance Guarantor to such Originator or ECM and (d) waives any benefit of and any right to participate in any collateral security which may be held by Secured Parties, the Agent or the Lenders. The payment of any amounts due with respect to any indebtedness of any Originator or ECM now or hereafter owed to Performance Guarantor is hereby subordinated to the prior payment in full of all of the Guaranteed Obligations. Performance Guarantor agrees that, after the occurrence of any default in the payment or performance of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, Performance Guarantor will not demand, sue for or otherwise attempt to collect any such indebtedness of any Originator or ECM to Performance Guarantor until all of the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been paid and performed in full. If, notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, Performance Guarantor shall collect, enforce or receive any amounts in respect of such indebtedness while any Obligations are still unperformed or outstanding, such amounts shall be collected, enforced and received by Performance Guarantor as trustee for Recipient (and its assigns) and be paid over to Recipient (or its assigns) on account of the Guaranteed Obligations without affecting in any manner the liability of Performance Guarantor under the other provisions of this Undertaking. The provisions of this Section 7 shall be supplemental to and not in derogation of any rights and remedies of Recipient under any separate subordination agreement which Recipient may at any time and from time to time enter into with Performance Guarantor. Section 8. TERMINATION OF PERFORMANCE UNDERTAKING. Performance Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall continue in full force and effect until the Final Payout Date, PROVIDED THAT this Undertaking shall continue to be effective or shall be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment or other satisfaction of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned upon the bankruptcy, insolvency, or reorganization of any Originator or ECM or otherwise, as though such payment had not been made or other satisfaction occurred, whether or not Recipient (or its assigns) is in possession of this Undertaking. No invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability by reason of the federal bankruptcy code or any insolvency or other similar law, or any law or order of any government or agency thereof purporting to reduce, amend or otherwise affect the Guaranteed Obligations shall impair, affect, be a defense to or claim against the obligations of Performance Guarantor under this Undertaking. Section 9. EFFECT OF BANKRUPTCY. This Performance Undertaking shall survive the insolvency of any Originator or ECM and the commencement of any case or proceeding by or against any Originator or ECM under the federal bankruptcy code or other federal, state or other applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization statutes. No automatic stay under the federal bankruptcy code with respect to any Originator or ECM or other federal, state or other applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization statutes to which any Originator or ECM is subject shall postpone the obligations of Performance Guarantor under this Undertaking. 6
Section 10. SETOFF. Regardless of the other means of obtaining payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, Recipient (and its assigns) is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, but only during the existence of an Amortization Event, without notice to Performance Guarantor (any such notice being expressly waived by Performance Guarantor) and to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any deposits and other sums against the obligations of Performance Guarantor under this Undertaking then past due for more than two (2) Business Days. Section 11. TAXES. All payments to be made by Performance Guarantor hereunder shall be made free and clear of any deduction or withholding (except for taxes excluded under Section 10.1 of the Credit and Security Agreement). If Performance Guarantor is required by law to make any deduction or withholding on account of tax (except for taxes excluded under Section 10.1 of the Credit and Security Agreement) or otherwise from any such payment, the sum due from it in respect of such payment shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that, after the making of such deduction or withholding, Recipient receive a net sum equal to the sum which they would have received had no deduction or withholding been made. Section 12. FURTHER ASSURANCES. Performance Guarantor agrees that it will from time to time, at the request of Recipient (or its assigns), provide information relating to the business and affairs of Performance Guarantor as Recipient may reasonably request. Performance Guarantor also agrees to do all such things and execute all such documents as Recipient (or its assigns) may reasonably consider necessary or desirable to give full effect to this Undertaking and to perfect and preserve the rights and powers of Recipient hereunder. Section 13. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. This Performance Undertaking shall be binding upon Performance Guarantor, its successors and permitted assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by Recipient and its successors and assigns. Performance Guarantor may not assign or transfer any of its obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each of Recipient and the Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, Recipient may assign or otherwise transfer the Agreements, any other documents executed in connection therewith or delivered thereunder or any other agreement or note held by them evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with the Guaranteed Obligations, or sell participations in any interest therein, to any other entity or other person, and such other entity or other person shall thereupon become vested, to the extent set forth in the agreement evidencing such assignment, transfer or participation, with all the rights in respect thereof granted to the Secured Parties herein. Section 14. AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Undertaking nor consent to any departure by Performance Guarantor therefrom shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by Recipient, the Agent and Performance Guarantor. No failure on the part of Recipient to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. 7
Section 15. NOTICES. All notices and other communications provided for hereunder shall be made in writing and shall be addressed as follows: if to Performance Guarantor, at the address set forth beneath its signature hereto, and if to Recipient, at the addresses set forth beneath its signature to the Credit and Security Agreement, or at such other addresses as each of Performance Guarantor or any Recipient may designate in writing to the other. Each such notice or other communication shall be effective (1) if given by telecopy, upon the receipt thereof, (2) if given by mail, three (3) Business Days after the time such communication is deposited in the mail with first class postage prepaid or (3) if given by any other means, when received at the address specified in this Section 15. Section 16. GOVERNING LAW. THIS UNDERTAKING SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS (AND NOT THE LAW OF CONFLICTS) OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. Section 17. CONSENT TO JURISDICTION. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EACH OF PROVIDER AND RECIPIENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY UNITED STATES FEDERAL OR NEW YORK STATE COURT SITTING IN THE BOROUGH OF MANHATTAN IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS UNDERTAKING, THE AGREEMENTS OR ANY OTHER DOCUMENT EXECUTED IN CONNECTION THEREWITH OR DELIVERED THEREUNDER AND EACH OF THE PERFORMANCE GUARANTOR AND RECIPIENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN ANY SUCH COURT AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE AS TO THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A COURT OR THAT SUCH COURT IS AN INCONVENIENT FORUM. Section 18. BANKRUPTCY PETITION. Performance Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding senior Indebtedness of Conduit, it will not institute against, or join any other Person in instituting against, Conduit any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings or other similar proceeding under the laws of the United States or any state of the United States. Section 19. MISCELLANEOUS. This Undertaking constitutes the entire agreement of Performance Guarantor with respect to the matters set forth herein. The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law or any other agreement, and this Undertaking shall be in addition to any other guaranty of or collateral security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations. The provisions of this Undertaking are severable, and in any action or proceeding involving any state corporate law, or any state or federal bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other law affecting the rights of creditors generally, if the obligations of Performance Guarantor hereunder would otherwise be held or determined to be avoidable, invalid or unenforceable on account of the amount of Performance Guarantor's liability under this Undertaking, then, notwithstanding any other provision of this Undertaking to the contrary, the amount of such liability shall, without any further action by Performance Guarantor or Recipient, be automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount 8
that is valid and enforceable as determined in such action or proceeding. Any provisions of this Undertaking which are prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. Unless otherwise specified, references herein to "SECTION" shall mean a reference to sections of this Undertaking. (SIGNATURE PAGE FOLLOWS) 9
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Performance Guarantor has caused this Undertaking to be executed and delivered as of the date first above written. EQUIFAX INC. By: ______________________________ Name: ____________________________ Title: ___________________________ 10

Exhibit 10. 5 EQUIFAX INC. NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT (PARTICIPANT) Number of Shares: Option Price: $ Date of Grant: THIS AGREEMENT is entered into as of the above Date of Grant, by and between Equifax Inc., a Georgia corporation (the "Company"), and the above-named Participant ("Participant"). This Agreement is subject to the provisions of the Equifax Inc. 2000 Stock Incentive Plan, as may be amended from time to time (the "Plan") and, unless defined in this Agreement, all terms used in this Agreement have the same meanings given them in the Plan. 1. GRANT OF OPTION. The Company on the "Date of Grant" granted to Participant (subject to the terms of the Plan and this Agreement) the right to purchase from the Company all or part of the Number of Shares stated above (the "Option"). This Agreement is not intended to be an incentive stock option under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). 2. BASIC TERMS AND CONDITIONS. The Option is subject to the following basic terms and conditions: (a) EXPIRATION DATE. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Option will expire ten (10) years from the Date of Grant (the "Expiration Date"). (b) EXERCISE OF OPTION. Except as provided in subparagraph 2(e) or paragraph 3, the Option shall be exercisable with respect to one-fourth of the Number of Shares subject to this option on the Date of Grant and with respect to an additional one-fourth of the Number of Shares subject to this Option on each of the first three anniversaries of the Date of Grant so that this Option shall be fully exercisable on the third anniversary of the Date of Grant, provided the Participant (i) remains employed by the Company or a Subsidiary or (ii) subject to the provisions of subparagraph 2(e)(ii), terminates employment by reason of Retirement (as defined in subparagraph 2(e)(ii)). Once exercisable, in whole or part, it will continue to be so exercisable until the earlier of the termination of Participant's rights under subparagraph 2(e) or paragraph 3, or the Expiration Date. The Option may be exercised in one or more exercises, provided that each exercise must be for a multiple of twenty-five (25) shares (E.G., 25 shares, 50 shares, 100 shares), up to the full number for which the Option is then
exercisable, unless the Number of Shares then exercisable is less than twenty-five (25), in which case the Option may be exercised for that lesser Number of Shares. (c) METHOD OF EXERCISE AND PAYMENT FOR SHARES. In order to exercise the Option, Participant must give written notice in a manner prescribed by the Company from time to time together with payment of the Option Price to the Company's Stock Option Administrator at the Company's principal office in Atlanta, Georgia, or as otherwise directed by the Administrator. The Date of Exercise will be the date of receipt of the notice or any later date specified in the notice. Participant must pay the Option Price (i) in cash or a cash equivalent acceptable to the Committee, or (ii) in the Committee's discretion, by the surrender (or attestation of ownership) of shares of Common Stock (held by Participant for at least six (6) months) with an aggregate Fair Market Value (based on the closing price of a share of Common Stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange composite index on the Date of Exercise) that is not less than the Option Price, or by surrender of property described in and subject to the conditions provided in Section 4(d) of the Plan, or (iii) by a combination of cash and such shares. Payment of the Option Price may be deferred in the discretion of the Committee to accommodate proceeds of sale of some or all of the shares to which this grant relates. If at exercise, Participant is not in compliance with the Company's minimum stock ownership guidelines then in effect for Participant's job grade or classification, if any, Participant will not be entitled to exercise the Option using a "cashless exercise program" of the Company (if then in effect), unless the net proceeds received by Participant from that exercise consist only of shares of Company stock, and Participant agrees to hold all those shares for at least one (1) year. (d) NON-TRANSFERABILITY. Participant's rights under this Agreement are non-transferable except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, in which case all of Participant's remaining rights under this Agreement must be transferred undivided to the same person or persons. During Participant's lifetime, only Participant (or Participant's legal representative if Participant is incompetent) may exercise the Option. (e) TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT. Except as provided in subparagraphs (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) below, or paragraph 3, the Option will expire and will not be exercisable after termination of Participant's employment with the Company or a Subsidiary. (i) ELIMINATION OF POSITION. Except as provided in paragraph 3 or 4 below, if the termination of Participant's employment results from the Company's elimination of the position held by Participant, then Participant will continue to have the right to exercise the Option with respect to that portion of the Number of Shares for which the Option was vested and exercisable on the date of termination and the remaining portion shall be cancelled. Except as provided in subsection 2(e)(iv)(A) below, that right will continue until the earlier of the last day of the one-year period 2
commencing on the date of termination of employment, or the Expiration Date. (ii) RETIREMENT. Except as provided in paragraph 3 or 4 below, if the termination of Participant's employment results from Participant's Retirement (as defined below), Participant will continue to vest in the Option in accordance with the original vesting schedule in subparagraph 2(b) above as if he had remained actively employed; provided, that upon Participant's death, all vesting will cease and the Option will be exercisable with respect to that portion of the Number of Shares for which the Option is vested and exercisable on the date of Participant's death and the remaining portion shall be cancelled. Participant will continue to have the right to exercise the Option with respect to that portion of the Number of Shares for which the Option is vested and exercisable from time to time until the earlier of the last day of the sixty (60) month period following Participant's Retirement, or the Expiration Date. "Retirement" means Participant's termination of employment with the Company or a Subsidiary (other than by the Company or a Subsidiary for Cause) at a time when Participant is eligible for immediate payment of benefits under Participant's applicable defined benefit retirement plan, if any, or in the absence of an applicable defined benefit retirement plan, as determined by the Committee. (iii) DISABILITY. Except as provided in paragraph 3 or 4 below, if the termination of Participant's employment results from Participant's total and permanent disability, confirmed by the statement of a licensed physician chosen or approved by the Committee, then Participant will continue to have the right to exercise the Option with respect to that portion of the Number of Shares for which the Option was vested and exercisable on the last date of Participant's active employment and the remaining portion shall be cancelled. Except as provided in subparagraph 2(e)(iv)(A) below that right will continue until the earlier of the last day of the sixty (60) month period following the last date of Participant's active employment or the Expiration Date. (iv) DEATH. (A) Except as provided in paragraph 3 or 4 below, if the termination of Participant's employment results from Participant's death, then Participant's estate, or the person(s) to whom Participant's rights under this Agreement pass by will or the laws of descent and distribution, will have the right to exercise the Option with respect to that portion of the Number of Shares for which the Option was vested and exercisable on the date of Participant's death and the remaining portion shall be cancelled. That right will continue until 3
the earlier of the last day of the sixty (60) month period following Participant's death or the Expiration Date. (B) If Participant dies following termination of employment and prior to the expiration of any remaining period during which the Option may be exercised in accordance with subparagraphs (i), (ii) or (iii) above, or paragraph 3, the remaining period during which the Option will be exercisable (by Participant's estate, or the person(s) to whom Participant's rights under this Agreement pass by will or the laws of descent and distribution) will be the greater of (a) the remaining period under the applicable subparagraph or paragraph referred to above, or (b) six (6) months from the date of death; provided that under no circumstances will the Option be exercisable after the Expiration Date. 3. CHANGE IN CONTROL. If a Change in Control of the Company occurs while Participant is employed by the Company or a Subsidiary, then the entire Number of Shares represented by the Option which had not yet been exercised will become immediately vested and exercisable (the "Unexercised Portion"). If Participant's employment with the Company or a Subsidiary terminates after the date on which the Change in Control occurs other than as a result of a termination by the Company or a Subsidiary for Cause, then Participant (or, if applicable, Participant's estate or the person(s) to whom Participant's rights under this Agreement pass by will or the laws of descent and distribution) will have the right to exercise the Unexercised Portion. Except as provided in Section 2(e)(iv)(B) above or Section 4 below, that right may be exercised until the earlier of the last day of the sixty (60) month period following the termination of Participant's employment or the Expiration Date. 4. CANCELLATION AND RESCISSION OF OPTION. (a) If, at any time, (i) during the Participant's employment with the Company or (ii) during the period after the Participant's termination of employment with the Company for any reason during which all or part of the Option remains exercisable, but not to exceed 24 months following the Participant's termination of employment, a Participant engages in any "Detrimental Activity" (as defined in subsection (b) below), the Committee may, notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, cancel, rescind, suspend, withhold or otherwise restrict or limit this Option as of the first date the Participant engaged in the Detrimental Activity, as determined by the Committee. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Committee may also require the Participant to pay to the Company any gain realized by the Participant from exercising all or any portion of the Option hereunder during the period beginning six (6) months prior to the date on which Participant engaged or began engaging in Detrimental Activity. (b) For purposes of this Agreement, "Detrimental Activity" shall mean and include any of the following: 4
(i) the breach or violation of any other agreement between Participant and the Company relating to the protection of Confidential Information or Trade Secrets, the solicitation of employees, customers or suppliers, or the refraining from competition with the Company; (ii) the disclosure, reproduction or use of Confidential Information or Trade Secrets (each as defined below) for the benefit of the Participant or third parties except in connection with the performance of the Participant's duties for the Company or, after advance notice to the Company, as required by a valid order or subpoena issued by a court or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction; (iii) the use, reproduction, disclosure or distribution of any information which the Company is required to hold confidential under applicable federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. ss. 1681 et seq.) and any state credit reporting statutes; (iv) the making, or causing or attempting to cause any other person to make, any statement, either written or oral, or conveying any information about the Company which is disparaging or which in any way reflects negatively upon the Company; (v) the solicitation or attempt to solicit any customer or actively targeted potential customer of the Company with whom the Participant had material contact on the Company's behalf during the 12 months immediately preceding the Participant's termination of employment; (vi) the solicitation or recruitment, attempt to solicit or recruit, or the assistance of others in soliciting or recruiting, any individual who is or was, within 6 months of the date in question, an employee of the Company unless such former employee was terminated by the Company without cause, or the inducement of (or attempt to induce) any such employee of the Company to terminate his employment with the Company; or (vii) the refusal or failure of a Participant to provide, upon the request of the Company, a certification, in a form satisfactory to the Company, that he or she is in full compliance with the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Agreement, including, without limitation, a certification that the Participant is not engaging in Detrimental Activity. (c) "Trade Secret" means information, including, but not limited to, technical or non-technical data, a formula, a pattern, a compilation, a program, a device, a method, a technique, a drawing, a process, financial data, financial plans, product plans, or a list of actual or potential Company customers or suppliers which (i) derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, and (ii) is the subject of the 5
Company's efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain secrecy; or as otherwise defined by applicable state law. (d) "Confidential Information" means any and all knowledge, information, data, methods or plans (other than Trade Secrets) which are now or at any time in the future developed, used or employed by the Company which are treated as confidential by the Company and not generally disclosed by the Company to the public, and which relate to the business or financial affairs of the Company, including, but not limited to, financial statements and information, marketing strategies, business development plans, acquisition or divestiture plans, and product or process enhancement plans. (e) Should any provision of this Paragraph 4 be held to be invalid or illegal, such illegality shall not invalidate the whole of this Paragraph 4, but, rather, the Plan shall be construed as if it did not contain the illegal part or be narrowed to permit its enforcement, and the rights and obligations of the parties shall be construed and enforced accordingly. 5. TERMINATION FOR CAUSE. For purposes of this Agreement, termination for "Cause" means termination as a result of (a) the willful and continued failure by Participant to substantially perform his or her duties with the Company (other than a failure resulting from Participant's incapacity due to physical or mental illness), after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to Participant by his or her superior officer which specifically identifies the manner the officer believes that Participant has not substantially performed his or her duties, or (b) Participant's willful misconduct which materially injures the Company, monetarily or otherwise. For purposes of this paragraph, Participant's act, or failure to act, will not be considered "willful" unless the act or failure to act is not in good faith and without reasonable belief that his or her action or omission was in the best interest of the Company. 6. FRACTIONAL SHARES. Fractional shares will not be issued, and when any provision of this Agreement otherwise would entitle Participant to receive a fractional share, that fraction will be disregarded. 7. NO RIGHT TO CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT. This Agreement does not give Participant any right to continued employment by the Company or a Subsidiary, and it will not interfere in any way with the right of the Company or Subsidiary to terminate Participant's employment at any time. 8. ADJUSTMENTS IN CAPITAL STRUCTURE. The terms of this Option will be adjusted as the Committee determines in its sole discretion is equitably required to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of the Participant in accordance with Section 10 of the Plan. 9. GOVERNING LAW. The Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Georgia. 10. CONFLICTS. If provisions of the Plan and the provisions of this Agreement conflict, the Plan provisions will govern. 6
11. PARTICIPANT BOUND BY PLAN. Participant acknowledges receiving a summary of the Plan, which provides that upon request a copy of the Plan will be provided to the Participant free of charge, and agrees to be bound by all the terms and provisions of the Plan. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not defined herein shall have the definitions given to them in the Plan. 12. BINDING EFFECT. Except as limited by the Plan or this Agreement, this Agreement is binding on and extends to the legatees, distributes, and personal representatives of Participant and the successors of the Company. 13. TAXES. Under procedures established by the Committee, the Company may withhold from Common Stock delivered to the Participant sufficient shares of Common Stock (valued as of the Date of Exercise) to satisfy required federal, state and local withholding and employment taxes, or the Participant will pay or deliver to the Company cash or Common Stock (valued as of the Date of Exercise) in sufficient amounts to satisfy these obligations. The Company shall not, however, withhold any amount in excess of the minimum required amount. 14. TRANSFER OF DATA. In order to effectively administer Equifax's global compensation and benefit programs, we may transfer personal data from your Equifax employment file to a centralized repository controlled by Equifax in the United States of America.

NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT UK VERSION- APPROVED OPTION SCHEME PARTICIPANT Number of Shares: Option Price: Date of Grant: THIS AGREEMENT is entered into as of the above Date of Grant, by and between Equifax Inc., a Georgia corporation (the "Company"), and the above-named Participant ("Participant"). This Agreement is subject to the provisions of the Equifax Inc. 2000 Stock Incentive Plan, as may be amended from time to time (the "Plan") and, unless defined in this Agreement, all terms used in this Agreement have the same meanings given them in the Plan. 1) GRANT OF OPTION. The Company on the "Date of Grant" granted to Participant (subject to the terms of the Plan and this Agreement) the right to purchase from the Company all or part of the Number of Shares stated above (the "Option"). This Agreement is not intended to be an incentive stock option under section 422A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). 2) BASIC TERMS AND CONDITIONS. The Option is subject to the following basic terms and conditions: a) EXPIRATION DATE. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Option will expire ten (10) years from the Date of Grant (the "Expiration Date"). b) EXERCISE OF OPTION. Except as provided in subparagraph 2(e) or paragraph 3, the Option shall be exercisable with respect to one-fourth of the shares subject to this option on the Date of Grant and with respect to an additional one-fourth of the shares subject to this option on each anniversary of the Date of Grant so that this option shall be fully exercisable on the third anniversary of the Date of Grant, provided the Participant remains employed by the Company or a Subsidiary. Once exercisable, in whole or part, it will continue to be so exercisable until the earlier of the termination of Participant's rights under subparagraph 2(e) or paragraph 3, or the Expiration Date. The Option may be exercised in one or more exercises, provided that each exercise must be for a multiple of twenty-five (25) shares (E.G., 25 shares, 50 shares, 100 shares), up to the full number for which the Option is then exercisable, unless the number of
shares then exercisable is less than twenty-five (25), in which case the Option may be exercised for that lesser number of shares. c) METHOD OF EXERCISE AND PAYMENT FOR SHARES. In order to exercise the Option, Participant must give written notice in a manner prescribed by the Company from time to time together with payment of the Option Price to the Company's Stock Option Administrator at the Company's principal office in Atlanta, Georgia, or as otherwise directed by the Administrator. The Date of Exercise will be the date of receipt of the notice or any later date specified in the notice. Participant must pay the Option Price (i) in cash or a cash equivalent acceptable to the Committee, or (ii) in the Committee's discretion, by the surrender (or attestation of ownership) of shares of Common Stock (held by Participant for at least six (6) months) with an aggregate Fair Market Value (based on the closing price of a share of Common Stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange composite index on the Date of Exercise) that is not less than the Option Price, or by surrender of property described in and subject to the conditions provided in Section 4(d) of the Plan, or (iii) by a combination of cash and such shares. Payment of the Option Price may be deferred in the discretion of the Committee to accommodate proceeds of sale of some or all of the shares to which this grant relates. If at exercise, Participant is not in compliance with the Company's minimum stock ownership guidelines then in effect for Participant's job grade or classification, if any, Participant will not be entitled to exercise the Option using a "cashless exercise program" of the Company (if then in effect), unless the net proceeds received by Participant from that exercise consist only of shares of Company stock, and Participant agrees to hold all those shares for at least one (1) year. d) NON-TRANSFERABILITY. Participant's rights under this Agreement are non-transferable except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, in which case all of Participant's remaining rights under this Agreement must be transferred undivided to the same person or persons. During Participant's lifetime, only Participant (or Participant's legal representative if Participant is incompetent) may exercise the Option. e) TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT. Except as provided in subparagraphs (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) below, or paragraph 3, the Option will expire and will not be exercisable after termination of Participant's employment with the Company or a Subsidiary. i) ELIMINATION OF POSITION. Except as provided in paragraphs 3 or 4 below, if the termination of Participant's employment results from the Company's elimination of the position held by Participant, then Participant will continue to have the right to exercise the Option with respect to that portion of the Number of Shares for which the Option was vested and exercisable on the date of termination, and the remaining portion shall be cancelled. Except as provided in subsection 2(e)(iv) below, the right to exercise the Option will continue until the earlier of the last day of the 2
one-year period commencing on the date of termination of employment, or the Expiration Date. ii) RETIREMENT. Except as provided in paragraphs 3 or 4 below, if the termination of Participant's employment results from Participant's Retirement, Participant will continue to vest in the Option in accordance with the original vesting schedule in Subparagraph 2(b) above as if he had remained actively employed; provided that upon Participant's death all vesting will cease and the Option will be exercisable with respect to that portion of the Number of Shares for which the Option is vested and exercisable on the date of death, and the remaining portion shall be cancelled. Except as provided in subparagraph 2(e)(iv) below, the right to exercise the Option will continue until the earlier of the last day of the sixty (60) month period following Participant's Retirement, or the Expiration Date. "Retirement" means Participant's termination of employment with the Company or a Subsidiary (other than by the Company or a Subsidiary for Cause) at a time when Participant is eligible for immediate payment of benefits under Participant's applicable retirement plan, if any, or in the absence of an applicable retirement plan, as determined by the Committee. iii) DISABILITY. Except as provided in paragraphs 3 or 4 below, if the termination of Participant's employment results from Participant's total and permanent disability, confirmed by a licensed physician's statement, then Participant will continue to have the right to exercise the Option with respect to that portion of the Number of Shares for which the Option was vested and exercisable on the last date of Participant's active employment and the remaining portion shall be cancelled.

(A) Except as provided in paragraphs 3 or 4 below, if the termination of Participant's employment results from Participant's death, then Participant's estate, or the person(s) to whom Participant's rights under this Agreement pass by will or the laws of descent and distribution, will have the right to exercise the Option with respect to that portion of the Number of Shares for which the Option was vested and exercisable on the date of Participant's death, and the remaining portion shall be cancelled. The right to exercise the Option will continue until the earlier of the last day of the sixty (60) month period following Participant's death or the Expiration Date. 3
(B) If Participant dies following termination of employment and prior to the expiration of any remaining period during which the Option may be exercised in accordance with subparagraphs (i), (ii) or (iii) above, or paragraph 3, the remaining period during which the Option will be exercisable (by Participant's estate, or the person(s) to whom Participant's rights under this Agreement pass by will or the laws of descent and distribution) will be the greater of (a) the remaining period under the applicable subparagraph or paragraph referred to above, or (b) six (6) months from the date of death; provided that under no circumstances will the Option be exercisable after the Expiration Date. 3) CHANGE IN CONTROL. If a Change in Control of the Company occurs while Participant is employed by the Company or a Subsidiary, then the entire Number of Shares represented by the Option not yet been exercised will become immediately vested and exercisable (the "Unexercised Portion"). If Participant's employment with the Company or a Subsidiary terminates after the date on which the Change in Control occurs other than as a result of a termination by the Company or a Subsidiary for Cause, then Participant (or, if applicable, Participant's estate or the person(s) to whom Participant's rights under this Agreement pass by will or the laws of descent and distribution) will have the right to exercise the Unexercised Portion. Except as provided in Section 2(e)(iv)(B) above or Section 4 below, that right will continue until the earlier of the last day of the sixty (60) month period following the termination of Participant's employment, or the Expiration Date. 4) CANCELLATION AND RESCISSION OF OPTION. a) If, at any time, (i) during the Participant's employment with the Company or (ii) during the period after the Participant's termination of employment with the Company for any reason during which all or part of the Option remains exercisable, but not to exceed 24 months following the Participant's termination of employment, a Participant engages in any "Detrimental Activity" (as defined in subsection (b) below), the Committee may, notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, cancel, rescind, suspend, withhold or otherwise restrict or limit this Option as of the first date the Participant engaged in the Detrimental Activity, as determined by the Committee. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Committee may also require the Participant to pay to the Company any gain realized by the Participant from exercising all or any portion of the Option hereunder during the period beginning six (6) months prior to the date on which Participant engaged or began engaging in Detrimental Activity. b) For purposes of this Agreement, "Detrimental Activity" shall mean and include any of the following: i) the breach or violation of any other agreement between Participant and the Company relating to the protection of Confidential Information or Trade 4
Secrets, the solicitation of employees, customers or suppliers, or the refraining from competition with the Company; ii) the disclosure, reproduction or use of Confidential Information or Trade Secrets (each as defined below) for the benefit of the Participant or third parties except in connection with the performance of the Participant's duties for the Company or, after advance notice to the Company, as required by a valid order or subpoena issued by a court or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction; iii) the use, reproduction, disclosure or distribution of any information which the Company is required to hold confidential under applicable federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. ss. 1681 et seq.) and any state credit reporting statutes; iv) the making, or causing or attempting to cause any other person to make, any statement, either written or oral, or conveying any information about the Company which is disparaging or which in any way reflects negatively upon the Company; v) the solicitation or attempt to solicit any customer or actively targeted potential customer of the Company with whom the Participant had material contact on the Company's behalf during the 12 months immediately preceding the Participant's termination of employment; vi) the solicitation or recruitment, attempt to solicit or recruit, or the assistance of others in soliciting or recruiting, any individual who is or was, within 6 months of the date in question, an employee of the Company unless such former employee was terminated by the Company without cause, or the inducement of (or attempt to induce) any such employee of the Company to terminate his employment with the Company; or vii) the refusal or failure of a Participant to provide, upon the request of the Company, a certification, in a form satisfactory to the Company, that he or she is in full compliance with the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Agreement, including, without limitation, a certification that the Participant is not engaging in Detrimental Activity. c) "Trade Secret" means information, including, but not limited to, technical or non-technical data, a formula, a pattern, a compilation, a program, a device, a method, a technique, a drawing, a process, financial data, financial plans, product plans, or a list of actual or potential Company customers or suppliers which (i) derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, and (ii) is the subject of the Company's efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain secrecy; or as otherwise defined by applicable state law. 5
d) "Confidential Information" means any and all knowledge, information, data, methods or plans (other than Trade Secrets) which are now or at any time in the future developed, used or employed by the Company which are treated as confidential by the Company and not generally disclosed by the Company to the public, and which relate to the business or financial affairs of the Company, including, but not limited to, financial statements and information, marketing strategies, business development plans, acquisition or divestiture plans, and product or process enhancement plans. e) Should any provision of this Paragraph 4 be held to be invalid or illegal, such illegality shall not invalidate the whole of this Paragraph 4, but, rather, the Plan shall be construed as if it did not contain the illegal part or be narrowed to permit its enforcement, and the rights and obligations of the parties shall be construed and enforced accordingly. 5) TERMINATION FOR CAUSE. For purposes of this Agreement, termination for "Cause" means termination as a result of (a) the willful and continued failure by Participant to substantially perform his or her duties with the Company (other than a failure resulting from Participant's incapacity due to physical or mental illness), after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to Participant by his or her superior officer which specifically identifies the manner the officer believes that Participant has not substantially performed his or her duties, or (b) Participant's willful misconduct which materially injures the Company, monetarily or otherwise. For purposes of this paragraph, Participant's act, or failure to act, will not be considered "willful" unless the act or failure to act is not in good faith and without reasonable belief that his or her action or omission was in the best interest of the Company. 6) FRACTIONAL SHARES. Fractional shares will not be issued, and when any provision of this Agreement otherwise would entitle Participant to receive a fractional share, that fraction will be disregarded. 7) NO RIGHT TO CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Plan: a) The Plan shall not form any part of any contract of employment between the Company or any Subsidiary and any employees of any of those companies, and it shall not confer on any such employees any legal or equitable rights (other than those constituting the Options themselves) against the Company or any Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, or give rise to any cause of action in law or in equity against the Company or any Subsidiary; b) The benefits to Eligible Employees under the Plan shall not form any part of their wages or remuneration or count as pay or remuneration for pension fund or other purposes; and c) In no circumstances shall any Eligible Employee on ceasing to hold the office or employment by virtue of which he is or may be eligible to participate in the Plan 6
be entitled to any compensation for any loss of any right or benefit or prospective right or benefit under the Plan which he might otherwise have enjoyed whether such compensation is claimed by way of damages for wrongful dismissal or other breach of contract or by way of compensation for loss of office or otherwise. By accepting the grant of an Option, an Optionee shall be deemed to have agreed to the foregoing provisions of this Section 7. 8) CHANGE IN CAPITAL STRUCTURE. The terms of this Option will be adjusted as the Committee determines in its sole discretion is equitably required to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of the Participant in accordance with Section 9 of the Plan. 9) GOVERNING LAW. The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of the Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Georgia and the United States of America without giving effect to the conflicts of laws principles thereof. 10) CONFLICTS.

Except as provided in paragraphs 3 or 4 below, if the termination of Participant's employment results from the Company's elimination of the position held by Participant, then Participant will continue to have the right to exercise the Option with respect to that portion of the Number of Shares for which the Option was vested and exercisable on the date of termination, and the remaining portion shall be cancelled. Except as provided in subsection 2(e)(iv) below, the right to exercise the Option will continue until the earlier of the last day of the 2
one-year period commencing on the date of termination of employment, or the Expiration Date. ii) RETIREMENT. Except as provided in paragraphs 3 or 4 below, if the termination of Participant's employment results from Participant's Retirement, Participant will continue to vest in the Option in accordance with the original vesting schedule in Subparagraph 2(b) above as if he had remained actively employed; provided that upon Participant's death all vesting will cease and the Option will be exercisable with respect to that portion of the Number of Shares for which the Option is vested and exercisable on the date of death, and the remaining portion shall be cancelled. Except as provided in subparagraph 2(e)(iv) below, the right to exercise the Option will continue until the earlier of the last day of the sixty (60) month period following Participant's Retirement, or the Expiration Date. "Retirement" means Participant's termination of employment with the Company or a Subsidiary (other than by the Company or a Subsidiary for Cause) at a time when Participant is eligible for immediate payment of benefits under Participant's applicable retirement plan, if any, or in the absence of an applicable retirement plan, as determined by the Committee. iii) DISABILITY. Except as provided in paragraphs 3 or 4 below, if the termination of Participant's employment results from Participant's total and permanent disability, confirmed by a licensed physician's statement, then Participant will continue to have the right to exercise the Option with respect to that portion of the Number of Shares for which the Option was vested and exercisable on the last date of Participant's active employment and the remaining portion shall be cancelled. Except as provided in subparagraph 2(e)(iv) below, the right to exercise the Option will continue until the earlier of the last day of the sixty (60) month period following the last date of Participant's active employment or the Expiration Date. iv) DEATH. (A) Except as provided in paragraphs 3 or 4 below, if the termination of Participant's employment results from Participant's death, then Participant's estate, or the person(s) to whom Participant's rights under this Agreement pass by will or the laws of descent and distribution, will have the right to exercise the Option with respect to that portion of the Number of Shares for which the Option was vested and exercisable on the date of Participant's death, and the remaining portion shall be cancelled. The right to exercise the Option will continue until the earlier of the last day of the sixty (60) month period following Participant's death or the Expiration Date. 3
(B) If Participant dies following termination of employment and prior to the expiration of any remaining period during which the Option may be exercised in accordance with subparagraphs (i), (ii) or (iii) above, or paragraph 3, the remaining period during which the Option will be exercisable (by Participant's estate, or the person(s) to whom Participant's rights under this Agreement pass by will or the laws of descent and distribution) will be the greater of (a) the remaining period under the applicable subparagraph or paragraph referred to above, or (b) six (6) months from the date of death; provided that under no circumstances will the Option be exercisable after the Expiration Date. 3) CHANGE IN CONTROL. If a Change in Control of the Company occurs while Participant is employed by the Company or a Subsidiary, then the entire Number of Shares represented by the Option not yet been exercised will become immediately vested and exercisable (the "Unexercised Portion"). If Participant's employment with the Company or a Subsidiary terminates after the date on which the Change in Control occurs other than as a result of a termination by the Company or a Subsidiary for Cause, then Participant (or, if applicable, Participant's estate or the person(s) to whom Participant's rights under this Agreement pass by will or the laws of descent and distribution) will have the right to exercise the Unexercised Portion. Except as provided in Section 2(e)(iv)(B) above or Section 4 below, that right will continue until the earlier of the last day of the sixty (60) month period following the termination of Participant's employment, or the Expiration Date. 4) CANCELLATION AND RESCISSION OF OPTION. a) If, at any time, (i) during the Participant's employment with the Company or (ii) during the period after the Participant's termination of employment with the Company for any reason during which all or part of the Option remains exercisable, but not to exceed 24 months following the Participant's termination of employment, a Participant engages in any "Detrimental Activity" (as defined in subsection (b) below), the Committee may, notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, cancel, rescind, suspend, withhold or otherwise restrict or limit this Option as of the first date the Participant engaged in the Detrimental Activity, as determined by the Committee. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Committee may also require the Participant to pay to the Company any gain realized by the Participant from exercising all or any portion of the Option hereunder during the period beginning six (6) months prior to the date on which Participant engaged or began engaging in Detrimental Activity. b) For purposes of this Agreement, "Detrimental Activity" shall mean and include any of the following: i) the breach or violation of any other agreement between Participant and the Company relating to the protection of Confidential Information or Trade 4
Secrets, the solicitation of employees, customers or suppliers, or the refraining from competition with the Company; ii) the disclosure, reproduction or use of Confidential Information or Trade Secrets (each as defined below) for the benefit of the Participant or third parties except in connection with the performance of the Participant's duties for the Company or, after advance notice to the Company, as required by a valid order or subpoena issued by a court or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction; iii) the use, reproduction, disclosure or distribution of any information which the Company is required to hold confidential under applicable federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. ss. 1681 et seq.) and any state credit reporting statutes; iv) the making, or causing or attempting to cause any other person to make, any statement, either written or oral, or conveying any information about the Company which is disparaging or which in any way reflects negatively upon the Company; v) the solicitation or attempt to solicit any customer or actively targeted potential customer of the Company with whom the Participant had material contact on the Company's behalf during the 12 months immediately preceding the Participant's termination of employment; vi) the solicitation or recruitment, attempt to solicit or recruit, or the assistance of others in soliciting or recruiting, any individual who is or was, within 6 months of the date in question, an employee of the Company unless such former employee was terminated by the Company without cause, or the inducement of (or attempt to induce) any such employee of the Company to terminate his employment with the Company; or vii) the refusal or failure of a Participant to provide, upon the request of the Company, a certification, in a form satisfactory to the Company, that he or she is in full compliance with the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Agreement, including, without limitation, a certification that the Participant is not engaging in Detrimental Activity. c) "Trade Secret" means information, including, but not limited to, technical or non-technical data, a formula, a pattern, a compilation, a program, a device, a method, a technique, a drawing, a process, financial data, financial plans, product plans, or a list of actual or potential Company customers or suppliers which (i) derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, and (ii) is the subject of the Company's efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain secrecy; or as otherwise defined by applicable state law. 5
d) "Confidential Information" means any and all knowledge, information, data, methods or plans (other than Trade Secrets) which are now or at any time in the future developed, used or employed by the Company which are treated as confidential by the Company and not generally disclosed by the Company to the public, and which relate to the business or financial affairs of the Company, including, but not limited to, financial statements and information, marketing strategies, business development plans, acquisition or divestiture plans, and product or process enhancement plans. e) Should any provision of this Paragraph 4 be held to be invalid or illegal, such illegality shall not invalidate the whole of this Paragraph 4, but, rather, the Plan shall be construed as if it did not contain the illegal part or be narrowed to permit its enforcement, and the rights and obligations of the parties shall be construed and enforced accordingly. 5) TERMINATION FOR CAUSE. For purposes of this Agreement, termination for "Cause" means termination as a result of (a) the willful and continued failure by Participant to substantially perform his or her duties with the Company (other than a failure resulting from Participant's incapacity due to physical or mental illness), after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to Participant by his or her superior officer which specifically identifies the manner the officer believes that Participant has not substantially performed his or her duties, or (b) Participant's willful misconduct which materially injures the Company, monetarily or otherwise. For purposes of this paragraph, Participant's act, or failure to act, will not be considered "willful" unless the act or failure to act is not in good faith and without reasonable belief that his or her action or omission was in the best interest of the Company. 6) FRACTIONAL SHARES. Fractional shares will not be issued, and when any provision of this Agreement otherwise would entitle Participant to receive a fractional share, that fraction will be disregarded. 7) NO RIGHT TO CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Plan: a) The Plan shall not form any part of any contract of employment between the Company or any Subsidiary and any employees of any of those companies, and it shall not confer on any such employees any legal or equitable rights (other than those constituting the Options themselves) against the Company or any Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, or give rise to any cause of action in law or in equity against the Company or any Subsidiary; b) The benefits to Eligible Employees under the Plan shall not form any part of their wages or remuneration or count as pay or remuneration for pension fund or other purposes; and c) In no circumstances shall any Eligible Employee on ceasing to hold the office or employment by virtue of which he is or may be eligible to participate in the Plan 6
be entitled to any compensation for any loss of any right or benefit or prospective right or benefit under the Plan which he might otherwise have enjoyed whether such compensation is claimed by way of damages for wrongful dismissal or other breach of contract or by way of compensation for loss of office or otherwise. By accepting the grant of an Option, an Optionee shall be deemed to have agreed to the foregoing provisions of this Section 7. 8) CHANGE IN CAPITAL STRUCTURE. The terms of this Option will be adjusted as the Committee determines in its sole discretion is equitably required to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of the Participant in accordance with Section 9 of the Plan. 9) GOVERNING LAW. The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of the Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Georgia and the United States of America without giving effect to the conflicts of laws principles thereof. 10) CONFLICTS. If provisions of the Plan and the provisions of this Agreement conflict, the Plan provisions will govern. 11) PARTICIPANT BOUND BY PLAN. Participant acknowledges receiving a summary of the Plan, which provides that upon request a copy of the Plan will be provided to the Participant free of charge, and agrees to be bound by all terms and provisions of the Plan. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not defined herein shall have the definitions given to them in the Plan. 12) BINDING EFFECT. Except as limited by the Plan or this Agreement, this Agreement is binding on and extends to the legatees, distributes, and personal representatives of Participant and the successors of the Company. 13) TAXES. Under procedures established by the Committee, the Company may withhold from Common Stock delivered to the Participant sufficient shares of Common Stock (valued as of the Date of Exercise) to satisfy federal, state and local withholding and employment taxes, or other taxes imposed by Participant's jurisdiction, or the Participant will pay or deliver to the Company cash or Common Stock (valued as of the Date of Exercise) in sufficient amounts to satisfy these obligations. The Company shall not, however, withhold any amount in excess of the minimum required amount. 14) TRANSFER OF DATA. In order to effectively administer Equifax's global compensation and benefit programs, we may transfer personal data from your Equifax employment file to a centralized repository controlled by Equifax in the United States of America. Your personal data in the repository will be used solely for internal Equifax purposes. You may examine your employee information file should you wish to do so. By signing this agreement, you provide your consent to this transfer and use of this data. 15) NIC ELECTION. It is a condition of the grant of this Option that the Participant enters into an election whereby the liability for the payment of the employer's secondary national insurance arising in connection with the Option is transferred to the Participant. The election, the terms of which have been approved by the UK Inland Revenue, are attached 7
hereto. Please complete, sign and return the election to Human Resources within 60 days of receipt. Failure to complete and return the signed election will result in the Option becoming null and void.

EXHBIT 10.8 EQUIFAX INC. INCENTIVE STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT (First_Name) (Last_NamE) Number of Shares: (Shares) Option Price: (Market_Value) Date of Grant: (Grant_Date) THIS AGREEMENT is entered into as of the above Date of Grant, by and between Equifax Inc., a Georgia corporation (the "Company"), and the above-named Participant ("Participant"). This Agreement is subject to the provisions of the Equifax Inc. 2000 Stock Incentive Plan, as may be amended from time to time (the "Plan") and, unless defined in this Agreement, all terms used in this Agreement have the same meanings given them in the Plan. 1. GRANT OF OPTION. The Company on the "Date of Grant" granted to Participant (subject to the terms of the Plan and this Agreement) the right to purchase from the Company all or part of the Number of Shares stated above (the "Option"). 2. BASIC TERMS AND CONDITIONS. The Option is subject to the following basic terms and conditions: (a) EXPIRATION DATE. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Option will expire ten (10) years from the Date of Grant (the "Expiration Date"). (b) EXERCISE OF OPTION. Except as provided in subparagraph 2(e) or paragraph 3, the Option shall be exercisable with respect to one-fourth of the Number of Shares subject to this option on the Date of Grant and with respect to an additional one-fourth of the Number of Shares subject to this Option on each of the first three anniversaries of the Date of Grant so that this Option shall be fully exercisable on the third anniversary of the Date of Grant, provided the Participant (i) remains employed by the Company or a Subsidiary or (ii) subject to the provisions of subparagraph 2(e)(ii), terminates employment by reason of Retirement (as defined in subparagraph 2(e)(ii)). Once exercisable, in whole or part, it will continue to be so exercisable until the earlier of the termination of Participant's rights under subparagraph 2(e) or paragraph 3, or the Expiration Date. The Option may be exercised in one or more exercises, provided that each exercise must be for a multiple of twenty-five (25) shares (E.G., 25 shares, 50 shares, 100 shares), up to the full number for which the Option is then
exercisable, unless the Number of Shares then exercisable is less than twenty-five (25), in which case the Option may be exercised for that lesser Number of Shares. (c) METHOD OF EXERCISE AND PAYMENT FOR SHARES. In order to exercise the Option, Participant must give written notice in a manner prescribed by the Company from time to time together with payment of the Option Price to the Company's Stock Option Administrator at the Company's principal office in Atlanta, Georgia, or as otherwise directed by the Administrator. The Date of Exercise will be the date of receipt of the notice or any later date specified in the notice. Participant must pay the Option Price (i) in cash or a cash equivalent acceptable to the Committee, or (ii) in the Committee's discretion by the surrender (or attestation of ownership) of shares of Common Stock (held by Participant for at least six (6) months) with an aggregate Fair Market Value (based on the closing price of a share of Common Stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange composite index on the Date of Exercise) that is not less than the Option Price, or by surrender of property described in and subject to the conditions provided in Section 4(d) of the Plan, or (iii) by a combination of cash and such shares. Payment of the Option Price may be deferred in the discretion of the Committee to accommodate proceeds of sale of some or all of the shares to which this grant relates. If at exercise, Participant is not in compliance with the Company's minimum stock ownership guidelines then in effect for Participant's job grade or classification, if any, Participant will not be entitled to exercise the Option using a "cashless exercise program" of the Company (if then in effect), unless the net proceeds received by Participant from that exercise consist only of shares of Company stock, and Participant agrees to hold all those shares for at least one (1) year. (d) TRANSFERABILITY. This option is non-transferable except by will, the laws of descent and distribution or to immediate family members, as defined in the Plan, a trust or partnership established for the benefit solely of one or more immediate family members. In the event of transfer to an immediate family member or other such entity for their account, current securities laws stipulate that when the option is exercised, shares issued will be restricted and not freely transferable for two years from date of exercise unless such shares are otherwise registered or sold pursuant to an exemption under the Securities Act of 1933. Any such transfer shall be effective only after reasonable prior notice thereof is provided in writing to the Committee and compliance with any terms and conditions therefor established by the Company, its Board or the Committee. (e) TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT. Except as provided in subparagraphs (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) below, or paragraph 3, the Option will expire and will not be exercisable after termination of Participant's employment with the Company or a Subsidiary. (i) ELIMINATION OF POSITION. Except as provided in paragraph 3 or 4 below, if the termination of Participant's employment results from the Company's elimination of the position held by Participant, then Participant will 2
continue to have the right to exercise the Option with respect to that portion of the Number of Shares for which the Option was vested and exercisable on the date of termination and the remaining portion shall be cancelled. Except as provided in subsection 2(e)(iv)(A) below, that right will continue until the earlier of the last day of the one-year period commencing on the date of termination of employment, or the Expiration Date. (ii) RETIREMENT. Except as provided in paragraph 3 or 4 below, if the termination of Participant's employment results from Participant's Retirement (as defined below), Participant will continue to vest in the Option in accordance with the original vesting schedule in subparagraph 2(b) above as if he had remained actively employed; provided, that upon Participant's death, all vesting will cease and the Option will be exercisable with respect to that portion of the Number of Shares for which the Option is vested and exercisable on the date of Participant's death and the remaining portion shall be cancelled. Participant will continue to have the right to exercise the Option with respect to that portion of the Number of Shares for which the Option is vested and exercisable from time to time until the earlier of the last day of the sixty (60) month period following Participant's Retirement, or the Expiration Date. "Retirement" means Participant's termination of employment with the Company or a Subsidiary (other than by the Company or a Subsidiary for Cause) at a time when Participant is eligible for immediate payment of benefits under Participant's applicable defined benefit retirement plan, if any, or in the absence of an applicable defined benefit retirement plan, as determined by the Committee. (iii) DISABILITY. Except as provided in paragraph 3 or 4 below, if the termination of Participant's employment results from Participant's total and permanent disability, confirmed by the statement of a licensed physician chosen or approved by the Committee, then Participant will continue to have the right to exercise the Option with respect to that portion of the Number of Shares for which the Option was vested and exercisable on the last date of Participant's active employment and the remaining portion shall be cancelled. Except as provided in subparagraph 2(e)(iv)(A) below that right will continue until the earlier of the last day of the sixty (60) month period following the last date of Participant's active employment or the Expiration Date. (iv) DEATH. (A) Except as provided in paragraph 3 or 4 below, if the termination of Participant's employment results from Participant's death, then Participant's estate, or the person(s) to whom Participant's rights under this Agreement pass by will or the laws of descent and 3
distribution, will have the right to exercise the Option with respect to that portion of the Number of Shares for which the Option was vested and exercisable on the date of Participant's death and the remaining portion shall be cancelled. That right will continue until the earlier of the last day of the sixty (60) month period following Participant's death or the Expiration Date. (B) If Participant dies following termination of employment and prior to the expiration of any remaining period during which the Option may be exercised in accordance with subparagraphs (i), (ii) or (iii) above, or paragraph 3, the remaining period during which the Option will be exercisable (by Participant's estate, or the person(s) to whom Participant's rights under this Agreement pass by will or the laws of descent and distribution) will be the greater of (a) the remaining period under the applicable subparagraph or paragraph referred to above, or (b) six (6) months from the date of death; provided that under no circumstances will the Option be exercisable after the Expiration Date. (f) TYPE OF OPTION. The Option is intended to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time, or any successor provision thereto, and shall be so construed; provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted as a representation, guarantee, or other undertaking on the part of the Company that the Option is or will be determined to be an Incentive Stock Option within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code. To the extent all or any portion of this Option does not qualify or ceases to qualify and is not treated as an Incentive Stock Option, it will be treated as a Nonqualified Stock Option. 3. CHANGE IN CONTROL. If a Change in Control of the Company occurs while Participant is employed by the Company or a Subsidiary, then the entire Number of Shares represented by the Option which had not yet been exercised will become immediately vested and exercisable (the "Unexercised Portion"). If Participant's employment with the Company or a Subsidiary terminates after the date on which the Change in Control occurs other than as a result of a termination by the Company or a Subsidiary for Cause, then Participant (or, if applicable, Participant's estate or the person(s) to whom Participant's rights under this Agreement pass by will or the laws of descent and distribution) will have the right to exercise the Unexercised Portion. Except as provided in Section 2(e)(iv)(B) above or Section 4 below, that right may be exercised until the earlier of the last day of the sixty (60) month period following the termination of Participant's employment or the Expiration Date. 4
4. CANCELLATION AND RESCISSION OF OPTION. (a) If, at any time, (i) during the Participant's employment with the Company or (ii) during the period after the Participant's termination of employment with the Company for any reason during which all or part of the Option remains exercisable, but not to exceed 24 months following the Participant's termination of employment, a Participant engages in any "Detrimental Activity" (as defined in subsection (b) below), the Committee may, notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, cancel, rescind, suspend, withhold or otherwise restrict or limit this Option as of the first date the Participant engaged in the Detrimental Activity, as determined by the Committee. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Committee may also require the Participant to pay to the Company any gain realized by the Participant from exercising all or any portion of the Option hereunder during the period beginning six (6) months prior to the date on which Participant engaged or began engaging in Detrimental Activity. (b) For purposes of this Agreement, "Detrimental Activity" shall mean and include any of the following: (i) the breach or violation of any other agreement between Participant and the Company relating to the protection of Confidential Information or Trade Secrets, the solicitation of employees, customers or suppliers, or the refraining from competition with the Company; (ii) the disclosure, reproduction or use of Confidential Information or Trade Secrets (each as defined below) for the benefit of the Participant or third parties except in connection with the performance of the Participant's duties for the Company or, after advance notice to the Company, as required by a valid order or subpoena issued by a court or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction; (iii) the use, reproduction, disclosure or distribution of any information which the Company is required to hold confidential under applicable federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. ss. 1681 et seq.) and any state credit reporting statutes; (iv) the making, or causing or attempting to cause any other person to make, any statement, either written or oral, or conveying any information about the Company which is disparaging or which in any way reflects negatively upon the Company; (v) the solicitation or attempt to solicit any customer or actively targeted potential customer of the Company with whom the Participant had material contact on the Company's behalf during the 12 months immediately preceding the Participant's termination of employment; 5
(vi) the solicitation or recruitment, attempt to solicit or recruit, or the assistance of others in soliciting or recruiting, any individual who is or was, within 6 months of the date in question, an employee of the Company unless such former employee was terminated by the Company without cause, or the inducement of (or attempt to induce) any such employee of the Company to terminate his employment with the Company; or (vii) the refusal or failure of a Participant to provide, upon the request of the Company, a certification, in a form satisfactory to the Company, that he or she is in full compliance with the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Agreement, including, without limitation, a certification that the Participant is not engaging in Detrimental Activity. (c) "Trade Secret" means information, including, but not limited to, technical or non-technical data, a formula, a pattern, a compilation, a program, a device, a method, a technique, a drawing, a process, financial data, financial plans, product plans, or a list of actual or potential Company customers or suppliers which (i) derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, and (ii) is the subject of the Company's efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain secrecy; or as otherwise defined by applicable state law. (d) "Confidential Information" means any and all knowledge, information, data, methods or plans (other than Trade Secrets) which are now or at any time in the future developed, used or employed by the Company which are treated as confidential by the Company and not generally disclosed by the Company to the public, and which relate to the business or financial affairs of the Company, including, but not limited to, financial statements and information, marketing strategies, business development plans, acquisition or divestiture plans, and product or process enhancement plans. (e) Should any provision of this Paragraph 4 be held to be invalid or illegal, such illegality shall not invalidate the whole of this Paragraph 4, but, rather, the Plan shall be construed as if it did not contain the illegal part or be narrowed to permit its enforcement, and the rights and obligations of the parties shall be construed and enforced accordingly. 5. TERMINATION FOR CAUSE. For purposes of this Agreement, termination for "Cause" means termination as a result of (a) the willful and continued failure by Participant to substantially perform his or her duties with the Company (other than a failure resulting from Participant's incapacity due to physical or mental illness), after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to Participant by his or her superior officer which specifically identifies the manner the officer believes that Participant has not substantially performed his or her duties, or (b) Participant's willful misconduct which materially injures the Company, monetarily or otherwise. For purposes of this paragraph, 6
Participant's act, or failure to act, will not be considered "willful" unless the act or failure to act is not in good faith and without reasonable belief that his or her action or omission was in the best interest of the Company. 6. FRACTIONAL SHARES. Fractional shares will not be issued, and when any provision of this Agreement otherwise would entitle Participant to receive a fractional share, that fraction will be disregarded. 7. LIMITATION ON ACCELERATION. Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, this Option may not be exercisable and, without the Participant's consent, the exercisability of this Option may not be accelerated so that the shares for which the Option (and all other Incentive Stock Options granted to the Participant by the Company or a Subsidiary) are first exercisable in any calendar year have a Fair Market Value (determined on the Date of Grant) exceeding $100,000. 8. NO RIGHT TO CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT. This Agreement does not give Participant any right to continued employment by the Company or a Subsidiary, and it will not interfere in any way with the right of the Company or Subsidiary to terminate Participant's employment at any time. 9. ADJUSTMENTS IN CAPITAL STRUCTURE. The terms of this Option will be adjusted as the Committee determines in its sole discretion is equitably required to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of the Participant in accordance with Section 10 of the Plan. 10. GOVERNING LAW. The Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Georgia. 11. CONFLICTS. If provisions of the Plan and the provisions of this Agreement conflict, the Plan provisions will govern. 12. PARTICIPANT BOUND BY PLAN. Participant acknowledges receiving a summary of the Plan, which provides that upon request a copy of the Plan will be provided to the Participant free of charge, and agrees to be bound by all the terms and provisions of the Plan. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not defined herein shall have the definitions given to them in the Plan. 13. BINDING EFFECT. Except as limited by the Plan or this Agreement, this Agreement is binding on and extends to the legatees, distributes, and personal representatives of Participant and the successors of the Company. 7
14. TAXES. Under procedures established by the Committee, the Company may withhold from Common Stock delivered to the Participant sufficient shares of Common Stock to satisfy required federal, state and local withholding and employment taxes, or the Participant will pay or deliver to the Company cash or Common Stock in sufficient amounts to satisfy these obligations. The Company shall not, however, withhold any amount in excess of the minimum required amount. 15. TRANSFER OF DATA. In order to effectively administer Equifax's global compensation and benefit programs, we may transfer personal data from your Equifax employment file to a centralized repository controlled by Equifax in the United States of America.

The Committee may in its sole and absolute discretion at any time before, or within 120 days after, the date of such termination of employment determine that some or all of such Deferred Shares shall be free of restrictions and shall not be forfeited. 4. CANCELLATION AND RESCISSION OF DEFERRED SHARES. (a) If, at any time, (i) during the Participant's employment with the Company or (ii) during the one-year period after the Participant's termination of employment with the Company for any reason, a Participant engages in any "Detrimental Activity" (as defined in subsection (b) below), the Committee may, notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, cancel, rescind, or otherwise forfeit the Deferred Shares as of the first date the Participant engaged in the Detrimental Activity, as determined by the Committee. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Committee may also require the Participant to pay to the Company any gain realized by the Participant due to the vesting or delivery of the Deferred Shares during the period beginning six (6) months prior to the date on which Participant engaged or began engaging in Detrimental Activity. (b) For purposes of this Agreement, "Detrimental Activity" shall mean and include any of the following: (i) the breach or violation of any other agreement between Participant and the Company relating to the protection of Confidential Information or Trade Secrets, the solicitation of employees, customers or suppliers, or the refraining from competition with the Company; (ii) the disclosure, reproduction or use of Confidential Information or Trade Secrets (each as defined below) for the benefit of the Participant or third parties except in connection with the performance of the Participant's duties for the Company or, after advance notice to the Company, as required by a valid order or subpoena issued by a court or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction; (iii) the use, reproduction, disclosure or distribution of any information which the Company is required to hold confidential under applicable federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. ss. 1681 et. Seq.) and any state credit reporting statutes; -2-
(iv) the making, or causing or attempting to cause any other person to make, any statement, either written or oral, or conveying any information about the Company which is disparaging or which in any way reflects negatively upon the Company; (v) the solicitation or attempt to solicit any customer or actively targeted potential customer of the Company with whom the Participant had material contact on the Company's behalf during the 12 months immediately preceding the Participant's termination of employment; (vi) the solicitation or recruitment, attempt to solicit or recruit, or the assistance of others in soliciting or recruiting, any individual who is or was, within 6 months of the date in question, an employee of the Company unless such former employee was terminated by the Company without cause, or the inducement of (or attempt to induce) any such employee of the Company to terminate his employment with the Company; or (vii) the refusal or failure of a Participant to provide, upon the request of the Company, a certification, in a form satisfactory to the Company, that he or she is in full compliance with the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Agreement, including, without limitation, a certification that the Participant is not engaging in Detrimental Activity. (c) "Trade Secret" means information, including, but not limited to, technical or non-technical data, a formula, a pattern, a compilation, a program, a device, a method, a technique, a drawing, a process, financial data, financial plans, product plans, or a list of actual or potential Company customers or suppliers which (i) derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, and (ii) is the subject of the Company's efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain secrecy; or as otherwise defined by applicable state law. (d) "Confidential Information" means any and all knowledge, information, data, methods or plans (other than Trade Secrets) which are now or at any time in the future developed, used or employed by the Company which are treated as confidential by the Company and not generally disclosed by the Company to the public, and which relate to the business or financial affairs of the Company, including, but not limited to, financial statements and information, marketing strategies, business development plans, acquisition or divestiture plans, and product or process enhancement plans. -3-
(e) Should any provision of this Paragraph 4 be held to be invalid or illegal, such illegality shall not invalidate the whole of this Paragraph 4, but, rather, the Plan shall be construed as if it did not contain the illegal part or be narrowed to permit its enforcement, and the rights and obligations of the parties shall be construed and enforced accordingly. 5. STOCK CERTIFICATES. Stock certificates (the "Certificate") evidencing the Deferred Shares shall be issued as of the Vesting Date and registered in the Employee's name. Subject to Section 8 of this Agreement, Certificates representing the unrestricted Common Shares will be delivered to the Employee as soon as practicable after the Vesting Date. If, however, the Employee elects to defer payment of the Common Shares as provided in Section 6 of this Agreement, the Common Shares shall be issued as set forth in the Deferral Election Agreement entered into between the Company and the Employee. 6. DEFERRAL ELECTION. The Employee may elect to defer delivery of the Common Shares that would otherwise be due by virtue of the lapse or waiver of the vesting requirements as set forth in Sections 2 or 3. If such deferral election is made, the Committee shall, in its sole discretion, establish the rules and procedures for such payment deferrals. 7. DIVIDENDS. Participants granted Deferred Shares shall not be entitled to receive any cash dividends, stock dividends or other distributions paid with respect to the Common Shares, except in circumstances where the distribution is covered by Section 18 below. 8. TAX WITHHOLDING OBLIGATIONS. The Employee shall be required to deposit with the Company an amount of cash equal to the amount determined by the Company to be required with respect to any withholding taxes, FICA contributions, or the like under any federal, state, or local statute, ordinance, rule, or regulation in connection with the award, deferral, or settlement of the Deferred Shares. Alternatively, the Company may, at its sole election, withhold the required amounts from the Employee's pay during the pay periods next following the date on which any such applicable tax liability otherwise arises. The Committee, in its discretion, may permit the Employee, subject to such conditions as the Committee shall require, to elect to have the Company withhold a number of Common Shares otherwise deliverable having a Fair Market Value sufficient to satisfy the statutory minimum of all or part of the Employee's estimated total federal, state, and local tax obligations associated with vesting or settlement of the Deferred Shares. The Company shall not deliver any of the Common Shares until and unless the Employee has made the deposit required herein or proper provision for required withholding has been made. 9. RESTRICTION AND TRANSFERABILITY. Until the Deferred Shares are vested as provided above, they may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated at any time. Any attempt to do so contrary to the provisions hereof shall be null and void. -4-
10. RIGHTS AS SHAREHOLDER. Except as provided in Section 7, the Employee shall not have voting or any other rights as a shareholder of the Company with respect to the Deferred Shares. Upon settlement of the Deferred Share units into Common Shares, the Employee will obtain full voting and other rights as a shareholder of the Company. 11. ADMINISTRATION. The Committee shall have the power to interpret the Plan and this Agreement and to adopt such rules for the administration, interpretation, and application of the Plan as are consistent therewith and to interpret or revoke any such rules. All actions taken and all interpretations and determinations made by the Committee shall be final and binding upon the Employee, the Company, and all other interested persons. No member of the Committee shall be personally liable for any action, determination, or interpretation made in good faith with respect to the Plan or this Agreement. 12. EFFECT ON OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. The value of the Deferred Share units granted pursuant to this Agreement shall not be included as compensation, earnings, salaries, or other similar terms used when calculating the Employee's benefits under any employee benefit plan sponsored by the Company or any Subsidiary except as such plan otherwise expressly provides. 13. NO EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS. The award of the Deferred Shares pursuant to this Agreement shall not give the Employee any right to remain employed by the Company or a Subsidiary, nor shall it interfere with or restrict the Company's right to terminate the Employee's employment at any time. 14. AMENDMENT. This Agreement may be amended only by a writing executed by the Company and the Employee which specifically states that it is amending this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be amended solely by the Committee by a writing which specifically states that it is amending this Agreement, so long as a copy of such amendment is delivered to the Employee, and provided that no such amendment adversely affecting the rights of the Employee, hereunder may be made without the Employee's written consent. Without limiting the foregoing, the Committee reserves the right to change, by written notice to the Employee, the provisions of the Deferred Shares or this Agreement in any way it may deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purpose of the grant as a result of any change in applicable laws or regulations or any future law, regulation, ruling, or judicial decision, provided that any such change shall be applicable only to Deferred Shares which are then subject to restrictions as provided herein. 15. NOTICES. Any notice to be given under the terms of this Agreement to the Company shall be addressed to the Company in care of its Secretary. Any notice to be given to Employee shall be addressed to Employee at the address listed in the Company's records. -5-
By a notice given pursuant to this Section, either party may designate a different address for notices. Any notice shall have been deemed given when actually delivered. 16. SEVERABILITY. If all or any part of this Agreement or the Plan is declared by any court or governmental authority to be unlawful or invalid, such unlawfulness or invalidity shall not invalidate any portion of this Agreement or the Plan not declared to be unlawful or invalid. Any Section of this Agreement (or part of such a Section) so declared to be unlawful or invalid shall, if possible, be construed in a manner which will give effect to the terms of such Section or part of a Section to the fullest extent possible while remaining lawful and valid. 17. CONSTRUCTION. The restricted stock units are being issued in the form of Deferred Shares pursuant to Section 8 (Deferred Shares) of the Plan and are subject to the terms of the Plan. To the extent that any provision of this Agreement violates or is inconsistent with an express provision of the Plan, the Plan provision shall govern and any inconsistent provision in this Agreement shall be of no force or effect. 18. ADJUSTMENTS TO DEFERRED SHARES. The terms of this Deferred Share Award Agreement will be adjusted as the Committee determines in accordance with Section 10 of the Plan. 19. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement will be governed by and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed and delivered this Agreement effective as of the day and year first above written. PARTICIPANT EQUIFAX INC. By: /s/ Thomas F.

EQUIFAX COMPLETES $125 MILLION TRADE RECEIVABLES FINANCING
ATLANTA, Georgia, Sept. 8, 2004Equifax Inc. (NYSE: EFX) today announced the closing on Sept. 7, 2004 of a trade receivables-backed revolving credit facility.  Under the terms of the transaction, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Equifax may borrow up to $125 million, subject to borrowing base availability and other terms and conditions.  Equifax will use the net proceeds received from the sale of its trade receivables to the subsidiary for general corporate purposes.  As of Sept. 8, 2004, there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility.
The credit facility will be funded on a non-committed basis by Blue Ridge Funding Corporation, a commercial paper conduit, and on a back-up basis by Wachovia Bank, N.A. and certain other liquidity lenders from time to time.  Wachovia Bank is the agent for Blue Ridge and the liquidity lenders.  The credit facility has an expiration date of Sept. 6, 2005, but may be extended for an additional period of up to three years if specified conditions are satisfied. Loans will bear interest based on prevailing commercial paper rates, LIBOR or base rates plus a specified margin or costs.  Outstanding debt under the credit facility will be consolidated on Equifaxs balance sheet for financial reporting purposes.
Our trade receivables pool makes this credit facility a very efficient funding mechanism, said Donald T. Heroman, chief financial officer.  This is an important part of our plan to diversify our sources of credit and obtain the lowest possible borrowing cost.
