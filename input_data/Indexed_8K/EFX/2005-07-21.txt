Equifax Inc. (NYSE: EFX) today reported revenue of $363 million for the second quarter of 2005, an increase of 15 percent from the same period last year. Operating income of $107 million was up 16 percent from $92 million in the second quarter of 2004.
ATLANTA, July 21, 2005 
 
As compared to the second quarter of 2004, which included a one-time net gain of $23 million ($0.17 per share) from the sale of an investment in a business partner and a $2 million asset impairment charge ($0.01 per share), earnings from continuing operations were $63 million ($0.47 per share) compared to $77 million ($0.58 per share) in the same period last year.
 
Adjusted for the impact of these one-time events and the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act ("FACT Act"), a non-GAAP measure, revenue was $354 million, up 12 percent; earnings from continuing operations were $60 million, up 8 percent; and EPS was $0.45, up 9 percent.  A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP measure is included in the attachment to this press release and is also available in the Investor Center on our website at .

Notes to our Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Measures
 
1. We calculate free cash flow by subtracting capital-related expenditures from cash provided by operations. Free cash flow is useful to management and our investors in measuring the cash generated by us that is available to be used for business and strategic initiatives. Free cash flow is not a measurement of liquidity under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. In addition, our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore, comparability may be limited.
 
2. The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 ("FACT Act") amended the Fair Credit Reporting Act and became law in December 2003.  During 2004 we established, along with the other nationwide credit reporting agencies, a centralized request facility, Central Source, LLC, which is owned jointly by Equifax, Experian Information Solutions, Inc. and TransUnion LLC, to provide to consumers, upon their request, a free annual credit file disclosure on a phased-in basis beginning on December 1, 2004.  On December 1, 2004, we began to assess a regulatory recovery fee for certain of our business-to-business products to help mitigate the costs required to implement the provisions of the FACT Act.  During 2005, the initial implementation of the annual free credit report required by the FACT Act will be completed, and our related regulatory recovery fee will remain in effect as we continue to address the challenges involved in complying with the FACT Act.  We have incurred significant compliance costs to implement the FACT Act requirements and have captured those cumulative expenses and related capital investment in a table in our non-GAAP financial measures, "Cumulative FACT Act cash flow impact".
 
The net impact of the free credit file disclosure and other requirements of the FACT Act on our business will depend on numerous factors, including among others the actual demand of consumers for free credit reports and our experience marketing fee-generating products to consumers requesting free credit file disclosures.
 
3. Equifax believes that the measures presented above that exclude items related to the FACT Act are measures that should be presented in addition to the amounts that are determined in accordance with GAAP and are useful to investors. The following matters should be considered when evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures:
 
Equifax reviews our operating results and effectiveness and our business segments excluding revenue and expenses related to the FACT Act because it allows investors to evaluate more effectively the performance of our businesses. We believe that these items should be excluded in order to compare operating performance in past, current and future periods.
 - 
 
Revenue and expenses related to the FACT Act are material and are considered to be incremental to the normal operations of our business. Corporate management is responsible for making decisions about complying with the provisions of the FACT Act.
 - 
 
These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for GAAP operating measurements.
 -
