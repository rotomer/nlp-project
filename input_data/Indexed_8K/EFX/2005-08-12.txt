On August 12, 2005, Equifax Inc., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thomas F. Chapman adopted a pre-arranged securities trading plan in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Equifax policies regarding stock transactions.  The trading plan has been approved by the Equifax Board of Directors.
 
Rule 10b5-1 allows corporate officers and directors to adopt written plans at a time when they are not in possession of material, non-public information and by which they can sell shares in the future at predetermined times and price parameters.  Allowing diversification of portfolios, the pre-planned trades are executed as specified by the plan without further action by the officer and without regard to any non-public information the officer might receive after the plan has been adopted.
 
During August, 2004, Mr. Chapman announced that he would retire as of December 31, 2005.  Mr. Chapman's plan provides for the sale of certain shares of his Equifax common stock in installments between September 15, 2005 and the date of his retirement.
 
Mr. Chapman noted that this routine plan would facilitate diversification of his holdings and estate planning in anticipation of retirement, while minimizing the effect of such sales by spreading them over an extended period.
 
  Transactions under the plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission as required.  Except as may be required by law, Equifax does not undertake to report modifications, terminations, transactions or other activities under Mr. Chapman's trading plan.
