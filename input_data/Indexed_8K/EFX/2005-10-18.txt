Item 1.01  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
Effective as of October 14, 2005, Equifax Inc., a Georgia corporation ("Equifax"), amended and restated its Rights Agreement dated as of October 25, 1995, as amended by Amendment to Rights Agreement dated as of July 7, 2001, between Equifax and SunTrust Bank, a Georgia banking corporation ("SunTrust"), as Rights Agent (the "Prior Agreement").  The amendment and restatement is reflected in the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement dated as of October 14, 2005 between Equifax and SunTrust, as Rights Agent (the "Rights Agreement").  As more fully described in and subject to the terms of the Rights Agreement, the Rights Agreement generally gives holders of Equifax's Common Stock rights to acquire additional shares of Equifax's Common Stock upon the occurrence of specified events.  SunTrust serves as Equifax's stock transfer agent.
 
The amendments included in the Rights Agreement were approved by the Board of Directors and (a) extend the final expiration of the Prior Agreement from November 6, 2005 to November 6, 2015; (b) eliminate the double trigger feature by increasing the thresholds at which the Rights become exercisable and the "self-dealing" flip-in is triggered, in each case, from 15% to 20%; (c) change the exercise price of each right from $55 to $153.81; (d) add a provision for a TIDE (three year independent director evaluation) committee; (e) clarify that the Board of Directors of Equifax may in good faith determine that a disposition of common stock by a person inadvertently exceeding the permitted threshold has been made as promptly as practicable; and (f) make certain other clarifying changes.
 
The TIDE Committee will consist of independent members of the Board of Directors and will review and evaluate the Rights Agreement to consider whether it continues to be in the best interest of the Company, its shareholders and any other relevant constituencies of the Company (i) at least every three years and (ii) sooner if an acquisition proposal is made that the TIDE Committee believes would make such a review and evaluation appropriate.  Following such review, the TIDE Committee will communicate its conclusion to the Board of Directors, including any recommendation as to whether the Rights Agreement should be modified or the rights should be redeemed.  A copy of the Rights Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

Under certain circumstances, as set forth in the Rights Agreement, such Rights may be redeemed, may expire, may be amended or may be evidenced by separate certificates and no longer be evidenced by this Certificate.  Equifax Inc. will mail to the holder of this Certificate a copy of the Rights Agreement without charge promptly after receipt of a written request therefor.  Under certain circumstances as set forth in the Rights Agreement, Rights beneficially owned by an Acquiring Person or any Affiliate or Associate of an Acquiring Person (as such terms are defined in the Rights Agreement) may become null and void.
Rights Agreement
 
With respect to Right Certificates containing the foregoing legend, until the earlier of (i) the Distribution Date or (ii) the Expiration Date, the Rights associated with the Common Shares represented by such certificates shall be evidenced by such certificates alone and registered holders of Common Shares shall also be the registered holders of the associated Rights, and the transfer of any of such certificates shall also constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Shares represented by such certificates.
The Company shall promptly notify the Rights Agent of the occurrence of a Distribution Date and request its transfer agent to provide to the Rights Agent a shareholder list together with all other relevant information.  As promptly as practicable after the Distribution Date, the Company shall prepare and execute, the Rights Agent will countersign and shall, at the Company's expense, send or cause to be sent (and the Rights Agent shall, if requested, send), by first-class, insured, postage prepaid mail, to each record holder of Common Shares as of the Close of Business on the Distribution Date, at the address of such holder shown on the records of the Company, a Right Certificate, evidencing one Right for each Common Share so held, subject to adjustment as provided herein.  In the event that an adjustment in the number of Rights per Common Share has been made pursuant to hereof, at the time of distribution of the Right Certificates, the Company shall make the necessary and appropriate rounding adjustments (in accordance with hereof) so that Right Certificates representing only whole numbers of Rights are distributed and cash is paid in lieu of any fractional Rights.  As of and after the Distribution Date, the Rights shall be evidenced solely by such Right Certificates.  The failure to mail a Right Certificate shall not affect the legality or validity of the Rights.

For the purpose of any computation hereunder, the "current per share market price" of Common Shares on any date shall be deemed to be the average of the daily closing prices per share of such Common Shares for the 30 consecutive Trading Days immediately prior to such date; , , that in the event that the current per share market price of the Common Shares is determined during a period following the announcement by the issuer of such Common Shares of (i) a dividend or distribution on such Common Shares payable in such Common Shares or securities convertible into such Common Shares (other than the Rights) or (ii) any subdivision, combination or reclassification of such Common Shares, and prior to the expiration of 30 Trading Days after the ex-dividend date for such dividend or distribution, or the record date for such subdivision, combination or reclassification, then, and in each such case, the current per share market price shall be appropriately adjusted to take into account ex-dividend trading or to reflect the current per share market price per Common Share equivalent.  The closing price for each day shall be the last sale price, regular way, or, in case no such sale takes place on such day, the average of the closing bid and asked prices, regular way, in either case as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed or admitted to trading on the NYSE or, if the Common Shares are not listed or admitted to trading on the NYSE, as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed on the principal national securities exchange on which the Common Shares are listed or admitted to trading or, if the Common Shares are not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, the last quoted price or, if not so quoted, the average of the high bid and low asked prices in the over-the-counter market, as reported by Nasdaq or such other system then in use, or, if on any such date the Common Shares are not quoted by any such organization, the average of the closing bid and asked prices as furnished by a professional market maker making a market in the Common Shares selected by the Board of Directors.  If the Common Shares are not publicly held or not so listed or traded, or not the subject of available bid and asked quotes, "current per share market price" shall mean the fair value per share as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent.

Whenever in the performance of its duties under this Agreement the Rights Agent deems it necessary or desirable that any fact or matter be proved or established by the Company prior to taking or suffering any action hereunder, such fact or matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by a certificate signed by any one of the Chairman of the Board, the President, any Vice President, the Secretary or the Treasurer of the Company and delivered to the Rights Agent; and such certificate shall be full authorization to the Rights Agent for any action taken or suffered in good faith by it under the provisions of this Agreement in reliance upon such certificate.
(b)

(c)
                                 
 
The Rights Agent shall not be liable for or by reason of any of the statements of fact or recitals contained in this Agreement or in the Right Certificates (except its countersignature thereof) or be required to verify the same, but all such statements and recitals are and shall be deemed to have been made by the Company only.
(d)
                                
 
The Rights Agent shall not be under any responsibility in respect of the validity of this Agreement or the execution and delivery hereof (except the due execution and delivery hereof by the Rights Agent) or in respect of the validity or execution of any Right Certificate (except its countersignature thereof); nor shall it be responsible for any breach by the Company of any covenant or condition contained in this Agreement or in any Right Certificate; nor shall it be responsible for any adjustment required under the provisions of or hereof (including any adjustment which results in Rights becoming void) or responsible for the manner, method or amount of any such adjustment or the ascertaining of the existence of facts that would require any such adjustment (except with respect to the exercise of Rights evidenced by Right Certificates after actual notice of any such adjustment); nor shall it by any act hereunder be deemed to make any representation or warranty as to the authorization or reservation of any shares of stock or other securities to be issued pursuant to this Agreement or any Right Certificate or as to whether any shares of stock or other securities will, when issued, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

Any application by the Rights Agent for written instructions from the Company may, at the option of the Rights Agent, set forth in writing any action proposed to be taken or omitted by the Rights Agent under this Agreement and the date on or after which such action shall be taken or such omission shall be effective.  The Rights Agent shall not be liable for any action taken by, or omission of, the Rights Agent in accordance with a proposal included in any such application on or after the date specified in such application (which date shall not be less that five Business Days after the date any officer of the Company actually receives such application, unless any such officer shall have consented in writing to an earlier date) unless, prior to taking any such action (or the effective date in the date of an omission), the Rights Agent shall have received written instructions in response to such application specifying the action to be taken or omitted.
 
The Rights Agent and any shareholder, director, officer or employee of the Rights Agent may buy, sell or deal in any of the Rights or other securities of the Company or become pecuniarily interested in any transaction in which the Company may be interested, or contract with or lend money to the Company or otherwise act as fully and freely as though it were not Rights Agent under this Agreement.

registered or certified mail, and to the holders of the Right Certificates by first-class mail.  The Company may remove the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent upon 30 calendar days' notice in writing, mailed to the Rights Agent or successor Rights Agent, as the case may be, and to each transfer agent of the Common Shares by registered or certified mail, and to the holders of the Right Certificates by first-class mail.  If the Rights Agent resigns or is removed or otherwise becomes incapable of acting, the Company shall appoint a successor to the Rights Agent.  If the Company fails to make such appointment within a period of 30 calendar days after giving notice of such removal or after it has been notified in writing of such resignation or incapacity by the resigning or incapacitated Rights Agent or by the holder of a Right Certificate (who shall, with such notice, submit his Right Certificate for inspection by the Company), then the registered holder of any Right Certificate may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a new Rights Agent.  Any successor Rights Agent, whether appointed by the Company or by such a court, shall be a Person organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or of the State of Georgia or the State of New York (or of any other state of the United States so long as such corporation is authorized to do business as a banking institution in the State of Georgia or the State of New York), in good standing, having a principal office in the State of Georgia or the State of New York, which is authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust or stock transfer powers and is subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority and which has at the time of its appointment as Rights Agent a combined capital and surplus of at least $50 million.  After appointment, the successor Rights Agent shall be vested with the same powers, rights, duties and responsibilities as if it had been originally named as Rights Agent without further act or deed; but the predecessor Rights Agent shall deliver and transfer to the successor Rights Agent any property at the time held by it hereunder, and execute and deliver any further assurance, conveyance, act or deed necessary for the purpose.  Not later than the effective date of any such appointment, the Company shall file notice thereof in writing with the predecessor Rights Agent and each transfer agent of the Common Shares, and mail a notice thereof in writing to the registered holders of the Right Certificates.  Failure to give any notice provided for in this , however, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of the resignation or removal of the Rights Agent or the appointment of the successor Rights Agent, as the case may be.
Section 21
 
.  Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Agreement or of the Rights to the contrary, the Company may, at its option, issue new Right Certificates evidencing Rights in such form as may be approved by its Board of Directors to reflect any adjustment or change in the Purchase Price per share and the number or kind of securities issuable upon exercise of the Rights made in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.  In addition, in connection with the issuance or sale by the Company of Common Shares following the Distribution Date and prior to the Expiration Date, the Company (a) shall, with respect to Common Shares so issued or sold pursuant to the exercise, exchange or conversion of securities (other than Rights) issued prior to the Distribution Date which are exercisable or exchangeable for, or convertible into, Common Shares, and (b) may, in any other case, if deemed necessary, appropriate or desirable by the Board of Directors, issue Right Certificates representing an equivalent number of Rights as would have been issued in respect of such Common Shares if they had been issued or sold prior to the Distribution Date, as appropriately adjusted as provided herein as if they had been so issued or sold; , , that (i) no such Right Certificate shall be issued if, and to the extent that, in its good faith judgment the Board of Directors determines that the issuance of such Right Certificate

Redemption
 
Prior to the Expiration Date, the Company may, at its option and with the approval of the Board, redeem all but not less than all of the then-outstanding Rights at the Redemption Price at any time prior to the Close of Business on the later of (i) the Distribution Date and (ii) the Share Acquisition Date, or on such later date as the Board of Directors may designate prior to such time as the Rights are no longer redeemable hereunder.
(a)
                                 
 
Immediately upon the effectiveness of the redemption of the Rights as provided in Section 23(a), and without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise the Rights shall terminate and the only right thereafter of the holders of Rights shall be to receive the Redemption Price without interest thereon.  Promptly after the effectiveness of the redemption of the Rights as provided in Section 23(a), the Company shall publicly announce such redemption, and within 10 calendar days thereafter, the Company shall give notice of such redemption to the holders of the then-outstanding Rights by mailing such notice to all such holders at their last addresses as they appear upon the registry books of the Company; , , that the failure to give, or any defect in, any such notice shall not affect the validity of the redemption of the Rights.  Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be deemed given, whether or not the holder receives the notice.  The notice of redemption mailed to the holders of Rights shall state the method by which the payment of the Redemption Price will be made.  The Company may, at its option, pay the Redemption Price in cash, Common Shares (based upon the current per share market price of the Common Shares (determined pursuant to  hereof) at the time of redemption) or any other form of consideration deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors (based upon the fair market value of such other consideration, determined by the Board of Directors in good faith) or any combination thereof.  The Company may, at its option, combine the payment of the Redemption Price with any other payment being made concurrently to holders of Common Shares and, to the extent that any such other payment is discretionary, may reduce the amount thereof on account of the concurrent payment of the Redemption Price.  If legal or contractual restrictions prevent the Company from paying the Redemption Price (in the form of consideration deemed appropriate by the Board) at the time of redemption, the Company will pay the Redemption Price, without interest, promptly after such time as the Company ceases to be so prevented from paying the Redemption Price.

Distribution Date
 
The Rights Agreement provides that, until the Distribution Date, the Rights will be transferred with and only with the Common Shares.  Until the Distribution Date (or earlier redemption or expiration of the Rights), new Common Share certificates issued upon transfer or new issuance of Common Shares will contain a notation incorporating the Rights Agreement by reference.  Until the Distribution Date (or earlier redemption or expiration of the Rights), the surrender for transfer of any certificates for Common Shares in respect of which Rights have been issued will also constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Shares represented by such certificates.

Final
Expiration Date
 
The Purchase Price payable, and the number of Common Shares or other securities issuable, upon exercise of the Rights are subject to adjustment from time to time to prevent
dilution (i) in the event of a stock dividend on, or a subdivision, combination or reclassification of, the Common Shares, (ii) upon the grant to holders of the Common Shares of certain rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase Common Shares at a price, or securities convertible into Common Shares with a conversion price, less than the then current market price of the Common Shares or (iii) upon the distribution to holders of the Common Shares of evidences of indebtedness or cash (excluding regular periodic cash dividends), assets, stock (excluding dividends payable in Common Shares) or of subscription rights or warrants (other than those referred to above).
 
In the event (a "") that (i) any person or group of affiliated or associated persons becomes an Acquiring Person, (ii) any Acquiring Person merges into or combines with the Company and the Company is the surviving corporation or any Acquiring Person effects certain other transactions with the Company, as described in the Rights Agreement, or (iii) during such time as there is an Acquiring Person, there shall be any reclassification of securities or recapitalization or reorganization of the Company which has the effect of increasing by more than 1% the proportionate share of the outstanding shares of any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person, proper provision shall be made so that each holder of a Right, other than Rights that are or were owned beneficially by the Acquiring Person (which, from and after the later of the Distribution Date and the date of the earliest of any such events, will be void), will thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise thereof at the then current exercise price of the Right, that number of Common Shares (or, under certain circumstances, an economically equivalent security or securities of the Company) having a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right.
Flip-in Event
 
To illustrate the operation of such an adjustment, at a Purchase Price of $153.81, assuming the current market price (as determined pursuant to the provisions of the Rights Agreement) per Common Share were $34.18, each Right not owned beneficially by an Acquiring Person at or after the time of such an occurrence would entitle its holder to purchase (after the Distribution Date) from the Company nine (9) Common Shares (having a market value of $307.62) for $153.81.

Flip-over Event
 
At any time after the later of the Distribution Date and the first occurrence of a Flip-in Event or Flip-over Event and prior to the acquisition by any person or group of affiliated or associated persons of 50% or more of the outstanding Common Shares, the Board of Directors
may exchange the Rights (other than any Rights which have become void), in whole or in part, at an exchange ratio of one Common Share per Right (subject to adjustment).
 
With certain exceptions, no adjustment in the Purchase Price will be required until cumulative adjustments require an adjustment in the Purchase Price of at least 1%.  The Company is not required to issue fractional Common Shares or other securities issuable upon the exercise of Rights.  In lieu of issuing such securities, the Company may make a cash payment, as provided in the Rights Agreement.
 
The Company may redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of $0.01 per Right (the ""), at any time prior to the close of business on the later of (i) the Distribution Date and (ii) the first date of public announcement that a person has become an Acquiring Person or on such later date, as the Board of Directors may designate prior to such time as the Rights are no longer redeemable.  Immediately upon any redemption of the Rights, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the Redemption Price.
Redemption Price
 
In addition, the Board of Directors will appoint a committee (the "") that is comprised of at least three directors of the Company who are independent under the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange and who are not an Acquiring Person nor an affiliate or an associate of an Acquiring Person, to review and evaluate the Rights Agreement in order to consider whether it continues to be in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders (i) at least every three years, or (ii) sooner if an acquisition proposal is made that the TIDE Committee believes would make such a review and evaluation appropriate.  Following each such review, the TIDE Committee will communicate its conclusions to the full Board of Directors, including any recommendation as to whether the Rights Agreement should be modified or the Rights should be redeemed.
TIDE Committee
 
The Rights Agreement may be amended by the Company without the approval of any holders of Right Certificates, including amendments which add other events requiring adjustment to the purchase price payable and the number of Common Shares or other securities issuable upon the exercise of the Rights or which modify procedures relating to the redemption of the Rights, provided that no amendment may be made at such time as the Rights are not then redeemable which decreases the stated Redemption Price or the period of time remaining until the Final Expiration Date or which modifies a time period relating to when the Rights may be redeemed.
