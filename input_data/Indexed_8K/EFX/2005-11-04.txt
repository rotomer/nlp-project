(the "Company") established the performance measures for the previously disclosed grant to be made on January 6, 2006, to Richard F. Smith, Chairman-Elect and Chief Executive Officer, of 65,000  performance-based restricted stock units pursuant to the terms of his employment agreement with the Company.  Mr. Smith's performance objective will be measured by the Company's earnings per share for the year ending December 31, 2006, and the restricted stock units will vest on the third anniversary of the grant date, subject to continued employment.
 
The Committee on November 1 also approved the 2006 annual base salaries of the Company's executive officers after a review of performance and competitive market data.

The following table sets forth the annual base salary levels for 2006 of the Company's next four most highly compensated executive officers after Mr. Smith:
