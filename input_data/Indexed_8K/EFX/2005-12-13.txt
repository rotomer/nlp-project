Equifax Inc. ("Equifax" or the "Company") is furnishing as Exhibit 99.1 hereto Regulation FD disclosure to clarify certain unusual items in 2005 and 2006 that will have an impact on the Company's 2005 and 2006 earnings per share, including among other things the impact of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions of 2003 ("FACT Act"), previously disclosed recent executive compensation actions,  and the Company's adoption on January 1, 2006 of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004)("SFAS 123R"), "Share-Based Payment".  The information contained in Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
Date: December 13, 2005
 
The following exhibit is being filed with this report:
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
1.  What is the estimated impact of the FACT Act on Equifax's earnings per share (EPS) for the year ending December 31, 2005?
 
The Company estimates that the 2005 positive impact of the FACT Act on fully diluted EPS will be approximately $0.07.
 
2.  What is the expected EPS impact for 2006 of Equifax's adoption in January 2006 of SFAS 123R?
 
The estimated negative impact on 2006 fully diluted EPS of the Company's adoption of SFAS 123R will be approximately $0.05.  This estimate is subject to change based on a number of factors, including without limitation the number, terms and conditions of new stock awards and the fair value at date of grant of such awards.
 
3.  What is the expected EPS impact for the full year 2005 of the September 2005 amendment of an agreement in which Equifax provides RMA Holdings LLC ("RMA") with credit information products and services?
 
The amendment to the RMA agreement reduced the level of credit information products and services that we are obligated to provide,resulting in a nonrecurring gain being recorded by Equifax during the third quarter of 2005 in other income, net.  The Company estimates that the positive fully diluted EPS impact of the RMA agreement for full year 2005 is approximately $0.03, which we do not expect in 2006.  For additional information on the RMA agreement, see Note 11 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements filed with Equifax's third quarter Form 10-Q on November 7, 2005.
 
4.  On December 22, 2004, Equifax filed a Form 8-K summarizing certain executive compensation actions approved by the Board of Directors, including the terms of the transition agreement entered into between the Company and former Chief Executive Officer Thomas F. Chapman.  What is the expected full year 2005 EPS impact of Mr. Chapman's transition agreement?
 
The Company estimates that the incremental impact for the full year 2005 on fully diluted EPS of compensation and other expenses related to Mr. Chapman's transition agreement is approximately $0.03.
 
5.  On October 4, 2005, Equifax filed a Form 8-K estimating the EPS impact for the third and fourth quarters of 2005 of Richard F. Smith's employment agreement, entered into on August 22, 2005, pursuant to which he became Chairman-Elect and Chief Executive Officer of Equifax effective September 19, 2005.  Are there any incremental costs relating to Mr. Smith's employment agreement that will be reflected in 2006?
 
As previously disclosed, Equifax estimates that the incremental impact of compensation and other expenses related to Mr. Smith's employment agreement on the Company's fully diluted EPS for the third and fourth quarters of 2005 will be approximately $0.03 and $0.01, respectively.  In 2006, the Company estimates that higher Chief Executive Officer compensation and other expenses will have an incremental fully diluted EPS impact of approximately $0.02 as compared to Chief Executive Officer expense in 2005.
