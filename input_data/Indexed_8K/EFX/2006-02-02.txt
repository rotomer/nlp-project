Immediately prior to the public offering, CD Holdings, Inc. converted a $20.0 million senior secured convertible note issued to it by Intersections Inc. in November 2001 into 3,755,792 shares of Intersections Inc. common stock, or approximately 26.9% of Intersection Inc.'s outstanding stock before its public offering.

The book value of our investment in Intersections Inc. was $22.3 million, including accrued interest of $2.3 million. In 2004, we recorded a $36.8 million gain ($23.0 million net of tax) related to this transaction.
 
Excluding the gain discussed above of $36.8 million, other income, net for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 would have been $10.7 million as opposed to $47.5 million.
 
11.

Excludes $5.3 million in previously reported asset impairment and related charges related to Italy for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004. These charges have been reclassified to loss from discontinued operations.
*
     
 
The effective tax rate from continuing operations was 36.9% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, down from 38.4% for the same period in 2004. The favorable reduction was primarily due to lower state income taxes and a reduction to the tax contingency reserve offset by additional tax expense related to non-deductible compensation.
12.
 
What drove the fluctuation in the annual effective tax rate?
 
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions," we were required to recognize a prepaid pension asset of approximately $165 million as a result of our U.S. Retirement Income Plan being overfunded as of December 31, 2005. This recognition resulted in a decrease in our minimum pension liability recorded in other comprehensive loss on our Consolidated Balance Sheets of approximately $100 million, net of tax.
13.
 
Why did the long-term prepaid pension asset increase to $183.7 million at December 31, 2005 from $18.2 million at December 31, 2004?

Notes to Our Non-GAAP Financial Measures That Supplement GAAP Accounting Measures
 
Certain disclosures prepared in accordance with accounting standards generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") contained in the preceding reconciliation are supplemented by disclosures that are not prepared in conformity with GAAP. These non-GAAP disclosures exclude certain items from the nearest equivalent GAAP presentations. We believe that a meaningful analysis of our financial performance requires an understanding of the factors underlying that performance and our judgments about the likelihood that particular factors will repeat. In some cases, short-term patterns and long-term trends may be obscured by unique large factors or one-time events. For example, events or trends in a particular business segment may be so significant as to obscure patterns and trends of our business in total. For this reason, we believe that investors may find it useful to see our "free cash flow," as well as our revenue growth, net income and earnings per share excluding the effects of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 ("FACT Act") and special items in 2004 (which included a gain from the sale of our investment in Intersections Inc. and an impairment charge relating to our Marketing business) that were not a result of our core operations.
 
These non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as being more important than comparable GAAP measures. They are presented because management believes this information provides (1) a more meaningful, consistent comparison of our underlying operational performance and trends for the periods presented, on a basis consistent with our chief decision makers' means of evaluating operating performance, including those related to staffing, future management priorities and how it will direct future operating expenses; and (2) additional information for investors to assess changes between periods that better reflect our ongoing operations. The items included in these non-GAAP disclosures, and the basis for excluding them, are set forth below.
 
We calculate free cash flow by subtracting capital-related expenditures from cash provided by (used in) operating activities. We believe free cash flow provides an important measure because it is one factor in determining our liquidity and financial health, showing the cash generated by us that is available to be used for dividends and discretionary investment. Free cash flow is not a measurement of liquidity under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, cash flow from operating activities, or the change in cash on the balance sheet and may not be comparable with cash flow as defined by other companies.
Free Cash Flow 
 
There were certain items in 2005 as well as those anticipated in 2006 that will impact our expected year-over year growth in earnings per share. In 2005, we recorded a nonrecurring gain related to our agreement with RMA Holdings LLC. In 2006, we expect the incremental stock-based compensation expense related to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payments," on January 1, 2006 to negatively impact our financial results. Accordingly, we believe it is helpful to investors to exclude these items from earnings per share when calculating our expected earnings per share growth since these items are not related to the expected earnings per share growth in our core operations.
Estimated Diluted Earnings per Share Growth  Excluding Certain Items that Impact Comparability 
 
FACT Act amended the Fair Credit Reporting Act and became law in December 2003. Reference is made to the summary of the FACT Act under "FACT Act Update" in the Management's Discussion and Analysis section of our 2004 Form 10-K and third quarter of 2005 Form 10-Q. During 2004 we established, along with other nationwide credit reporting agencies, a centralized request facility, Central Source, LLC, which is
Cumulative FACT Act cash flow impact 
owned jointly by Equifax, Experian Information Solutions, Inc. and TransUnion LLC, to provide to consumers, upon their request, a free annual credit file disclosure on a phased-in basis beginning on December 1, 2004. On December 1, 2004, we began to assess a regulatory recovery fee for certain of our business-to-business products to help mitigate the costs required to implement the provisions of the FACT Act. The initial implementation of the annual free credit report required by the FACT Act has been completed. Our related recovery fee will remain in effect as we continue to recover the capital costs incurred and the ongoing costs involved in complying with the FACT Act. We have incurred significant compliance costs to implement the FACT Act requirements and have captured those cumulative expenses and related capital investment in a table in our non-GAAP financial measures, "Cumulative FACT Act cash flow impact."
 
We have presented income from continuing operations with the following non-GAAP adjustments: (1) We believe the FACT Act impacts the comparability of results and growth rates of certain of our North America Information Services business, including its underlying U.S. Consumer and Commercial, Mortgage Services, Information Services and Personal Solutions businesses. Our management believes that excluding the impact of the FACT Act provides a useful perspective on changes in the basic underlying operations of these businesses and our company as a whole, and is a key indicator of financial performance. (2) The sale in the second quarter of 2004 of Intersections Inc. for a gain of $23.0 million, net of tax, was material and not a result of our core operations relative to the operating results for the periods presented. (3) The asset impairment and related charges totaling $2.4 million for the second quarter of 2004 were not a result of our core operations for the operating results for the periods presented.
Income from Continuing Operations (excluding certain items impacting comparability)
 
As noted previously, we began assessing a regulatory recovery fee for certain of our business-to-business products in December 2004 to help mitigate our costs required to comply with the provisions of the FACT Act. We believe providing revenue measures excluding this fee provides a more consistent comparison of our underlying operating results and trends for the periods presented, on a basis consistent with management's means of evaluating revenue growth. The fee was not in effect until December 2004, and the phase-in of initial FACT Act compliance requirements was not completed until September 1, 2005.
