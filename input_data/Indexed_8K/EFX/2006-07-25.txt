Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On July 24, 2006, Equifax Inc. (the "Company") amended and restated its existing five-year, $500 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Amended Credit Agreement") with SunTrust Bank, as Joint Lead and Administrative Agent, Banc of America Securities, LLC, as Joint Lead and Syndication Agent, and a number of other financial institutions, among other provisions the term was extended from August 20, 2009 to July 24, 2011; the applicable margin for borrowings and the annual facility fee were lowered; the maximum leverage ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) was increased from 3.0 to 1 to 3.50 to 1; and a minimum interest coverage ratio was deleted. The Amended Credit Agreement may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes.
 
The Amended Credit Agreement also includes an "accordion" feature that will allow the Company to request an increase of up to $500 million in the maximum borrowing commitment, which cannot exceed $1.0 billion. Each member of the lending group may elect to participate or not participate in any request the Company makes to increase the maximum borrowing commitment. In addition, any increase in the borrowing capacity pursuant to this accordion feature is subject to certain terms and conditions, including the absence of an event of default. The increased borrowing commitment may be used for general corporate purposes.
 
At June 30, 2006, interest was payable on borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement at the base rate or London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus a specified margin or competitive bid option as selected by the Company from time to time. The annual facility fee and interest rate are subject to adjustment based on the Company's debt ratings. At June 30, 2006, the Company had $35.0 million outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement.
