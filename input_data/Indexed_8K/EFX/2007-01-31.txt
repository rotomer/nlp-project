Fourth Quarter 2006 Highlights
Double-digit revenue growth in four of five business units contributed to an 8 percent increase in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2006, when compared to the same period in 2005.
                 
The company completed an organizational realignment, effective January 1, 2007, to better support our strategic objectives. We recorded a $6.4m charge in the quarter related to the elimination of certain positions as part of the realignment.
                 
Operating margin decreased to 28.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006 from 29.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the unfavorable impact of the $6.4 million severance charge related to our organizational realignment and the negative incremental impact of adopting SFAS 123R, operating margin increased to 30.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006.
                 
Cash provided by operating activities for the fourth quarter of 2006 was $118.9 million, a 12 percent increase when compared to the same period in 2005.
                 
The company repurchased 1.4 million shares of its common stock on the open market for $50.7 million during the fourth quarter of 2006. At December 31, 2006, $132.6 million remained authorized for future share repurchases.
                 
The company acquired Austin-Tetra, Inc. on October 6, 2006 for $34.4 million. Austin-Tetra is a leading provider of business-to-business data management and enhancement services to the commercial market. This acquisition is an integral part of our long-term growth strategy, complementing our commercial information business.
                 
North America
Total revenue was $308.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, a 6 percent increase from the fourth quarter of 2005. Operating margin for North America was 38.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to 37.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005.
                 
North America Information Services revenue was $203.6 million, up 3 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2005.
                 
Marketing Services revenue was $73.6 million, up 11 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2005.
                 
Personal Solutions revenue was $31.7 million, up 18 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2005.

Operating margin decreased to 28.2 percent for the full year 2006 from 29.2 percent for the full year 2005. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of certain litigation matters, the $6.4 million severance charge in 2006 related to our organizational realignment, and the negative incremental impact of adopting SFAS 123R, operating margin increased to 29.7 percent for the full year 2006.
                 
Cash provided by operating activities for the full year 2006 was $374.3 million, an 11 percent increase when compared to the same period in 2005.
                 
Equifax repurchased 6.0 million shares of its common stock on the open market for $212.7 million during the full year 2006.
                 
The effective tax rate for the full year 2006 was 34.0 percent, as compared to 36.9 percent for the same period in 2005. The decline was primarily driven by the reversal of certain income tax reserves related to uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations during the third quarter of 2006, and a non-taxable gain related to a litigation settlement during the second quarter of 2006. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the favorable impact of the reversal of certain income tax reserves and the litigation settlement, our effective tax rate was 37.6 percent for the full year 2006.
                 
Total debt declined $52.2 million from December 31, 2005 to December 31, 2006.
                 
North America

On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of certain litigation matters, operating margin was 37.5 percent in 2006.

Latin America
Total revenue was $154.0 million, up 21 percent compared to 2005. In local currency, revenue was up 14 percent when compared to the prior year. Operating margin was 29.8 percent, up from 26.3 percent in the full year 2005.
2007 Annual Outlook
Based on current business trends and management's outlook, Equifax expects consolidated annual revenue growth to be between 6 percent and 10 percent. In 2007, we expect quarterly year-over-year growth to be in the lower portion of this range in the first quarter and to increase over the course of the year as new product and market initiatives yield increasing results. EPS for the full year is expected to be between $2.15 and $2.23, representing growth ranging from 7 percent to 11 percent over our 2006 EPS, excluding certain items, of $2.01. EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure defined by us as operating income before depreciation and amortization expense, is expected to be in the range of $555 million to $575 million for the full year. Annual capital expenditures are targeted at $70 million to $100 million. A reconciliation of EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP measure and related notes are presented in the attached Q&A.

3.
                
The increase in other income, net was primarily due to the settlement of claims against former selling shareholders of Naviant, Inc., an acquisition in 2002, which resulted in a $14.1 million non-taxable gain recorded during the second quarter of 2006, partially offset by a $3.3 million, pretax, gain recorded during the third quarter of 2005 related to an agreement with RMA Holdings, LLC.

Common Questions & Answers (Unaudited)
What drove the fluctuation in the effective tax rate?
4.
                
Our effective income tax rate was 37.3% for the three months ended December 31, 2006, up from 34.5% for the same period in 2005, due primarily to an increase in foreign taxes in the fourth quarter of 2006 and favorable discrete items during the fourth quarter of 2005.
Our effective income tax rate was 34.0% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 down from 36.9% for the same period in 2005. The reduction was due primarily to the reversal of income tax reserves related to uncertain tax positions for which the applicable statute of limitations expired in the third quarter of 2006 and the non-taxable litigation settlement related to Naviant Inc. during the second quarter of 2006.
The following is the impact of the reversal of the income tax reserves, which resulted in an income tax benefit, on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2006:

6.

Why did short-term debt and current maturities increase from $92.3 million at December 31, 2005 to $330.0 million at December 31, 2006?
7.

Notes to Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to the Comparable GAAP Financial Measures
This financial measure is not prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and excludes certain items, including (1) the reversal of a $9.5 million income tax reserve related to uncertain tax positions primarily due to the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations during the third quarter of 2006 and (2) the impact of the non-taxable $14.1 million gain recorded during the second quarter of 2006 related to the settlement of claims against the former selling shareholders of Naviant, Inc., an acquisition in 2002.  The effective tax rate, excluding certain items, is not a measurement of profitability under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, provision for income taxes or earnings per share.
Effective Tax Rate, Excluding Certain Items -
Management believes our effective tax rate, excluding certain items, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding the items discussed above in order to show a comparable effective tax rate since the items during the periods are material amounts and not comparable to similar activity in the prior periods presented. Equifax believes that this financial information is useful to our management and investors in assessing Equifax's historical performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.
Pretax Income, Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share, Excluding Certain Items; Personal Solutions Operating Income and Profit Margin, Excluding Certain Litigation Matters; North America Information Services Operating Income and Profit Margin, Excluding Certain Litigation Matters; North America Operating Income and Profit Margin, Excluding Certain Litigation Matters; and Consolidated Operating Income and Profit Margin, Excluding Certain Items
During the fourth quarter of 2006, we recorded a $6.4 million severance charge related to our organizational realignment. Management believes excluding this charge from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2006, as compared to the same periods in 2005 since a charge of such a material amount during the periods is not comparable to similar activity in the prior periods presented. This is consistent with how our

management reviews and assesses Equifax's historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.
In June 2006, we consummated a settlement of claims against certain former selling shareholders of Naviant, Inc. In 2004, we served a demand for arbitration alleging, among other things, that the sellers were liable for rescission or for indemnification as a result of breaches of various representations and warranties concerning information furnished to us in connection with our acquisition of Naviant, Inc. in 2002. As a result of this settlement, we recognized a $14.1 million non-taxable gain in other income, net, on our Consolidated Statement of Income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006.
Litigation Settlement
- 
Management believes excluding this litigation settlement from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, as compared to the same period in 2005 since the gain related to the litigation settlement associated with our previous acquisition of Naviant, Inc. is material and is not reflective of our core operations. This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax's historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.
During the first nine months of 2006, we recorded a $5.0 million, pretax, loss contingency related to certain legal matters. Of this $5.0 million, pretax loss, $4.0 million was recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses and $1.0 million was recognized in cost of services on our Consolidated Statements of Income. This loss is included within our Personal Solutions segment financial results.
Other Litigation Matters
-
During the third quarter of 2006, we also recorded a $4.0 million, pretax, loss associated with certain litigation matters within our North America Information Services segment. Of this $4.0 million, pretax loss, $3.5 million was recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses and $0.5 million was recognized in cost of services on our Consolidated Statements of Income.
Management believes excluding these litigation matters from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, as compared to the same periods in 2005 since the litigation loss contingencies and related reversal of such a material amount during the periods is not comparable to similar activity in the prior periods presented. This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax's historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.
During the third quarter of 2006, the applicable statute of limitations related to uncertain tax positions expired, resulting in the reversal of the related income tax reserve. The reversal of the reserves resulted in a $9.5 million income tax benefit. The income tax benefit was recorded in provision for income taxes on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006.
Income Tax Benefit
-
 
Management believes excluding this income tax benefit from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, as compared to the same period in 2005 since an income tax benefit of such a material amount is not comparable to similar activity in the prior period presented. This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax's historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.
On January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS 123R"), which requires the cost relating to share-based payment transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services from
SFAS 123R

either employees or non-employees be recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements as the goods or services are rendered. The cost is measured at the fair value of the equity instrument issued. Since the date of adoption of SFAS 123R, we are no longer permitted to follow the intrinsic value accounting method under previous accounting guidance, which resulted in no stock-based compensation expense for stock options for which the exercise price was equal to the fair value of the underlying stock on the date of grant.
Management believes excluding the incremental impact of SFAS 123R from pretax, net income and diluted earnings per share provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2006, as compared to the same periods in 2005 since our Consolidated Financial Statements issued prior to January 1, 2006 did not change as a result of adopting SFAS 123R. There was no change to our prior years' Consolidated Financial Statements because we elected the modified prospective transition method. Equifax believes that this financial information is useful to investors since it is consistent with how management assesses Equifax's historical performance and year-over-year growth and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. By excluding the incremental impact of SFAS 123R, our management is able to evaluate and review the financial and operational impact of various business initiatives.
The incremental impact of SFAS 123R during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2006 represents (1) the stock option expense related to stock options unvested at the time of adoption and granted during 2006, (2) the accelerated expense recognition for nonvested shares that were issued during 2006 to employees that are retirement-eligible prior to the expiration of the stated vesting period, and (3) the impact of estimating forfeitures related to nonvested shares. For additional information about SFAS 123R, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2006.
This financial measure is not prepared in conformity with GAAP and is calculated by excluding depreciation and amortization expense from operating income ("EBITDA"). EBITDA is not a measurement of profitability under GAAP since this financial measure excludes depreciation and amortization expense, as well as interest expense, minority interest in earnings (net of tax), other income, net and provision for income taxes from earnings. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, operating margin, or cash provided by operating activities. Equifax's definition of EBITDA may not be comparable with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
EBITDA -
Management believes EBITDA provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our liquidity performance by excluding the items discussed above. Additionally, management believes this financial information is useful to investors in assessing Equifax's historical financial performance and for planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods since it is an important metric used by management for those same activities, as well as evaluating future investing and financing decisions. While management uses EBITDA as a measurement of liquidity, this non-GAAP financial measure does not consider debt-service payments, or cash generated by us that is available for capital expenditures, dividends and discretionary investment.
These non-GAAP financial measures are not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, operating margin or earnings per share and may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
