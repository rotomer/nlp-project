Item 5.02   Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On February 2, 2007, the Compensation, Human Resources and Management Succession Committee ("Committee") of the Board of Directors of Equifax Inc. (the "Company") reviewed and approved the payment of cash awards to named executive officers pursuant to the 2006 Annual Incentive Plan ("AIP"), adopted under the Company's shareholder-approved Key Management Incentive Plan. The Committee also reviewed and approved 2007 financial objectives for corporate performance and the relative weightings of the financial and individual management objectives. These objectives cover the Company's current named executive officers, including Richard F. Smith, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Lee Adrean, Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Kent E. Mast, Corporate Vice President and General Counsel;  Paul J. Springman, Corporate Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, and J. Dann Adams, President - U.S. Consumer Information Solutions.
Under both the 2006 AIP and 2007 AIP, each named executive officer has a bonus target expressed as a percentage of base salary paid during the performance year. Bonus targets are 60% of base salary (100% for Mr. Smith) and are based upon a review of competitive practices for each job level. Actual awards can range from 0% to 200% of target, depending on performance against pre-determined goals.  Goals for named executive officers with corporate-wide responsibilities include earnings per share, revenue and individual management objectives, weighted at 65%, 15% and 20%, respectively, of the targeted incentive. For Mr. Adams, the business unit weightings are 45% business unit profit, 30% business unit profit margin, 15% business unit revenue and 10% individual performance objectives.  Mr. Adams' goals for 2007 will be weighted 30% earnings per share, 30% business unit revenue, 20% business unit profit and 20% individual performance objectives.
For 2006, the Committee approved the following performance-based AIP awards to the named executive officers of the Company: Mr. Smith, $2,371,200; Mr. Adrean (who joined the Company in October 2006), $98,060; Mr. Mast, $385,294; Mr. Springman, $377,369; Mr. Adams, $142,089; and Donald T. Heroman (former Chief Financial Officer), $405,467.  The Committee also approved a special incentive award to Mr. Adams in the amount of $57,911, in recognition of his individual performance in 2006.  Pursuant to the terms of her retirement agreement dated May 10, 2006 with the Company, as previously approved by the Committee, Karen H. Gaston, former Chief Administrator Officer, will receive a prorated 2006 AIP award of $139,807 for Ms. Gaston's service through June 1, 2006.
The Committee approved the following long-term incentive awards effective February 7, 2007, to named executive officers pursuant to the Company's shareholder-approved 2000 Stock Incentive Plan:  Messrs. Smith, Adrean, Mast, Springman and Adams received 110,000, 30,000, 26,000, 26,000, 22,000 nonqualified stock options, respectively.  The options were granted at the closing market price on the New York Stock Exchange on February 7, 2007, have a ten-year term, and vest 33-1/3% on the first anniversary of the

grant date and 33-1/3% on each of the next two grant date anniversaries if the holder remains employed by the Company on those dates, subject to acceleration in the event of a change in control.  The Committee also approved the grant on February 7, 2007, to Messrs. Smith and Adrean of 85,000 and 14,000 restricted stock units, respectively.  The restricted stock units vest three years from the grant date.
The Committee on February 2 also approved the 2007 annual base salaries of the Company's named executive officers after a review of performance and competitive market data.  The annual base salary levels for 2007 of the named executive officers are Mr. Smith, $1,350,000; Mr. Adrean, $435,000; Mr. Mast, $392,000; Mr. Springman, $370,000; and Mr. Adams, $345,000.
