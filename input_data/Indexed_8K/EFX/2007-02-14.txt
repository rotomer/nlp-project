ITEM 1.01  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On February 14, 2007, Equifax Inc. ("Equifax") and TALX Corporation ("TALX") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") which provides that TALX will merge with and into Chipper Corporation ("Merger Sub"), a Missouri corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Equifax (the "Merger").  As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of TALX will cease and Merger Sub will continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger wholly-owned by Equifax.
Concurrently, Equifax entered into a Shareholder Agreement (the "Shareholder Agreement") with William W. Canfield, the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, and President of TALX who owns approximately 6% of TALX's outstanding common stock.  In the Shareholder Agreement, Mr. Canfield has agreed that his TALX shares will be voted in favor of the Merger.
THE MERGER AGREEMENT
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time and as a result of the Merger, each share of TALX common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (other than shares as to which appraisal rights are properly asserted under Missouri law and shares owned by Equifax, TALX, or their respective wholly-owned subsidiaries) will be converted into the right to receive, subject to proration as described below, either (i) 0.861 of a share of Equifax common stock or (ii) $35.50 in cash, as elected by holders of TALX common stock.  This election is subject to the limitation that 75% of the outstanding shares of TALX common stock be exchanged for Equifax common stock and 25% for cash, with proration to be applied in the event of oversubscription. TALX stock options that are outstanding at the time of completion of the Merger, whether vested or unvested, will be converted into vested options to purchase shares of Equifax common stock.
 
TALX and Equifax have made customary representations, warranties, and covenants in the Merger Agreement, including, among other things, covenants: (i) to conduct their business in the ordinary and usual course during the interim period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger, (ii) not to engage in certain types of transactions during such period, (iii) that TALX will convene and hold a meeting of the shareholders of TALX to consider and vote upon the approval of the Merger, and (iii) that, subject to certain exceptions, TALX's board of directors will continue to recommend approval of the Merger to its shareholders.  In addition, TALX made certain additional customary covenants, including, among others, covenants not to: (i) solicit or knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals relating to alternative business combination transactions or (ii) subject to certain exceptions, engage in discussions or negotiations regarding, or provide any non-public information in connection with, alternative business combinations.
The representations and warranties Equifax and TALX made to each other in the Merger Agreement were made as of specific dates and are subject to qualifications and limitations agreed to by the parties in connection with negotiating the terms of the Merger Agreement.  Moreover, these representations and warranties are subject to contractual standards of materiality that may be different from those generally applicable to disclosures to shareholders and in some cases may have been made solely for the purpose of providing contractual rights and remedies to the parties rather than to establish matters as facts.  Accordingly, you should not rely on the representations and warranties as characterizations of the actual state of affairs.
Consummation of the Merger is subject to customary conditions, including: (i) approval of the Merger Agreement by the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of TALX common stock, (ii) absence of certain laws or orders prohibiting the consummation of the Merger, and (iii) expiration or termination of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act waiting period and certain other regulatory approvals.  Each party's obligation to consummate the Merger is subject to certain other conditions, including (i) subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party, (ii) performance in all material respects of the other party of its obligations, and (iii) the delivery of customary opinions from counsel to Equifax and counsel to TALX that the Merger will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for federal income tax purposes.
The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both Equifax and TALX, including the right of TALX to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to enter into an alternative business combination that
2
constitutes a "Superior Proposal" (as defined in the Merger Agreement) if TALX complies with certain notice and other requirements set forth in the Merger Agreement, and further provides that, upon the termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, TALX may be required to pay to Equifax a termination fee of $12 million.
The Merger Agreement also provides that William W. Canfield will be elected to Equifax's Board of Directors upon consummation of the Merger.
The foregoing description of the Merger and the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto, and is incorporated by reference into this report.
THE SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT
In the Shareholder Agreement, Mr. Canfield has granted an irrevocable proxy to Equifax to vote his shares, and has otherwise agreed that his shares shall be voted, in favor of approval of the Merger by the shareholders of TALX and against any proposal involving the acquisition of TALX by a third party or any other proposal, action, or transaction that would reasonably be expected to prevent, impede, or delay the consummation of the Merger.  The Shareholder Agreement, and the proxy included therein, will terminate if the Merger Agreement is terminated.
A copy of the Shareholder Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.  The foregoing description of the Shareholder Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Shareholder Agreement.
Item 8.01. Other Events.
On February 14, 2007, Equifax and TALX announced that they have entered into an agreement that provides for TALX to merge with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Equifax.  A copy of the joint press release is filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto.
In connection with the proposed TALX transaction, the Equifax board of directors approved an increase in the amount of repurchases authorized under Equifax's common stock repurchase program to $783 million from $383 million.  The authorized increase is contingent upon the closing of the TALX transaction.
In connection with the proposed transaction, a registration statement of Equifax will be filed with the SEC.    The final proxy statement/prospectus will be mailed to shareholders of TALX.  Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of the registration statement and proxy statement/prospectus (when available) as well as other filed documents containing information about Equifax and TALX, without charge, at the SEC's web site (http://www.sec.gov).

Equifax and TALX shareholders are encouraged to read the registration statement and any other relevant documents filed with the SEC, including the proxy statement/prospectus that will be part of the registration statement, because they will contain important information about Equifax, TALX, and the proposed transaction.
This communication shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy securities, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of such jurisdiction
.

I agree that I will not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Parent Common Stock issued to me in the Merger unless (i) such sale, transfer or other disposition has been registered under the Act for resale (and that the Parent S-4 will not provide such registration); (ii) I provide evidence of compliance with Rule 145(d)(1), in a letter in the form of hereto, or such sale, transfer or other disposition is otherwise made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145 promulgated by the SEC under the Act; or (iii) in the written opinion of counsel, which opinion

and counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent, such sale, transfer or other disposition is otherwise exempt from registration under the Act.
4.             I understand that Parent is under no obligation to register the sale, transfer or other disposition of the Parent Common Stock by me or on my behalf.
5.             I understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to Parent's transfer agent with respect to Parent Common Stock and that there will be placed on any certificates for the Parent Common Stock issued to me, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance:
"The shares represented by this certificate were issued in a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933 applies.  The shares represented by this certificate may only be sold or otherwise transferred in accordance with the terms of a letter agreement between the registered holder hereof and Equifax Inc., a copy of which agreement is on file at the principal offices of Equifax Inc."
6.             I also understand that, unless the transfer by me of my Parent Common Stock has been registered under the Act or is a sale made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145(d), Parent reserves the right to put the following legend on the certificates issued to my transferee:
"The sale of the shares represented by this certificate has not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and the shares were acquired from a person who received such shares in a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act applies.  The shares have been acquired by the holder not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act and may not be sold, pledged or otherwise transferred except in accordance with an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act."
It is understood and agreed that this letter agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or effect and the legends set forth in paragraphs (5) or (6), as the case may be, above shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without such legend, and the related stop transfer restrictions shall be lifted forthwith, if (i) any such shares of Parent Common Stock shall have been registered under the Act for sale, transfer or other disposition by me or on my behalf and are sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of, or (ii) if I provide evidence that any such shares of Parent Common Stock are sold in accordance with the provisions of Rule 145(d)(1) promulgated under the Act in the form of a letter in the form of hereto, or (iii) if I provide a letter to the effect I am not at the time an affiliate of Parent and have been the beneficial owner of the Parent Common Stock for at least one year (or such other period as may be prescribed by the Act and the Rules and Regulations), or (iv) if I provide a letter that I am not and have not been for at least three months an affiliate of Parent and have been the beneficial owner of the Parent Common Stock for at least two years (or such other period as may be prescribed by the Act and the Rules and Regulations), or (v) Parent shall have received a letter from the staff of the SEC, or a written opinion of counsel, which opinion and counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent, or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to the effect that the stock transfer restrictions and the legend are not required.
Annex I

7.             By its acceptance hereof, Parent agrees, for a period of two years after the Effective Time, that it will file on a timely basis all reports required to be filed by it pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, so that the public information provisions of Rule 144(c) promulgated under the Securities Act are satisfied and the resale provisions of Rule 145(d)(1) and (2) promulgated under the Securities Act are therefore available to me in the event I desire to transfer any Parent Common Stock issued to me in the Merger.
My execution of this letter should not be considered an admission on my part that I am an "affiliate" of the Company as described in the first paragraph of this letter or as a waiver of any rights I may have to object to any claim that I am such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
Equifax Inc. (NYSE: EFX) and TALX Corporation (Nasdaq: TALX) announced today that Equifax will acquire TALX in a stock and cash transaction valued at approximately $1.4 billion, including the assumption of debt.  The acquisition is subject to certain regulatory approvals, approval by TALX shareholders and customary closing conditions. Equifax and TALX will hold a joint conference call for analysts and investors tomorrow at 8 a.m. EST, as described below.
ATLANTA AND ST. LOUIS February 14, 2007 
 service, created by TALX in 1995, is a leader in workplace verification and has over 142 million employment records.
Based in St. Louis, TALX is a leading provider of employment verification and related human resource/payroll services, serving over 9,000 clients in the U.S., including 385 companies in the FORTUNE 500. TALX provides a wide spectrum of products and services including employment and income verification, pay reporting, hiring, and employment tax management services. The Work Number
Over the past three fiscal years, TALX's revenues and net income have grown at a compounded annual growth rate of 29.1 percent and 54.9 percent respectively, as the company has broadened the range of its services. Through its fiscal third quarter ended December 31, 2006, TALX reported revenues of $197 million, up 33 percent from the prior year.
Acquisition of TALX Advances Equifax's Long-Term Growth Strategy
The acquisition of TALX is aligned with Equifax's long-term growth strategy of expanding into new markets and acquiring proprietary data sources.  Equifax and TALX each leverage data and technologies that are designed to help customers make critical decisions with greater confidence. With this transaction, Equifax is positioned to deliver complementary solutions to a broader customer base that will continue to rely on Equifax and TALX as the trusted stewards of consumer and business information. The purchase also adds a management team with proven business performance.  Upon the closing of the transaction, William W. Canfield,  TALX's chairman and chief executive officer, will join Equifax's senior management team as president of the  TALX business unit and be appointed to Equifax's Board of Directors.
"By acquiring TALX, Equifax has expanded into a high-growth market that depends on unique information solutions. Many of TALX's customers are Equifax customers today. This fits squarely with our strategy to find opportunities that complement our strong franchise with recurring, transaction-based revenues. Both companies serve as critical enablers for the U.S. economy," said Richard F. Smith, Chairman and CEO of Equifax.
 "This is a very exciting day for TALX and its associates. Equifax's strategy fits with our own company's goals. We plan to continue to help customers reduce costs and stay compliant through trusted intelligence for their human resource and payroll processes, which are the cornerstone to our success," Canfield said.
Terms and Conditions
Under the terms of the agreement, approved by the boards of directors of both companies, the acquisition consideration for TALX's stock is structured as 75 percent Equifax stock and 25 percent cash. TALX shareholders may elect to receive for each TALX share either 0.861 shares of Equifax stock, $35.50 in cash, or a combination of stock and cash of equivalent value, subject to pro-ration so that the total consideration issued for TALX stock consists of 75 percent Equifax stock and 25 percent cash. The acquisition is structured so that the stock portion of the purchase price will be tax-free to selling shareholders. In the aggregate, Equifax will issue approximately 22 million shares of Equifax stock and pay approximately $300 million in cash.  Equifax will assume TALX outstanding debt, which was $191.5 million as of December 31, 2006.
2
The proposed transaction is expected to be completed late in the second or early third quarter of 2007.
Expanded Share Repurchase Program
Equifax's Board of Directors has authorized $400 million in additional share repurchases.  Added to the current authorization of $383 million, the total repurchase authorization will be $783 million. The company intends to repurchase $700 million in stock following the completion of the acquisition in open market transactions or in privately-negotiated purchases. The timing and nature of any such repurchases will depend on market conditions, other investment opportunities, applicable securities laws and other factors.
