The information set forth under Item 2.03 below is incorporated by reference.
Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
Item 2.01
          
On May 15, 2007, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"). dated as of February 14, 2007, by and among Equifax Inc. ("Equifax"), TALX Corporation ("TALX") and Chipper Corporation, a wholly owned direct subsidiary of Equifax ("Merger Sub"), TALX merged with and into Merger Sub (the "Merger").  As a result of the Merger, TALX is now a  wholly owned direct subsidiary of Equifax.
Pursuant to the Merger, each share of common stock of TALX, par value $0.01 per share, was converted into the right to receive 0.861 of a share of Equifax common stock, par value $1.25 per share, or $35.50 in cash, without interest.  The issuance of Equifax's common stock pursuant to the Merger was registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Equifax's registration statement on Form S-4 (File No. 333-141389), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and declared effective on April 9, 2007.  The definitive proxy statement/prospectus of TALX and Equifax, dated April 9, 2007, that forms a part of the registration statement contains additional information about the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to, the nature of Equifax's and TALX's business, the principles used in determining the Merger consideration, the nature of any interests of Equifax's and TALX's directors and officers in the Merger, and Equifax's intended use of the assets acquired in the Merger.  The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement (including the description of the consideration paid in connection with the Merger) is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which was filed as Exhibit 2.1 to Equifax's Current Report on Form 8-K dated February 14, 2007 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Based on the closing price of Equifax common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on May 15, 2007 of $41.32 per share, the total Merger consideration was approximately $1.3 billion including assumed indebtedness of approximately $172 million.
Approximately $283 million was required to fund and consummate the Merger.  In addition, on May 16, 2007, Equifax plans to repay the approximately $97 million in borrowings outstanding under TALX's revolving credit facility.  Equifax has funded or will finance these transactions with borrowings under its existing credit facility with SunTrust Bank and other lenders as described below under Item 2.03.
The additional approximately 20.6 million shares of Equifax's common stock issuable in connection with the closing of the Merger were issued by Equifax from treasury shares.  Application has been made to the New York Stock Exchange for listing the additional 2,023,852 shares which Equifax has reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding TALX stock options and 2,000,000 Equifax shares reserved for future issuance under TALX equity plans.
On May 15, 2007, Equifax issued a press release announcing the completion of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the cessation of trading in TALX common stock as of the end of trading hours on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on May 15, 2007.  A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
Item 2.03
          
On May 14, 2007, in connection with the transactions described above under Item 2.01, Equifax executed an amendment to its Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated July 24, 2006 with the Lenders named therein and SunTrust Bank, as Administrative Agent, pursuant to which the lenders under the agreement agreed to increase the borrowing limit under such facility from $500 million to $850 million.  As of May 15, 2007, the current outstanding principal amount of indebtedness under such facility is approximately $400 million (of which $283 million has been borrowed to pay the TALX merger consideration and $97 million borrowed in anticipation of repaying the TALX revolving credit facility as discussed in Item 2.01).
Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
Item 5.02
          
As of the effective time of the Merger described above under Item 2.01, the authorized number of directors constituting Equifax's Board of Directors was increased from eleven to twelve and, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Board elected William W. Canfield to the Equifax Board as a Class II Director for a term expiring at the 2008 annual meeting of shareholders or until his successor has been duly elected and qualified.  Mr. Canfield, former Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of TALX Corporation, was also appointed president of the TALX business unit of Equifax, reporting to Equifax Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard F. Smith.  Mr. Canfield was also a shareholder of TALX, and will receive the merger consideration specified in the Merger Agreement.

Equifax Inc. (NYSE: EFX) today announced the completion of the acquisition of TALX Corporation (NASDAQ: TALX) following approval of the transaction by TALX shareholders and satisfaction of all other closing conditions of the merger agreement.
ATLANTA, May 15, 2007 
 service, created by TALX in 1995, is a leader in workplace verification and has over 147 million employment records.
TALX is a leading provider of employment verification and related human resource/payroll services, serving over 9,000 clients in the U.S., including more than 75 percent of companies in the FORTUNE 500. TALX provides a wide spectrum of products and services including employment and income verification, pay reporting, hiring, and employment tax management services. The Work Number
The acquisition of TALX is aligned with Equifax's long-term growth strategy of expanding into new markets with unique data and analytics.  Equifax and TALX each leverage data and technologies that are designed to help customers make critical decisions with greater confidence. The acquisition also adds an experienced management team with proven business performance.
"We are very pleased to welcome TALX and 1,900 associates to Equifax. TALX products and services will enable Equifax to broaden its suite of solutions for customers and expand its position as an industry leader in data, analytics and technology. With Equifax, TALX customers will benefit from the resources of a 108-year-old global company that is a trusted steward of critical information," said Richard F. Smith, chairman and CEO, Equifax.
  
"On behalf of TALX, its shareholders and our associates, I am extremely proud that our company is now part of Equifax. The combination of our two companies is a natural fit, as Equifax and TALX have similar business models focused on helping customers become more efficient by leveraging information and technology. I know that our customers will reap the benefits of having our two great companies serving their needs for many years to come," said William W. Canfield, president, TALX.
Under the terms of the merger agreement, each share of TALX common stock is converted into the right to receive either $35.50 in cash, without interest, or 0.861 of a share of Equifax common stock for each share of TALX common stock that the shareholder owned immediately before completion of the merger.  If TALX shareholders elect to receive more stock or cash than is provided for under the merger agreement, elections for the oversubscribed form of merger consideration will be prorated so that 75 percent of the shares of TALX common stock outstanding immediately before completion of the merger will be converted into shares of Equifax common stock and the remaining 25 percent will be converted into the right to receive cash. Under the terms of the stock and cash transaction, Equifax expects to issue approximately 20.6 million shares of its common stock and pay cash in the approximate amount of $283 million in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding shares of TALX common stock.  The final results of the cash and stock elections, including the consideration to be received by TALX shareholders who validly elected cash and those who validly elected stock, are expected to be announced by Equifax as soon as practicable after final reconciliation by the exchange agent for the transaction, Computershare Shareholder Services, Inc.
Trading in TALX's common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market ceased at the end of trading hours on Tuesday, May 15, 2007.
TALX becomes one of Equifax's five business units, along with U.S. Consumer Information Solutions, North American Commercial Information Solutions, International and Personal Solutions. Mr. Canfield has joined Equifax as president of the TALX business unit and has been elected to Equifax's board of directors. Starting today, Equifax will begin integrating the two companies' operations to ensure a smooth transition and the creation of long-term value for customers, employees and shareholders.
