Based on the calculations of the exchange agent for the transaction, Computershare Shareholders Services, Inc., of the 31,948,179 shares of TALX stock outstanding as of the effective time of the merger:
14,159,439 of the shares, or 44.32 percent, elected to receive Equifax stock;
                 
13,165,194 of the shares, or 41.21 percent, elected to receive cash; and
                 
4,623,546 of the shares, or 14.47 percent, did not make a valid and timely election.
                 
According to these calculations, the merger consideration to be paid to TALX shareholders will be allocated as follows:
:  TALX shareholders who made a stock election for all or a portion of their shares of TALX common stock will receive 0.861 of a share of Equifax common stock for each of their stock election shares.
Stock Elections
  Because the cash merger consideration was oversubscribed, TALX shareholders who made a cash election for all or a portion of their shares of TALX common stock will receive the cash consideration of $35.50 per share for approximately 60.67 percent of their cash election shares and will receive 0.861 of a share of Equifax common stock per share for approximately 39.33 percent of their cash election shares.
Cash Elections:
  TALX shareholders who did not make a valid election will receive 0.861 of a share of Equifax common stock for each of their shares of TALX common stock.
Non-Elections:
No fractional shares of Equifax common stock will be issued.  In lieu thereof, TALX shareholders will receive cash.
