NEWS RELEASE
 
Equifax Inc. (NYSE: EFX) today reported second quarter results. Revenue increased to $454.5 million, up 17 percent compared to the second quarter of 2006. Diluted earnings per share ("EPS") was 51 cents, a 4 percent decrease from the second quarter of 2006.   On a non-GAAP basis, diluted EPS adjusted for acquisition-related amortization expense and excluding the favorable net impact of several 2006 litigation-related matters, increased 8 percent to 57 cents from the second quarter of 2006.  Our second quarter operating results include TALX Corporation subsequent to the date of acquisition on May 15, 2007.
ATLANTA, July 23, 2007 
"In the second quarter we completed, ahead of schedule, the acquisition of TALX, a leading provider of employment and income verification and human resources outsourcing services," said Richard F. Smith, Equifax Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  "At the same time, we kept our focus on customers of the traditional Equifax businesses and, excluding the impact of TALX, delivered 8 percent revenue growth, including double-digit growth in our International, North America Personal Solutions and North America Commercial Solutions businesses."
Second Quarter 2007 Highlights
Solid double-digit revenue growth in our International, North America Personal Solutions and North America Commercial Solutions operating segments and the acquisition of TALX contributed to a 17 percent increase in revenue in the second quarter of 2007, when compared to the same period in 2006.
                 
Operating margin was 26.4 percent compared to 24.9 percent in the second quarter of 2006.
                 
Operating income grew to $119.8 million, up 24 percent from the second quarter of 2006.  On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of the second quarter 2006 litigation matters mentioned above, operating income grew 8 percent.
                 
Net income rose to $70.1 million, a one percent increase from the second quarter of 2006, which included the favorable net impact of the 2006 litigation-related matters.  On a non-GAAP
                 
1
basis excluding the impact of these litigation matters, net income increased 9 percent.
Total debt increased to $1.2 billion in the second quarter of 2007, from $503.9 million at December 31, 2006.  The increase resulted primarily from our issuance of an aggregate of $550 million of ten- and thirty-year fixed rate senior notes in late June, assumption of $75 million in senior guaranteed notes of TALX and commencement of a commercial paper program on May 22, 2007 to refinance certain other outstanding debt.
                 
We repurchased 4.2 million of our common shares for $179.3 million in the quarter, as part of our previously announced share repurchase programs.
                 
U.S. Consumer Information Solutions
Total revenue was $250.0 million in the second quarter of 2007, a 2 percent increase from the second quarter of 2006.  Solid demand for our online consumer information solutions product lines was partially offset by weakness in the mortgage and marketing services markets.  Operating margin for U.S. Consumer Information Solutions was 40.4 percent in the second quarter of 2007 versus 41.5 percent in the second quarter of 2006.
                 
Online Consumer Information Solutions revenue was $165.4 million, up 5 percent compared to the second quarter of 2006.
                 
Mortgage Reporting Solutions revenue was $19.0 million, down 1 percent compared to the second quarter of 2006.
                 
Credit Marketing Services revenue was $39.6 million, down 3 percent compared to the second quarter of 2006.
                 
Direct Marketing Services revenue was $26.0 million, down 9 percent compared to the second quarter of 2006.
International
Total revenue was $115.3 million in the second quarter of 2007, a 15 percent increase from the second quarter of 2006. In local currency, revenue was up 9 percent when compared to the same period in the prior year. Operating margin for International was 29.0 percent in the second quarter of 2007, down from 29.7 percent in the second quarter of 2006.
                 
Europe revenue was $45.2 million, up 20 percent compared to the second quarter of 2006. In local currency, revenue was up 11 percent when compared to the same period in the prior year.
                 
Latin America revenue was $44.1 million, up 14 percent compared to the second quarter of 2006. In local currency, revenue was up 9 percent when compared to the same period in the prior year.
                 
Canada Consumer revenue was $26.0 million, up 8 percent compared to the second quarter of 2006. In local currency, revenue was up 6 percent when compared to the same period in the prior year.
North America Personal Solutions
Total revenue rose to $38.6 million, a 24 percent increase from the second quarter of 2006. Operating margin was 19.0 percent versus a negative margin in the second quarter of 2006.  Operating margin for the second quarter of 2006 included the impact of a $14 million loss contingency related to certain litigation matters.  On a non-GAAP basis,
2
excluding the impact of the loss contingency, operating margin was 9 percent in the second quarter of 2006.
North America Commercial Solutions
Total revenue rose to $15.3 million, a 41 percent increase from the second quarter of 2006. Operating margin was 6.4 percent, down from 13.5 percent in the second quarter of 2006.
TALX
Total revenue was $35.3 million, and operating margin was 12.8 percent, for the period from the acquisition on May 15, 2007 through June 30, 2007, meeting our expectations.  For the full calendar quarter, transaction volume for The Work Number business unit was 3.5 million, up 15 percent from the second quarter of 2006.  In addition, almost 5.3 million total records were added, bringing total records in the database to 152.3 million.

The Common Questions and Answers (Unaudited) ("Q&A") that are a part of this press release include supplemental financial information which Equifax believes is useful to assess its operating performance. The following financial measures included herein or in the Q&A are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"): Operating income and net income excluding the 2006 litigation matters; consolidated operating margin excluding TALX operating results in 2007 and litigation-related matters in 2006; EBITDA, defined as operating income adding back depreciation and amortization expense and excluding the 2006 litigation matters; and diluted EPS, as adjusted for acquisition-related amortization expense and excluding the 2006 litigation matters.  Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and related notes are presented in the Q&A. This information can also be found under "About Equifax/Investor Center/Non-GAAP/GAAP Financial Measures" on our web site at www.equifax.com.

What drove the fluctuation in the effective tax rate?
Our effective income tax rate was 35.8% for the three months ended June 30, 2007, up from 31.8% for the same period in 2006 due primarily to a $14 million non-taxable litigation settlement recorded during the second quarter of 2006. Additionally, the June 30, 2007 rate reflects a lower foreign and state tax rate compared to the June 30, 2006 rate and a favorable discrete item related to our foreign tax credit utilization.  The effective income tax rate was 36.1% for the six months ended June 30, 2007, up from 34.7% for the same period  in 2006, due to the same factors discussed above.

The weighted average cost of debt was 6.2% at June 30, 2007, an increase from 5.7% at June 30, 2006, due primarily to the issuance of longer term fixed-rate debt and repayment of short-term debt.

Notes to Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to the Comparable GAAP Financial Measures
Reconciliation of operating income and net income for the purposes of comparability highlighting the impact of the following:
Duringthe second quarter of 2006, we recorded a $14.0 million, pretax, and $8.6 million, net of tax, loss contingency related to certain legal matters. Of this $14.0 million, pretax loss, $11.5 million was recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses and $2.5 million was recognized in cost of services on our Consolidated Statements of Income during the three and six months ended June 30, 2006. This loss was included within our North America Personal Solutions segment financial results.
Litigation Loss Contingency 
In June 2006, we consummated a settlement of claims against certain former selling shareholders of Naviant, Inc.  In 2004, we served a demand for arbitration alleging, among other things, that the sellers were liable for rescission or for indemnification as a result of breaches of various representations and warranties concerning information furnished to us in connection with our acquisition of Naviant, Inc. in 2002.  As a result of this settlement, we recognized a $14.1 million non-taxable gain in other income, net on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006.
Litigation Settlement
Management believes excluding the foregoing litigation matters (the "2006 litigation matters") from our financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007, as compared to the same periods in 2006 since (1) the gain related to the litigation settlement associated with our previous acquisition of Naviant Inc. is material and is not reflective of our core operations and (2) the litigation loss contingency of such a material amount is not comparable to similar activity in the prior periods presented. This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax's historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.
Management believes excluding the results of TALX from the calculation of operating margin is meaningful supplemental information for purposes of comparing the results of Equifax's operating units on a basis consistent with that prior to the completion of the TALX acquisition.  This presentation provides investors additional information to assess our trends in operating performance during 2007 until our consolidated results reflect our TALX business on a comparable basis.
Presentation of consolidated operating margin excluding TALX operating results in 2007 and litigation - related matters in 2006 
We calculate this financial measure by excluding acquisition-related amortization expense and the 2006 litigation matters, net of tax, from the determination of net income in the calculation of diluted EPS. This financial measure is not prepared in conformity with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to diluted EPS, net income, operating income, operating margin, or cash provided by operating activities.
Diluted EPS, adjusted for acquisition-related amortization expense and the 2006 litigation matters 
Management believes that this measure is useful because management excludes acquisition-related amortization expense when measuring operating profitability, evaluating performance trends, and setting performance objectives, and it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis by excluding items that relate to acquired amortizable intangible assets and not to the core operations of our businesses.
14
We calculate EBITDA by adding back depreciation and amortization expense and the 2006 litigation loss contingency to operating income. This financial measure is not prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") since it excludes depreciation and amortization expense, as well as interest expense, minority interest in earnings (net of tax), other income, net, provision for income taxes from earnings and the 2006 litigation loss contingency. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, operating margin, or cash provided by operating activities. Our definition of EBITDA may not be comparable with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
EBITDA 
Management believes that EBITDA is a useful supplemental measure to investors because it is consistent with how management evaluates our financial performance and is frequently used by securities analysts and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. Additionally, management uses this measure as an important metric for forecasting and analyzing future periods, as well as evaluating future investing and financing decisions.
