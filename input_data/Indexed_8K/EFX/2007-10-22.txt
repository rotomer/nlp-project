Equifax Inc. (NYSE: EFX) today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2007. Revenue increased 25 percent to $492.5 million compared to the prior year period. The core Equifax businesses grew 7 percent while 18 percent is attributable to the aquisition of TALX in May 2007. Operating income grew 7 percent to $129.2 million, and was up 12 percent excluding the net favorable impact of certain litigation matters in the prior year period.
ATLANTA, October 22, 2007 
 
Third quarter diluted earnings per share ("EPS") was 48 cents compared to 61 cents in the prior year period. Prior year EPS was favorably impacted by 10 cents related to litigation matters and the reversal of certain income tax reserves. EPS adjusted to exclude the impact of acquisition related amortization expense and the aforementioned litigation and tax matters increased 5 percent to 58 cents from the prior year period. Adjusted EPS and operating income excluding 2006 favorable litigation-related items are non-GAAP financial measures, which are defined and reconciled to the most closely related GAAP financial measure in the information accompanying this release.
 
"The diversity and strength of our business units enabled Equifax to deliver strong financial performance for the quarter. Our results were bolstered by double-digit growth from our North America Commercial Solutions, North America Personal Solutions and International businesses," said Richard F. Smith, Equifax Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "At a time when many of our customers are weathering a tough economic climate, our business model and diversified revenue stream allow us to consistently drive top line growth and profitability."
 
Third Quarter 2007 Highlights
 
Double-digit revenue growth in our North America Commercial Solutions, North America Personal Solutions and International operating segments and a full quarter's results from TALX contributed to a 25 percent increase in revenue in the third quarter of 2007, when compared to the same period in 2006.
 - 
                 
Operating margin was 26.2 percent compared to 30.6 percent in the third quarter of 2006. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of our TALX acquisition in 2007 and the 2006 litigation-related matters mentioned above, operating margin was 28.2 percent in 2007 compared to 29.3 percent in the third quarter of 2006. The third quarter 2007 operating margin reflects increased costs of litigation and greater investments in marketing and technology when compared to the same period in 2006.
 - 
                 
 
Net income was $67.9 million, a 14 percent decrease from the third quarter of 2006, which included the favorable net impact of the 2006 litigation-related matters mentioned above and a $9.5 million benefit from the resolution of a tax matter. On a non-GAAP basis excluding the impact of these litigation matters and tax benefit, net income increased 2 percent. Year over year net income growth was negatively impacted by increased intangible amortization expense related to the acquisition of TALX and interest expense on additional debt incurred to finance this acquisition and our subsequent repurchase of common stock.
 - 
                 
 
As planned, total debt increased to $1.4 billion in the third quarter of 2007 compared to $1.2 billion at June 30, 2007, with the increase resulting primarily from our share repurchase program.
 - 
                 
 
We repurchased 11.1 million of our common shares for $441.6 million in the third quarter, as part of our previously announced share repurchase programs. From the date of the TALX acquisition through September 30, 2007, we have repurchased $620.9 million of our previously announced goal of repurchasing $700.0 million of our shares by the end of 2007.

U.S. Consumer Information Solutions ("USCIS")
 
Total revenue was $243.9 million in the third quarter of 2007, a 1 percent decrease from the third quarter of 2006. Although customers in the U.S. consumer credit markets faced a difficult environment, transaction volume for Online Consumer Information Services remained strong, having grown five percent when compared to the same period in 2006. Operating margin for USCIS was 39.8 percent in the third quarter of 2007, up from 39.1 percent in the third quarter of 2006. Operating margin for the third quarter of 2006 included the impact of a $4.0 million litigation loss contingency. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of this loss contingency, third quarter 2006 operating margin was 40.7 percent. Compared to the third quarter of 2006:
 
 -

 - 
                 
Latin America revenue was $47.1 million, up 16 percent in U.S. dollars (9 percent in local currency); and

Operating margin for the third quarter of 2006 included the favorable impact of a $9.0 million reversal of a loss contingency related to certain litigation matters. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of this loss contingency, operating margin was 20.4 percent in the third quarter of 2006.
 
North America Commercial Solutions
 
Total revenue rose to $16.7 million, a 45 percent increase from the third quarter of 2006. Operating margin was 19.5 percent, down from 21.3 percent in the third quarter of 2006, but up from 7.9 percent in the first half of 2007.
 
TALX
 
Total revenue was $70.4 million and operating margin was 14.2 percent for the third quarter of 2007. Transaction volume for The Work Number business unit was 3.6 million, up 22 percent from the third quarter of 2006. In addition, approximately 6.6 million total records were added to the employment database, bringing total records in the database to 158.9 million.
 
Outlook for 2007 Results
 
Due to market uncertainties related to the current state of the economy, Equifax has updated its full year guidance for 2007. The revised guidance is based on our year-to-date performance, current market trends and management's expectations. Equifax expects consolidated annual revenue growth to be approximately 19 percent and diluted EPS, as adjusted for acquisition-related amortization expense, to be between $2.28 and $2.32 versus prior guidance issued in June 2007 of $2.25 to $2.33.

3.
           
What drove the fluctuation in the effective tax rate?
Our effective income tax rate was 37.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2007, up from 29.7% for the same period in 2006, due primarily to the reversal of $9.5 million of income tax reserves related to uncertain tax positions for which the applicable statute of limitations expired during the third quarter of 2006. The effective income tax rate was 36.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2007, up from 32.9% for the same period in 2006 due to the $14.1 million non-taxable litigation settlement recorded during the second quarter of 2006 and the reversal of income tax reserves in 2006 discussed above. On a non-GAAP basis, the three- and nine-month effective tax rates in 2006 excluding the impact of the reversal of the uncertain tax position noted above and the $14.1 million non-taxable litigation settlement were 38.1% and 37.7%, respectively. Additionally, the September 30, 2007 rate reflects a lower foreign and state tax rate compared to 2006 and a favorable second quarter 2007 discrete item related to our foreign tax credit utilization.

We repurchased 11.1 million shares of our common stock on the open market for $441.6 million during the third quarter of 2007. At September 30, 2007, $161.7 million remained authorized for future share repurchases.
 
7.
          
What was the weighted average cost of debt?
The weighted average cost of debt was 6.1% at September 30, 2007, an increase from 5.7% at September 30, 2006, due primarily to the issuance of longer term fixed rate debt in the second quarter of 2007.

Notes to Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to the Comparable GAAP Financial Measures
 
Reconciliation of operating income and net income for the purposes of comparability highlighting the impact of the following:
 
Litigation Loss Contingencies 
Duringthe second quarter of 2006, we recorded a $14.0 million, pretax, and $8.6 million, net of tax, loss contingency related to certain legal matters. Of this $14.0 million, pretax loss, $11.5 million was recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses and $2.5 million was recognized in cost of services on our Consolidated Statements of Income. During the third quarter of 2006, there were favorable court rulings which reduced our exposure related to these litigation matters resulting in the reversal of a portion of the loss contingency. We reversed $9.0 million, pretax, of the loss contingency during the third quarter of 2006, of which $7.5 million was reversed to selling, general and administrative expenses and $1.5 million was reversed to cost of services in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The $14.0 million loss during the second quarter of 2006 and $9.0 million subsequent reversal of a portion of the loss in the third quarter of 2006 are included within our North America Personal Solutions segment financial results. The loss contingency accrual totaled $5.0 million as of September 30, 2006.
 
During the third quarter of 2006, we also recorded a $4.0 million, pretax, and $2.5 million, net of tax, loss associated with certain litigation matters within our U.S. Consumer Information Solutions segment. Of this $4.0 million, pretax loss, $3.5 million was recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses and $0.5 million was recognized in cost of services on our 2006 Consolidated Statements of Income.
 
Litigation Settlement
 In June 2006, we consummated a settlement of claims against certain former selling shareholders of Naviant, Inc. In 2004, we served a demand for arbitration alleging, among other things, that the sellers were liable for rescission or for indemnification as a result of breaches of various representations and warranties concerning information furnished to us in connection with our acquisition of Naviant, Inc. in 2002. As a result of this settlement, we recognized a $14.1 million non-taxable gain in other income, net on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the nine months ended September 30, 2006.
 
Management believes excluding the foregoing litigation matters (the "2006 litigation matters") from our financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006, as compared to the same periods in 2007 since (1) the gain related to the litigation settlement associated with our previous acquisition of Naviant Inc. is material and is not reflective of our core operations and (2) the litigation loss contingencies and related reversals of such a material amount during the periods is not comparable to similar activity in the subsequent periods presented. This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax's historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.
 
Income Tax Benefit 
During the third quarter of 2006, the applicable statute of limitations related to uncertain tax positions expired resulting in the reversal of the related income tax reserve. The reversal of the reserves resulted in a $9.5 million income tax benefit. The income tax benefit was recorded in provision for income taxes on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006.
 
Management believes excluding this income tax benefit from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006, as compared to the same periods in 2007 since an
income tax benefit of such a material amount is not comparable to similar activity in the prior periods presented. This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax's historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.
 
Management believes excluding the results of TALX from the calculation of operating margin is meaningful supplemental information for purposes of comparing the results of Equifax's operating units on a basis consistent with that prior to the completion of the TALX acquisition. This presentation provides investors additional information to assess our trends in operating performance during 2007 until our consolidated results reflect our TALX business on a comparable basis.
Presentation of consolidated operating margin excluding TALX operating results in 2007 and litigation loss contingencies, net in 2006 
 
We calculate this financial measure by excluding acquisition-related amortization expense and the 2006 litigation matters, net of tax, from the determination of net income in the calculation of diluted EPS. This financial measure is not prepared in conformity with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to diluted EPS, net income, operating income, operating margin, or cash provided by operating activities.
Diluted EPS, adjusted for acquisition-related amortization expense, 2006 litigation matters and income tax benefit 
 
Management believes that this measure is useful because management excludes acquisition-related amortization expense when measuring operating profitability, evaluating performance trends, and setting performance objectives, and it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis by excluding items that relate to acquired amortizable intangible assets and not to the core operations of our businesses.
 
We calculate EBITDA by adding back depreciation and amortization expense and the net impact of the 2006 litigation loss contingencies described above to operating income. This financial measure is not prepared in conformity with GAAP since it excludes depreciation and amortization expense, as well as interest expense, minority interest in earnings (net of tax), other income, net, provision for income taxes from earnings and the 2006 litigation loss contingencies. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, operating margin, or cash provided by operating activities. Our definition of EBITDA may not be comparable with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
EBITDA 
 
Management believes that EBITDA is a useful supplemental measure to investors because it is consistent with how management evaluates our financial performance and is frequently used by securities analysts and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. Additionally, management uses this measure as an important metric for forecasting and analyzing future periods, as well as evaluating future investing and financing decisions.
 
Effective Tax Rate, Excluding Certain Items 
This
financial measure is not prepared in conformity with GAAP and excludes certain items, including (1) the reversal of a $9.5 million income tax reserve related to uncertain tax positions primarily due to the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations during the third quarter of 2006 and (2) the impact of the non-taxable $14.1 million gain recorded during the second quarter of 2006 related to the settlement of claims against the former selling shareholders of Naviant, Inc., an acquisition in 2002.  The effective tax rate, excluding certain items, is not a measurement of profitability under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, provision for income taxes or earnings per share.
and analyzing future periods.
Management believes our effective tax rate, excluding certain items provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding the items discussed above in order to show a comparable effective tax rate since the items during the periods are material amounts and not comparable to similar activity in the prior periods presented. Equifax believes that this financial information is useful to our management and investors in assessing Equifax's historical performance and liquidity and when planning, forecasting
