NEWS RELEASE
 
 
 
ATLANTA, February 4, 2008 
Equifax Inc. (NYSE: EFX) today reported financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2007.  Based on unaudited results, r
evenue increased 26 percent in the fourth quarter to $490.9 million from the fourth quarter 2006. 
Operating income grew 9 percent to $120.2 million. 
Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share ("EPS") was 49 cents compared to 50 cents in the prior year period.  On a non-GAAP basis, EPS, adjusted to exclude the impact of acquisition-related amortization expense and the 2006 organizational realignment charge, increased 4 percent to 59 cents for the fourth quarter 2007.
 
For the full year 2007, revenue increased 19 percent to $1.84 billion compared to 2006.  Operating income grew 11 percent to $486.2 million.  Diluted EPS was $2.02 compared to $2.12 for the full year 2006.  EPS for the full year 2007, adjusted to exclude the impact of acquisition-related amortization expense and certain 2006 matters, increased 7 percent to $2.32 from the prior year period.  Adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure, which is defined and reconciled to the most closely related GAAP financial measure in the information accompanying this release.
 
"In 2007, we made significant progress executing on our growth strategy.  We acquired TALX, the largest acquisition in the company's history, which significantly diversifies revenues and broadens our product portfolio.  In addition, we continued market penetration of analytics and enabling technologies in U.S. Consumer Information Solutions and experienced strong incremental growth and margin improvement in our International businesses," said Richard F. Smith, Equifax Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  "North America Personal Solutions exceeded performance expectations and North America Commercial Solutions finished the year with strong growth and a much sharper strategic focus."
 
Fourth Quarter 2007 Highlights
 
                 
Double-digit revenue growth in our North America Personal Solutions, North America Commercial Solutions and International operating segments and results from TALX contributed to a 26 percent increase in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2007, when
 
compared to the same period in 2006.  Equifax, excluding TALX, delivered 7 percent revenue growth while TALX contributed 19 points to fourth quarter growth.
 
                 
Operating margin was 24.5 percent compared to 28.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006.   On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin adjusted to exclude the impact of acquisition-related amortization expense and the 2006 charge related to organizational realignment was 28.9 percent in 2007 compared to 31.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006.  Adjusted operating margin is a non-GAAP financial measure
which is defined and reconciled to the most closely related GAAP financial measure in the information accompanying this release.
 
                 
The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2007 was 33.1 percent, as compared to
37.3
percent for the same period in 2006 and 36.6 percent for the first nine months of 2007.
 
U.S. Consumer Information Solutions ("USCIS")
Total revenue was $228.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, a 3 percent decrease from the fourth quarter of 2006.  Credit Marketing and Mortgage Reporting were affected by weakness in the U.S. credit and mortgage markets and were the primary contributors to this revenue decline.  Compared to the fourth quarter of 2006:
 
                 
Online Consumer Information Solutions revenue was $150.6 million, up 2 percent;
                 
Mortgage Reporting Solutions revenue was $12.7 million, down 15 percent;
                 
Credit Marketing Services revenue was $37.1 million, down 16 percent; and
                 
Direct Marketing Services revenue was $28.3 million, down 3 percent.
 
Operating margin for USCIS was 36.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007, down from 41.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006.  Based on current revenue run rates and specific actions already taken or currently identified, USCIS operating margins are expected to increase steadily throughout 2008 from the fourth quarter level starting in the first quarter.
 
International
Total revenue was $128.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, a 23 percent increase from the fourth quarter of 2006. In local currency, revenue was up 11 percent when compared to the same period in the prior year.  Compared to the fourth quarter of 2006:
 
                 
Europe revenue was $48.8 million, up 18 percent in U.S. dollars (10 percent in local currency);
                 
Latin America revenue was $51.6 million, up 30 percent in U.S. dollars (18 percent in local currency); and
                 
Canada Consumer revenue was $28.5 million, up 20 percent in U.S. dollars (3 percent in local currency).
 
Operating margin for International was 28.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007 versus 28.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006.
 
TALX
Total revenue was $73.8 million and operating margin was 20.0 percent for the fourth quarter of 2007.  Fourth quarter revenue in 2007 was 14 percent greater than the amount of revenue reported by TALX during the same period in 2006.
In addition, approximately 7.0 million total records were added to the employment database, bringing total records in the database to 165.9 million, up 16 percent from a year ago.
 
North America Personal Solutions
Total revenue rose to $38.3 million, a 21 percent increase from the fourth quarter of 2006, driven by solid execution of the segment's strategic transformation from transaction-based products to subscription-based products. Operating margin was 26.1 percent versus 26.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006.
 
North America Commercial Solutions
Total revenue rose to $21.2 million, a 26 percent increase from the fourth quarter of 2006. Operating margin was 30.2 percent, up from 28.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006.
 
Full Year 2007 Highlights
 
                 
Broad-based revenue growth in our North America Commercial Solutions, North America Personal Solutions and International operating segments and the results of our TALX business segment, subsequent to its acquisition on May 15, 2007, contributed to a 19 percent increase in revenue during 2007, when compared to the same period in 2006.  TALX represented 12 percent of the full year revenue growth.
 
                 
Operating margin decreased to 26.4 percent for the full year 2007 from 28.2 percent for the full year 2006.   On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin adjusted to exclude the impact of acquisition-related amortization expense and the 2006 litigation-related matters and organizational realignment charge was 30.0 percent in 2007 compared to 31.2 percent in 2006.
 
                 
EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization expense and the 2006 litigation-related matters and organizational realignment charge to operating income, was $613.9 million for the full year 2007 compared to $534.3 million a 15 percent increase over 2006.
 
                 
The effective tax rate for the full year 2007 was 35.8 percent, as compared to
34.0
percent for the same period in 2006. The 2007 rate reflects a lower foreign and state tax rate compared to 2006 and other discrete items.  The 2006 rate included the reversal of certain income tax reserves during the third quarter and a non-taxable gain related to a litigation settlement during the second quarter.
 
                 
Interest expense increased by $26.6 million to $58.5 million, and weighted-average diluted shares increased 4 percent to 135.1 million, as a result of the combined effect of the acquisition of TALX and the subsequent issuance of debt to repurchase a portion of the shares issued in the acquisition.
 
                 
We repurchased 17.9 million shares of our common stock on the open market for $718.7 million dur
ing the full year 2007.
U.S. Consumer Information Solutions ("USCIS")
Total revenue was $969.7 million in 2007, a slight increase over 2006.  Compared to the full year of 2006:
 
                 
Online Consumer Information Solutions revenue was $639.0 million, up 3 percent;
                 
Mortgage Reporting Solutions revenue was $66.1 million, down 8 percent;
                 
Credit Marketing Services revenue was $156.4 million, down 6 percent; and
                 
Direct Marketing Services revenue was $108.2 million, down 2 percent.
 
Operating margin for USCIS was 39.6 percent in the full year 2007, down from 40.9 percent in the full year 2006.
 
International
Total revenue was $472.8 million in 2007, a 17 percent increase from 2006. In local currency, revenue was up 10 percent when compared to the same period in the prior year. Compared to the full year of 2006:
 
                 
Europe revenue was $183.8 million, up 20 percent in U.S. dollars (10 percent in local currency);
                 
Latin America revenue was $182.5 million, up 19 percent in U.S. dollars (12 percent in local currency); and
                 
Canada Consumer revenue was $106.5 million, up 12 percent in U.S. dollars (5 percent in local currency).
 
Operating margin for International was 29.8 percent in the full year 2007, up from 29.3 percent in the full year 2006.
 
TALX
Total revenue was $179.4 million and operating margin was 16.3 percent for the period from its acquisition on May 15, 2007 through December 31, 2007.  In addition, approximately 23.1 million total records were added to the employment database, bringing total records in the database to 165.9 million.
 
North America Personal Solutions
Total revenue rose to $153.5 million, a 22 percent increase from the full year 2006.  Solid execution of a strategic transformation led to an increase in the subscriber base to 1.4 million customers, a 41 percent increase from 2006. Operating margin was 22.1 percent, up from 10.8 percent for the full year 2006.  On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of certain 2006 litigation matters, operating margin was 14.8 percent for the full year 2006.
 
North America Commercial Solutions
Total revenue rose to $67.6 million, a 37 percent increase from the full year 2006.  In 2007, U.S. commercial transaction volume rose 33 percent to 4.7 million transactions.  Operating margin for 2007 was 17.7 percent, down from 20.2 percent in 2006, reflecting our continued investments in this high growth area of the business.
 
2008 Annual and First Quarter Outlook
 
Based on current business trends and management's outlook, Equifax expects consolidated annual revenue growth to be between 9 percent and 12 percent.  Adjusted EPS for the full year is
expected to be between $2.48 and $2.58.  EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $675 million to $710 million for the full year.  Annual capital expenditures are targeted at $125 million to $150 million.
 
Equifax expects consolidated revenue for the first quarter of 2008 to be between $488 million and $498 million and adjusted EPS to be between 56 cents and 60 cents.
 
Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP financial measure, is calculated by excluding acquisition-related amortization expense from the determination of net income in the calculation of diluted EPS.  EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization expense to operating income.
 
In the case of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, we have not provided corresponding forward-looking GAAP financial measures because these measures are not accessible to us.  We cannot predict the occurrence, timing, or amount of all non-GAAP items that we exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures which could potentially be significant to the calculation of our GAAP financial measures for future fiscal periods.

The following financial measures included herein or in the Q&A are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"): operating income, operating margin and net income excluding the net impact of certain 2006 litigation-related matters, income tax benefit and charge related to organizational realignment; adjusted operating income and operating margin excluding acquisition-related amortization expense and the net impact of certain litigation-related matters and charge related to organizational realignment in 2006; EBITDA, defined as operating income adding back depreciation and amortization expense and excluding the net impact of certain 2006 litigation matters and charge related to organizational realignment; diluted EPS, as adjusted to exclude acquisition-related amortization expense, the net impact of certain 2006 litigation matters, income tax benefit and charge related to organizational realignment; and effective tax rate, excluding certain items.

Notes to Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to the Comparable GAAP Financial Measures
 
Reconciliation of operating income, operating margin and net income for the purposes of comparability highlighting the impact of the following:
 
Litigation Loss Contingencies 
Duringthe second quarter of 2006, we recorded a $14.0 million, pretax, ($8.6 million, net of tax) loss contingency related to certain legal matters. Of this $14.0 million, pretax loss, $11.5 million was recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses and $2.5 million was recognized in cost of services on our Consolidated Statements of Income.  During the third quarter of 2006, there were favorable court rulings which reduced our exposure related to these litigation matters resulting in the reversal of a portion of the loss contingency.  We reversed $9.0 million, pretax, of the loss contingency during the third quarter of 2006, of which $7.5 million was reversed to selling, general and administrative expenses and $1.5 million was reversed to cost of services in our Consolidated Statements of Income.  The $14.0 million loss during the second quarter of 2006 and $9.0 million subsequent reversal of a portion of the loss in the third quarter of 2006 are included within our North America Personal Solutions segment financial results.
 
During the third quarter of 2006, we also recorded a $4.0 million, pretax, ($2.5 million, net of tax) loss associated with certain litigation matters within our U.S. Consumer Information Solutions segment.  Of this $4.0 million, pretax loss, $3.5 million was recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses and $0.5 million was recognized in cost of services on our 2006 Consolidated Statements of Income.
 
Litigation Settlement
In June 2006, we consummated a settlement of claims against certain former selling shareholders of Naviant, Inc.  In 2004, we served a demand for arbitration alleging, among other things, that the sellers were liable for rescission or for indemnification as a result of breaches of various representations and warranties concerning information furnished to us in connection with our acquisition of Naviant, Inc. in 2002.  As a result of this settlement, we recognized a $14.1 million non-taxable gain in other income, net on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006.
 
Management believes excluding the foregoing litigation matters (the "2006 litigation matters") from our financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, as compared to the same period in 2007 since (1) the gain related to the litigation settlement associated with our previous acquisition of Naviant, Inc. is material and is not reflective of our core operations and (2) the litigation loss contingencies and related reversal of such a material amount during the period is not comparable to similar activity in the subsequent period presented. This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax's historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.
 
Income Tax Benefit 
During the third quarter of 2006, the applicable statute of limitations related to uncertain tax positions expired resulting in the reversal of the related income tax reserve. The reversal of the reserves resulted in a $9.5 million income tax benefit. The income tax benefit was recorded in provision for income taxes on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006.
 
Management believes excluding this income tax benefit from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, as compared to the same period in 2007 since an income tax benefit of such a material amount is not comparable to similar activity in the subsequent period
presented. This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax's historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.
 
Charge Related to Organizational Realignment 
During the fourth quarter of 2006, we recorded a $6.4 million, pretax, ($4.0 million, net of tax) severance charge related to our organizational realignment.  Management believes excluding this charge from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2006, as compared to the same periods in 2007 since a charge of such a material amount during the periods is not comparable to similar activity in the subsequent periods presented.  This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax's historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.
 
Adjusted operating income and operating margin, excluding acquisition-related amortization expense, the 2006 litigation loss contingencies, net and charge related to organizational realignment 
Management believes excluding the acquisition-related amortization expense and the 2006 litigation loss contingencies, net and charge related to organization realignment from the calculation of operating income and margin is useful because management excludes acquisition-related amortization expense and other items that are not comparable when measuring operating profitability, evaluating performance trends, and setting performance objectives, and it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis by excluding items that relate to acquisition-related intangible assets and the 2006 items that impact comparability.
 
Diluted EPS, adjusted for acquisition-related amortization expense, 2006 litigation matters, income tax benefit and charge related to organizational realignment 
We calculate this financial measure by excluding acquisition-related amortization expense and the 2006 litigation matters, income tax benefit and charge related to organizational realignment, net of tax, from the determination of net income in the calculation of diluted EPS. This financial measure is not prepared in conformity with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to diluted EPS, net income, operating income, operating margin, or cash provided by operating activities.
 
Management believes that this measure is useful because management excludes acquisition-related amortization expense when measuring operating profitability, evaluating performance trends, and setting performance objectives, and it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis by excluding items that relate to acquisition-related intangible assets and the 2006 items that impact comparability.
 
EBITDA 
We calculate EBITDA by adding back depreciation and amortization expense and the net impact of the 2006 litigation loss contingencies and charge related to organizational realignment described above to operating income. This financial measure is not prepared in conformity with GAAP since it excludes depreciation and amortization expense, as well as interest expense, minority interest in earnings (net of tax), other income, net, provision for income taxes from earnings and the 2006 litigation loss contingencies and organizational realignment charge. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, operating margin, or cash provided by operating activities. Our definition of EBITDA may not be comparable with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
 
Management believes that EBITDA is a useful supplemental measure to investors because it is consistent with how management evaluates our financial performance and is
frequently used by securities analysts and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. Additionally, management uses this measure as an important metric for forecasting and analyzing future periods, as well as evaluating future investing and financing decisions.
 
Effective Tax Rate, Excluding Certain Items 
This
financial measure is not prepared in conformity with GAAP and excludes certain items, including (1) the reversal of a $9.5 million income tax reserve related to uncertain tax positions primarily due to the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations during the third quarter of 2006 and (2) the impact of the non-taxable $14.1 million gain recorded during the second quarter of 2006 related to the settlement of claims against the former selling shareholders of Naviant, Inc., an acquisition in 2002.  The effective tax rate, excluding certain items, is not a measurement of profitability under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, provision for income taxes or earnings per share.
 
Management believes our effective tax rate, excluding certain items provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding the items discussed above in order to show a comparable effective tax rate since the items during the periods are material amounts and not comparable to similar activity in the subsequent periods presented. Equifax believes that this financial information is useful to our management and investors in assessing Equifax's historical performance and liquidity and when planning, forecasting
and analyzing future periods.
