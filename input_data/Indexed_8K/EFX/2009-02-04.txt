Equifax Inc. (NYSE: EFX) today announced financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2008.  The company reported revenue of $446.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, a 9 percent decrease from the prior year period, of which 5 percent was due to the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates.  Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $116.1 million, a 3 percent decrease from the same period of 2007.  Fourth quarter 2008 net income was $64.0 million, a 2 percent decrease from the prior year.  Diluted earnings per share ("EPS") for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $0.50 compared to $0.49 in the same period of the prior year, a 2 percent increase.  On a non-GAAP basis, EPS, excluding the impact of acquisition-related amortization expense ("adjusted EPS"), was $0.61, up 3 percent from the same period of 2007.
ATLANTA, February 4, 2009 
 
Operating income for 2008 was $477.2 million, a 2 percent decrease from 2007.  Full year net income for 2008 increased slightly from 2007 to $272.8 million.  EPS was $2.09 compared to $2.02 for the full year 2007, a 4 percent increase.  On a non-GAAP basis, EPS, excluding the impact of acquisition-related amortization expense, restructuring and asset write-down charges and an income tax benefit recorded in the third quarter of 2008, was $2.48, up 7 percent from the prior year period.

For the full year 2008, revenue increased 5 percent to $1.94 billion compared to 2007. 
 
"2008 was one of the most challenging business environments we have ever faced. Although economic conditions deteriorated throughout the year, we concentrated our efforts on key revenue initiatives to help our clients meet their information and risk management needs in this difficult environment and to better position each of our business units for long-term growth.  In 2008, new product innovation delivered over $70 million of revenue.  We also launched four new business initiatives addressing opportunities in Capital Markets, Collections, Identity
 
.  Many challenges remain as we enter 2009. However, we have a diversified business portfolio and solid momentum with our new product initiatives that we expect will continue to deliver solid financial performance."
Management and Government.  Settlement Services, our largest new business initiative grew four-fold in 2008, offsetting double digit declines in core Mortgage Reporting revenue.  We continue to realize revenue synergies with The Work Number as we have closed sixty new deals in 2008," said Richard F. Smith, Equifax's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  "We reallocated our resources and took the actions needed to reduce operating expenses and maintain strong operating margins. Our business model is resilient, our balance sheet remains strong, and we believe we are well positioned to deliver on our long-term growth objectives

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
This earnings release presents operating income and operating margin excluding acquisition-related amortization expense, restructuring and asset write-down charges; net income and diluted EPS excluding acquisition-related amortization expense, restructuring and asset write-down charges, all net of tax, and income tax benefit; EBITDA, which we define as operating income adding back depreciation and amortization expense; and Adjusted EBITDA, which is EBITDA adding back certain restructuring charges.  These are important financial measures for Equifax but are not financial measures as defined by GAAP.
 
These non-GAAP financial measures should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant GAAP financial measures and are not presented as alternative measures of operating income, operating margin, net income or EPS as determined in accordance with GAAP.  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as we have calculated may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
 
Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and related notes are presented in the Q&A.  This information can also be found under "Investors/GAAP/Non-GAAP Measures" on our website at www.equifax.com.

Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied.  Such differences may result from actions taken by Equifax, including restructuring or strategic initiatives (including capital investments or asset acquisitions or dispositions), as well as from developments beyond Equifax's control, including but not limited to changes in worldwide and U.S. economic conditions that materially impact consumer spending, consumer debt and employment, changes in demand for Equifax's products and services, our ability to develop new products and services, pricing and other competitive pressures, our ability to achieve targeted cost efficiencies, risks relating to illegal third party efforts to access data, risks associated with our ability to complete and integrate acquisitions and other investments, changes in laws and regulations governing our business, including federal or state responses to identity theft concerns, and the outcome of our pending litigation.

(Dollars in millions)
 
2.
   
What drove the fluctuation in the effective tax rate?
Our effective income tax rate was 36.6% for the three months ended December 31, 2008, up from 33.1% for the same period in 2007, due primarily to discrete items recorded during the fourth quarter 2007 including a $2.9 million benefit for refunds related to our 2002 and 2003 U.S. federal income tax filings.
 
Our effective income tax rate was 32.8% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, down from 35.8% for the same period in 2007. The 2008 rate reflects the reversal of a $14.6 million income tax reserve related to an uncertain tax position regarding our Brazilian operations, for which the statute of limitations expired in the third quarter of 2008.

Notes to Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to the Comparable GAAP Financial Measures
 
Restructuring and Asset Write-Down Charges
 During the third quarter of 2008,
we realigned our business to better support our strategic objectives in the current economic environment.  As a result, the company recorded $16.8 million of restructuring and asset write-down charges.  Of this amount,
$10.3 million relates to severance expenses and $4.1 million relates to certain contractual costs including office exit and cancellation fees, both of which were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Income.  The remaining
$2.4 million represents software asset write-down charges that were recorded in depreciation and amortization on our Consolidated Statements of Income. 
Management believes excluding these charges from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to 2007 since charges of such a material amount are not comparable to similar activity in the prior year.  This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax's historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.
 
Income Tax Benefit 
During the third quarter of 2008, the applicable statute of limitations related to an uncertain tax position regarding our Brazilian operations expired resulting in the reversal of the related income tax reserves. The reversal of the reserves resulted in the recognition of a $14.6 million income tax benefit. The income tax benefit was recorded in provision for income taxes on our Consolidated Statements of Income.  Management believes excluding this income tax benefit from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to 2007 since an income tax benefit of such a material amount is not comparable to similar activity in the prior period presented. This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax's historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.
 
- Management believes excluding acquisition-related amortization expense, restructuring and asset write-down charges from the calculation of operating income and margin, on a non-GAAP basis, is useful because management excludes items that are not comparable when measuring operating profitability, evaluating performance trends, and setting performance objectives, and it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis by excluding items that that impact comparability.
Adjusted operating income and operating margin, excluding acquisition-related amortization expense, restructuring and asset write-down charges
 
- We calculate these financial measures by excluding acquisition-related amortization expense, restructuring and asset write-down charges, all net of tax, and the 2008 income tax benefit from the determination of net income in the calculation of diluted EPS. These financial measures are not prepared in conformity with GAAP.  Management believes that these measures are useful because management excludes acquisition-related amortization expense and other items that are not comparable when measuring operating profitability, evaluating performance trends, and setting performance objectives, and it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis by
Net income and diluted EPS, adjusted for acquisition-related amortization expense, restructuring and asset write-down charges and income tax benefit
excluding items that relate to acquisition-related intangible assets and the 2008 items that impact comparability.
 
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
- We calculate EBITDA by adding back depreciation and amortization expense to operating income. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA by adding back certain restructuring charges to EBITDA. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not prepared in conformity with GAAP since they exclude depreciation and amortization expense, as well as interest expense, minority interest in earnings (net of tax), other income, net, provision for income taxes and the 2008 restructuring charges from earnings. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to net income, operating income, operating margin, or cash provided by operating activities.  Management believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful supplemental measures to investors because they are consistent with how management evaluates our financial performance and are frequently used by securities analysts and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. Additionally, management uses these measures as important metrics for forecasting and analyzing future periods, as well as evaluating future investing and financing decisions.
