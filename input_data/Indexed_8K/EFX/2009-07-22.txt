Second quarter revenue was $455.4 million, up 1 percent over the first quarter of 2009.
 
                 
Second quarter EPS was $0.47 and second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.57.
 
ATLANTA, July 22, 2009 
Equifax Inc. (NYSE: EFX) today announced financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2009.  The company reported r
evenue of $455.4 million in the second quarter of 2009, a 9 percent decrease from the second quarter of 2008, of which 4
percent was due to the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates.  Second
quarter 2009 n
et income was $59.6 million, down from $70.8 million in the prior year.  Diluted earnings per share ("EPS") for the second quarter of 2009 was $0.47 compared to $0.54 in the same period of the prior year.  On a non-GAAP basis, EPS, excluding the impact of acquisition-related amortization expense ("adjusted EPS"), was $0.57 compared to $0.64 in the second quarter of 2008.
 
"We continued to make good progress on our key strategic initiatives during the second quarter, including leveraging The Work Number and Tax Management Services businesses, innovating new products and expanding mortgage settlement services. For the quarter, TALX delivered strong year-over-year growth, while USCIS was generally consistent with our previous outlook aided by strong mortgage activity during much of the quarter," said Richard F. Smith, Equifax's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "However, our International results were adversely affected by weakening economic conditions, while Personal Solutions and North America Commercial Solutions were adversely impacted by the continuing recessionary environment and consumer caution in the U.S.  In the face of ongoing softness in the global economy and in demand for credit-related services, we continue to aggressively manage our expenses, diversify our revenue base and invest in our long-term growth strategy.  We believe these efforts will position us well for revenue growth when the economy begins to recover."

These are important financial measures for Equifax but are not financial measures as defined by GAAP.
 
These non-GAAP financial measures should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant GAAP financial measures and are not presented as alternative measures of operating income, operating margin or EPS as determined in accordance with GAAP.

These statements are made on the basis of management's views and assumptions regarding future events and business performance as of the time the statements are made.

Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied.  Such differences may result from actions taken by Equifax, including restructuring or strategic initiatives (including capital investments or asset acquisitions or dispositions), as well as from developments beyond Equifax's control, including but not limited to changes in worldwide and U.S. economic conditions that materially impact consumer spending, consumer debt and employment, changes in demand for Equifax's products and services, our ability to develop new products and services, pricing and other competitive pressures, our ability to achieve targeted cost efficiencies, risks relating to illegal third party efforts to access data, risks associated with our ability to complete and integrate acquisitions and other investments, changes in laws and regulations governing our business, including federal or state responses to identity theft concerns, and the outcome of our pending litigation.

The effective tax rate was 37.2% for the six months ended June 30, 2009, up from 35.8% for the same period in 2008, due primarily to the item discussed above and an unfavorable discrete item recorded during the first quarter of 2009 related to the effect of a change in California state income taxes on our deferred tax liabilities.

Notes to Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to the Comparable GAAP Financial Measures
 
Restructuring Charge 
During the first quarter of 2009,
the company recorded an $8.4 million, pretax, ($5.4 million, net of tax) restructuring charge primarily related to
severance expense in selling, general and administrative expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Income.  Management believes excluding this charge from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the six months ended June 30, 2009, as compared to the same period in 2008, since a charge of such a material amount is not comparable to similar activity in the prior year.  This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax's historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.
 
Adjusted operating income and operating margin, excluding restructuring charge
- Management believes excluding the restructuring charge from the calculation of operating income and margin, on a non-GAAP basis, is useful because management excludes items that are not comparable when measuring operating profitability, evaluating performance trends, and setting performance objectives, and it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis by excluding items that impact comparability.
 
Diluted EPS, adjusted for acquisition-related amortization expense and restructuring charge
- We calculate this financial measure by excluding acquisition-related amortization expense and the restructuring charge, both net of tax, from the determination of net income in the calculation of diluted EPS. This financial measure is not prepared in conformity with GAAP.  Management believes that this measure is useful because management excludes acquisition-related amortization expense and other items that are not comparable when measuring operating profitability, evaluating performance trends, and setting performance objectives, and it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis by excluding items that relate to acquisition-related intangible assets and items that impact comparability.
