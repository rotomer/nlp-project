Third quarter revenue was $451.9 million, down 1 percent from the second quarter of 2009.
 
                 
Third quarter EPS was $0.47 and third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.57.
 
                 
Announced agreement to acquire IXI Corporation, a leading provider of information on consumer financial assets, income and spending.
 
ATLANTA, October 21, 2009 
Equifax Inc. (NYSE: EFX) today announced financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2009.  The company reported r
evenue of $451.9 million in the third quarter of 2009, a 7 percent decrease from the third quarter of 2008, of which 3
percent was due to the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates. 
Diluted earnings per share ("EPS") for the third quarter of 2009 was $0.47 compared to $0.56 in the same period of the prior year.  On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted EPS, which excludes the impact of acquisition-related amortization expense and the restructuring and asset write-down charges and income tax benefit in the prior year, was $0.57 compared to $0.63 in the third quarter of 2008.
 
"Our business continues to perform well in a very challenging operating environment. Strong operating margins and the strength of our balance sheet enable us to pursue strategic acquisitions that will further enhance our competitive position while providing incremental revenue and EPS growth," said Richard F. Smith, Equifax's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Earlier today we announced an agreement on an important strategic acquisition, IXI Corporation. The wealth and asset data, which IXI owns, significantly broadens and deepens the insight about consumers' capacity, ability and propensity to spend or to pay on their obligations. This unique consumer wealth data substantially enhances our strategy of providing differentiated data, best-in-class analytics, and technology for our customers' decisioning needs."

These are important financial measures for Equifax but are not financial measures as defined by GAAP.
 
These non-GAAP financial measures should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant GAAP financial measures and are not presented as alternative measures of operating income, operating margin, net income or EPS as determined in accordance with GAAP.

Management does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
 
Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied.  Such differences may result from actions taken by Equifax, including restructuring or strategic initiatives (including capital investments or asset acquisitions or dispositions), as well as from developments beyond Equifax's control, including but not limited to changes in worldwide and U.S. economic conditions that materially impact consumer spending, consumer debt and employment, changes in demand for Equifax's products and services, our ability to develop new products and services, pricing and other competitive pressures, our ability to achieve targeted cost efficiencies, risks relating to illegal third party efforts to access data, risks associated with our ability to complete and integrate acquisitions and other investments, changes in laws and regulations governing our business, including federal or state responses to identity theft concerns, and the outcome of our pending litigation.

What drove the fluctuation in the effective tax rate?
Our effective income tax rate was 33.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2009, up from 19.6% for the same period in 2008, due primarily to the reversal of a $14.6 million income tax reserve during 2008 related to the expiration of the statute of limitations for an uncertain tax position regarding our Brazilian operations.  During the third quarter of 2009, we recorded a discrete item related to an investment loss in a subsidiary which favorably affected our third quarter of 2009 tax rate by approximately 3 percentage points.  The effective income tax rate was 36.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2009, up from 31.0% for the same period in 2008, due primarily to the items described above.

Notes to Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to the Comparable GAAP Financial Measures
 
Restructuring and Asset Write-Down Charges
 During the first quarter of 2009,
the company recorded an $8.4 million, pretax, ($5.4 million, net of tax) restructuring charge primarily related to
severance expense in selling, general and administrative expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Income.  During the third quarter of 2008, we recorded restructuring and asset write-down charges of $16.8 million, pretax, ($10.5 million, net of tax).  Of this amount, $10.3 million related to severance expense and $4.1 million related to certain contractual costs, including office exit and cancellation fees, both of which were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Income.  The remaining $2.4 million represents software asset write-down charges that were recorded in depreciation and amortization on our Consolidated Statements of Income.
 
Management believes excluding these charges from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009, as compared to the same periods in 2008, since charges of such material amounts are not comparable among the periods.  This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax's historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.
 
Income Tax Benefit 
During the third quarter of 2008, the applicable statute of limitations related to an uncertain tax position regarding our Brazilian operations expired resulting in the reversal of the related income tax reserves. The reversal of the reserves resulted in the recognition of a $14.6 million income tax benefit. The income tax benefit was recorded in provision for income taxes on our Consolidated Statements of Income.  Management believes excluding this income tax benefit from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, since an income tax benefit of such a material amount is not comparable to similar activity in the subsequent periods presented. This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax's historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.
 
Net income and diluted EPS, adjusted for acquisition-related amortization expense, restructuring and asset write-down charges and income tax benefit
- We calculate these financial measures by excluding acquisition-related amortization expense, restructuring and asset write-down charges, all net of tax, and the 2008 income tax benefit from the determination of net income in the calculation of diluted EPS. These financial measures are not prepared in conformity with GAAP.  Management believes that these measures are useful because management excludes acquisition-related amortization expense and other items that are not comparable when measuring operating profitability, evaluating performance trends, and setting performance objectives, and it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis by excluding items that relate to acquisition-related intangible assets and items that impact comparability.
 
Adjusted operating income and operating margin, excluding restructuring and asset write-down charges
- Management believes excluding the 2008 third quarter restructuring and asset write-down charges from the calculation of operating income and margin, on a non-GAAP basis, is useful because management excludes items that are not comparable when measuring operating profitability, evaluating performance trends, and setting performance objectives, and it
allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis by excluding items that impact comparability.
