ERISA Compliance
.

No "employee pension benefit plan" subject to Title IV of ERISA established or maintained by the Company, its subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates, if such "employee pension benefit plan" were terminated, would have any "amount of unfunded benefit liabilities" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(18) of ERISA), except for the amount of unfunded benefit liabilities, if any, as would not, in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.  Neither the Company, its subsidiaries nor any of their ERISA Affiliates has incurred or reasonably expects to incur any liability under (i) Title IV of ERISA with respect to termination of, or withdrawal from, any "employee pension benefit plan" or (ii) Sections 412, 4971, 4975 or 4980B of the Code that would, in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.  Each "employee pension benefit plan" established or maintained by the Company, its subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates that is intended to be qualified under Section 401 of the Code is so qualified and the Company is not aware of any circumstances likely to cause the loss of such qualification.
Any certificate signed by an officer of the Company and delivered to the Representatives or to counsel for the Underwriters shall be deemed to be a representation and warranty by the Company to each Underwriter as to the matters set forth therein.

The Company hereby acknowledges that the only information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) are the statements set forth in (i) the last paragraph on the front cover of the Preliminary Prospectus and Prospectus regarding delivery of the Securities, (ii) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities in table in the second full paragraph under the caption "Underwriting" in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus, (iii) the fourth full paragraph under the caption "Underwriting" in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus, and (iv) the eighth full paragraph under the caption "Underwriting" in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus; and the Underwriters confirm that such statements are correct. The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liabilities that each Underwriter may otherwise have.
 
(c)  
Notifications and Other Indemnification Procedures
.
  Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party for contribution or otherwise than under the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 8 or to the extent it is not prejudiced as a proximate result of such failure.  In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and such indemnified party seeks or intends to seek indemnity from an indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in and, to the extent that it shall elect, jointly with all other indemnifying parties similarly notified, by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to
assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that a conflict may arise between the positions of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in conducting the defense of any such action or that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assume such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties.  Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of such indemnifying party's election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (together with local counsel), approved by the indemnifying party (the Representatives in the case of Section 8(b) and Section 9), representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such action) or (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party.
provided, however,
 
(d)  
Settlements
.
 
The indemnifying party under this Section 8 shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by Section 8 hereof, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
SECTION 9.           .  If the indemnification provided for in Section 8 is for any reason held to be unavailable to or otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such
Contribution
indemnified party, as incurred, as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate initial offering price of the Securities as set forth on such cover.  The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or the Underwriters, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8, any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim.  The provisions set forth in Section 8 with respect to notice of commencement of any action shall apply if a claim for contribution is to be made under this Section 9; that no additional notice shall be required with respect to any action for which notice has been given under Section 8 for purposes of indemnification.
provided, however,
 
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 9.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting commissions received by such Underwriter in connection with the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public.
 
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several, not joint, in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments set forth opposite their names in .  For purposes of this Section 9, each director, officer, employee or agent of an Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act
Schedule A
shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company with the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
 
SECTION 10.        
Termination of this Agreement
.
  Prior to the Closing Date, this Agreement may be terminated by the Representatives by notice given to the Company if at any time (i) trading or quotation in any of the Company's securities shall have been suspended or limited by the Commission or by the New York Stock Exchange, or trading in securities generally on either the Nasdaq Stock Market or the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited, or minimum or maximum prices shall have been generally established on any of such stock exchanges by the Commission or FINRA; (ii) a general banking moratorium shall have been declared by any federal, New York or Georgia authorities; (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of national or international hostilities or any crisis or calamity, or any change in the United States or international financial markets, or any substantial change or development involving a prospective substantial change in United States' or international political, financial or economic conditions, as in the judgment of the Representatives is material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to market the Securities in the manner and on the terms described in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Securities; (iv) since the execution of this Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Disclosure Package, there shall have occurred any Material Adverse Change the effect of which, in the judgment of the Representatives, makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the completion of the offer or the sale of and payment for the Securities; (v) the Company shall have sustained a loss by strike, fire, flood, earthquake, accident or other calamity of such character as in the judgment of the Representatives may interfere materially with the conduct of the business and operations of the Company regardless of whether or not such loss shall have been insured; or (vi) there shall have occurred a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States.  Any termination pursuant to this Section 10 shall be without liability on the part of the Company to any Underwriter, except that the Company shall be obligated to reimburse the expenses of the Underwriters pursuant to Sections 4 and 6 hereof, any Underwriter to the Company, or of any party hereto to any other party except that the provisions of Section 8 and Section 9 shall at all times be effective and shall survive such termination.

In relation to each Member State of the European Economic Area which has implemented the Prospectus Directive, each Underwriter represents and agrees that with effect from and including the date on which the Prospectus Directive is implemented in that Member State it has not made and will not make an offer of Securities to the public in that Member State, except that it may, with effect from and including such date, make an offer of Securities to the public in that Member State:
 
                 
at any time to legal entities which are authorized or regulated to operate in the financial markets or, if not so authorized or regulated, whose corporate purpose is solely to invest in securities;
 
                 
at any time to any legal entity which has two or more of (1) an average of at least 250 employees during the last financial year; (2) a total balance sheet of more than 43,000,000; and (3) an annual net turnover of more than 50,000,000, as shown in its last annual or consolidated accounts; or
 
                 
at any time in any other circumstances which do not require the publication by us of a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive (except in reliance on Article 3.2(b) of the Prospectus Directive).
 
For the purposes of the above, the expression an "offer of Securities to the public" in relation to any Securities in any Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Securities to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe the Securities, as the same may be varied in that Member State by any measure implementing the Prospectus Directive in that Member State and the expression Prospectus Directive means Directive 2003/71/EC and includes any relevant implementing measure in that Member State.

EXHIBIT A-1
 
The opinion of Alston & Bird LLP, counsel for the Company, to be delivered pursuant to Section 5(e) of the Purchase Agreement, shall be substantially to the effect that:
 
(i)            The Company has corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities.
 
(ii)           The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
 
(iii)          The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and (assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Trustee) constitutes a valid and legally binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, moratorium and other laws relating to or affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally, and to the limitation that the enforceability thereof (including by means of specific performance) may be subject to certain equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before which proceedings may be brought, including traditional equitable defenses such as waiver, laches and estoppel; good faith and fair dealing; reasonableness; materiality of the breach; impracticability or impossibility of performance; and the effect of obstruction or failure to perform or otherwise act in accordance with an agreement by any person other than the obligor thereunder (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) (the "Bankruptcy and Equity Exception").
 
(iv)          The Securities are in the form contemplated by the Indenture, have been duly authorized by the Company for issuance and sale pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture and, when duly executed, authenticated, issued, and delivered in the manner provided in the Indenture (assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of the Indenture by the Trustee) and paid for as provided in the Underwriting Agreement, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception, and will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture.
 
(v)           The statements in the Base Prospectus under the caption "Description of the Debt Securities" and in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus under the captions "Description of the Notes," insofar as such statements constitute summaries of legal matters, documents, or legal proceedings referred to therein, fairly summarize, in all material respects, the matters referred to therein.
 
(vi)          The statements in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus under the caption "Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences," insofar as such statements purport to constitute a summary of the U.S. federal tax laws referred to therein, fairly summarize, in all material respects, the U.S. federal tax laws referred to therein.
(vii)         No consent, approval, authorization, or order of, or registration, qualification, or filing with, any court or other governmental or regulatory authority or agency, is required for the Company's execution, delivery and performance of the Underwriting Agreement, the Base Indenture or the Supplemental Indenture or the issuance and delivery of the Securities, except such as may be required under applicable state securities or blue sky laws, and by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, in connection with the purchase and resale of the Securities by the Underwriters.
 
(viii)        The execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement, the Base Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture by the Company and the performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder (other than performance by the Company of its obligations under the indemnification and contribution sections of the Underwriting Agreement, as to which we express no opinion) will not (a) result in any violation of the provisions of the charter or by-laws of the Company; or (b) to the best of our knowledge, result in any violation of any law, administrative regulation, or administrative or court decree applicable to the Company.
 
(ix)           The Company is not, and after receipt of payment for the Securities and the application of the proceeds thereof as described under the caption: "Use of Proceeds" in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus will not be, an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act.
 
(x)            The Base Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act.
 
In addition, we confirm that we have participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, representatives of the independent registered public accounting firm of the Company, the Underwriters' representatives and the Underwriters' counsel at which the contents of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus were discussed and, although we have not independently verified and are not passing upon and do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus (other than as specified above), on the basis of the foregoing (relying as to materiality to the extent we deem appropriate upon facts provided to us by officers or other representatives of the Company and without independent verification of such facts), no facts have come to our attention that causes us to believe that (a) the Registration Statement, as of the date of the Underwriting Agreement (I) did not comply in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act, and (II) contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (b) the Disclosure Package, as of the Initial Sale Time (as defined in the third paragraph of the Underwriting Agreement), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (c) the Prospectus, as of its date or as of the Closing Date, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.  We express no opinion with respect to the financial statements, notes and schedules, other financial and
statistical data and assessments of or reports on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus.
 
The foregoing opinions are limited to the federal laws of the United States of America, the laws of the State of Georgia, and with respect to the matters set forth in paragraphs (iii) and (iv), also the laws of the State of New York.
 
EXHIBIT A-2
 
The opinion of Kent E. Mast, Esq., Chief Legal Officer of the Company, to be delivered pursuant to Section 5(f) of the Purchase Agreement, shall be substantially to the effect that:

Atlanta, Georgia 30309
 
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as counsel to Equifax Inc., a Georgia corporation (the "Company"), in connection with (1) the filing of the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-144009) (the "Registration Statement") with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), on June 25, 2007 for the purpose of registering under the Securities Act the Company's debt securities to be offered from time to time by the Company on terms to be determined at the time of the offering, and (2) the issuance by the Company of its 4.450% Senior Notes due 2014 (the "Notes") as described in the Company's Prospectus dated June 25, 2007 (the "Prospectus"), which is a part of the Registration Statement, and Prospectus Supplement dated November 4, 2009 (the "Prospectus Supplement").  The Notes will be issued under an indenture dated as of June 29, 1998, by and between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (formerly known as the Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as successor to Bank One Trust Company, N.A., which was successor in interest to The First National Bank of Chicago), as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by a Third Supplemental Indenture to be dated as of November 9, 2009 by and between the Company and the Trustee (together, the "Indenture"). The Notes will be sold pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement dated November 4, 2009 between the Company and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., as the representatives of the underwriters named therein. This opinion is being furnished in accordance with the requirements of Item 601(b)(5) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act.
 
As counsel to the Company, we have examined the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company, the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company, records of proceedings of the Board of Directors and the Debt Issuance Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company deemed by us to be relevant to this opinion, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement, the Indenture and the form of Note.  We also have examined such other relevant documents, and have made such other examinations of matters of law and of fact, as we have considered appropriate or advisable for purposes of this opinion. In our examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of all natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as original documents and the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified, conformed, facsimile, electronic or photostatic copies.  As to questions of fact material to this opinion, we have relied upon the statements as to factual matters contained in the above-referenced documents and statements of officers of the Company, and we have made no independent investigation with regard thereto.
 
To the extent that the obligations of the Company under the Indenture may depend upon such matters, we have assumed for purposes of this opinion that: (i) the Trustee is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization; (ii) the Trustee is duly qualified to engage in the activities contemplated by the Indenture; (iii) the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Trustee and constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the Trustee, enforceable against the Trustee in accordance with its terms; (iv) the Trustee is in compliance, with respect to any actions the Trustee may take under the Indenture, with all applicable laws and regulations; and (v) the Trustee has the requisite organizational and legal power and authority to perform its obligations under the Indenture.
 
Our opinion set forth below is subject to the effects of (i) bankruptcy, fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, liquidation, conservatorship, and similar laws, and limitations imposed under judicial decisions related to or affecting creditors' rights and remedies
