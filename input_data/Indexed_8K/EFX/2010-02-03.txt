evenue of $464.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, a 4 percent increase from the fourth quarter of 2008, of which 3 percent was due to the favorable effect of foreign exchange rates
.  Fourth quarter 2009 net income was $60.2 million, a 6 percent decrease from the prior year.  On a non-GAAP basis, excluding acquisition-related amortization expense, a restructuring charge (both net of tax) and an income tax benefit, net income was $77.9 million, flat when compared to the fourth quarter of 2008.

For the full year 2009, revenue was $1.82 billion, a 6 percent decrease from 2008 of which 3
percent was due to the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates.

What drove the fluctuation in the effective tax rate?
 
Our effective income tax rate was 20.3% for the three months ended December 31, 2009, down from 36.2% for the same period in 2008, due primarily to the recognition of a $7.3 million income tax benefit during the fourth quarter of 2009 related to our ability to utilize foreign tax credits beyond 2009. Additionally, we recorded favorable discrete items during the fourth quarter of 2009 related to foreign and state taxes.
 
The effective tax rate was 32.6% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, up from 32.3% for the same period in 2008.  Our 2009 rate reflects the previously mentioned income tax benefits and our 2008 rate reflects the reversal of a $14.6 million income tax reserve related to the expiration of the statute of limitations for an uncertain tax position regarding our Brazilian operations.

Notes to Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to the Comparable GAAP Financial Measures
 
Restructuring and Asset Write-Down Charges
 During the fourth and first quarters of 2009,
the company recorded restructuring charges primarily related to severance expense of $16.4 million, pretax, ($10.4 million, net of tax) and $8.4 million, pretax, ($5.4 million, net of tax) respectively,
in selling, general and administrative expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Income.  During the third quarter of 2008, we recorded restructuring and asset write-down charges of $16.8 million, pretax ($10.5 million, net of tax).  Of this amount, $10.3 million related to severance expense and $4.1 million related to certain contractual costs, including office exit and cancellation fees, both of which were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Income.  The remaining $2.4 million represents software asset write-down charges that were recorded in depreciation and amortization on our Consolidated Statements of Income.
 
Management believes excluding these charges from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2009, as compared to 2008, since charges of such material amounts are not comparable among the periods.  This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax's historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.
 
Income Tax Benefits 
During the fourth quarter of 2009, we recorded a $7.3 million income tax benefit related to our ability to utilize foreign tax credits beyond 2009.  During the third quarter of 2008, the applicable statute of limitations related to an uncertain tax position regarding our Brazilian operations expired resulting in the reversal of the related income tax reserves. The reversal of the reserves resulted in the recognition of a $14.6 million income tax benefit. These income tax benefits were recorded in provision for income taxes on our Consolidated Statements of Income.  Management believes excluding these income tax benefits from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, since income tax benefits of such material amounts are not comparable among the periods. This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax's historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.
 
Net income and diluted EPS, adjusted for acquisition-related amortization expense, restructuring and asset write-down charges and income tax benefits
- We calculate these financial measures by excluding acquisition-related amortization expense, restructuring and asset write-down charges, all net of tax, and income tax benefits from the determination of net income in the calculation of diluted EPS. These financial measures are not prepared in conformity with GAAP. Management believes that these measures are useful because management excludes acquisition-related amortization expense and other items that are not comparable when measuring operating profitability, evaluating performance trends, and setting performance objectives, and it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis by excluding items that relate to acquisition-related intangible assets and items that impact comparability.
 
Adjusted operating income and operating margin, excluding restructuring and asset write-down charges
- Management believes excluding the restructuring and asset write-down
charges from the calculation of operating income and margin, on a non-GAAP basis, is useful because management excludes items that are not comparable when measuring operating profitability, evaluating performance trends, and setting performance objectives, and it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis by excluding items that impact comparability.
