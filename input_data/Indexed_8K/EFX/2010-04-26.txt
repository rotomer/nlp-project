Executive Compensation Actions
 
On April 20, 2010, the Compensation, Human Resources and Management Succession Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors of Equifax Inc. (the Company) approved annual long-term incentive (LTI) award opportunities for named executive officers pursuant to the Companys shareholder-approved 2008 Omnibus Incentive  Plan (the "Plan").  The named executive officers include Richard F. Smith, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Lee Adrean, Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Coretha M. Rushing, Corporate Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer; Kent E. Mast, Corporate Vice President and Chief Legal Officer; and William W. Canfield, President, TALX.
 
The Committee approved the following annual stock option and performance-based restricted stock unit awards to the named executive officers effective as of April 30, 2010:
 
The stock options are non-qualified, have a ten-year term and vest 33-1/3% on the first anniversary of the grant date and 33-1/3% on each of the next two grant date anniversaries if the officer remains employed by the Company on those dates or has retired, subject to acceleration in the event of a change in control and adjustment in certain events.
 
The qualified performance-based restricted stock units awards have both time-based and performance-based vesting conditions.  The awards provide for  a three-year vesting period from the date of grant if the officer remains actively employed by the Company, subject to acceleration if the termination is due to death, disability or change in control, and adjustment in certain events.  Awards will no longer vest immediately upon an executive's retirement as is the case with prior awards.  The awards also require the achievement of certain applicable performance-based vesting conditions which reflect the Company's intention to qualify, to the extent practicable, compensation paid to officers as tax deductible, subject to the deductibility limitations of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.  The maximum number of shares listed above for each executive officer that vests on the vesting date will be equal in value to one-half of one percent (or one and one-half percent in the case of the Chief Executive Officer) of the sum of the Company's cumulative operating income for the period April 1, 2010 through December 31, 2012, as determined by the Committee in accordance with the Plan, divided by the fair market value of a share on the vesting date. 
Copies of the form of non-qualified stock option award agreement, qualified performance-based restricted stock unit award agreement (senior leadership team) and restricted stock unit award agreement (non-senior leadership team employees) are attached to this report as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2, and 10.3, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.

Canfield, a member of the Company's Board of Directors, President of the Companys TALX business unit and a named executive officer, announced his intention to retire from the Board effective as of June 1, 2010.  Mr. Canfield will retire as President of TALX effective June 1, 2010, and as an officer of the Company effective December 31, 2010, after assisting with the transition in leadership of TALX to J.

EXHIBIT 10.1
[Participant]
 
Number of Shares Subject to Award: [Number of Shares]
 
Option Price:  $[Option Price]
 
Date of Grant:  [Grant Date]
 
Pursuant to the Equifax Inc. 2008 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the Plan), Equifax Inc., a Georgia corporation (the Company), has granted the above-named Participant (the Participant) an Option (the Award) to purchase shares of common stock of the Company (the Shares), the terms and conditions of which are set in this agreement (the Agreement) and in the Plan.  Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Plan.
 
1.       The Company on the Date of Grant set forth above granted to Participant (subject to the terms of the Plan and this Agreement) the right to purchase from the Company all or part of the Number of Shares stated above (the Option).  This Agreement is not intended to be, and shall not be treated as, an incentive stock option as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code).
Grant of Option
.
 
2.       The Option is subject to the following basic terms and conditions:
Basic Terms and Conditions
.
 
(a)    Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Option will expire ten (10) years from the Date of Grant (the Expiration Date).
Expiration Date
.
 
(b)    Except as provided in Sections 2(d) or 3, the Option shall be exercisable with respect to one-third of the Number of Shares subject to this Option on each of the first three anniversaries of the Date of Grant so that this Option shall be fully exercisable on the third anniversary of the Date of Grant, provided the Participant (i) remains employed by the Company or a Subsidiary or (ii) subject to the provisions of Section 2(d)(ii), terminates employment by reason of Retirement (as such term is defined in the Plan).  Once exercisable, in whole or part, the Option will continue to be so exercisable until the earlier of the termination of Participants rights under Section 2(d) or 3, or the Expiration Date.
Exercise of Option
.
 
(c)    In order to exercise the Option, it must be vested and must not have expired, and Participant must give written notice in a manner prescribed by the Company from time to time together with payment of the Option Price to the Company at the Companys principal office in Atlanta, Georgia, or as otherwise directed by the Committee.  The Date of Exercise will be the date of receipt of the notice or any later date specified in the notice.  Participant must pay the Option Price (i) in cash or a cash equivalent acceptable to the Committee, (ii) by the surrender (or attestation of ownership) of Shares with an aggregate Fair Market Value (based on the closing price of a share of Common Stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange composite index on the Date of Exercise) that is not less than the Option Price, (iii) by a combination of cash and Shares or (iv) by net settlement of the Option in the manner designated by the Committee.  Not all forms and methods of payment are available in every country.  Except as restricted by applicable law, payment of the Option Price may be delayed in the discretion of the Committee to accommodate proceeds of sale of some or all of the shares to which this grant relates.
Method of Exercise and Payment for Shares
.
 
If at exercise, Participant is not in compliance with the Companys minimum stock ownership guidelines then in effect for Participants job grade or classification, if any, Participant will not be entitled to exercise the Option using a cashless exercise program of the Company (if then in effect), unless the net proceeds received by Participant from that exercise consist only of Shares and Participant agrees to hold all those Shares for at least one (1) year.

(d)    Except as provided in Subsections (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) below, or Section 3, the Option will expire and will not be exercisable after termination of Participants employment with the Company or a Subsidiary.
Termination of Employment
.
 
(i)     .  Except as provided in Sections 3 or 4 below, if the termination of Participants employment results from the Companys elimination of the position held by Participant, then Participant will continue to have the right to exercise the Option with respect to that portion of the Number of Shares for which the Option was vested and exercisable on the date of Participants termination of employment and the remaining portion shall be forfeited and cancelled.  Except as provided in Subsection 2(d)(iv)(A) below, the right to exercise the vested portion of the Option will continue until the earlier of the last day of the one-year period commencing on the date of termination of employment, or the Expiration Date.
Elimination of Position
 
(ii)    .  Except as provided in Sections 3or 4 below, if the termination of Participants employment results from Participants Retirement (as such term is defined in the Plan), Participant will continue to vest in the Option in accordance with the original vesting schedule in Section 2(b) above as if Participant had remained actively employed; provided, that upon Participants death, all vesting will cease and the Option will be exercisable with respect to that portion of the Number of Shares for which the Option is vested and exercisable on the date of Participants death and the remaining portion shall be forfeited and cancelled.
Retirement
 
 
Participant will continue to have the right to exercise the Option with respect to that portion of the Number of Shares for which the Option is vested and exercisable from time to time until the earlier of the last day of the sixty (60) month period following Participants Retirement, or the Expiration Date.
 
(iii)   .  Except as provided in Sections 3 or 4 below, if the termination of Participants employment results from Participants Disability (as such term is defined in the Plan), then Participant will continue to have the right to exercise the Option with respect to that portion of the Number of Shares for which the Option was vested and exercisable on the last date of Participants active employment and the remaining portion shall be forfeited and cancelled. Except as provided in Section 2(d)(iv)(A) below, the right to exercise the vested portion of the Option will continue until the earlier of the last day of the sixty (60) month period following the last date of Participants active employment or the Expiration Date.
Disability
 
(iv)  
Death.
 
(A)        Except as provided in Sections 3 or 4 below, if the termination of Participants employment results from Participants death, then Participants estate, or the person(s) to whom Participants rights under this Agreement pass by will or the laws of descent and distribution, will have the right to exercise the Option with respect to that portion of the Number of Shares for which the Option was vested and exercisable on the date of Participants death and the remaining portion shall be forfeited and cancelled.  The right to exercise the vested portion of the Option will continue until the earlier of the last day of the sixty (60) month period following Participants death or the Expiration Date.
 
(B)        If Participant dies following termination of employment and prior to the expiration of any remaining period during which the Option may be exercised in accordance with Subsections (i), (ii) or (iii) above, or Section 3, the remaining period during which the Option will be exercisable (by Participants estate, or the person(s) to whom Participants rights under this Agreement pass by will or the laws of descent and distribution) will be the greater of (a) the remaining period under the applicable section or paragraph referred to above, or (b) six (6) months from the date of death; provided that under no circumstances will the Option be exercisable after the Expiration Date.
 
3.        If a Change of Control of the Company occurs while Participant is employed by the Company or a Subsidiary, then the entire Number of Shares represented by the Option which have not yet been exercised will become immediately vested and exercisable (the Unexercised Portion).  The Committee, in its discretion, may terminate the Option upon a Change of Control; provided, however, that at least 30 days prior to the Change of Control, the Committee notifies the Participant that the Option will be terminated and provides the Participant, at the election of the Committee, either (i) a cash payment equal to the difference between the Fair Market Value of the vested Options (including Options that would become vested upon the Change in Control as provided above) and the Exercise Price for such Options, computed as of the date of the Change of Control and to be paid no later than three (3) business days after the Change of Control, or (ii) the right to exercise all vested Options (including Options that would become vested upon the Change of Control as provided above) immediately prior to the Change of Control. If the Unexercised Portion of the Options continue to remain outstanding after the Change of Control and if Participants employment with the Company or a Subsidiary terminates after the date on which the Change of Control occurs other than as a result of a termination by the Company or a Subsidiary for Cause, then Participant (or, if applicable, Participants estate or the person(s) to whom Participants rights under this Agreement pass by will or the laws of descent and distribution) will have the right to exercise the Unexercised Portion.  Except as provided in Section 2(d)(iv)(B) above or Section 4 below, that right may be exercised until the earlier of the last day of the sixty (60) month period following the termination of Participants employment or the Expiration Date.

Cancellation and Rescission of Option
.
 
(a)  If, at any time, (i) during Participants employment with the Company or a Subsidiary or (ii) during the period after Participants termination of employment with the Company or any Subsidiary for any reason during which all or part of the Option remains exercisable, but not to exceed 24 months following Participants termination of employment, Participant engages in any Detrimental Activity (as defined in subsection (b) below), the Committee may, notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, cancel, rescind, suspend, withhold or otherwise restrict or limit this Option as of the first date Participant engaged in the Detrimental Activity, as determined by the Committee.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Committee may also require Participant to pay to the Company any gain realized by Participant from exercising all or any portion of the Option hereunder during the period beginning six (6) months prior to the date on which Participant engaged or began engaging in Detrimental Activity.
 
(b)  For purposes of this Agreement, Detrimental Activity shall mean and include any of the following:
 
(i)     the breach or violation of any other agreement between Participant and the Company relating to protection of Confidential Information or Trade Secrets, solicitation of employees, customers or suppliers, or  refraining from competition with the Company;
 
(ii)    the disclosure, reproduction or use of Confidential Information or Trade Secrets (each as defined below) for the benefit of Participant or third parties except in connection with the performance of Participants duties for the Company or, after advance notice to the Company, as required by a valid order or subpoena issued by a court or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction;
 
(iii)   the use, reproduction, disclosure or distribution of any information which the Company is required to hold confidential under applicable federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C.  1681 et seq.) and any state credit reporting statutes;
 
(iv)  the making, or causing or attempting to cause any other person to make, any statement, either written or oral, or conveying any information about the Company which is disparaging or which in any way reflects negatively upon the Company;
 
(v)   the solicitation or attempt to solicit any customer or actively targeted potential customer of the Company with whom the Participant had material contact on the Companys behalf during the 12 months immediately preceding Participants termination of employment;
 
(vi)  the solicitation or recruitment, attempt to solicit or recruit, or the assistance of others in soliciting or recruiting, any individual who is or was, within 6 months of the date in question, an employee of the Company unless such former employee was terminated by the Company without cause, or the inducement of (or attempt to induce) any such employee of the Company to terminate his employment with the Company; or
 
(vii) the refusal or failure of Participant to provide, upon the request of the Company, a certification, in a form satisfactory to the Company, that he or she is in full compliance with the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Agreement, including, without limitation, a certification that Participant is not engaging in Detrimental Activity.

(c)   means information, including, but not limited to, technical or non-technical data, a formula, a pattern, a compilation, a program, a device, a method, a technique, a drawing, a process, financial data, financial plans, product plans, or a list of actual or potential Company customers or suppliers which (i) derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, and (ii) is the subject of the Companys efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain secrecy; or as otherwise defined by applicable state law.

5.     If Participant's employment with the Company or a Subsidiary is terminated for Cause, the Committee may, notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, cancel, rescind, suspend, withhold or otherwise restrict or limit this Award as of the date of termination for Cause. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Committee may also require Participant to pay to the Company any gain realized by Participant from the Shares subject to the Award during the period beginning six months prior to the date on which Participant engaged or began engaging in conduct that led to his or her termination for Cause. For purposes of this Agreement, termination for Cause means termination as a result of (a) the willful and continued failure by Participant to substantially perform his or her duties with the Company or any Subsidiary (other than a failure resulting from Participants incapacity due to physical or mental illness), after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to Participant by his or her superior officer which specifically identifies the manner the officer believes that Participant has not substantially performed his or her duties, or (b) Participants willful misconduct which materially injures the Company, monetarily or otherwise.  For purposes of this Section, Participants act, or failure to act, will not be considered willful unless the act or failure to act is not in good faith and without reasonable belief that his or her action or omission was in the best interest of the Company.
Termination for Cause
.
 
 6.    Subject to any valid deferral election, the rights and privileges conferred under this Award may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated by operation of law or otherwise (except as permitted by the Plan).  Any attempt to do so contrary to the provisions hereof shall be null and void.  Upon Participants death, the Option may be transferred by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, in which case all of Participants remaining rights under this Agreement must be transferred undivided to the same person or persons.  During Participants lifetime, only Participant (or Participants legal representative if Participant is incompetent) may exercise the Option.
Non-Transferability of Award
.
 
7.     The Shares deliverable to the Participant upon the exercise of the Option hereunder may be either previously authorized but unissued Shares or issued Shares which have been reacquired by the Company.  The Company shall not be required to honor the exercise of the Option or issue any certificate or certificates for Shares prior to fulfillment of all of the following conditions: (a) the admission of such Shares to listing on all stock exchanges on which such class of stock is then listed; (b) the completion of any registration or other qualification of such Shares under any state or federal law or under the rulings and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other governmental regulatory body, which the Committee shall, in its discretion, deem necessary or advisable; (c) the obtaining of any approval or other clearance from any state or federal governmental agency, which the Committee shall, in its discretion, determine to be necessary or advisable; and (d) the lapse of such reasonable period of time following the grant of the Shares as the Committee may establish from time to time for reasons of administrative convenience.
Conditions to Exercise of Award and Issuance of Shares
.
 
8.     Except as provided in Sections 3 or 11, the Participant shall not have voting, dividend or any other rights as a shareholder of the Company with respect to the unexercised Option.  Upon exercise of a vested Award into Shares, the Participant will obtain full voting and other rights as a shareholder of the Company with respect to such Shares.

Rights as Shareholder

9.     The Committee shall have the power to interpret the Plan and this Agreement and to adopt such rules for the administration, interpretation, and application of the Plan as are consistent therewith and to interpret or revoke any such rules.  All actions taken and all interpretations and determinations made by the Committee shall be final and binding upon the Participant, the Company, and all other interested persons.  No member of the Committee shall be personally liable for any action, determination, or interpretation made in good faith with respect to the Plan or this Agreement.

10.   Fractional shares will not be issued, and when any provision of this Award Agreement otherwise would entitle Participant to receive a fractional share, that fraction will be disregarded.
 
Fractional Shares
.
 
11.   In the event of a change in corporate capitalization as described in Section 18 of the Plan, the Committee shall make appropriate adjustments to the number and class of Shares or other stock or securities subject to the Option and to the purchase price for such Shares or other stock or securities.  The Committees adjustments shall be effective and final, binding and conclusive for all purposes of this Agreement.
 
Adjustments in Capital Structure
.
 
12.   Regardless of any action the Company or a Subsidiary (the Employer) takes with respect to any or all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related withholding (Tax-Related Items), Participant acknowledges and agrees that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by him or her is and remains Participants responsibility and that the Company and/or the Employer (i) make no representations nor undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of this Option, including the grant, vesting or exercise of this Option, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such exercise and receipt of any dividends; and (ii) do not commit to structure the terms or the grant or any aspect of this Option to reduce or eliminate Participants liability for Tax-Related Items.  Prior to the exercise of this Option, Participant shall pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and or the Employer to withhold all applicable Tax-Related Items legally payable from Participants wages or other cash compensation paid to Participant by the Company and or the Employer or from proceeds of the sale of Shares.  Alternatively, or in addition, if permissible under local law, the Company may (1) sell or arrange for sale of Shares that Participant acquires to meet the required withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items, and or (2) withhold in Shares, provided that the Company only withholds the amount of Shares necessary to satisfy the required minimum withholding amount.  In addition, Participant shall pay the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold as a result of Participants participation in the Plan or Participants purchase of Shares that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described.  The Company may refuse to honor the exercise and refuse to deliver the Shares if Participant fails to comply with Participants obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.

13.    By accepting the grant of this Option, Participant acknowledges and agrees that: (i) the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature and may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time unless otherwise provided in the Plan or this Agreement; (ii) the grant of this Option is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of stock options, or benefits in lieu of stock options, even if stock options have been granted repeatedly in the past; (iii) all decisions with respect to future grants, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company; (iv) the Participants participation in the Plan shall not create a right of further employment with the Company and shall not interfere with the ability of the Company to terminate Participants employment relationship at any time with or without cause and it is expressly agreed and understood that employment is terminable at the will of either party, insofar as permitted by law; (v) Participant is participating voluntarily in the Plan; (vi) this Option is an extraordinary item that is outside the scope of Participants employment contract, if any; (vii) this Option is not part of normal or expected compensation or salary for any purposes, including but not limited to calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments insofar as permitted by law; (viii) in the event Participant is not an employee of the Company, this Option award will not be interpreted to form an employment contract or relationship with the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate; (ix) the future value of the underlying Shares is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty; (x) if the underlying Shares do not increase in value, this Option will have no value; (xi) if Participant exercises this Option and obtains Shares, the value of those Shares acquired upon exercise may increase or decrease in value, even below the Option Price; (xii) in consideration of the grant of this Option, no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from termination of this Option or diminution in value of this Option or Shares purchased through exercise of this Option resulting from termination of Participants employment by the Company or the Employer (for any reason whatsoever and whether or not in breach of local labor laws) and Participant irrevocably releases the Company and the Employer from any such claim that may arise; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen, then, by accepting the terms of this Agreement, Participant shall be deemed irrevocably to have waived any entitlement to pursue such claim; and (xiii)  except as otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, in the event of involuntary termination of employment (whether or not in breach of local labor laws), Participants right to receive stock options and vest in stock options under the Plan, if any, will terminate effective as of the date that Participant is no longer actively employed and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law; furthermore, in the event of involuntary termination of employment (whether or not in breach of local labor laws), Participants right to exercise this Option after termination of employment, if any, will be measured by the date of termination of Participants active employment and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law; the Committee shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when Participant is no longer actively employed for purposes of this Option.

APPENDIX A
Application
The following policy on recovery of incentive payments is adopted by the Compensation, Human Resources & Management Succession Committee of the Board of Directors (Committee) of Equifax Inc. (Company) effective February 4, 2010, for Incentive Compensation awarded or paid for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2009.
The Committee may, in its sole discretion, in appropriate circumstances and to the extent permitted by governing law, direct the Company to require recovery of all or a portion of any Incentive Compensation awarded or paid to any Employee where:
 
 
The Committee in its discretion also may direct the Company to seek to recover the excess amount of any Incentive Compensation awarded or paid to a Covered Officer for a fiscal period if the result of a performance measure upon which the award was based or paid is subsequently restated or otherwise adjusted in a manner that would reduce the size of the award or payment, regardless of whether the Covered Officer committed any misconduct.  Where the result of a performance measure was considered in determining the compensation awarded or paid, but the Incentive Compensation is not awarded or paid on a formulaic basis, the Committee will determine in its discretion the amount, if any, by which the payment or award should be reduced.
Amount to be Recovered
In each such instance, the Company will, to the extent practicable, seek to recover from the individual Covered Officer the amount by which the individuals Incentive Compensation for the relevant periods exceeded the lower payment that would have been made based on the restated financial results.  In addition, if an Employee engaged in Misconduct that contributed to award or payment of Incentive Compensation to him or her that is greater than would have been paid or awarded in the absence of Misconduct, the Company may take other remedial and recovery action, as determined by the Committee in its discretion, including recovery of all or part of the Incentive Compensation.  
The Company shall notify an Employee within 12 months after the date of any financial restatement of its intent to recover amounts under this policy.
Methods for Recovery
The Committee shall determine whether the Company shall effect any such recovery: (i) by seeking repayment from the Employee; (ii) by reducing (subject to applicable law and the terms and conditions of the applicable plan, program or arrangement) the amount that would otherwise be payable to the Employee under any compensatory plan, program, or arrangement maintained by the Company; (iii) by withholding payment of future increases in compensation (including the payment of any discretionary bonus amount) or grants of compensatory awards that would otherwise have been made in accordance with the Companys otherwise applicable compensation practices; or (iv) by any combination of the foregoing.
 
This policy shall be in addition to any other equitable or legal remedy that may be taken by the Company with respect to the subject matter of this policy.

In addition, Participant shall pay the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold as a result of Participants participation in the Plan or Participants purchase of Shares that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described.
