Effective February 10, 2012, the Compensation, Human Resources and Management Succession Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors of Equifax Inc. (the Company) granted Performance Share awards (the Performance Shares) and time-vested restricted stock unit awards (RSUs) under the Companys 2008 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the 2008 Plan), to certain executive employees, including the following named executive officers (NEOs) in the amounts indicated below:
 
 
The Committee determined that the Companys long-term incentive program should be changed to more closely align equity awards with the Companys total shareholder return ) performance (stock price appreciation plus reinvested dividends) relative to the TSR of the companies included in the S&P 500 stock index as constituted on the initial grant date of the Performance Shares (subject to certain adjustments, the comparator group), measured cumulatively over a three-year period with final payout determined by the Committee based on the Companys average cumulative TSR percentile ranking over the last four quarters of this period. The companies included in the S&P 500 stock index were selected because the Company views the other companies in the S&P 500 stock index as the principal competition for our shareholders investment dollars.
(TSR
 
Beginning in 2012, the Companys named executive officers (the NEOs) and other eligible senior executives will receive one-half or more of their target long-term incentive award in the form of Performance Shares and the remainder in the form of RSUs cliff vesting three years from the grant date. The Performance Shares will be earned and pay out in shares of our common stock, if at all, based on the Companys TSR performance compared to the comparator group over a three-year period. The payout will be computed based on the Companys average cumulative percentile ranking over the last four quarters of the three-year performance period. Payout of these awards will range from zero to 200% of the target number of shares awarded to each NEO, with 200% earned if the Companys TSR performance is at or above the 90 percentile of the comparator group; 150% earned at the 70 percentile; 100% earned at the 50 percentile; 50% earned at the 30 percentile; and 0% below the 30 percentile, with straight-line interpolation between percentile points.

[Name of Participant]
 
Target Number of Shares Subject to Award: [Number of Shares]
 
Date of Grant: [Grant Date]
 
Pursuant to the Equifax Inc. 2008 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the Plan), Equifax Inc., a Georgia corporation (the Company), has granted the above-named participant (Participant) Performance Shares (the Award) entitling Participant to earn such number of shares of Company common stock (the Shares) as set forth above on the terms and conditions set forth in this agreement (this Agreement) and the Plan. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Plan.
 
The Award is granted to Participant on the Grant Date set forth above and represents the right to receive one Share for each Share subject to the Award earned by satisfaction of the performance measures and goals set forth in Sections 2 and 3 of this Agreement. Depending on the Companys 3-year relative TSR performance as set forth in Section 3, the Participant may earn zero percent (0%) to two hundred percent (200%) of the Shares awarded.
Grant Date.
 
2.   
.
Vesting
 
(a)   Subject to earlier vesting in accordance with Sections 4 or 5 below, the Shares will become vested on the later of the third anniversary of the grant date or the date on which the Committee certifies goal attainment (the Vesting Date) in accordance with the vesting provisions of subsections (b) and (c) below and payout provisions pursuant to Section 3 below. Prior to the Vesting Date, the Shares subject to the Award shall be nontransferable and, except as otherwise provided herein, shall be immediately forfeited upon Participants termination of employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries. Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee reserves the right in its sole discretion to waive or reduce the vesting requirements.
 
(b)   In no event shall the number of Shares which vest on the Vesting Date exceed the number of Shares subject to the Award or the individual limits for Participants as set forth in the Plan. The payout of vested Shares may be reduced, but not increased, based on the degree of attainment of such performance criteria as determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion. To the extent unvested Shares are not paid to Participant pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, then such unvested Shares shall be immediately forfeited.
 
(c)   The Shares subject to the Award are intended to be qualified performance-based compensation within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended and the regulations thereunder (the Code). The maximum number of Shares that may vest and be paid out on the Vesting Date pursuant to Section 4 of this Agreement shall be limited to a fair market value on the Vesting Date not to exceed the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
(a) The Performance Period for this Award begins on January 1, 2012 and ends on December 31, 2014. The percentage of the Award earned and paid will be as certified by the Committee as soon as practicable following the end of the Performance Period based on the percentile ranking of the Companys three-year cumulative average quarterly TSR compared to the three-year cumulative average quarterly TSR performance of the S&P 500, subject to adjustment. The Maximum Award percentage may be decreased but may not be increased by the Committee. The goals by which performance will be measured for payout of the Shares awarded are as follows:
 
Performance Share Payout Table
 
 
(b) . The number of Shares payable is the Target Award multiplied by the average of the Companys cumulative TSR positioning for each of the last four quarters of the Performance Period. For a hypothetical illustration of this calculation, see Example A below. For performance levels falling between the values as shown above, the percentage of performance Shares payable will be determined by interpolation. Payments will be made in Shares.

Hypothetical Example: 2008-2010 Performance Cycle
 
 
 
(c)   . The fair market value of Shares on the Vesting Date will be used by the Committee to determine the basis of the Shares earned and payable.
Value of the Shares Issued as Payment for Shares Earned
 
(d)   . As provided in Section 16 below, the Company shall withhold Shares having a Fair Market Value on the date the tax is to be determined equal to the minimum statutory amount for federal, state, local, and unemployment taxes (Total Tax) which could be withheld on the transaction, with respect to any taxable event arising as a result of this Agreement.
Withholding
 
(e)   . Payout of the Award will be made to Participant as soon as practicable following the Vesting Date and written certification of performance by the Committee, but in no event later than March 15 of the calendar year after the Performance Period (as defined in Section 3(a)), ends.

(b)   . Except as the Committee may at any time otherwise provide or as required to comply with applicable law, if Participants employment is terminated by reason of his or her Disability (as such term is defined in the Plan) prior to the Vesting Date, for purposes of determining the payment Participant is entitled to receive under this Award, Participant shall be treated as continuing to be employed through the Vesting Date and payout of Shares under the Award shall be at target (100%), as soon as practicable after Participants termination of employment due to Disability.

(c)   .

 means information, including, but not limited to, technical or non-technical data, a formula, a pattern, a compilation, a program, a device, a method, a technique, a drawing, a process, financial data, financial plans, product plans, or a list of actual or potential Company customers or suppliers which (i) derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, and (ii) is the subject of the Companys efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain secrecy; or as otherwise defined by applicable state law.

For purposes of this Section, Participants act, or failure to act, will not be considered willful unless the act or failure to act is not in good faith and without reasonable belief that his or her action or omission was in the best interest of the Company.

In addition, Participant shall pay the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold as a result of Participants participation in the Plan or Participants purchase of Shares that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described.

APPENDIX A
 
POLICY ON RECOVERY OF INCENTIVE PAYMENTS
 
Application
 
The following policy on recovery of incentive payments is adopted by the Compensation, Human Resources & Management Succession Committee of the Board of Directors (Committee) of Equifax Inc. (Company) effective February 4, 2010, for Incentive Compensation awarded or paid for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2009.
 
The Committee may, in its sole discretion, in appropriate circumstances and to the extent permitted by governing law, direct the Company to require recovery of all or a portion of any Incentive Compensation awarded or paid to any Employee where:
 
 
 
.
The Committee in its discretion also may direct the Company to seek to recover the excess amount of any Incentive Compensation awarded or paid to a Covered Officer for a fiscal period if the result of a performance measure upon which the award was based or paid is subsequently restated or otherwise adjusted in a manner that would reduce the size of the award or payment, regardless of whether the Covered Officer committed any Misconduct. Where the result of a performance measure was considered in determining the compensation awarded or paid, but the Incentive Compensation is not awarded or paid on a formulaic basis, the Committee will determine in its discretion the amount, if any, by which the payment or award should be reduced.
 
 
Amount to be Recovered
 
In each such instance, the Company will, to the extent practicable, seek to recover from the individual Covered Officer the amount by which the individuals Incentive Compensation for the relevant periods exceeded the lower payment that would have been made based on the restated financial results. In addition, if an Employee engaged in Misconduct that contributed to award or payment of Incentive Compensation to him or her that is greater than would have been paid or awarded in the absence of Misconduct, the Company may take other remedial and recovery action, as determined by the Committee in its discretion, including recovery of all or part of the Incentive Compensation. The Company shall notify an Employee within 12 months after the date of any financial restatement of its intent to recover amounts under this policy.
 
Methods for Recovery
 
The Committee shall determine whether the Company shall effect any such recovery: (i) by seeking repayment from the Employee; (ii) by reducing (subject to applicable law and the terms and conditions of the applicable plan, program or arrangement) the amount that would otherwise be payable to the Employee under any compensatory plan, program, or arrangement maintained by the Company; (iii) by withholding payment of future increases in compensation (including the payment of any discretionary bonus amount) or grants of compensatory awards that would otherwise have been made in accordance with the Companys otherwise applicable compensation practices; or (iv) by any combination of the foregoing. This policy shall be in addition to any other equitable or legal remedy that may be taken by the Company with respect to the subject matter of this policy.

APPENDIX A
 
POLICY ON RECOVERY OF INCENTIVE PAYMENTS
 
Application
 
The following policy on recovery of incentive payments is adopted by the Compensation, Human Resources & Management Succession Committee of the Board of Directors (Committee) of Equifax Inc. (Company) effective February 4, 2010, for Incentive Compensation awarded or paid for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2009.  
 
The Committee may, in its sole discretion, in appropriate circumstances and to the extent permitted by governing law, direct the Company to require recovery of all or a portion of any Incentive Compensation awarded or paid to any Employee where:
 
.
The Committee in its discretion also may direct the Company to seek to recover the excess amount of any Incentive Compensation awarded or paid to a Covered Officer for a fiscal period if the result of a performance measure upon which the award was based or paid is subsequently restated or otherwise adjusted in a manner that would reduce the size of the award or payment, regardless of whether the Covered Officer committed any Misconduct.  Where the result of a performance measure was considered in determining the compensation awarded or paid, but the Incentive Compensation is not awarded or paid on a formulaic basis, the Committee will determine in its discretion the amount, if any, by which the payment or award should be reduced.   
 
 
Amount to be Recovered
 
In each such instance, the Company will, to the extent practicable, seek to recover from the individual Covered Officer the amount by which the individuals Incentive Compensation for the relevant periods exceeded the lower payment that would have been made based on the restated financial results.  In addition, if an Employee engaged in Misconduct that contributed to award or payment of Incentive Compensation to him or her that is greater than would have been paid or awarded in the absence of Misconduct, the Company may take other remedial and recovery action, as determined by the Committee in its discretion, including recovery of all or part of the Incentive Compensation.  The Company shall notify an Employee within 12 months after the date of any financial restatement of its intent to recover amounts under this policy.
 
Methods for Recovery
 
The Committee shall determine whether the Company shall effect any such recovery: (i) by seeking repayment from the Employee; (ii) by reducing (subject to applicable law and the terms and conditions of the applicable plan, program or arrangement) the amount that would otherwise be payable to the Employee under any compensatory plan, program, or arrangement maintained by the Company; (iii) by withholding payment of future increases in compensation (including the payment of any discretionary bonus amount) or grants of compensatory awards that would otherwise have been made in accordance with the Companys otherwise applicable compensation practices; or (iv) by any combination of the foregoing.  This policy shall be in addition to any other equitable or legal remedy that may be taken by the Company with respect to the subject matter of this policy.

6.   If Participant's employment with the Company or a Subsidiary is terminated for Cause, the Committee may, notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, cancel, rescind, suspend, withhold or otherwise restrict or limit this Award as of the date of termination for Cause.

Alternatively, or in addition, if permissible under local law, the Company may (1) sell or arrange for sale of Shares that Participant acquires to meet the required withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items, and/or (2) satisfy such obligations in Shares, provided that the Company only withholds the amount of Shares necessary to withhold the required minimum withholding amount.  In addition, Participant shall pay the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold as a result of Participants participation in the Plan or Participants purchase of Shares that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described.  The Company may refuse to honor the exercise and refuse to deliver the Shares if Participant fails to comply with Participants obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.

APPENDIX A
 
POLICY ON RECOVERY OF INCENTIVE PAYMENTS
 
Application
 
The following policy on recovery of incentive payments is adopted by the Compensation, Human Resources & Management Succession Committee of the Board of Directors (Committee) of Equifax Inc. (Company) effective February 4, 2010, for Incentive Compensation awarded or paid for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2009.  
 
The Committee may, in its sole discretion, in appropriate circumstances and to the extent permitted by governing law, direct the Company to require recovery of all or a portion of any Incentive Compensation awarded or paid to any Employee where:
 
.
The Committee in its discretion also may direct the Company to seek to recover the excess amount of any Incentive Compensation awarded or paid to a Covered Officer for a fiscal period if the result of a performance measure upon which the award was based or paid is subsequently restated or otherwise adjusted in a manner that would reduce the size of the award or payment, regardless of whether the Covered Officer committed any Misconduct.  Where the result of a performance measure was considered in determining the compensation awarded or paid, but the Incentive Compensation is not awarded or paid on a formulaic basis, the Committee will determine in its discretion the amount, if any, by which the payment or award should be reduced.   
 
 
Amount to be Recovered
 
In each such instance, the Company will, to the extent practicable, seek to recover from the individual Covered Officer the amount by which the individuals Incentive Compensation for the relevant periods exceeded the lower payment that would have been made based on the restated financial results.  In addition, if an Employee engaged in Misconduct that contributed to award or payment of Incentive Compensation to him or her that is greater than would have been paid or awarded in the absence of Misconduct, the Company may take other remedial and recovery action, as determined by the Committee in its discretion, including recovery of all or part of the Incentive Compensation.  The Company shall notify an Employee within 12 months after the date of any financial restatement of its intent to recover amounts under this policy.
 
Methods for Recovery
 
The Committee shall determine whether the Company shall effect any such recovery: (i) by seeking repayment from the Employee; (ii) by reducing (subject to applicable law and the terms and conditions of the applicable plan, program or arrangement) the amount that would otherwise be payable to the Employee under any compensatory plan, program, or arrangement maintained by the Company; (iii) by withholding payment of future increases in compensation (including the payment of any discretionary bonus amount) or grants of compensatory awards that would otherwise have been made in accordance with the Companys otherwise applicable compensation practices; or (iv) by any combination of the foregoing.  This policy shall be in addition to any other equitable or legal remedy that may be taken by the Company with respect to the subject matter of this policy.
