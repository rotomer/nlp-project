Equifax Reports Record Quarterly Revenue of $523 Million, up 11% and up 16% on a Constant Dollar Basis Excluding Brazil
 
 Equifax Inc. (NYSE: EFX) today announced financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2012. The company reported revenue of $522.7 million in the first quarter of 2012, an 11 percent increase from the first quarter of 2011. On a non-GAAP basis, first quarter revenue was up 15 percent in U.S. dollars and 16 percent in local currency, excluding Brazilian operating results due to the deconsolidation of Brazil in the second quarter of 2011.
ATLANTA, April 25, 2012

Notes to Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to the Comparable GAAP
 
Financial Measures
 
- We calculate these financial measures by excluding acquisition-related amortization expense from the determination of net income attributable to Equifax in the calculation of diluted EPS. These financial measures are not prepared in conformity with GAAP. Management believes
Diluted EPS and net income attributable to Equifax, adjusted for acquisition-related amortization expense
that these measures are useful because management excludes acquisition-related amortization expense and other items that are not comparable when measuring operating profitability, evaluating performance trends, and setting performance objectives, and it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis by excluding items that relate to acquisition-related intangible assets and items that impact comparability.
 
- Management believes excluding the Brazilian revenue from the calculation of operating revenue, on a non-GAAP basis, is
Adjusted operating revenue, excluding the results of our Brazilian operations
useful because it allows investors to evaluate the Companys growth on a basis consistent with the current composition of our business.
