Items 1 through 4 and 6 through 9 are not included because they are inapplicable.Exelon Generation notified Edison International's subsidiary, Midwest Generation, on July 1, 2002, of ExelonGeneration's exercise of its option to purchase 1,265 megawatts, or MW, of capacity and energy during 2003 (of apossible total of 3,949 MW subject to option) from Midwest Generation's coal-fired generation units in Illinoisin accordance with the terms of the existing power purchase agreement related to these units.  As a result, 2,684MW of the capacity of these units will no longer be subject to the power purchase agreement after January 1,2003.  Midwest Generation will sell the energy and capacity from the released units through a combination ofbilateral agreements, forward sales and spot market sales.  The notification received from Exelon Generation hasno effect on its commitments to purchase capacity from these units for the balance of 2002.In a related action, Midwest Generation and Exelon Generation have agreed to amend the power purchase agreementrelated to Midwest Generation's Illinois peaker plants to reinstate within the terms of that agreement four ofthe oil peaker units at Midwest Generation's Fisk Station with a capacity of 160 MW which through the previousexercise of options by Exelon Generation had been released from the terms of that agreement.Midwest Generation is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Edison Mission Energy, which is a wholly-owned indirectsubsidiary of Edison International.  In December 1999, Midwest Generation completed a transaction withCommonwealth Edison, now a subsidiary of Exelon Corporation, to acquire from Commonwealth Edison its fossil-fuelgenerating plants located in Illinois.  In connection with the transaction, Midwest Generation entered into threepower purchase agreements with terms of up to five years expiring on December 31, 2004, pursuant to which ExelonGeneration (another subsidiary of Exelon Corporation and successor to Commonwealth Edison under these contracts)has the obligation to pay for and the right to purchase the capacity of and power generated by these plants.  Oneof these agreements relates to Midwest Generation's coal fired units, which for agreement purposes are dividedinto option units and committed units.  Under this agreement, Exelon Generation has the option, exercisable notlater than 180 days prior to January 1, 2003, to retain under the terms of the agreement for 2003 the capacity ofthe option units (3,949 MW), with any such capacity not retained being released after January 1, 2003, from theterms of the agreement.  Exelon Generation has a similar option, exercisable not later than 180 days prior toJanuary 1, 2004, to retain or release for 2004 all or a portion of the option units retained for 2003 (1,265MW).  It remains committed to purchase 1,696 MW of capacity from the committed units for 2003 and 2004.The following table lists the coal-fired units from which Exelon Generation is committed to purchase capacitythrough 2004, the units for which Exelon Generation has exercised its call option for 2003, and the units which,as of January 1, 2003, will be released from the terms of thePage 2

COAL-FIRED UNITS

Edison Mission Energy's subsidiary Edison Mission Marketing & Trading currently markets the electric powergenerated by Edison Mission Energy's 1,884 MW facility in Homer City, Pennsylvania under bilateral contracts orto the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Power Pool (PJM) or the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO).  Inanticipation of the release of Illinois coal units from contract from January 2003, Edison Mission Marketing &Trading has commenced forward sales of energy from the released units for 2003. In connection with these efforts,Edison Mission Energy will continue to evaluate the marketing and trading potential of the released units.These units are located in the Mid-America Interconnected Network, which has transmission connections to the EastCentral Area Reliability Council and other regional markets.  Commonwealth Edison has recently announced itsintention to join PJM which will provide efficient transmission interconnections into these markets as well.Among the factors that will influence the price of power and volume of sales Midwest Generation will realize fromthe released units are:o     prevailing market prices for fuel oil, coal and natural gas and associated transportation costs;o     the extent of additional supplies of capacity, energy and ancillary services from current competitors or      new market entrants, including the development of new facilities;o     transmission congestion in and to each market area;o     the market structure rules for each market area;o     the availability, reliability and operation of nuclear generating plants;o     weather conditions prevailing in surrounding areas from time to time;o     the rate of growth in electricity usage as a result of factors such as regional economic conditions and      the implementation of  conservation programs.The following table lists the forward month-end market prices for energy per megawatt hour for the calendar 2003and calendar 2004 "strips" as publicly quoted for sales "Into ComEd" and "Into Cinergy" during the first sixmonths of 2002.  As indicated above, these forward prices will continue to fluctuate as a result of a number offactors, including gas prices, electricity demand, which is also affected by economic growth, and the amount ofexisting and planned power plant capacity.  The actual spot prices for electricity delivered into these marketsmay vary materially from the forward market prices.Page 4

The costs of production of the released units vary and, accordingly,depending on market conditions, the amount of generation that will be sold from the released units is expected tovary from unit to unit.Additional information about market risk exposures of Edison Mission Energy is contained in the "Management'sDiscussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition - Market Risk Exposures - EME Issues"that is incorporated by reference into Part II, Item 7 of Edison International's Annual Report on Form 10-K forthe year ended 2001.It should be noted that the events referred to in this filing relate to Midwest Generation's coal-fired units inIllinois.    By October 2nd of this year, Exelon Generation must notify Midwest Generation if they intend torelease any of the units under the peaker or Collins Station power purchase agreements.Page 5
