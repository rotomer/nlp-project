Items 1 through 4, 6, 8, and 9 are not included because they are inapplicable.Item 5.  Other EventsOn September 23, 2002, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued an opinion and order onthe appeal from a federal district court's stipulated judgment approving the settlement agreement betweenSouthern California Edison Company ("SCE") and the California Public Utilities Commission ("CPUC").  SCE is thepublic utility subsidiary of Edison International.  The opinion and order affirmed the stipulated judgment of thedistrict court in part and referred questions based on California state law to the Supreme Court of California.Background.  In November 2000, SCE filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Central Districtof California against the commissioners of the CPUC, alleging that their refusal to allow SCE to recover itswholesale costs of purchasing power in its retail rates violated federal law.  The CPUC and SCE negotiated asettlement agreement to resolve the litigation, and the district court entered a stipulated judgment on October5, 2001, incorporating the settlement agreement.  Several entities appealed the stipulated judgment, includingThe Utility Reform Network ("TURN"), a California consumer group that had been allowed to intervene in thelitigation as a permissive intervenor, and three other entities whose motions to intervene had been denied.In accordance with the settlement agreement, the CPUC has established a procurement-related obligations account,or PROACT, with an opening balance of about $3.6 billion, representing SCE's unrecovered power procurement costsas of September 1, 2001.  While the appeal of the district court's stipulated judgment has been pending, SCE andthe CPUC have continued to operate under the terms of the settlement agreement.  As of August 31, 2002, theremaining unrecovered balance in the PROACT was $1.1 billion.Opinion and Order.  In its September 23 opinion, the appeals court affirmed the district court on all claims,except for the challenges founded on California state law, which the appeals court referred to the CaliforniaSupreme Court.  Specifically, the appeals court affirmed the district court in the following respects:  (1) thedistrict did not err in denying the motions to intervene of the entities other than TURN; (2) the district courtdid not err in denying standing for the entities other than TURN to appeal the stipulated judgment; (3) thedistrict court was not deprived of original jurisdiction over the lawsuit; (4) the district court did not err indeclining to abstain from the case; (5) the district court did not exceed its authority by approving thestipulated judgment without TURN's consent; (6) the district court's approval of the settlement agreement did notdeny TURN due process; and (7) the district court did not violate the Tenth Amendment of the United StatesConstitution in approving the stipulated judgment.  In sum, the appeals court concluded that none of thesubstantive arguments based on federal statutory or constitutional law compelled reversal of the district court'sapproval of the stipulated judgment.The appeals court stated in its opinion, however, that there is a serious question of whether the settlementagreement violated state law, both in substance and in the procedure by which the CPUC agreed to it.  The appealscourt further stated that if the settlement agreement violatedPage 2state law, the CPUC lacked capacity to consent to the stipulated judgment, and the appeals court would berequired to vacate the stipulated judgment as void.  The appeals court said that, on a substantive level, thestipulated judgment appears to violate California's electric industry restructuring statute providing for a ratefreeze.  The appeals court said that, on a procedural level, the stipulated judgment appears to violateCalifornia laws requiring open meetings and public hearings.  Because federal courts are bound by thepronouncements of the state's highest court on applicable state law, and because the appeals court found nocontrolling precedents from California courts on the issues of state law in this case, the appeals court issued aseparate order certifying those issues to the California Supreme Court and requesting the California SupremeCourt to accept certification.The appeals court stayed further proceedings in the case pending a response from the California Supreme Court onthe request for certification.  The appeals court did not stay the continued operation of the settlementagreement.  SCE is evaluating the appeals court's opinion and order and determining what actions to take inresponse.  Possible actions include a petition for rehearing before an en banc panel of the appeals court or thefiling of briefs with the California Supreme Court.Neither EIX nor SCE can predict the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, or the impact that any outcome wouldhave on the stipulated judgment or the settlement agreement.Item 7.

SO. CAL. EDISON v. LYNCH           14661- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------fornia Edison Co. ("SoCal Edison"), an electric public utilitythat provides retail electric service in Southern California,against the Commissioners ("Commissioners") of the CaliforniaPublic Utilities Commission ("the Commission"), whichregulates the rates, practices and services of SoCal Edison andother California public utilities. We affirm the judgment ofthe district court in part and certify questions based on Californiastate law to the Supreme Court of California.                                       I   The origins of the present controversy began in 1996 withthe passage of Assembly Bill 1890 ("AB 1890"), which significantlyrestructured California's power industry. Act ofSeptember 23, 1996, 1996 Cal. Legis. Serv. 854, codified inCal. Pub. Util. Codess.ss.330-398.5. The idea animating AB1890 was that deregulation would foster competition in electricalgeneration, which would ultimately provide better serviceand reduce the price of electricity to consumers. Seegenerally Cal. Pub. Util. Codess.330.1 Under prior law, theCommission set the retail electricity rates charged by utilitiesproviding service in exclusive service territories. Id. atss.330(d). These regulated rates included reimbursement forthe cost of constructing power plants and contractual obligationsfor the provision of electrical service. Id. atss.330(q).The goal of AB 1890 was to create a deregulated market inwhich price would be established by competition and consumerscould select their electrical power supplier.   The legislature recognized that the transition from a regulatedenvironment to a competitive market had the potentialto leave the utilities with unrecoverable, or "stranded" costs.In general terms, stranded costs are those costs an electricalsupplier incurs in anticipation of serving customers that laterbecome unrecoverable because the supplier either cannot- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   1 The legislation is summarized in Cal. Power Exchange Corp. v. FERC(In re Cal. Power Exchange Corp.), 245 F.3d 1110, 1114-15 (2001).
14662                  SO. CAL. EDISON v. LYNCH- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------charge a rate that allows cost recovery or is unable to sell sufficientpower. This most typically occurs when there is a shiftin utility rate philosophy from a "cost plus rate of return"design to a market-driven rate. Ass'n of Pub. Agency Customers,Inc. v. Bonneville Power Admin., 126 F.3d 1158, 1180(9th Cir. 1997).   Of course, as we have observed, "the term `stranded costs'is something of a misnomer, for someone always pays forthem." Id. Under AB 1890, the Commission was charged withthe responsibility of calculating the amount of stranded costs.Cal. Pub. Util. Codess.367. The utilities were to recover theirallowed stranded costs through individual cost-recovery plansduring a transition period when rates were temporarily frozen,under the theory that the utilities would continue to make aprofit. Id. atss.368. During this transition period, the utilitieswere also to dismantle their vertically-integrated operationsby selling a large portion of their generation plants, and to sellthe output of their remaining generation capacity to a wholesaleclearinghouse known as the California Power ExchangeCorporation ("CalPx"). Cal. Power Exchange Corp., 245 F.3dat 1114-15. During the transition period, the utilities wererequired to purchase power from CalPx on behalf of retailcustomers who had not elected to purchase power elsewhere.Id. at 1115. The demise of vertical integration, which was regulatedby the state, subjected the utilities' purchases of wholesalepower to the jurisdiction of the Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission ("FERC"), which regulated CalPx asa public utility under the Federal Power Act. Id. at 1114.   In 2000, wholesale electricity prices skyrocketed, particularlyin the CalPx spot markets. SoCal Edison, which was stillsubject to the retail rate freeze designed to lock in profit,incurred enormous debt because it was unable to pass itswholesale power costs onto its customers. Id. at 1115. SoCalEdison alleges that it incurred obligations of over $6.5 billionfor wholesale electricity in excess of what it recovered inretail sales. A series of power emergencies ensued which
SO. CAL. EDISON v. LYNCH          14663- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------threatened the continuous provision of electricity in California.Id. at 1115-16. FERC responded in a series of regulatoryactions detailed in Cal. Power Exchange Corp. Id. at 1116-19.In 2001, the California legislature and the Commission tooka series of steps to alleviate the power crisis, the result ofwhich was to significantly alter the impact of AB 1890. However,SoCal Edison alleges that the legislation failed toimprove SoCal Edison's dire financial condition becauseSoCal Edison was precluded by a Commission decision fromrecovering costs incurred during the rate freeze period.   As a result, SoCal Edison filed the instant action for injunctiveand declaratory relief against the Commissioners. Amongother theories, SoCal Edison alleged that the refusal of theCommission to increase its retail rates as SoCal Edison'swholesale rates rose was preempted under the federal filedratedoctrine, which holds that a state is preempted from preventingthe recovery in retail rates of costs incurred pursuantto FERC tariffs.   After some preliminary decisions by the district court, TheUtility Reform Network ("TURN"), a non-profit organizationdevoted to protecting the interests of residential and smallcommercialconsumers of utility services, moved to intervene.The district court initially denied the motion, but eventuallygranted TURN permissive intervention. After further proceedings,the case was stayed by agreement of the Commissionand SoCal Edison so that the parties could attempt to resolvetheir disputes. A settlement was negotiated and presented tothe district court in the form of a stipulated judgment("Stipulated Judgment"). Under the terms of the StipulatedJudgment, existing rates were to remain in effect for a twoyearperiod to allow SoCal Edison to recover approximately$3.3 billion of its $6.3 billion loss during the prior rate-freezeperiod. TURN objected to the entry of the Stipulated Judgment.The district court allowed TURN one day to register itsobjections, and one day for SoCal Edison and the Commissionto respond. After reviewing the objections, the district
14664                     SO. CAL. EDISON v. LYNCH- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------court approved the Stipulated Judgment. TURN appeals theentry of the Stipulated Judgment. Three other parties whowere denied intervention appeal the district court's denial oftheir intervention motions.   We affirm the district court on all claims, except for thechallenges founded on California state law, which we certifyto the California Supreme Court.                                       II   The district court did not err in denying the motions tointervene filed by Reliant Energy Services ("Reliant"), MirantAmericas Energy Marketing ("Mirant"), and the CaliforniaManufacturers and Technology Association ("CMTA") (collectively,"Proposed Intervenors"). Reliant and Mirant arewholesale generators of electricity. The CMTA is a tradeassociation with approximately 800 manufacturing and technologycompanies owning and operating facilities in California.We review the district court's denial of intervention as ofright is reviewed de novo, Waller v. Fin. Corp. of Am., 828F.2d 579, 582 (9th Cir. 1987), except for district court's determinationof timeliness, a decision which we review for abuseof discretion. Cunningham v. David Special Commitment Ctr.,158 F.3d 1035, 1037 (9th Cir. 1998). We review the districtcourt's denial of permissive intervention for abuse of discretion.Venegas v. Skaggs, 867 F.2d 527, 529 (9th Cir. 1989).                                      A   The district court properly denied the Proposed Intervenors'motions to intervene as of right, pursuant to Rule 24(a),Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. An applicant for interventionin a pending federal action as a matter of right must satisfyfour requirements, namely that: "(1) it has a significantprotectable interest relating to the property or transaction thatis the subject of the action; (2) the disposition of the actionmay, as a practical matter, impair or impede the applicant's
SO. CAL. EDISON v. LYNCH           14665- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------ability to protect its interest; (3) the application is timely; and(4) the existing parties may not adequately represent theapplicant's interest." United States v. City of Los Angeles, 288F.3d 391, 397 (9th Cir. 2002) (quoting Donnelly v. Glickman,159 F.3d 405, 409 (9th Cir. 1998) (internal quotation marksomitted)).   The district court correctly denied the Proposed Intervenors'motions to intervene as of right because they did not satisfythe first requirement: that they have a significantprotectable interest relating to the property or transaction thatis the subject of the action. We recently discussed the analyticalframework for this requirement in City of Los Angeles,288 F.3d at 398:     "An applicant has a `significant protectable interest'     in an action if (1) it asserts an interest that is protected     under some law, and (2) there is a `relationship'     between its legally protected interest and the     plaintiff's claims." Donnelly, 159 F.3d at 409. The     relationship requirement is met "if the resolution of     the plaintiff's claims actually will affect the applicant."     Id. at 410. The "interest" test is not a clear-cut     or bright-line rule, because "[n]o specific legal or     equitable interest need be established." [Greene v.     United States, 996 F.2d 973, 976 (9th Cir. 1993).]     Instead, the "interest" test directs courts to make a     "practical, threshold inquiry," id., and "is primarily     a practical guide to disposing of lawsuits by involving     as many apparently concerned persons as is compatible     with efficiency and due process," County of     Fresno v. Andrus, 622 F.2d 436, 438 (9th Cir. 1980)     (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).   Reliant and Mirant argue that they have a significant protectableinterest in the litigation because SoCal Edison owesthem over $260 million arising out of their wholesale electricitytransactions which, allegedly due to the Commission's
14666                  SO. CAL. EDISON v. LYNCH- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------actions, SoCal Edison is unable to repay. The pending litigationwould not resolve those claims, and SoCal Edison is inprivity with the California Power Exchange Corporation, notwith Reliant or Mirant. Thus, Reliant and Mirant are claiminga right to intervene based on a contingent, unsecured claimagainst a third-party debtor. This falls far short of the "direct,non-contingent, substantial and legally protectable" interestrequired for intervention as a matter of right. Dilks v. AlohaAirlines, 642 F.2d 1155, 1157 (9th Cir. 1981) (citation omitted).   CMTA asserts that, as an association of more than 800companies in the manufacturing and high-technology sectors,its members are "an integral part of the California economy"who "purchase significant quantities of electricity from SoCalEdison." However, "an undifferentiated, generalized interestin the outcome of an ongoing action is too porous a foundationon which to premise intervention as of right." PublicServ. Co. of N.H. v. Patch, 136 F.3d 197, 205 (1st Cir. 1998);see also Westlands Water Dist. v. U.S., 700 F.2d 561, 563 (9thCir. 1983) (Environmental Defense Fund's interest in waterdistrict's water export rights is no different from interest of"substantial portion of the population of northern California"and is thus not "legally protectible" under Rule 24(a)). Thus,CMTA does not have the right to intervene in this case underfederal law.                                       B   The district court also did not err in denying Reliant,Mirant, and CMTA permissive intervention. "[A] court maygrant permissive intervention where the applicant for interventionshows (1) independent grounds for jurisdiction; (2)the motion is timely; and (3) the applicant's claim or defense,and the main action, have a question of law or a question offact in common." City of Los Angeles, 288 F.3d at 403 (quotingNorthwest Forest Res. Council v. Glickman, 82 F.3d 825,839 (9th Cir. 1996)). "Even if an applicant satisfies those
SO. CAL. EDISON v. LYNCH           14667- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------threshold requirements, the district court has discretion todeny permissive intervention." Donnelly, 159 F.3d at 412.   Here, Proposed Intervenors fail to meet the thresholdrequirements because no common question of law or factexists between their claims and the main action. ProposedIntervenors argue that the amount of money that SoCal Edisonmay collect, and how SoCal Edison uses that money,raises questions of law and fact common to both the underlyingaction and any claims Reliant and Mirant have againstSoCal Edison and/or the Commission. However, the ProposedIntervenors' concerns as to whether SoCal Edison wouldrepay them are sufficiently different from the issues in theunderlying action so as to not meet this factor of the test forpermissive intervention. "The intervention rule is . . . notintended to allow the creation of whole new lawsuits by theintervenors." Donnelly, 159 F.3d at 412 (internal quotationmarks and citation omitted).                                      III   Reliant, Mirant, and CMTA argue in the alternative that,even if the district court did not err in denying their motionsto intervene, they still have standing to appeal the entry of theStipulated Judgment. We disagree.   A nonparty has standing to appeal a district court's decision"only in exceptional circumstances." Citibank Int'l. v. Collier-Traino, Inc., 809 F.2d 1438, 1441 (9th Cir. 1987). We haveallowed such an appeal only when "(1) the appellant, thoughnot a party, participated in the district court proceedings, and(2) the equities of the case weigh in favor of hearing theappeal." Bank of Am. v. M/V Executive, 797 F.2d 772, 774(9th Cir. 1986). Proposed Intervenors have not met theserequirements. Apart from their applications for intervention,the Proposed Intervenors did not participate in the districtcourt proceedings. By contrast, the appellant in Bank of Am.filed papers and presented oral argument to a magistrate judge
14668                    SO. CAL. EDISON v. LYNCH- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------and the district court on the merits of the case. Id. at 774. Further,there is nothing inequitable about limiting participationin this appeal to submission of amicus briefs. In short, thereare no "exceptional circumstances" in this case that justifygranting a non-party standing to appeal.                                       IV   TURN argues that the Rooker-Feldman doctrine2 precludedthe district court from exercising original jurisdiction. TheRooker-Feldman doctrine is founded on "the unremarkableproposition that federal district courts are courts of original,not appellate, jurisdiction." Gruntz v. County of Los Angeles(In re Gruntz), 202 F.3d 1074, 1078 (9th Cir. 2000) (en banc).It is based on negative inferences drawn from 28 U.S.C.ss.1331, which establishes the district court's original jurisdiction,and 28 U.S.C.ss.1257, which allows Supreme Courtreview of "[f]inal judgments or decrees rendered by the highestcourt of a State in which a decision could be had." Id.(internal quotation marks omitted). Applying these jurisdictionallimitations, the Rooker-Feldman doctrine bars directfederal district court appellate review of state court judicialproceedings. See Worldwide Church of God v. McNair, 805F.2d 888, 890 (9th Cir. 1986).   TURN contends that the Rooker-Feldman doctrine applieshere because SoCal Edison's lawsuit is "inextricably intertwined"with the actions of the Commission and because thePacific Gas & Electric Company ("PG&E") sought state judicialreview of the Commission's cost-recovery decisions.- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------   2 The doctrine takes its name from Rooker v. Fid. Trust Co., 263 U.S.413 (1923), and District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460U.S. 462 (1983). Rooker held that federal statutory jurisdiction over directappeals from state courts lies exclusively in the Supreme Court and isbeyond the original jurisdiction of federal district courts. See Rooker, 263U.S. at 415-16. Feldman held that this jurisdictional bar extends to particularclaims that are "inextricably intertwined" with those a state court hasalready decided. See Feldman, 460 U.S. at 486-87.
SO. CAL. EDISON v. LYNCH           14669- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------   The Rooker-Feldman doctrine does not apply to the actionsof the Commission because it is a state administrative agency,not a court. The primary statute from which the Rooker-Feldman doctrine has been drawn-- 28 U.S.C.ss.1257--does not, by its terms, describe state administrative decisions.More importantly, the Supreme Court has recently rejected aclaim that the Rooker-Feldman doctrine barred federal districtcourt review of adjudicatory decisions of state administrativeagencies. As the Court noted:     The Commission also suggests that the Rooker-     Feldman doctrine precludes a federal district court     from exercising jurisdiction over Verizon's claim.     See District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman,     460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206     (1983); Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U.S. 413,     44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923). The Rooker-     Feldman doctrine merely recognizes that 28 U.S.C.     ss. 1331 is a grant of original jurisdiction, and does     not authorize district courts to exercise appellate     jurisdiction over state-court judgments, which Congress     has reserved to this Court, see 28 U.S.C.     ss. 1257(a). The doctrine has no application to judicial     review of executive action, including determinations     made by a state administrative agency.Verizon Md. Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n of Md., 122 S. Ct.1753, 1759 n.3 (2002) (emphasis added).   TURN also claims that a collateral state court judicial challengeto the Commission action filed by PG&E deprives thedistrict court of jurisdiction over this case. This argument isunavailing. The Rooker-Feldman doctrine does not bar theexercise of federal court jurisdiction when the federal courtlitigant was not a party to the state court action. Johnson v. DeGrandy, 512 U.S. 997, 1006 (1994). SoCal Edison was not aparty to PG&E's state court challenge; thus the Rooker-Feldman doctrine did not preclude the federal district court
14670                       SO. CAL. EDISON v. LYNCH- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------from exercising jurisdiction in this case.3 SoCal Edison didfile an amicus letter in support of PG&E's petition. However,"mere participation in the state case as amici does not invokethe Rooker/Feldman bar." Bennett v. Yoshina, 140 F.3d 1218,1224 (9th Cir. 1998). Thus, existence of collateral state courtproceedings involving a third party did not deprive the districtcourt of original jurisdiction over this action.                                       V   TURN argues the district court should have abstained underthe "Burford doctrine" from exercising jurisdiction over thislawsuit. See Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U.S. 315, 332-33(1943)). We review whether the requirements for abstentionhave been met de novo, and the district court's decisionwhether to abstain for an abuse of discretion. Fireman's FundIns. Co. v. Quackenbush, 87 F.3d 290, 294 (9th Cir. 1996).   "District courts have an obligation and a duty to decidecases properly before them, and `[a]bstention from the exerciseof federal jurisdiction is the exception, not the rule.' "City of Tuscon v. U.S. West Communications, Inc., 284 F.3d1128, 1132 (2002) (quoting Colorado River Water ConservationDist. v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 813 (1976)).   However, under the Burford abstention doctrine, whentimely and adequate state court review is available, a federalcourt sitting in equity may decline to interfere with the proceedingsor orders of state administrative agencies:     (1) when there are difficult questions of state law     bearing on policy problems of substantial public     import whose importance transcends the result in the- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------   3 In fact, the district court in PG&E's case rejected the argument thatPG&E's state court writ was res judicata of PG&E's federal claims.

SO. CAL. EDISON v. LYNCH          14671- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------     case then at bar; or (2) where the exercise of federal     review of the question in a case and in similar cases     would be disruptive of state efforts to establish a     coherent policy with respect to a matter of substantial     public concern.New Orleans Pub. Serv., Inc. v. Council of New Orleans, 491U.S. 350, 361 (1989) (internal quotation marks and citationomitted).   We have required certain factors to exist before a districtcourt can abstain under Burford. See City of Tuscon, 284 F.3dat 1133. These are:     first[,] that the state has chosen to concentrate suits     challenging the actions of the agency involved in a     particular court; second, that federal issues could not     be separated easily from complex state law issues     with respect to which state courts might have special     competence; and third, that federal review might disrupt     state efforts to establish a coherent policy.Id. (quoting United States v. Morros, 268 F.3d 695, 705 (9thCir. 2001)).   Here, not only has the state not chosen to concentrate suitschallenging the administrative action in a particular court, ithas expressly waived any abstention defense to SoCal Edison'saction and consented to the Stipulated Judgment. SeeOhio Civil Rights Comm'n v. Dayton Christian Schs., Inc.,477 U.S. 619, 626 (1986) ("A State may of course voluntarilysubmit to federal jurisdiction even though it might have hada tenable claim for abstention."). Thus, the threshold requirementsfor the exercise of Burford abstention by the districtcourt have not been satisfied.4  The fact that a non-state inter-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------   4 We also note that "Burford abstention is particularly inappropriatewhen the plaintiff's claim is based on preemption, because abstaining
14672                    SO. CAL. EDISON v. LYNCH- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------vening party preferred another forum is not relevant to satisfyingthe prerequisites for Burford abstention. Cf. SouthwestAirlines Co. v. Texas Intern. Airlines, Inc., 546 F.2d 84, 93(5th Cir. 1977). "If the State voluntarily chooses to submit toa federal forum, principles of comity do not demand that thefederal court force the case back into the State's own system."Ohio Bureau of Employment Servs. v. Hodory, 431 U.S. 471,480 (1977). The district court did not err in declining toabstain in this case.                                       VI   The district court did not exceed its authority by approvingthe stipulated settlement between SoCal Edison and the Commissionwithout TURN's consent, a decision which wereview de novo. Class Plaintiffs v. City of Seattle, 955 F.2d1268, 1287 (9th Cir. 1992). An intervenor does not have theright to prevent other parties from entering into a settlementagreement. Local No. 93, Int'l Ass'n of Firefighters, AFL-CIOv. City of Cleveland, 478 U.S. 501, 528-29 (1986). As theCourt explained:     [i]t has never been supposed that one party--     whether an original party, a party that was joined     later, or an intervenor--could preclude other parties     from settling their own disputes and thereby withdrawing     from litigation. Thus, while an intervener is     entitled to present evidence and have its objections     heard at the hearings on whether to approve a consent     decree, it does not have power to block the     decree merely by withholding its consent.- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------under Burford would be an implicit ruling on the merits." Morros, 268F.3d at 705 (quoting Knudsen Corp. v. Nevada State Dairy Comm'n, 676F.2d 374, 377 (9th Cir. 1982)). Here, SoCal Edison alleges that the federalfiled-rate doctrine facially preempts any Commission refusal to permitrecovery of SoCal Edison's wholesale procurement costs.
SO. CAL. EDISON v. LYNCH           14673- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Thus, TURN's consent was not a necessary precursor to thedistrict court's accepting the Stipulated Judgment.   TURN points out that Firefighters provides an exceptionwhere "nonconsenting intervenors" have brought "validclaims" that are "properly raised." Id. at 529. However, asTURN itself admits, the organization "as defendants were notexpected to raise claims and [its] members cannot challengethe terms of the settlements in later suits." Instead, whatTURN claims to possess is a "legally cognizable interest inprotecting the refund rights of its 30,000 ratepaying members,in securing the lower rates that state law guarantees them andthe stipulated judgment denies them, and in preventing therate increases that will inevitably result from this judgment."These interests do not amount to the kind of "valid claims"the Firefighters Court had in mind. Furthermore, TURN'sattempt to narrow the scope of the Firefighters exception asapplying only to plaintiffs, and not defendants such as TURN,is unavailing because the Firefighters case clearly references"third part[ies]" in general. See Firefighters, 478 U.S. at 529.In sum, TURN's consent was not required for the districtcourt to approve the settlement.                                      VII   Nor did the district court's approval of the settlement denyTURN due process. TURN argues that the district court didnot afford it sufficient time to submit briefs opposing the proposedsettlement.   District courts have "inherent power" to control their dockets.Ferdik v. Bonzelet, 963 F.2d 1258, 1260 (9th Cir. 1992).Our review of such decisions is deferential; we will reverse adistrict court's litigation management decisions only if itabused its discretion, see id., or if the procedures deprived thelitigant of due process of law within the meaning of the Fifthor Fourteenth Amendments. See Barona Group of CapitanGrande Band of Mission Indians v. Am. Mgmt. & Amusement,
14674                      SO. CAL. EDISON v. LYNCH- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------Inc., 824 F.2d 710, 721-22 (9th Cir. 1987), amended by 840F.2d 1394, 1405-06 (9th Cir. 1988). Due process requires thata party affected by government action be given "the opportunityto be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningfulmanner." Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 333 (1976)(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In analyzingthe constitutional sufficiency of notice, we must consider:     [f]irst, the private interest that will be affected by the     official action; second, the risk of an erroneous     deprivation of such interest through the procedures     used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or     substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the     Government's interest, including the function     involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens     that the additional or substitute procedural requirement     would entail.Id. at 335.   Although the district court expedited the notice and hearingprocess in this case, TURN filed an extensive brief raising allof the salient issues. In turn, the district court requiredTURN's opponents to file their response brief on an expeditedschedule, which they did. TURN does not quantify either theprobable increased value of alternative procedures, or the riskof an erroneous deprivation of the interest through the proceduresused. Indeed, TURN does not contend that it was preventedfrom presenting its case; its essential complaint is thatthe district court did not consider adequately the argumentsthat TURN made. However, that argument goes to the merits,not to procedural due process.   For the same reasons, TURN has not established prejudice.TURN has failed to demonstrate that the district court'sscheduling order substantially prejudiced TURN's ability topresent its arguments. See Fitch, 472 F.2d at 549 n.5 U.S. v.Fitch, 472 F.2d 548, 549 n.5 (9th Cir. 1973)(rejecting chal-
SO. CAL. EDISON v. LYNCH           14675- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------lenge to contempt judgment based on insufficient noticewhere "[a]ppellants have shown no prejudice."); Hoffman forand on Behalf of NLRB v. Beer Drivers & Salesmen's LocalUnion No. 888, 536 F.2d 1268, 1273 (9th Cir. 1976) (rejectingdue process claim based on "insufficient notice of hearing"because "[t]here is no indication that the parties were notfully aware of the issues or were in any way deprived of a fullopportunity to explore the issues of fact or be heard on theissues of law").   Given the totality of the circumstances of this case, we cannotsay that the expedited briefing schedule deprived TURNof procedural due process.                                      VIII   Contrary to TURN's assertion, the district court did notviolate the Tenth Amendment in approving the StipulatedJudgment. The application of federal preemption, as soughtby SoCal Edison in its complaint, would not intrude on therights reserved under the Tenth Amendment. Further, "[t]osay that nothing in the Commerce Clause justifies federal regulationof even the intrastate operations of public utilities misapprehendsthe proper role of the courts in assessing thevalidity of federal legislation promulgated under one of Congress'plenary powers." FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U.S. 742,753 (1982). "If Congress has the constitutional authority toenact legislation, then the pre-emption question is whetherCongress intended to displace state law in that area, notwhether the existence of state law forbade Congress from regulating."United States v. Geiger, 263 F.3d 1034, 1040 (9thCir. 2001) (citing Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, 533 U.S.525, 540-41 (2001)).   The district court's approval of the Stipulated Judgmentdoes not mandate state participation in the enforcement of afederal statutory scheme such as in Printz v. United States,521 U.S. 898 (1997), nor require a state legislature to adopt
14676               SO. CAL. EDISON v. LYNCH- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------federal regulations such as in New York v. United States, 505U.S. 144 (1992). Rather, the judgment simply confirms a settlementof a valid federal preemption claim. The TenthAmendment cannot be used to bar enforcement of consensualjudgments. United States v. District of Columbia, 654 F.2d802, 808 (D.C. Cir. 1981). In short, the district court had thepower under Article III to approve a settlement over a suitalleging federal preemption, and did not unconstitutionallycommandeer California's regulatory apparatus in doing so.                                       IX   [1] In sum, none of the substantive arguments based on federalstatutory or constitutional law compel reversal of the districtcourt's approval of the Stipulated Judgment. There is,however, a serious question of whether the agreementbetween the Commission and SoCal Edison violated statelaw, both in substance and in the procedure by which theCommission agreed to it. If so, then the Commission lackedcapacity to consent to the Stipulated Judgment, and we wouldbe required to vacate it as void. State officials cannot enterinto a federally-sanctioned consent decree beyond theirauthority under state law. See Keith v. Volpe, 118 F.3d 1386,1393 (9th Cir. 1997) (consent decree could not be interpretedto supplant California Outdoor Advertising Act because stateagency would not have had authority to agree to such adecree); Wash. v. Penwell, 700 F.2d 570, 573 (9th Cir. 1983)(vacating a consent decree that required the state of Oregonto fund a prisoners' legal services program because the stateAttorney General acted beyond his authority and therefore"the consent decree was void to the extent that it exceededdefendants' authority").                                       A   [2] On a substantive level, there is a serious question as towhether the Stipulated Judgment's ratemaking terms violatess.368 of AB 1890. California Public Utilities Codess.368
SO. CAL. EDISON v. LYNCH           14677- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------directed the Commission to set rates "at levels equal to the . . .rate schedules as of June 10, 1996," to reduce those levels forresidential and small-commercial customers by ten percent,and to maintain those rates until the utility has fully recoveredits stranded costs or until March 31, 2002, whichever comesfirst. Cal. Pub. Util. Codess.368(a) (emphasis added). Section368 explicitly states that the utility "shall be at risk for thosecosts not recovered during that time period." Id.   [3] The Stipulated Judgment appears to violatess.368 in tworespects. First, the settlement expressly maintains the ratefreezebeyond March 31, 2002, in violation ofss.368, and thesettlement expressly does so for the purpose of allowingSoCal Edison to recover its past procurement costs. The contestedlanguage of the Stipulated Judgment reads as follows:     The Parties hereby agree that during the Recovery     Period [SoCal Edison] shall recover in retail electric     rates its Procurement Related Obligations recorded     in the PROACT [Account for Recovery of Procurement     Related Obligations established pursuant to     ss. 2.1(a) of the Agreement]. The Parties acknowledge     that they each currently project that the maintenance     of Settlement Rates will likely result in sufficient     Surplus for [SoCal Edison] to recover substantially     all of its unrecovered Procurement Related Obligations     prior to the end of 2003.Stipulated Judgment,ss.2.2, emphasis added. The agreementdefines "Recovery Period" as:     the period commencing September 1, 2001 and ending     on the earlier of the date that [SoCal Edison]     recovers all Procurement Related Obligations     recorded in the PROACT or December 31, 2005.     The Recovery Period includes the Rate Repayment     Period.
14678                   SO. CAL. EDISON v. LYNCH- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------Stipulated Judgment,ss.1.1(q), emphasis added. These provisionsappear to violatess.368, which clearly limits the utilitiesto March 31, 2002 and disallows SoCal Edison from applyingcollections past this date to prior procurement costs.   [4] Second, the settlement also appears to violatess.368'srate-freeze guarantee that protects consumers from priceincreases during the transition to a competitive market. TheStipulated Judgment allows the SoCal Edison to "pocket" foritself the above-rate-freeze-level rates that the Commissionadopted in 2001 solely in order to pay the state for wholesalepower the California Department of Water Resources wasprocuring for the utilities. As a result, under the StipulatedJudgment, the SoCal Edison will collect a "surcharge" ratethat is above the rates in effect on June 10, 1996, in violationof ss.368.   The testimony of the Commission President Loretta Lynch,in response to the California Legislature's query as to why theCommission did not agree to the SoCal Edison - Commissionsettlement months earlier, supports this conclusion. Sheexplained as follows:     MS. LYNCH: Well, actually the Commission is prevented     under state law under 1890 from allowing     that recovery, and what we did with the [SoCal Edison]     settlement was essentially agree to a settlement     that federal law trumped state law, but the Commission     on its own could not trump state law. The Commission     must follow state law.   We are not dissuaded by SoCal Edison's and the Commission'sargument that, whatever restrictionsss.368 may oncehave imposed on the Commission, subsequent legislativechanges and Commission decisions have restored the Commission'straditional authority to permit utilities to recovertheir costs--specifically, those costs associated with its utilityretained generation, which includes its nuclear power plants
SO. CAL. EDISON v. LYNCH           14679- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------and contracts involving Qualifying Facilities--even after theAB 1890 rate freeze. Most notably, the Appellees cite AssemblyBill 6X ("AB 6X"), which in 2001 amended or deletedthree provisions of AB 1890, which had previously providedfor the transition from regulated status to unregulated statusfor utility generation.   However, AB 6X as well as Assembly Bill 1X ("AB 1X")were not intended to relieve the utilities of their regulatorybargain but rather to protect the state from further damage dueto the utilities' imminent inability to meet their utility obligationof providing power to their customers. The Appellees'interpretation of AB 1X and AB 6X is contradicted by the factthat the legislature retained Cal. Pub. Util. Codess.ss.367,368(a), and repeals by implication are "heavily disfavored."See, e.g., NLRB v. Kolkka, 170 F.3d 937, 941 (9th Cir. 1999).A finding of implied repeal must be based on a finding thatthe legislative body actually formulated the intent to repealthe earlier enactment but somehow failed to carry out thatintent. Kenai Peninsula Borough v. State of Alaska, 612 F.2d1210, 1214 (9th Cir. 1980) ("There can be no implied repealunless the intention of the legislative body to repeal isclear."). The legislative history here demonstrates no suchintent. Moreover, there is nothing in the 2001 legislation thatis inconsistent with the rate-freeze or with holding the utilitiesto the risk of not fully recovering stranded costs. Finally, boththe Commission and SoCal Edison recognized, when AB 1Xand AB 6X were enacted, that these acts left the utilitiesresponsible for unrecovered stranded costs. Thus, on a substantivelevel, the Stipulated Judgment appears to violate statelaw.                                       B   [5] On a procedural level, there is a serious question as towhether the Stipulated Judgment violates state laws, specificallythose requiring open government and reasoned decisionsreached upon an evidentiary record. It appears that the Com-
14680                  SO. CAL. EDISON v. LYNCH- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------mission adopted the agreement with SoCal Edison in violationof both the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act ("Bagley-KeeneAct"), Cal. Gov't Codess.ss.11120-11132.5, andss.454 of thePublic Utilities Code.   [6] First, the Stipulated Judgment seems to violate theBagley-Keene Act because the parties approved it in a secretmeeting. Section 11126(d)(1), in particular, requires that"[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law, any meeting ofthe Public Utilities Commission at which the rates of entitiesunder the commission's jurisdiction are changed shall beopen and public." Cal. Gov't Codess.11126(d)(1) (emphasisadded). The Stipulated Judgment, which extinguished ratepayers'refund rights, precluded a reduction in rates that wereotherwise subject to reduction, and granted SoCal Edison significantconcessions for years to come, changes rates such thatthe open meeting requirement ofss.11126(d)(1) is triggered.   SoCal Edison and the Commission argue that the StipulatedJudgment does not change existing rates. Rather, in theirview, the agreement obligates the Commission to allow SoCalEdison to charge existing rates. But the provision of the agreementto which SoCal Edison cites merely defines the phrase"settlement rates" without saying anything about what theCommission is obligated to do. See Settlement Agreement,ss.1.1(w).   The Commission has claimed that it could settle the litigationin a "closed session" pursuant to section 11126(e)(1) ofthe Government Code, which provides that:     [n]othing in this article shall be construed to prevent     a state body, based on the advice of its legal counsel,     from holding a closed session to confer with, or     receive advice from, its legal counsel regarding     pending litigation when discussion in open session     concerning those matters would prejudice the position     of the state body in the litigation.
SO. CAL. EDISON v. LYNCH           14681- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------Cal. Gov't Codess.11126(e)(1) (emphasis added). However,ss.11126(e) merely allows the agency to meet in closed session"to confer with, or receive advice from, its legal counselregarding pending litigation"--not to take action, and certainlynot to issue regulatory orders. Id.   [7] Second, the Commission appears to have violated PublicUtilities Codess.454 with its decision to extinguish ratepayerrefund rights and to lock in higher rates, without apublic hearing and without findings. Section 454 providesthat:     [e]xcept as provided in Section 455 [which deals     with rate schedules not resulting in a rate increase],     no public utility shall change any rate or so alter any     classification, contract, practice, or rule as to result     in any new rate, except upon a showing before the     commission and a finding by the commission that the     new rate is justified.Cal. Pub. Util. Codess.454(a) (emphasis added). Californiacase law also holds that the Commission must hold a hearingand issue findings before adopting an order that affects rates.See Cal. Mfrs. Ass'n v. Pub. Utils. Comm'n, 595 P.2d 98, 102(Cal. 1979) (annulling the Commission rate-increase decisionsfor absence of supporting findings and evidence).   SoCal Edison and the Commission argued below thatss.454did not apply because the Commission was not changing ratesbut rather agreeing not to change rates. The Appellees makea similar argument on appeal; they maintain thatss.454 appliesonly when a utility seeks to "increase" rates, not when a utilitykeeps existing rates in place, as they claim the StipulatedJudgment provides for.   However, this argument conforms neither to the text nor tothe order or its result. First, as a textual matter, the SoCal Edison -Commission agreement does far more than just agree
14682                 SO. CAL. EDISON v. LYNCH- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------not to reduce rates. Under the Stipulated Judgment the Commissionagrees not to penalize SoCal Edison for failing tomeet the Commission's capital-structure requirements, not to"unreasonably withh[o]ld" consent to SoCal Edison's paymentof dividends to shareholders, to allow SoCal Edison upto $900 million per year in rates for capital additions, toapprove SoCal Edison compromising certain claims againstwholesale-power sellers, and to announce that SoCal Edisonmay recover past costs that would not be recoverable underthe TURN Accounting Proposal adopted by the Commission.Each of these constitutes a "change" in SoCal Edison's rate.   Second, as an economic matter the agreement will result inhuge changes in the rates SoCal Edison customers will pay.Before the entry of the Stipulated Judgment, any overcollectionin rates was subject to refund under the CommissionDecision 01-03-082. After the entry of the Judgment, it is not.TURN estimates that the SoCal Edison - Commission dealadds $3.3 billion to ratepayers' electric costs.                                       C   [8] As we have noted, as a matter of federal law, state officialscannot enter into a federally-sanctioned consent decreebeyond their authority under state law. In addition, Californiaagencies such as the Commission are explicitly prohibited bythe state constitution from agreeing to be enjoined fromenforcing state laws that have not been declared unconstitutionalby an appellate court. Article III, section 3.5, of theCalifornia Constitution provides that:     [a]n administrative agency, including an administrative     agency created by the Constitution . . . has no     power . . . (c) [t]o declare a statute unenforceable, or     to refuse to enforce a statute on the basis that federal     law or federal regulations prohibit the enforcement     of such statute unless an appellate court has made a
SO. CAL. EDISON v. LYNCH           14683- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------     determination that the enforcement of such statute is     prohibited by federal law or federal regulations.CAL. CONST. art. III,ss.3.5. In assenting to the judgment here,the Commission ("an administrative agency created by theConstitution," see CAL. CONST. art. XII) was refusing toenforce both the substantive limits on the utilities' transitioncost recovery and the procedures required of the Commissionwhen making rate orders. By stipulating to the judgment, theCommission agreed not only to exempt SoCal Edison fromAB 1890 but also to be enjoined from enforcing AB 1890.Thus, assuming our interpretation of California state law iscorrect, the Stipulated Judgment must be vacated as void.                                       D   [9] However, ours is not the final word on California statelaw. Federal courts are bound by the pronouncements of thestate's highest court on applicable state law. Davis v. MetroProductions, Inc., 885 F.2d 515, 524 (9th Cir. 1989). However,the decisions of California appellate courts provide nocontrolling precedent on these issues of state law; thus, thiscase satisfies the criteria for certification. See Cal. Rules ofCourt 29.5(a)(3). Resolution of the state law issues involvedin this litigation will have a substantial effect on Californialaw and the citizens of California. Accordingly, principles ofcomity suggest that those decisions should be made by Californiacourts. Thus, by separate order accompanying this decision,we certify these issues of state law to the Supreme Courtof California and respectfully request the Court to accept certification.                                       X   We affirm the judgment of the district court in all respects,except for the state law claims identified in section IX. Werespectfully certify those issues to the Supreme Court of California.We stay further proceedings in this case pending a

Does the stipulated judgment violatess.454 of the Public Utilities Code by altering utility              rates without a public hearing and the issuance of findings?III. Statement of FactsA brief description of the factual background of this case is contained in the panel opinion thataccompanies this Order.IV. The Need for CertificationAll parties agree that the instant litigation is of the utmost importance to the California utilityregulation and the California economy. We have resolved all of the pending federal questions. The onlyissues left for resolution are ones of statelaw. Federal courts are bound by the pronouncements of the state's highest court on applicable statelaw. Davis v. Metro Productions, Inc., 885 F.2d 515, 524 (9th Cir. 1989).  However, the decisions ofCalifornia appellate courts provide no controlling precedent on these issues of state law; thus, thiscase satisfies the criteria for certification. See Cal. Rules of Court 29.5(a)(3). Resolution of thestate law issues involved in this litigation will have a substantial effect on California law and thecitizens of California, not only on the questions presented by this case, but in future stateadministrative proceedings.  Therefore, principles of comity suggest that decisions about Californiastate law be made by California courts.V.
