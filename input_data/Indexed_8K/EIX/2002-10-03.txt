Other EventsMoody's DowngradeOn October 1, 2002, Moody's Investors Service downgraded the senior secured credit rating of Mission EnergyHolding Company to B3 from Ba2.  Mission Energy Holding Company is a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of EdisonInternational.  Moody's also lowered its credit rating on Mission Energy Holding Company's wholly-ownedsubsidiary, Edison Mission Energy (senior unsecured debt to Ba3 from Baa3), and Edison Mission Energy'swholly-owned indirect subsidiary Edison Mission Midwest Holdings Co. (syndicated loan facility to Ba2 fromBaa2).  The ratings remain under review for possible further downgrade.  In addition, Moody's placed under reviewfor possible downgrade the ratings of Edison Mission Energy's subsidiary Edison Mission Holdings Company (seniorsecured debt rated Baa3) and Brooklyn Navy Yard Cogeneration Partners, L.P. (senior secured debt rated Baa3), apartnership in which one of Edison Mission Energy's subsidiaries owns a 50% interest.These ratings actions do not trigger any defaults or prepayment obligations under the credit facilities of theaffected entities; however, the changed ratings will increase the borrowing costs under certain of thosefacilities.  Additionally, as a result of the ratings action affecting Edison Mission Midwest Holdings,distributions to Edison Mission Energy will no longer be permitted from Edison Mission Midwest Holdings andexcess cash flow at Edison Mission Midwest Holdings will be deposited in a security account for the benefit ofits creditors.Moreover, as a result of these ratings actions, Edison Mission Energy could be required by market practice andcontract to provide collateral for its domestic and United Kingdom trading activities.  It is anticipated that inthe aggregate this will initially require less than $20 million.  Further, Edison Mission Energy may be requiredto accelerate or provide credit support for its equity contribution obligation in connection with its acquisitionof a 50% interest in the CBK Power Co. Ltd. project in the Philippines.  The total amount of the equityobligation is $48.5 million and otherwise would have been contributed ratably over a period of approximately ninemonths.Edison Mission Energy also anticipates that sales of power from its First Hydro, Homer City and MidwestGeneration projects may require additional credit support over the next twelve months, depending upon marketconditions and the strategies adopted for the sale of this power.  ThePage 2potential working capital support for this is currently projected to be between $100 million and $200 millionfrom time to time over the next twelve months.As of September 30, 2002, Edison Mission Energy had approximately $500 million of cash on hand and undrawn linesof credit.  Edison Mission Energy has revolving credit agreements totaling $487 million, under which $70 millionin letters of credit are outstanding. Last month Edison Mission Energy extended a $275 million, 364-day trancheof this facility on an unsecured basis.  The remaining $212 million of the facility expires in September 2004.Exelon NotificationOn October 2, 2002, Exelon Generation notified Edison Mission Energy's subsidiary Midwest Generation of itsexercise of its option to terminate the existing power purchase agreements during 2003 with respect to (a) 1,614megawatts, or MW, of capacity and energy (out of a possible total of 2,698 MW subject to the option to terminate)from the Collins Station, a natural gas and oil-fired electric generating station located in Grundy County, nearMorris, Illinois, and (b) 113 MW of capacity and energy (out of a possible total of 807 MW subject to the optionto terminate) from the natural gas and oil-fired peaking units located in Illinois, in accordance with the termsof the applicable power purchase agreement related to these generating units. As a result, 1,614 MW of thecapacity of the Collins Station and 113 MW of the capacity of the peaking units, will no longer be subject to apower purchase agreement with Exelon Generation after January 1, 2003.  This is in addition to 137 MW of thecapacity of the peaking units for which Exelon Generation had previously exercised its option to terminate,effective as of January 1, 2002.In light of the notification from Exelon, Edison Mission Energy is reviewing the competitiveness of the releasedunits and will determine over the balance of this year whether any further changes in operations are appropriatefor next year.  The notification received from Exelon Generation has no effect on its commitments to purchasecapacity from these generating units for the balance of 2002.Background- -----------In December 1999, Midwest Generation completed a transaction with Commonwealth Edison, now a subsidiary of ExelonCorporation, to acquire from Commonwealth Edison its fossil-fuel generating plants located in Illinois.  Inconnection with the transaction, Midwest Generation entered into three power purchase agreements with terms of upto five years expiring on December 31, 2004, pursuant to which Exelon Generation (another subsidiary of ExelonCorporation and successor to Commonwealth Edison under these contracts) has the obligation to pay for and theright to purchase the capacity of and power generated by these plants.  One of these agreements relates to theCollins Station and one of these agreements relates to the peaking units.  Under each of these agreements, ExelonGeneration has the option to terminate, exercisable not later than 90 days prior to January 1, 2003, the powerpurchase agreement for 2003 with respect to any of the generating units at the Collins Station and any of thepeaking units, with any such generating unit for which the power purchase agreement is terminated beingPage 3released after January 1, 2003 from the terms of the applicable power purchase agreement.  Exelon Generation hasa similar option to terminate, exercisable not later than 90 days prior to January 1, 2004, the power purchaseagreements for 2004 with respect to all or a portion of the generating units not previously terminated for 2003(1,084 MW from the Collins Station and 694 MW from the peaking units).The following table lists the generating units at the Collins Station and the peaking units as to which ExelonGeneration has not exercised its option to terminate for 2003, the generating units which, as of January 1, 2003,will, as a result of the exercise by Exelon Generation of its option to terminate, be released from the terms ofthe power purchase agreement, and the peaking units as to which Exelon Generation exercised its option toterminate effective as of January 1, 2002, along with related pricing information set forth in the power purchaseagreement.
