Other EventsStandard & Poor's Downgrade of Mission Energy CompaniesMission Energy Holding Company is a wholly-owned, indirect subsidiary of Edison International.  On November 25,2002, Standard & Poor's Ratings Service downgraded Mission Energy Holding Company's senior debt rating to B- fromBB-.  Standard & Poor's also lowered its credit ratings on Mission Energy Holding Company's wholly-ownedsubsidiary, Edison Mission Energy (senior unsecured debt to BB- from BBB-), and Edison Mission Energy'swholly-owned, indirect subsidiaries, Edison Mission Midwest Holdings Co. (syndicated loan facility to BB- fromBBB-) and Edison Mission Marketing & Trading, Inc. (senior unsecured credit rating to BB- from BBB-).  Standard &Poor's has assigned a negative rating outlook for each of the companies that was downgraded.Like the ratings downgrade action taken by Moody's Investor Service on October 1, 2002, with respect to MissionEnergy Holding Company and the other affected companies, the Standard & Poor's ratings actions do not trigger anydefaults under the credit facilities of Mission Energy Holding Company or any of the other affected companies,but the changed Standard & Poor's ratings will increase the borrowing costs under certain of those facilities.Edison Mission Energy also anticipates that sales of power from its First Hydro, Homer City, and MidwestGeneration plants may require additional credit support over the next twelve months, depending on marketconditions and the strategies adopted for the sale of this power.  Edison Mission Energy continues to project thepotential working capital support for this to be between $100 million and $200 million from time to time over thenext twelve months.  Edison Mission Energy does not believe that the ratings actions taken by Standard & Poor'scause it to increase this projection.Lakeland Project and TXU EuropeEdison Mission Energy's  wholly-owned  Lakeland project operates a 220 MW combined cycle,  natural  gas-fired powerplant located in the United  Kingdom.  Ownership of the project is held through  Edison Mission  Energy's  indirectsubsidiary,  Lakeland Power Ltd.,  which sells power  generated from the plant pursuant to a power sales  agreementwith Norweb Energi Ltd, which is                                      -2-
a direct  subsidiary of TXU (UK) Holdings Limited (TXU UK) and an indirect  subsidiary of TXU Europe Group plc (TXUEurope).On November 19, 2002, TXU UK and TXU Europe, together with a related entity, TXU Europe Energy Trading Limited(TXU Energy), entered into formal administration proceedings in the United Kingdom (similar to bankruptcyproceedings in the United States).  As a result of these actions and their effect on Norweb Energi and EdisonMission Energy's contractual arrangements with other parties, the plant currently is not operating.Edison Mission Energy believes it likely that, in accordance with English legal procedures, it will be confirmedshortly that Lakeland Power Ltd. is under no further obligations under the power sales agreement with NorwebEnergi.  If it is confirmed that the power sales agreement has been brought to an end, Edison Mission Energycould operate the Lakeland project as a merchant plant, but because of depressed power prices in the UK market,it may not be able to do this profitably in the near term.  Edison Mission Energy believes that the project willhave valid claims in the administration proceedings of one or more of the TXU entities currently underadministration, but cannot provide assurance of the amount, time of recovery, or ultimate success of theseclaims.  Furthermore, defaults exist under the agreements governing the project's indebtedness, which ifcontinuing could permit the project's lenders to foreclose upon the project.  Edison Mission Energy is indiscussions with the project's lenders concerning these developments and, in the meantime, cash disbursementsfrom the project's bank accounts require the lenders' approval.  Although Lakeland Power Ltd. is evaluatingfuture business plans under these conditions, there is no assurance that the project's lenders will not forecloseupon the project or that Lakeland Power Ltd. will not enter into formal administration or other bankruptcyproceedings.Although cash is held by the project, Edison Mission Energy does not anticipate any distributions from theproject unless and until these matters are resolved in a manner that permits the project to operate profitablyand/or a substantial claim is recovered from the TXU Europe group's administration proceedings.  The bank loansof Lakeland Power Ltd are non-recourse to Edison Mission Energy.  Furthermore, the defaults on these loans do notcross-default to any other indebtedness of Edison Mission Energy or its affiliates.  A foreclosure by theproject's lenders or the effect of administration or other bankruptcy proceedings could result in the loss ofEdison Mission Energy's entire investment (approximately $70 million at October 31, 2002).  As disclosed inEdison International's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2002, Edison MissionEnergy plans to complete an asset impairment evaluation taking into consideration continuing developments withrespect to the power sales agreement during the fourth quarter of 2002.California Public Utilities Commission Litigation Settlement AgreementAs disclosed in Edison International's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2002,Edison International's subsidiary, Southern California Edison Company, is a party to a litigation settlementagreement with the California Public Utilities Commission providing for Southern California Edison to recover itspast electricity procurement costs.  The settlement agreement is being challenged on appeal to the United StatesCourt of Appeals for the                                      -3-
Ninth Circuit, which certified questions to the California Supreme Court about whether the settlement agreementviolated California laws.  Southern California Edison filed a brief requesting that the California Supreme Courtaccept the case, reformulate one of the questions, and answer the questions as reformulated.  On November 20,2002, the California Supreme Court issued an order indicating that it would hear the case, agreeing toreformulate one of the questions as requested by Southern California Edison, and setting a briefing schedule thatconcludes in March 2003.  The order also granted Southern California Edison's request for calendar preference,indicating that the Court would set the matter for hearing as soon as possible upon completion of briefing.Southern California Edison does not know when the California Supreme Court will hear the matter or issue itsanswers to the certified questions.
