FORM 8-K                                                  CURRENT REPORT
EDISON INTERNATIONAL
Items 1 through 4 and 6 through 9 are not included because they are inapplicable.Edison Mission Energy is a wholly-owned, indirect subsidiary of Edison International.  Edison Mission Energy'sLakeland project operated a 220 MW combined cycle, natural gas-fired power plant located in the United Kingdom.Ownership of the project is held through Edison Mission Energy's indirect subsidiary, Lakeland Power Ltd., whichsold power generated from the plant pursuant to a power sales agreement with Norweb Energi Ltd, which is a directsubsidiary of TXU (UK) Holdings Limited (TXU UK) and an indirect subsidiary of TXU Europe Group plc (TXU Europe).As previously reported, TXU UK and TXU Europe, together with a related entity, TXU Europe Energy Trading Limited(TXU Energy), entered into formal administration proceedings in the United Kingdom (similar to bankruptcyproceedings in the United States) on November 19, 2002.  As a result of these actions and their effect on NorwebEnergi Ltd. and Edison Mission Energy's contractual arrangements with other parties, the Lakeland power plantcurrently is not operating.  In December 2002, the directors of Norweb Energi Ltd. appointed a liquidator to windup its contractual rights and obligations.On December 4, 2002, Norweb Energi Ltd. provided a notice of disclaimer of the Power Sales Agreement dated October 20,1989 (as amended from time to time) between Lakeland Power Ltd. and Norweb Energi Ltd. (as successor to North WesternElectricity Board) under Section 178 of the Insolvency Act.  The disclaimer is effectively a termination of the powersales agreement.On December 19, 2002, the lenders to the Lakeland project accelerated the debt owing under the bank agreement thatgoverns the project's indebtedness primarily as a result of the notice of disclaimer of the power sales agreement byNorweb Energi Ltd.  The bank loans of Lakeland Power Ltd. are non-recourse to Edison Mission Energy.  Furthermore, thedefaults on these loans do not cross-default to any other indebtedness of Edison Mission Energy or its affiliates.On December 20, 2002, the project's lenders exercised their right to appoint Michael Thomas Seery and Michael VincentMcLoughlin, partners with KPMG LLP, as administrative receiver over the assets of Lakeland Power Ltd.  This followeddiscussions over the past several weeks regarding future operations of the power plant.  The administrative receiver isPage 2appointed to take control of the affairs of Lakeland Power Ltd. and has a wide range of powers (specified in theInsolvency Act 1986), including authorizing the sale of the power plant.  The appointment of the administrative receiverresults in the treatment of Lakeland power plant as an asset held for sale under Statement of Financial AccountingStandards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" (SFAS No. 144).The events related to the Lakeland project will result in an impairment charge and a provision for bad debts ofapproximately $100 million ($70 million after tax) in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2002, arising from thewrite-down by Edison Mission Energy of the Lakeland power plant and related claims under the power sales agreement (anasset group under SFAS No. 144) to their fair market value.  Edison Mission Energy will account for the Lakeland projectas a discontinued operation in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002, and will no longerconsolidate the activities of Lakeland Power Ltd. due to the loss of control arising from the appointment of theadministrative receiver.The Edison Mission Energy consolidated financial statements for the years ended 2001 and 2000 were subject to an audit byArthur Andersen LLP which was presented in Edison Mission Energy's 2001 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Edison MissionEnergy has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the auditor for its 2002 consolidated financial statements.  UnderStatement of Auditing Standards No. 58, Reports on Audited Financial Statements, a re-audit ordinarily is necessary fordiscontinued operations which require reclassification of prior years consolidated financial statements to conform to theseparate presentation of discontinued operations in such financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 144.  EdisonMission Energy has been advised by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP that a re-audit of its 2001 and 2000 consolidated financialstatements is required as a result of the classification of the Lakeland project as a discontinued operation.On December 23, 2002, Contact Energy Ltd., a New Zealand publicly traded energy company 51% owned by Edison MissionEnergy, announced that it has entered into a conditional agreement with NGC Holdings Ltd. to acquire the TaranakiCombined Cycle power station and related interests for NZ$500 million.  The Taranaki station is a 357 MW combined cycle,natural gas-fired plant located near Stratford, New Zealand.  The acquisition is conditioned on, among other things,Contact Energy gaining a clearance from the New Zealand Commerce Commission, approval by the shareholders of NGC, and thetermination of a cross border leveraged lease currently in existence.  Subject to satisfaction of the closing conditions,a closing is expected in February 2003.  As a result of the proposed acquisition and the financing to be obtained byContact Energy to finance such acquisition, Standard and Poor's lowered the long-term credit rating of Contact Energyfrom BBB+ to BBB.As previously reported, Edison International's wholly-owned, indirect subsidiary Edison Capital has leased twoaircraft to United Airlines.  United Airlines filed for United States bankruptcy court protection on December 9,2002.  United Airlines has proposed restructuring the leases for both of Edison Capital's aircraft, which wouldPage 3result in Edison Capital receiving no further rent payments.  As a result, Edison Capital will take a write-downof $35 million against earnings for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2002.                                                    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this reportto be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
