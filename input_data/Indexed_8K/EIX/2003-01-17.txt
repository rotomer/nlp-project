SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
FORM 8-K                                                  CURRENT REPORT
EDISON INTERNATIONAL
Items 1 through 4, 6, 8, and 9 are not included because they are inapplicable.         On January 17, 2003, Southern California Edison Company ("SCE"), a subsidiary of Edison International,filed with the California Public Utilities Commission ("CPUC") a detailed plan outlining how customer rates couldbe reduced later in 2003 when SCE expects to have completed recovery of uncollected procurement costs incurred onbehalf of its customers during the California energy crisis.  Under a settlement agreement between SCE and theCPUC, these past procurement costs are recorded in a regulatory balancing account called the PROACT.  AtDecember 31, 2002, the remaining PROACT balance to be recovered by SCE was $574 million.         In its January 17 filing, SCE proposed that the CPUC apply rate reductions in the same manner it applieda series of rate surcharges during the height of the energy crisis in 2001--primarily to rates paid by businessand higher-use residential customers.  If approved by the CPUC, the percentage reductions in rates after PROACTrecovery is completed would be 8% for larger-use residential customers, 19% for small and medium businesscustomers, and 26% for larger-use business customers.  SCE's press release discussing the rate reduction plan isattached as Exhibit 99.1.         SCE has previously projected that it will recover the remaining balance of the PROACT by the end of2003.  Based on decisions made by the CPUC at the end of 2002, SCE now believes it will recover PROACT bymid-2003.  There still exist material factors that could delay SCE's estimate of the timing of PROACT recovery.The material factors affecting timing of PROACT recovery include:o        the level of output of SCE's generating plants and contract power deliveries (for example, lower than         forecasted output could slow PROACT recovery).o        the outcome of issues currently being addressed in the CPUC's power procurement proceedings, including         further adjustments to the CPUC-authorized allocation among the California utilities of power         contracted by the California Department of Water Resources ("CDWR") for 2003 and the related CDWR         revenue requirement impacts.Page 2o        an increase by the CPUC in the charges SCE collects on behalf of the CDWR to service its bond and/or         power procurement costs due either to an increase in CDWR's actual revenue requirement or to a         change in SCE's percentage allocation (presently approximately 42% for power procurement and 44%         for the bond charge), either of which could reduce funds available for PROACT recovery.  Under the         terms of its settlement with the CPUC, SCE may request a rate adjustment if changes in CDWR         charges reduce PROACT recovery; however, the timing of such an adjustment would be uncertain.o        the level of retail electricity sales (for example, lower than forecasted sales would slow PROACT         recovery).o        the amount of (i) a regulatory asset that may be created in addition to the PROACT, but which would         directly reduce the PROACT balance, to allow SCE to recover a portion of its procurement         undercollection from "direct access" customers and (ii) the direct access "exit fees."  If the         regulatory asset is created, recovery of the PROACT may be accelerated, however, depending upon         the amount of "exit fees" recoverable by SCE, collection of the PROACT may be accelerated or         slowed.o        a decision by the CPUC to prevent SCE from recovering $209 million used to hedge natural gas price         exposure associated with certain procurement contracts for 2002 and 2003.  This $209 million has         been incorporated into SCE's current projection of the timing of PROACT recovery.  On January 13,         2003 the CPUC released an administrative law judge's draft decision authorizing SCE to recover         these costs.  Should the CPUC not adopt this decision, PROACT recovery would be accelerated and         SCE would be forced to charge the $209 million against its earnings.o        a decision by the CPUC, which could be made under the settlement agreement, directing $150 million of         surplus revenue in 2003 to be used for any utility purpose.  This decision would delay PROACT         recovery to the extent these funds would not be available to reduce the PROACT.                                                      A consumer advocacy group is pursuing an appeal seeking to overturn the federal district court'sstipulated judgment approving the settlement agreement between SCE and the CPUC, including the PROACT and SCE'srecovery procedures related to it.  In considering this appeal of the federal district court's action, the UnitedStates Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has certified certain questions of law to the California SupremeCourt about whether the settlement agreement violated California law.  On November 20, 2002, the CaliforniaSupreme Court issued an order indicating that it would hear the case, and ordered that all briefing be submittedby March 2003. The court further stated that the case would be scheduled for expedited oral argument, followingcompletion of the briefing.Page 3         In January 2001, the CDWR began making emergency power purchases for customers of SCE and two otherinvestor-owned California utility companies: Pacific Gas and Electric Company ("PG&E") and San Diego Gas &Electric Company ("SDG&E").  Under this arrangement, SCE would remit directly to the CDWR and would not recognizeas revenue amounts which SCE billed to and collected from its customers for electric power purchased and sold tothose customers by the CDWR.  The CPUC had the responsibility to allocate the CDWR's power procurement revenuerequirement among the customers of SCE, PG&E, and SDG&E.  In February 2002, the CPUC allocated to SCE's customers$3.5 billion (about 38%) of the CDWR's power procurement revenue requirement for 2001 and 2002, or about$1.7 billion per year, subject to later true-up to reflect the CDWR's actual recorded costs during the 2001-2002period.  In addition, in an October 2002 decision, the CPUC established a separate "bond charge" for eachutility's customers for the purpose of repaying debt costs resulting from CDWR's financing of a portion of its2001 power purchases.  The "bond charge" applies to all electricity consumed on or after November 15, 2002, andwill be set annually based on annual expected debt-related costs and projected electricity consumption.  For2003, the CPUC allocated to SCE's customers $331 million (about 44%) of CDWR's bond charge revenue requirement.The bond charge is set at a rate of 0.513 cents per kilowatt-hour for SCE's customers.         On December 17, 2002, the CPUC adopted an allocation of CDWR's forecast power procurement revenuerequirement for 2003, based on the quantity of electricity expected to be supplied under the CDWR contracts tocustomers of each of the three utility companies by the CDWR.  SCE's allocated share is $1.9 billion of theCDWR's total 2003 power procurement revenue requirement of $4.5 billion.  This is an interim allocation and willbe superseded by a later allocation after the CDWR submits a supplemental determination of its 2003 revenuerequirement.  The CPUC stated that the later allocation could result in a reduction in the CDWR's revenuerequirement, with a corresponding decrease in the CDWR's rate charged to customers.  The CPUC's December 17decision did not address issues relating to the true-up of the CDWR's 2001-2002 revenue requirement, stating thatthose issues will be addressed after actual data for 2002 becomes available, expected to be in April 2003.         The allocation made by the CPUC's December 17 decision is substantially consistent with SCE'sexpectations.  Although payments to CDWR will increase for 2003 compared to 2002, the CPUC has authorized SCE toretain in rates a previously authorized surcharge to offset the increase in its allocation.  The net effect ofthese decisions has not materially affected SCE's expectations for recovering the remaining balance in the PROACT.         Under California law and orders of the CPUC, SCE resumed power procurement for its customers onJanuary 1, 2003.  The CPUC recently has issued several significant procurement-related decisions and approvals,including the following:Page 4o        On October 24, 2002, the CPUC issued a decision ordering SCE, PG&E, and SDG&E to resume procurement and         adopting a regulatory framework for their procurement activities.  On November 25, 2002, SCE filed an         application with the CPUC for rehearing of the October 24 decision seeking the correction of legal         errors in the decision.  The CPUC has not yet ruled on SCE's application for rehearing, but has         indicated that it will address SCE's application and others in future decisions.o        On December 19, 2002, the CPUC issued a decision approving modified short-term procurement plans for         SCE, PG&E and SDG&E, modifying and clarifying the cost-recovery mechanisms and standards of         behavior adopted in the October 24 decision, and providing further guidance on the long-term         planning process to be undertaken in the next phase of the power procurement proceeding.  The CPUC         found that the utilities were capable of resuming full procurement on January 1, 2003, and ordered         that they take all necessary steps to do so.o        In anticipation of resuming power procurement for its customers, SCE negotiated capacity contracts with         several suppliers and submitted an advice letter to the CPUC on November 5, 2002, requesting         review and approval of these transactions.  On December 5, 2002, the CPUC approved the contracts,         subject to various conditions.  SCE then entered into further negotiations with these potential         suppliers, evaluated the suppliers' updated prices and quantities, and conferred with the CPUC's         Procurement Review Group as to any changes.  As a result of that process, SCE has entered into         several capacity contracts with terms of up to five years.         In accordance with its procurement plan, SCE also has entered into standard agreements with suppliers toenable SCE to purchase power to fill a portion of its residual net-short (the amount of energy needed to serveSCE's customers from sources other than its own generating plants, power purchase contracts and CDWR's powerpurchase contracts) and to sell surplus power arising from its allocation of certain CDWR contracts, and topurchase and sell natural gas to comply with its obligations under its capacity contracts.  SCE began transactingunder these agreements to meet its power requirements for January 2003 at the end of 2002.         On January 1, 2003, SCE resumed responsibility for procuring electricity for its customers.  To date,SCE has been able both to buy and sell required quantities of electricity and natural gas, notwithstandinganticipated counterparty concerns associated with its non-investment grade credit rating and creditworthiness.         On December 19, 2002, the CPUC adopted an operating order under which SCE, PG&E, and SDG&E will performthe operational, dispatch, and administrative functions for the CDWR's long-term power purchase contracts,beginning January 1, 2003.  The operating order sets forth the terms and conditions under which the three utilitycompanies will administer the CDWR contracts and requires the utility companies to dispatch all the generatingassets within their portfolios on a least-cost basis for the benefit of their ratepayers.  PG&E and SDG&E havefiled an emergency motion whereby they sought to substitute their negotiated operatingPage 5agreements with CDWR for the CPUC's operating order.  The CPUC has not yet ruled on their motion and itis not clear what impact, if any, a CPUC ruling on their motion will have on SCE.         The CPUC also approved amendments to the servicing agreements between the utilities and the CDWRrelating to transmission, distribution, billing, and collection services for the CDWR's purchased power.  Theservicing order issued by the CPUC identifies the formulas and mechanisms to be used by SCE to remit to CDWR therevenue collected from SCE's customers for their use of energy from CDWR contracts that have been allocated toSCE.         On December 31, 2002, California Governor Gray Davis reappointed Michael R. Peevey to the CPUC anddesignated him as President.  On the same day, Governor Davis appointed Susan P. Kennedy to serve as a CPUCCommissioner.(a)      Not applicable(b)      Not applicable(c)      Exhibits         99.1     Press release about procurement cost recovery and customer rate reduction plan.Page 6                                                             Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused thisreport to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

SCE has been collecting these costs under the terms of its cost-recovery settlement agreement with theCPUC. As of Dec. 31, 2002, $574 million of SCE's $3.6 billion in uncollected procurement costs remained to berecovered.  SCE officials project that full recovery of the balance could occur as early as midyear, allowingrates to drop shortly thereafter (see SCE Form 8-K filing re: procurement recovery contingencies).         SCE's filing proposes that the CPUC apply the rate reductions in the same manner it applied a series ofsurcharges during the height of the crisis in 2001--primarily to rates paid by business and higher-use residentialcustomers.         "The higher electricity rates were borne by our business customers as well as those residentialcustomers who have high consumption requirements," said SCE CEO Alan Fohrer.  "Thus, we are asking the commissionto reduce rates in the same pattern originally used to allocate those crisis rates across customer groups."         The following chart describes the customer groups most impacted by the CPUC rate surcharges along withthe proposed rate reductions.

Participants in the state's low-income California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) program wouldcontinue to receive rate protection and keep their 20% discount.Page 1Page 2 of 2         "Nearly two-thirds of our residential bills did not include the crisis surcharges, because most of ourresidential customers were either exempted through the CARE discount program or they were able to keep theirconsumption levels below the surcharge benchmarks," Fohrer said.         It should be noted that rates for these lower-use residential customers might have increased 10% thisyear with the expiration of a legislated 10% rate reduction that small customers received in 1998 as part of thestate's deregulation program.  SCE's rate filing eliminates that potential rate increase.         "Even if this proposal is approved, rates will not drop all the way to pre-crisis levels, because thecosts associated with the state's long-term power contracts and the state's direct access program will remain inrates for some time," said Fohrer.  "We will continue to press for refunds and other measures that restorereasonable pricing and reliable power supplies for our customers going forward."                                                       # # #
