[EDISON INTERNATIONAL LOGO]                                                                                   ROSEMEAD, Calif., May 7, 2003 -- Edison International (NYSE: EIX) recorded earnings per share of 17 centsin the first quarter of 2003, compared to 26 cents in the first quarter of 2002 on a reported basis.  The lowerearnings reflect a planned refueling outage at San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS), partially offset byimproved performance at Edison Mission Energy (EME).        "We have made solid progress in the first quarter of 2003," said EIX Chairman John Bryson.  "SouthernCalifornia Edison continues its trend of good performance and Edison Mission Energy has a better than expectedoutcome.  We remain on course toward our long-term goal of overall financial health and flexibility."        The earnings include a three-cents-per-share charge at EME for a change in accounting principle in thefirst quarter of 2003 and two cents per share in earnings from discontinued operations at EME in the firstquarter of 2002.  EIX's core earnings, which exclude the two items above, were 20 cents per share in the firstquarter of 2003 compared to 24 cents per share in the same period last year.   For the periods presented below,EIX's core earnings are the same as earnings from continuing operations.        Southern California Edison (SCE) earned $102 million in the first quarter of 2003, compared with $146million in the same period last year.  The $44 million decrease primarily reflects a planned refueling outage atSONGS during the first quarter of 2003.  The decrease also includes higher operating and maintenance expensesfrom higher health-care costs and storm-damage expenses, partially offset by higher performance-based ratemakingrevenue.        In January 2002, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) approved the creation of theProcurement-Related Obligations Account (PROACT) to record the recovery of $3.6 billion of SCE'sprocurement-related obligations pursuant to the settlement agreement between SCE and the CPUC.  In February 2003,the CPUC allowed SCE to transfer $209 million into its PROACT balance for natural gas hedging costs.  As of March31, 2003, the remaining PROACT balance was $640 million.                                                     - more -        EME's first quarter 2003 loss from continuing operations was $8 million compared to a loss of $41 millionin the same period last year.  The reduced loss of $33 million is primarily due to higher U.S. energy prices inthe first quarter of 2003 compared to 2002.  EME's earnings are seasonal with higher earnings expected during thesummer months.        Edison Capital's earnings for the first quarter of 2003 were $15 million, down $4 million from the sameperiod last year.  This decrease is primarily due to a maturing investment portfolio which produces lower income,partially offset by lower net interest expense and higher tax benefits.        EIX parent company's loss of $19 million reflects an improvement of $4 million over the prior year'speriod that is primarily due to the absence of 2002 losses from Edison O&M Services resulting from EIX's decisionto wind down the business in 2003.        The 2003 first quarter financial results reflect no earnings or loss from discontinued operations while2002 first quarter results include earnings from discontinued operations of $5 million from EME's LakelandProject in the UK.        EME's results include a three-cent, or $9 million, charge for the cumulative effect of a change inaccounting principle related to the new accounting standard for recording asset retirement obligations adopted byEIX in 2003.  As SCE follows accounting principles for rate-regulated enterprises, implementation of this newstandard did not affect its earnings.
