Other Events.Moody's DowngradesOn May 14, 2003, Moody's Investors Service downgraded the senior debt rating of Mission Energy Holding Company (MEHC) to Caa2 fromB3.  MEHC is a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Edison International.  Moody's also lowered its credit ratings of MEHC'ssubsidiary, Edison Mission Energy (EME) (senior unsecured debt, to B2 from Ba3), and EME's largest subsidiary, Edison Mission MidwestHoldings Co. (syndicated loan facility, to Ba3 from Ba2).  In addition, Moody's downgraded the credit ratings of Brooklyn Navy YardCogeneration Partners, L.P., a partnership in which an EME subsidiary owns a 50% interest (senior secured debt, to Ba1 from Baa3),the pass-through bonds related to the sale-leaseback of the Homer City facilities (to Ba2 from Baa3), the pass-through certificatesrelated to the sale-leaseback of Midwest Generation's Powerton Station and Joliet Station (to B2 from Ba3), the bank credit facilityrelated to the sale-leaseback of Midwest Generation's Collins facility (to Ba3 from Ba2), and Mission Capital L.P. (monthly incomepreferred securities, to Caa1 from B2).  The ratings are no longer under review for possible further downgrade.  The outlook isstable for the ratings of Brooklyn Navy Yard Cogeneration Partners, L.P. and the pass-through bonds related to the sale-leaseback ofthe Homer City facilities.  The outlook is negative for the ratings of MEHC, EME, Edison Mission Midwest Holdings, and the otheraffected entities.These ratings actions do not trigger any defaults or prepayment obligations under MEHC's or EME's credit facilities or those of theother affected entities.  In particular, these changes do not require any prepayment of indebtedness at Edison Mission MidwestHoldings.  However, the changed ratings may affect the ability of EME to extend or replace its credit facilities upon expiration andthe ability of Edison Mission Midwest Holdings to extend or refinance its $911 million of debt maturing in December 2003.In addition, sales of power from EME's First Hydro, Homer City and Midwest Generation projects require credit support, depending uponmarket conditions and the strategies adopted for the sale of this power.  EME has previously projected the potential working capitalsupport for this to be between $100 million and $200 million from time to time during 2003 and currently believes these projectionsto be unchanged.2
