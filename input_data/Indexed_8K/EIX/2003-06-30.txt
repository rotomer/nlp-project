As a result, 578 MW of the capacity ofthese units will no longer be subject to the power purchase agreement beginning January 1, 2004.  MidwestGeneration will sell the energy and capacity from the released units through a combination of bilateralagreements, forward sales and spot market sales.  The notification received from Exelon Generation has no effecton its commitments to purchase capacity from these generating units for the balance of 2003.In December 1999, Midwest Generation completed a transaction with Commonwealth Edison, now a subsidiary of ExelonCorporation, to acquire from Commonwealth Edison its fossil-fuel generating plants located in Illinois.  Inconnection with the transaction, Midwest Generation entered into three power purchase agreements withCommonwealth Edison that expire on December 31, 2004.  In January 2001, Commonwealth Edison assigned theseagreements to Exelon Generation.One of the power purchase agreements relates to Midwest Generation's coal-fired units.  2004 will be the finalcontract year under this agreement.  The following table lists the coal-fired units from which Exelon Generationis committed to purchase capacity through 2004 (including the units for which Exelon Generation has exercised itscall option for 2004) and the units which, as of January 1, 2004, will have been released from the terms of thepower purchase agreement, along with related pricing information set forth in the power purchase agreement.Page 2                                                    Waukegan Unit 7               328      11,000      11,000        1,375      1,375        17.0     17.0   Crawford Unit 8               326      11,000      11,000        1,375      1,375        17.0     17.0   Will County Unit 4            520      11,000      11,000        1,375      1,375        17.0     17.0   Joliet Unit 8                 522      11,000      11,000        1,375      1,375        17.0     17.0   Waukegan Unit 8               361      21,300      21,300        2,663      2,663        20.0     20.0   Fisk Unit 19                  326      21,300      21,300        2,663      2,663        20.0     20.0                                 ---                               2,383   Waukegan Unit 6               100         (b)      21,300          (b)      2,663         (b)     20.0   Crawford Unit 7               216         (b)      21,300          (b)      2,663         (b)     20.0   Will County Unit 3            262         (b)      21,300          (b)      2,663         (b)     20.0   Will County Unit 1 (c)        156         (b)         (b)          (b)        (b)         (b)      (b)   Will County Unit 2 (c)        154         (b)         (b)          (b)        (b)         (b)      (b)   Joliet Unit 6                 314         (b)         (b)          (b)        (b)         (b)      (b)   Joliet Unit 7                 522         (b)         (b)          (b)        (b)         (b)      (b)   Powerton Unit 5               769         (b)         (b)          (b)        (b)         (b)      (b)   Powerton Unit 6               769         (b)         (b)          (b)        (b)         (b)      (b)                              ------                               3,262                               -----                               5,645                               =====(a)  "Summer" months are June, July, August and September, and "Non-Summer" months are the remaining months in     the year.(b)  Released units refer to those option units for which Exelon Generation has not, in its latest notice or in     previous years, exercised its right to purchase capacity and energy during the following year.
