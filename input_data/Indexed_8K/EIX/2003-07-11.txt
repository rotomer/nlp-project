On July 10, 2003, Southern California Edison Company (SCE), the largest subsidiary of Edison International, issued a pressrelease announcing that the California Public Utilities Commission had approved $1.2 billion in rate reductions, effective August 1,2003, for SCE's customers.  The rate reductions are based on SCE's current forecast that during July it will likely complete recoveryof $3.6 billion in uncollected power procurement costs incurred on behalf of customers during the California energy crisis.  Thecosts were recorded in a regulatory balancing account known as the procurement-related obligations account, or PROACT.  A copy of thepress release is attached as Exhibit 99.Item 7.

The reductionswould range from 8% to 19%, depending on the customer group.         The rate change is based on SCE's current forecast that during July it will likely complete recovery of $3.6 billion inuncollected power procurement costs incurred on behalf of customers during the California energy crisis.  As a result, rates will bereduced Aug. 1.         "The $1.2-billion customer rate reduction authorized today is a major landmark in the economic recovery from thedevastating impacts of the power crisis for the 12 million people and 500,000 businesses we serve," said SCE Chairman John E.Bryson.  "Our customers deserve this rate relief, just as they deserve the reliable electric service that SCE's strengtheningfinancial health will help ensure."         SCE filed a rate-reduction plan last January, anticipating a mid-year completion of its cost recovery effort and thepossibility of reduced rates in early fall.  Subsequently, a settlement was reached with representatives of various customer groupsthat included the use of forecasted rather than after-the-fact cost-recovery verification and made possible earlier ratereductions.   Based on forecasts that point to full recovery in July, the reductions would be implemented on Aug. 1.  Consistentwith the settlement, any remaining unrecovered costs or overcollection at the end of July due to forecasting variances will betransferred to another regulatory account.         As the following chart shows, the anticipated reductions would benefit all customer types - residential, small,medium-sized, and large businesses as well as agricultural and street-lighting customers.  Average rate reductions for businessesare larger than those for residential customers because businesses paid higher energy crisis rate surcharges.  Participants in thestate's low-income California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) program would continue to receive rate protection and retain their20% bill discount.                                                               - MORE -

"We continue to pursue other measures that lower costs and assure reliable power supplies for our customers."         SCE has been recovering its uncollected power procurement costs under the terms of a settlement agreement reached with theCPUC in October 2001.   That settlement has been appealed and is under review by the courts.         "SCE is taking important steps to become a financially healthy company once again so that we can fully serve our customers,"said Foster.  "Today's commission decision signaling the completion of procurement cost recovery and the implementation of reducedcustomer rates is a critical step.  In addition, we are working hard on our General Rate Case, on clear rules regarding the state'sDirect Access programs and the recovery of major capital investments and on a plan to attract and have access to capital for futureinvestments on behalf of our customers."                                                                 # # #         An Edison  International  (NYSE:EIX)  company,  Southern  California Edison is one of the nation's largest electricutilities, serving a population of more than 12 million via 4.5 million  customer  accounts in a  50,000-square-mile  service areawithin central, coastal and Southern California.
