EIX's core earnings include the impairment charge at EME, and exclude the impact of the URG decision atSCE in 2002 and discontinued operations.  Excluding the EME impairment charge, EIX's second quarter 2003 resultswere comparable to core earnings of 54 cents per share for the same period last year.SECOND-QUARTER EARNINGS DETAILEarnings (Loss) from Continuing Operations- ------------------------------------------         SCE earnings from continuing operations were $225 million in the second quarter of 2003, compared with$215 million in the second quarter of 2002, after excluding the $480 million adjustment related to the URGdecision in 2002.  The $10 million increase in core earnings primarily reflects the impact of two items thatoccurred in the second quarter of 2002 that did not occur in the current period:  a refueling outage at SanOnofre Nuclear Generating Station Unit 2 and a one-time positive adjustment relating to the implementation of asales adjustment mechanism.         EME's loss from continuing operations was $165 million in the second quarter of 2003 compared to $6million in the same period last year.  The decrease in earnings is primarily due to the asset impairment chargeof $150 million, a reduction in revenue from the Illinois power plants which reflects the release of certainpower and capacity in 2003 under the power purchase agreements, higher interest and rent expense from the declinein EME's and its subsidiaries' credit ratings, and lower ancillary revenues at the First Hydro project.  Thedecrease in earnings was partially offset by higher U.S. energy prices, higher earnings from oil and gasactivities and lower state income taxes.  On an annual basis, EME's earnings are seasonal with higher earningsexpected during the summer months.         The impairment charge at EME during the second quarter of 2003 resulted from a revised long-term outlookfor capacity revenues from its small peaking plants in Illinois due to                                                     - more -a number of factors, including the effect of higher long-term natural gas prices on the competitiveness of theseunits and the current oversupply of generation.  Since capacity value represents a key revenue component forthese small peaking plants, the revised outlook resulted in a write-down of the book value of these assets from$286 million to their estimated fair market value of $41 million.  The small peaking power plants range in sizefrom 64 megawatts (MW) to 163 MW, and total 899 MW.         In addition to the impairment charge related to the small peaking plants, EME's indirect subsidiary,Midwest Generation LLC, will report in its separate financial statements for its second quarter, an impairmentcharge of $475 million, after tax, related to the long-term lease of the 2,698-MW gas-fired Collins Station.  Theimpairment charge results from a write-down of the book value of capitalized assets related to the CollinsStation from $858 million to their estimated fair market value of $78 million.  The impairment charge by MidwestGeneration LLC is not reflected in the operating results of EME, Mission Energy Holding Company or EIX as theCollins Station is treated in their financial statements as an operating lease and not as an asset, andtherefore, is not subject to impairment for accounting purposes.         Earnings in the second quarter of 2003 for Edison Capital, Mission Energy Holding Company and EIX parentcompany and other were substantially unchanged from the results in the same period last year.Earnings (Loss) from Discontinued Operations- --------------------------------------------         The second-quarter financial results include a loss from discontinued operations of $2 million in 2003and earnings from discontinued operations of $9 million in 2002.  The 2003 loss is due to adjustments related tothe sale of Fiddler's Ferry and Ferrybridge (FFF) and Lakeland.  The 2002 earnings were due to earnings fromLakeland and the recovery of an insurance claim related to the operation of FFF prior to its sale in 2001.

EIX had core earnings of $91 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2003, compared with coreearnings of $255 million for the same period last year.  2003 core earnings exclude EME's loss from discontinuedoperations of $2 million and charge of $9 million related to a change in accounting principle. 2002 core earningsexclude the $480 million gain from the implementation of the URG decision at SCE and earnings from discontinuedoperations of $14 million at EME.YEAR-TO-DATE EARNINGS DETAILEarnings (Loss) from Continuing Operations- -------------------------------------------         Excluding the $480 million gain to implement the URG decision, SCE's earnings from continuing operationsin the first half of 2003 decreased by $34 million, compared to the same period last year.  The decreaseprimarily reflects the impact of a one-time positive adjustment relating to the implementation of a salesadjustment mechanism that occurred in the second quarter of 2002.  Additionally, SCE had higher operating andmaintenance expenses, including health care and storm damage costs, which were offset by higher revenue.         EME's loss from continuing operations for the six-month period ending June 30, 2003, increased by $126million compared to the same period last year primarily due to the asset impairment charge of $150 million.EME's results were favorably impacted by higher U.S. energy prices and lower state income taxes.   Partiallyoffsetting these favorable items were a reduction in revenue from the Illinois power plants which reflects therelease of certain                                                        - more -power and capacity in 2003 under the power purchase agreements, higher interest and rent expense from a declinein EME's and its subsidiaries' credit ratings, and lower ancillary revenues at the First Hydro project.         Edison Capital's earnings for the six-months ended June 30, 2003 were $27 million, down $4 million fromthe same period last year.  This decrease is primarily due to a maturing investment portfolio which produceslower income, partially offset by lower net interest expense and higher tax benefits.         Earnings for the six months ended June 30, 2003 for Mission Energy Holding Company and EIX parentcompany and other were substantially unchanged from the results in the same period last year.Earnings (Loss) from Discontinued Operations- --------------------------------------------         The financial results for the six months ended June 30, 2003 include a loss from discontinued operationsof $2 million at EME from adjustments related to the sale of FFF and Lakeland.  The financial results for the sixmonths ended June 30, 2002 include earnings from discontinued operations of $14 million which reflect operatingresults from Lakeland and the recovery of an insurance claim related to the operation of FFF prior to its sale in2001.Change in Accounting Principle- ------------------------------         EME's results for the six-month period ending June 30, 2003 include a three-cent, or $9 million, chargefor the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for asset retirement obligations adopted in 2003.As SCE follows accounting principles for rate-regulated enterprises, implementation of this new standard did notaffect its earnings.
