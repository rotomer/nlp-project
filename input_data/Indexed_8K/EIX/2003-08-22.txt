Items 1 through 4, 6, and 8 through 12 are not included because they are inapplicable.                  On August 21, 2003, Southern California Edison Company (SCE), the largest subsidiary of EdisonInternational, issued a press release announcing that the California Supreme Court had issued a decisionanswering certain questions certified to it by a federal court of appeals regarding SCE's settlement agreementwith the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC).  The California Supreme Court answered each question byaffirming that the settlement conformed to California state law.  A copy of the press release is attached asExhibit 99.                  In 2001, SCE and the CPUC entered into a settlement of SCE's federal district court lawsuit against theCPUC, which sought a ruling that SCE was entitled to full recovery of certain procurement-related costs.  A keyelement of the settlement agreement was the establishment of a $3.6 billion regulatory balancing account, calledthe PROACT, as of August 31, 2001.  A consumer advocacy group known as The Utility Reform Network, or TURN, andother parties appealed to the federal court of appeals seeking to overturn the stipulated judgment of thedistrict court that approved the settlement agreement.         On September 23, 2002, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued an opinion thataffirmed the district court on all claims, with the exception of challenges founded upon California state law,which the appeals court referred to the California Supreme Court.  The appeals court concluded that none of thesubstantive arguments based on federal statutory or constitutional law compelled reversal of the district court'sapproval of the stipulated judgment.  However, the appeals court stated in its opinion that there was a seriousquestion whether the settlement agreement violated state law, both in substance and in the procedure by which theCPUC agreed to it.  The appeals court added that if the settlement agreement violated state law, the CPUC lackedcapacity to consent to the stipulated judgment, and the stipulated judgment would need to be vacated.  Theappeals court indicated that, on a substantive level, the stipulated judgment appeared to violate California'selectric industry restructuring statute providing for a rate freeze.  The appeals court also indicated that, on aprocedural level, the stipulated judgment appeared to violate California laws requiring open meetings and publichearings.Page 2         Because federal courts are bound by the pronouncements of the state's highest court on applicable statelaw, and because the federal appeals court found no controlling precedents from California courts on the issuesof state law in this case, the appeals court issued a separate order certifying those issues in question form tothe California Supreme Court and requested that the California Supreme Court accept certification.  TheCalifornia Supreme Court accepted the certification, reformulated one of the certified questions as SCE hadrequested, and set a briefing schedule.  After the completion of the filing of briefs by the respective parties,including supplemental briefs requested by the California Supreme Court concerning an issue related toCalifornia's open meeting laws, the parties made oral arguments before the California Supreme Court at a hearingon May 27, 2003.                  In its decision on August 21, 2003, the California Supreme Court concluded that the settlement betweenSCE and the CPUC did not violate California law in any of the respects raised by the federal court of appeals.Specifically, the California Supreme Court concluded that (1) the commissioners of the CPUC had the authority topropose the stipulated judgment in light of the provisions of California's restructuring statute, AB 1890;(2) the procedures employed by the CPUC in entering the stipulated judgment did not violate California's openmeeting law for public agencies; and (3) the stipulated judgment did not violate California's public utilitiescode by allegedly altering rates without a public hearing and issuance of findings.         Now that the California Supreme Court has issued its decision on the certified questions, the matterwill return to the Ninth Circuit for final disposition, subject to any efforts by TURN to seek a rehearing beforethe California Supreme Court or pursue further federal appeals.  In the meantime, the case is stayed in thefederal appellate court.         Pending a final outcome of the proceedings, SCE continues to operate under the settlement agreement.  AtJuly 31, 2003, the PROACT regulatory balancing account was overcollected by $148 million.  SCE expects that theovercollection will be returned to customers through a different regulatory balancing account to be approved bythe CPUC.  SCE continues to believe it is probable that ultimate recovery of its past procurement costs throughregulatory mechanisms, including the PROACT, will be validated.  However, SCE cannot predict with certainty theoutcome of the pending legal proceedings.(c)      Exhibits         99       Press release about California Supreme Court decisionPage 3                                                             Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused thisreport to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Said SCE Chairman John E. Bryson:  "Today's landmark decision should clear the path for the federalcourt to uphold our settlement in its entirety.  Recent events illustrate even more clearly the significant roleelectricity plays in our economy.  The court's decision should enable us to continue our leadership role inenhancing the electric system and ensuring continued reliable service to our customers."         The California Supreme Court was responding to three state-law questions posed by the federal NinthCircuit Court of Appeals in a decision issued in September 2002.  In that decision, the Ninth Circuit rejectedall federal law challenges to the stipulated judgment that approved the settlement.  The Ninth Circuit statedthat the only remaining question regarding the validity of the stipulated judgment was whether the CPUC, byagreeing to the settlement, exceeded its authority under California law.  The California Supreme Court has nowruled that the CPUC did not exceed its state-law authority.  The ruling by the California Supreme Court sets thestage for the Ninth Circuit to act expeditiously in issuing a decision that finally resolves TURN's appeal in amanner consistent with the California Supreme Court's guidance.         Pursuant to the settlement agreement, the CPUC authorized SCE to establish an account to track therecovery of its crisis-related costs.  That collection process is now complete and, effective Aug. 1, SCE wasable to reduce rates for all its customers.                                                       # # #
