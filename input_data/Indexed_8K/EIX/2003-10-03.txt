Items 1 through 4 and 6 through 12 are not included because they are inapplicable.                  On October 1, 2003, Exelon Generation notified Edison International's indirect subsidiary, MidwestGeneration, LLC, of the exercise of its option to retain under a power purchase agreement for calendar year 2004the 1,084 megawatts (MW) of capacity and energy from Midwest Generation's Collins Station currently undercontract for calendar year 2003.  Exelon Generation also exercised its option to release from a related powerpurchase agreement 302 MW of capacity and energy (out of a possible total of 694 MW subject to the option) fromMidwest Generation's natural gas and oil-fired peaking units, thereby retaining under that contract 392 MW of thecapacity and energy of such units for calendar year 2004.  The notification received from Exelon Generation hasno effect on its commitments to purchase capacity from these peaking units for the balance of 2003.         Midwest Generation currently intends to operate the peaking units released by Exelon Generation asmerchant plants and to sell the energy and capacity from those units through a combination of bilateralagreements, forward sales and spot market sales.  The ability of Midwest Generation to derive profits from thesale of electricity from the released units will be affected by prevailing market prices and the cost ofproduction, including fuel costs and the cost to comply with environmental regulations.  The cost of productionof merchant plants varies and, accordingly, depending on market conditions, the amount of generation that will besold from merchant assets is expected to vary from unit to unit.  Midwest Generation continues to monitor marketconditions and plans to adjust operations of its merchant plants based on these conditions.  In this regard,Midwest Generation suspended operations at Units 1 and 2 of the Will County plant and Units 4 and 5 at theCollins Station in January 2003.  During the fourth quarter of 2003, Midwest Generation will update its operatingplans for 2004, and will consider at that time whether operations should be suspended or decommissioned for anyreleased units.Page 2                                                             Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused thisreport to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
