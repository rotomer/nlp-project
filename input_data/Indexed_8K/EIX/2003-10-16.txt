Items 1 through 4 and 6 through 12 are not included because they are inapplicable.                  On October 16, 2003, Edison International received cash dividends of $945 million from its utilitysubsidiary, Southern California Edison Company, and $225 million from its nonutility subsidiary, Edison Capital.After receiving the dividends, Edison International has cash on hand of about $1.3 billion.  Edison Internationalexpects to make aggregate payments of approximately $205 million on November 30, 2003, to holders of two seriesof trust preferred securities (QUIPS) issued by affiliates:  EIX Trust I, 7.875% Cumulative Quarterly IncomePreferred Securities, Series A; and EIX Trust II, 8.60% Cumulative Quarterly Income Preferred Securities, SeriesB.  The payments on November 30 would cover all previously deferred distributions on the QUIPS and thedistributions becoming due on November 30.  Edison International then would resume quarterly distributions on theQUIPS, subject to its rights to begin deferring distributions again in the future at its election.  EdisonInternational also intends to use $618 million of the dividend proceeds to repay the remaining principal amountof its 6-7/8% Notes, due in September 2004.         Edison International continues to have as its goal to declare by year-end 2003 a dividend that would bepaid to holders of its common stock in early 2004.  The resumption of dividends from Southern California Edisonand the payment of all deferred amounts on the QUIPS are necessary conditions for Edison International to be ableto declare a dividend to its shareholders.  Any decision by Edison International's board of directors to declarea dividend also depends on the company's financial condition and liquidity and other factors considered relevantby the board.Page 2                                                             Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused thisreport to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
