Other Events.CPUC Litigation Settlement Agreement         On October 22, 2003, the California Supreme Court denied the petition of The Utility Reform Network (TURN) for rehearing ofan August 21, 2003 decision that concluded that the settlement agreement between Southern California Edison Company (SCE) and theCalifornia Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) did not violate California law.  The August 21 decision of the California Supreme Courtwas issued in response to questions certified to it by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  The matter will nowreturn to the Ninth Circuit for final disposition, subject to any efforts by TURN to pursue further federal appeals.         Background         In October 2001, SCE and the CPUC entered into a settlement of SCE's federal district court lawsuit against the CPUC, whichsought a ruling that SCE was entitled to full recovery of certain procurement-related costs.  TURN and other parties appealed to theNinth Circuit seeking to overturn the stipulated judgment of the district court that approved the settlement agreement.         On September 23, 2002, the Ninth Circuit issued an opinion that affirmed the district court on all claims, with theexception of challenges founded upon California state law.  The Ninth Circuit issued a separate order certifying those issues inquestion form to the California Supreme Court.         In its decision on August 21, 2003, the California Supreme Court concluded that the settlement agreement between SCE and theCPUC did not violate California law in any of the respects raised by the certified questions from the Ninth Circuit.  On September 8,2003, TURN filed a petition for rehearing of the California Supreme Court's decision.  On October 22, 2003, the California SupremeCourt issued its order denying the petition for rehearing.         The settlement agreement allowed SCE to recover $3.6 billion of past procurement-related costs through a regulatorybalancing account known as the PROACT.  The recovery of the past procurement-related costs was completed by July 31, 2003.  OnOctober 14, 2003, the CPUC's Energy Division notified SCE that the division completed its final review of PROACT accounting andeliminated the PROACT account effective August 14, 2003.Page 2
