Items 1 through 4 and 6 through 12 are not included because they are inapplicable.                  On October 28, 2003, Standard & Poor's Ratings Service downgraded the senior secured debt rating of Mission Energy HoldingCompany (MEHC) to CCC from B-.  MEHC is a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Edison International.  Standard &Poor's also lowered the credit rating of MEHC's wholly owned direct subsidiary, Edison Mission Energy (EME)(senior unsecured debt to B from BB-), and the credit ratings of MEHC's wholly owned indirect subsidiaries EdisonMission Midwest Holdings Co. (syndicated loan facility to B from BB-) and Edison Mission Marketing & Trading,Inc. (corporate credit rating to B from BB-), as well as the credit ratings on the Monthly Income PreferredSecurities issued by Mission Capital, L.P. (to CCC from B), the pass-through certificates related to thesale-leaseback of Midwest Generation, LLC's Powerton Station and Joliet Station (to B from BB-) and the seniorsecured bank facility related to the sale-leaseback of Midwest Generation, LLC's Collins facility (to B fromBB-).  The ratings remain on CreditWatch with negative implications, where they were placed on October 16, 2003.In addition, Standard & Poor's downgraded the credit rating of the pass-through bonds related to thesale-leaseback of the Homer City facilities (to BB from BBB-) and the bonds related to the financing of EME'sequity interests in the Big Four projects (to B from BB), and placed both ratings on CreditWatch with negativeimplications.         These ratings actions do not trigger any defaults under MEHC's or EME's credit facilities or those ofthe other affected entities.  However, as a result of the ratings action affecting Edison Mission MidwestHoldings, cash currently on deposit in the cash flow recapture account (approximately $245 million) is nowrequired to be used to prepay indebtedness of Edison Mission Midwest Holdings, with the amount of such prepaymentto be applied ratably to the $911 million and $808 million tranches of Edison Mission Midwest Holdings'indebtedness.  In the future, so long as the ratings event continues, amounts of excess cash flow deposited inthe cash flow recapture account at the end of each calendar quarter will be used to prepay, pro rata, amounts thenoutstanding under the Edison Mission Midwest Holdings bank facilities.         In addition, sales of power from EME's First Hydro, Homer City, and Midwest Generation projects requirecredit support, depending upon market conditions and the strategies adopted for the sale of this power.  EME haspreviously projected the potential working capital support for this to be between $100 million and $200 millionfrom time to time during the remainder of 2003 and currently believes these projections to be unchanged.Page 2         The above ratings actions do not affect Standard & Poor's ratings on Edison International(B-/Developing) and Edison International's largest subsidiary, Southern California Edison Company (BB/Developing).
