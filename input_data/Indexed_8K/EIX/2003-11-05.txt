The increase primarily reflects theresolution of certain regulatory proceedings at Southern California Edison (SCE) in the third quarter of 2003 andwrite-offs of capitalized costs at Edison Mission Energy (EME) in the same period last year.        The 2003 third-quarter results also include a gain of 14 cents per share from discontinued operations dueto the sale of SCE's fuel oil pipeline and storage business.  The 2002 third quarter results include earningsfrom discontinued operations of two cents per share at EME's Lakeland project.  Excluding earnings fromdiscontinued operations, EIX's earnings from continuing operations were $1.53 per share in the third quarter of2003 compared to $1.06 per share in 2002.THIRD-QUARTER EARNINGS DETAILEarnings from Continuing Operations- -----------------------------------        SCE's earnings from continuing operations were $329 million in the third quarter of 2003, compared with$234 million in the third quarter of 2002.  This $95 million increase reflects the resolution of certainregulatory proceedings recorded in the third quarter of 2003.  The proceedings include the California PublicUtilities Commission's (CPUC) allocation of certain overhead costs between the CPUC and the Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission (FERC) jurisdictions, the final disposition of the Procurement Related Obligations Account(PROACT) following the CPUC's review, and the Palo Verde nuclear incentive awards.  These favorable results werepartially offset by performance-based ratemaking (PBR) rewards received in 2002, higher net interest expense anddepreciation expense.        EME's 2003 third quarter earnings from continuing operations of $200 million were higher than the 2002third quarter earnings from continuing operations by $57 million primarily due to higher U.S. wholesale energyprices, the start of operations at Phase II of the Sunrise project in June 2003, increased earnings from ContactEnergy and the ISAB and Paiton projects, and the write-off of capitalized costs in 2002.  These favorable resultswere partially offset by lower capacity revenues from EME's Midwest Generation subsidiary due to                                                     - more -Page 1certain units being released from power purchase agreements in 2003 and lower state tax benefits than in 2002.EME's earnings are seasonal with higher earnings expected during the summer months.        Earnings in the third quarter of 2003 for Edison Capital were $14 million compared to $27 million in thesame period last year.  The decrease is primarily due to lower state tax benefits.        Mission Energy Holding Company's results were unchanged from its results in the same period last year."EIX parent and other" incurred a loss of $18 million in the third quarter of 2003 compared to a loss of $35million in the third quarter of 2002.  The decrease in the loss reflects an insurance premium refund to EME fromEIX's insurance subsidiary in the third quarter of 2002 and an asset impairment charge at its Edison O&M Servicesunit in the third quarter of 2002.Earnings from Discontinued Operations- -------------------------------------        The third-quarter financial results include a $44 million, after-tax, gain on the sale of SCE's fuel oilpipeline and storage business in 2003 and earnings from discontinued operations of $6 million in 2002 from EME'sLakeland project.

Excluding SCE's gain of $480 million for implementationof the CPUC's utility-retained generation (URG) decision in 2002, earnings from continuing operations were $585million for the nine months ended September 30, 2003, compared to $599 million for the same period last year.This decrease in core earnings was primarily the result of an EME 2003 asset impairment charge of 46 cents pershare, partially offset by SCE's resolution of certain regulatory proceedings in 2003 and EME's write-offs ofcapitalized costs in 2002.        2003 earnings from discontinued operations include SCE's gain on sale and operating results from its fueloil pipeline and storage business, and adjustments from the sale of EME's Fiddler's Ferry and Ferrybridge (FFF)and Lakeland projects.  2002 earnings from discontinued operations are primarily related to operating resultsfrom EME's Lakeland project.  EME's 2003 loss from the change in accounting principle of $9 million resulted fromimplementation of a new accounting standard for asset retirement obligations.YEAR-TO-DATE EARNINGS DETAILEarnings (Loss) from Continuing Operations- ------------------------------------------        Excluding the $480 million gain in 2002 to implement the URG decision, SCE's earnings from continuingoperations for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 increased by $55 million compared to the same period lastyear.  This increase in core earnings primarily reflects the resolution of certain regulatory proceedings at SCErecorded in the third quarter of 2003.  These proceedings include the CPUC's allocation of certain overheadcosts,                                                     - more -the final disposition of the PROACT account following the CPUC's review, and Palo Verdenuclear incentive awards.  These favorable results were partially offset by regulatory itemsrecorded in 2002 including the CPUC decisions regarding SCE's PBR and URG-related issues.  Earnings were alsoaffected by higher operations and maintenance expenses and depreciation expenses, partially offset by higherrevenue.      EME's earnings from continuing operations for the nine-month period ending September 30, 2003, decreased by$67 million compared to the same period last year primarily due to the asset impairment charge of $150 million,after-tax, for Midwest Generation's peaking facilities last quarter, partially offset by the start of operationsat Phase II of the Sunrise project in June 2003 and the write-off of capitalized costs in 2002.  EME's 2003results were favorably impacted by higher U.S. wholesale energy prices and increased earnings from Contact Energyand the Paiton project.   These favorable items were partially offset by a reduction in revenue from the Illinoispower plants, which reflects the release of certain power and capacity in 2003 from power purchase agreements,lower ancillary revenues and mark-to-market losses on forward contracts at the First Hydro project, and lowerstate tax benefits.        Edison Capital's earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 were $41 million, down $17 millionfrom the same period last year.  This decrease is primarily due to lower state tax benefits and a maturing leaseportfolio which produces lower income, partially offset by lower interest expense.        Earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 for Mission Energy Holding Company weresubstantially unchanged from the results in the same period last year.  "EIX parent and other" incurred a loss of$61 million for the nine-month period ending September 30, 2003, compared to a loss of $79 million in the sameperiod last year.  The decrease in the loss reflects an insurance premium refund to EME from EIX's insurancesubsidiary and an asset impairment charge at Edison O&M Services in the third quarter of 2002.Earnings from Discontinued Operations- -------------------------------------        The increase in earnings from discontinued operations primarily reflects the 2003 gain on sale andoperating results from SCE's fuel oil pipeline and storage business, partially offset by a loss from discontinuedoperations at EME from adjustments related to the sale of the FFF and Lakeland projects in 2003 and operatingincome from Lakeland in 2002.Change in Accounting Principle- ------------------------------        EME's results for the nine-month period ending September 30, 2003 include a three-cent, or $9 million,charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for asset retirement obligations adopted in2003.  Because SCE follows accounting principles for rate-regulated enterprises, implementation of the assetretirement standard did not affect its earnings.                                                     - more -                                                                  Year-To-Date Ended Sept. 30,Earnings (Loss) Per Share (Unaudited)                              2003                  2002            Change- -------------------------------------                              ----                  ----            ------Core Earnings (Loss):  Southern California Edison                                        $2.00               $1.83             $0.17  Edison Mission Energy                                              0.08                0.29             (0.21)  Edison Capital                                                     0.13                0.18             (0.05)  Mission Energy Holding Co.
