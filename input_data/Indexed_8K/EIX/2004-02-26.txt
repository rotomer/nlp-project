FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE- ---------------------                                                                                      Media Contact: (626) 302-1033                                                                                                     WWW.EDISON.COM                                                                                                     --------------                             Edison International Reports 2003 Financial Results - Part I        ROSEMEAD, Calif., February 26, 2004 -- For 2003, Edison International (NYSE: EIX) recorded totalconsolidated earnings of $821 million or $2.52 per share.  In 2002, the company earned $1.1 billion or $3.31 pershare, including a gain of $480 million related to a regulatory decision on Southern California Edison's (SCE)utility-retained generation (URG). Excluding this one-time 2002 gain, EIX's earnings from continuing operations in2003 increased $124 million over 2002.        "During 2003, the company achieved each of its principal goals for the year.  That strong performance allowedus to improve financial strength across the entire company, reduce customer rates to better serve our customers atSouthern California Edison and to declare, after a three-year absence, a dividend to our common stock shareholders,"commented John E. Bryson, Chairman, Edison International.        Major factors contributing to the increase of $124 million over the prior year included the resolution ofsignificant regulatory proceedings at SCE, the impact of higher U.S. wholesale energy prices on Edison MissionEnergy (EME), increased generation from EME's Homer City plant and the absence of write-offs incurred in 2002 atEME.  These positive impacts to earnings were partially offset in 2003 by asset impairment charges at EME.        EIX consolidated earnings for 2003 also included a gain on an SCE asset sale and related operating earningstotaling $50 million reported in discontinued operations, and charges of $9 million for the cumulative effect of achange in accounting principles at EME.2003 EARNINGS DETAILEarnings from Continuing Operations- -----------------------------------        Excluding the $480 million gain in 2002, SCE's earnings from continuing operations were $872 million in 2003,compared to $748 million in 2002.  The $124 million increase results from the net effect of the resolution of severalregulatory proceedings in 2002 and 2003.  The 2003 proceedings include the California Public Utilities Commission's(CPUC) decision on the allocation of certain costs between state and federal regulatory jurisdictions, tax impactsfrom the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rate case, and the final disposition of the Procurement RelatedObligations Account (PROACT) which had been created to record the recovery of SCE's procurement-related obligations.The positive effects of these factors on 2003 earnings were partially offset by the implementation in 2002 of theCPUC's URG decision and                                                                -more-performance-based ratemaking (PBR) rewards received in 2002.  SCE's results also included higher depreciation expenseand lower net interest income, partially offset by higher FERC and PBR revenue.        EME's earnings from continuing operations in 2003 were $28 million compared to $82 million in 2002.  Thedecrease in earnings was primarily due to the asset impairment charge of $150 million, after tax, for MidwestGeneration's peaking facilities and a reduction in capacity revenue for the Illinois power plants and a $32million, after tax, asset impairment charge related to EME's investment in the Brooklyn Navy Yard project,partially offset by higher U.S. wholesale energy prices, increased generation from the Homer City plant and othernet charges in 2002.  These net charges, after tax, include write-offs totaling $66 million related to thecancellation of turbine orders, the suspension of the Powerton SCR project, and the impairment of goodwill and a$27 million loss from a settlement agreement that terminated the obligation to build additional generation inChicago; partially offset by a gain of $43 million from the settlement of a post-retirement employee benefitliability.  EME's 2003 earnings included increased profitability from its interest in the Paiton project inIndonesia and its interest in the Sunrise project which commenced operation of Phase II in June 2003.  Thesefavorable items together with higher profitability from Contact Energy were partially offset by lower state taxbenefits.        Earnings from continuing operations for Edison Capital were $57 million in 2003 compared with $33 millionin 2002.  The increase in earnings was primarily the result of the write-off in 2002 of an investment in aircraftleases with United Airlines totaling $34 million, after-tax, partially offset by a maturing investment portfoliowhich produces lower income.        The 2003-loss at Mission Energy Holding Company (MEHC) increased by $4 million due to lower interestincome and higher consulting fees.  The loss for "EIX parent company and other" decreased $34 million primarilyfrom charges in 2002 associated with businesses the company exited.Earnings (Loss) from Discontinued Operations- --------------------------------------------        Earnings from discontinued operations in 2003 were $51 million, including a $44 million, after-tax, gainon the sale of SCE's fuel oil pipeline business.  The 2002 loss from discontinued operations primarily representsthe one-time asset impairment charge of $77 million, after-tax, resulting from EME's Lakeland project beingplaced into administrative receivership in the U.K., offset by $22 million, in 2002 operating results from theLakeland project.  The results from discontinued operations also included the settlement of minor items relatedto the sale of EME's Fiddler's Ferry and Ferrybridge plants and certain Edison Enterprises subsidiaries in 2001.Changes in Accounting Principles- --------------------------------        EME recorded a $9 million charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for assetretirement obligations.  Because SCE follows accounting principles for rate-regulated enterprises, implementationof the asset retirement standard did not affect its earnings.                                                      -more-        In accordance with a new accounting standard for variable interest entities, EIX had previously reportedthat it would consolidate EME's Brooklyn Navy Yard project and certain Edison Capital projects effective October1, 2003.  The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued revised guidance in December 2003 that allowed delayedimplementation of certain portions of this standard.  As EIX continues to evaluate the impact of this standard,it delayed implementation until the first quarter of 2004.  As a result of this delay in implementation and EME'sDecember 2003 agreement to sell its interest in the Brooklyn Navy Yard project, EME recorded a $32 million, aftertax, impairment charge, recorded in continuing operations.

EIX's fourth quarter 2003 earnings fromcontinuing operations were $194 million, or $0.59 per share, compared to $56 million, or $0.18 per share in2002.  The improvement in 2003 earnings was primarily due to the resolution of regulatory issues combined withlower operating and maintenance expenses in 2003 at SCE, improved plant performance at some of EME's foreignplants, the absence of Edison Capital's 2002 write-off of an airline lease and EME's 2002 loss from discontinuedoperations.Earnings from Continuing Operations- -----------------------------------        SCE's earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2003 were $222 million, up $69 millionfrom the same period last year.  The increase is primarily due to the tax impact from the FERC rate case combinedwith lower operating and maintenance expenses, partially offset by PBR rewards and qualifying facilitiesincentives received in 2002.        EME broke even on a continuing operations basis in the fourth quarter of 2003 compared to a loss fromcontinuing operations of $13 million in 2002.  The improved results are due in part to higher profitability fromthe Paiton and First Hydro plants and higher U.S. wholesale energy prices, partially offset by an assetimpairment charge of $32 million related to EME's investment in the Brooklyn Navy Yard project.  The fourthquarter of 2002 included a gain of $43 million from the settlement of a post-retirement employee benefitliability; partially offset by a $27 million loss from a settlement agreement that terminated the obligation tobuild additional generation in Chicago.  EME's earnings are seasonal with higher earnings expected during thesummer months.                                                      -more-        Edison Capital had earnings from continuing operations of $16 million in the fourth quarter of 2003compared to a loss of $25 million in the fourth quarter of 2002.  The increase in earnings was mainly the resultof the write-off in 2002 of an investment in aircraft leases with United Airlines totaling $34 million, aftertax.        The loss at MEHC increased due to lower interest income.
