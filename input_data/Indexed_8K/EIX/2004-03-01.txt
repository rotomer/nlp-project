Theamendment provides that the Board will not trigger the rights plan to make the rights exercisable without priorapproval by the Company's shareholders.         The Board also adopted a policy that Edison International's existing rights plan, which will expire byits terms in November 2006, will not be extended, and that the Board would seek shareholder approval beforeadopting any future shareholder rights plan unless, due to timing constraints or other reasons consistent withthe Board's fiduciary duties, a committee consisting solely of independent directors determines that it would bein the best interests of shareholders to adopt the plan before obtaining shareholder approval.  Any rights planadopted by the Board without such prior shareholder approval would automatically terminate on the firstanniversary of the adoption of the plan unless the plan is approved by Edison International's shareholders beforeit terminates.         Shareholders approved a non-binding proposal on this issue at Edison International's annual meeting lastyear.                                                        ###
