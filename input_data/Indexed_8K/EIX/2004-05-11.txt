"We are off to an encouraging start for the year, led by improved results at Edison Mission Energy andcontinued strength at Southern California Edison," said EIX Chairman John Bryson.      Reported earnings in the first quarter of 2003 included a three-cents-per-share charge at EME from theimplementation of a new accounting principle and one cent per share in earnings from discontinued operations atSCE.  EIX's earnings from continuing operations, which exclude the two items above, were 30 cents per share inthe first quarter of 2004 compared to 19 cents per share in the same period last year.      SCE earnings from continuing operations were essentially unchanged with $100 million in the first quarterof 2004, compared to $99 million in the same period last year.      EME's first quarter 2004 earnings from continuing operations were $31 million compared to a loss of $8million in the same period last year.  The improved results are primarily due to stronger operating performanceat the Illinois Plants, driven by higher merchant generation and wholesale energy prices, and higher ancillaryservices and mark-to-market impacts on forward contracts at the First Hydro project in the UK.  The ContactEnergy projects in New Zealand, the Loy Yang B project in Australia and the Paiton project in Indonesia alsocontributed to the earnings increase.   First quarter results for 2004 include a $29 million after-tax gain fromthe sale of EME's interest in Four Star Oil & Gas.  These favorable items were partially offset by outages in2004 at the Homer City project and 2003 earnings at Four Star Oil & Gas, which did not occur in 2004 due to thesale.  EME's earnings are seasonal with higher earnings expected during the summer months.     Edison Capital's earnings for the first quarter of 2004 were $11 million, down $4 million from the sameperiod last year.  This decrease is primarily due to a maturing investment portfolio which produces lowerincome.     The first quarter 2004 losses from Mission Energy Holding Company of $25 million and "EIX parent company andother" of $19 million were essentially unchanged from the same period last year.                                                     - more -     Discontinued operations of $3 million in the first quarter of 2003 reflect earnings from SCE's fuel oilpipeline and storage business, which was sold in the third quarter of 2003.     Edison Capital's 2004 results include a $1 million charge for the cumulative effect of a change inaccounting principle reflecting the impact of Edison Capital's implementation of an accounting standard thatrequires the consolidation of certain variable interest entities.  EME's 2003 results include a $9 million chargerelated to the accounting standard for recording asset retirement obligations.  Because SCE follows accountingprinciples for rate-regulated enterprises, implementation of the asset retirement accounting standard did notaffect its earnings.
