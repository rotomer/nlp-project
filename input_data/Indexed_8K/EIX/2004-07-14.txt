Southern California Edison is the largest subsidiary ofEdison International.  The general rate case decision authorized an annual increase of approximately $73 millionin base rates.  Southern California Edison had requested an increase of about $250 million.         The decision is retroactive to May 22, 2003, when the decision initially was forecasted to be rendered.The balance in the account established to record the recovery of the authorized rate increase since that datewill be recovered in rates over the next 12 months.  To stabilize customer rates, Southern California Edisonproposed that the general rate case decision be combined with several other rate-related proceedings.  SouthernCalifornia Edison estimates that the outcome of this consolidated rate decision will decrease average rates forbundled service customers by 0.34%.         The general rate case decision approves nearly all of Southern California Edison's request to continueits multi-billion infrastructure investment program through 2005.  This program is essential to preserve currentlevels of electric grid reliability.  The decision also establishes revenue adjustments for 2004 and 2005 to meetcost escalation and planned capital investments.         The decision rejects Southern California Edison's requested increase in depreciation to cover the risingdisposal costs of retired equipment, instead choosing to shift recovery of about $114 million annually to futureyears.  The balance of the reduction in Southern California Edison's request is primarily in the areas ofcapital-related ratemaking adjustments of about $42 million, and operations and maintenance expense of about $17million.         While Southern California Edison's case was pending before the California Public Utilities Commission,the company identified $28 million of supplemental costs being incurred above the general rate case forecast.The commission's final decision did not recognize these cost increases, which are primarily in the area oftransmission and distribution operations.  Southern California Edison intends to review its operations to betteralign its costs with the authorized revenues.Page 2         Southern California Edison is planning to submit a notice of intent for its 2006 general rate case thissummer and then file a formal application in the fall once it has met the California Public UtilitiesCommission's standard for completeness.  In this upcoming application, Southern California Edison will renew itsrequest to establish appropriate levels of operating and depreciation expenses.
