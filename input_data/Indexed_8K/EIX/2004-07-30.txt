Thedecrease is primarily due to a 2004 lease termination partially offset by a 2003 asset impairment and the neteffect of regulatory adjustments that occurred in 2003 and 2004.        Excluding these items, EIX's second quarter 2004 earnings were 32 cents per share, compared to earningsof 37 cents per share for the same period last year.  The decrease primarily reflects the expiration of the SanOnofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS) incentive mechanism at Southern California Edison (SCE) partiallyoffset by improved operating results at Edison Mission Energy's (EME) projects.        "With the July 8 Rate Case decision for SCE and with a total $3 billion in executed sales agreements forour EME international power stations, we have taken critical steps forward.  We can now look forward to makingthe substantial capital investments necessary over the next five years to serve well our utility customers, andto earnings and dividend growth for our shareholders," commented John E. Bryson, Chairman, Edison International.        Beginning in the second quarter of 2004, the results of Mission Energy Holding Company-parent only and itswholly owned subsidiary, EME, are presented on a consolidated basis as Mission Energy Holding Company consolidated(MEHC).  This change is due primarily to the elimination of restrictions on dividends that EME may pay to itsparent company resulting from the removal of the ring-fencing provisions in the second quarter of 2004.        The 2004 results include a charge of $1.80 per share at MEHC related to the termination of the CollinsFacility lease and earnings of 33 cents per share at SCE from regulatory adjustments related to theimplementation of SCE's 2003 General Rate Case (GRC) decision.  The 2003 results include a charge of 46 cents pershare at MEHC related to the impairment of eight small peaking plants in Illinois and earnings of 16 cents pershare at SCE from various positive regulatory adjustments.SECOND-QUARTER EARNINGS DETAIL        SCE earnings from continuing operations were $242 million in the second quarter of 2004, compared with$223 million in the second quarter of 2003.  The expiration of the incremental cost incentive pricing (ICIP)mechanism at SONGS resulted in a decrease in earnings of $47 million.  This decrease was more than offset by aquarter-over-quarter benefit in regulatory adjustments of $55 million and improved operating results.  Theearnings impacts of these positive regulatory items in the second quarter of 2004 ($107 million) from theimplementation of the 2003 GRC decision were                                                      -MORE-partially offset by positive regulatory items that occurred in the second quarter of 2003 ($52 million) whichincluded the tax impacts of a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rate case and prior-period Palo Verdeincentive awards.        MEHC, on a consolidated basis with EME, had a loss from continuing operations of $1.88 per share comparedto a loss of 58 cents per share in the second quarter of 2003.  MEHC's parent-only results for the second quarterof 2004 were substantially unchanged from the results in the same period last year.  EME's loss from continuingoperations was $585 million in the second quarter of 2004 compared to a loss from continuing operations of $165million in the second quarter of 2003.  The increase in EME's loss was primarily due to the $586 million chargerelated to the termination of the lease of the 2,698-MW gas-fired Collins Station held by Midwest Generation. Thedecrease in earnings also reflects higher corporate interest expense from $800 million in new debt at MissionEnergy Holdings International and the absence of earnings from the Four Star Oil & Gas project as compared to thesecond quarter of 2003 due to the sale of EME's interest in that project in the first quarter of 2004.  Thedecrease in earnings was partially offset by the 2003 charge of $150 million related to the impairment of MidwestGeneration's small peaking plants and improved operating results at ISAB, Contact Energy, First Hydro and HomerCity.  On an annual basis, EME's earnings are seasonal with higher earnings expected during the summer months.         Earnings in the second quarter of 2004 for Edison Capital were substantially unchanged from the resultsin the same period last year.        The loss for "EIX parent company and other" decreased by $5 million primarily due to lower net interestexpense.        The second-quarter 2003 financial results include earnings from discontinued operations of $2 millionfrom SCE's fuel oil pipeline and storage business which was sold in the third quarter of 2003, offset by a $2million loss from adjustments related to the sale of MEHC's Fiddler's Ferry and Ferrybridge (FFF) and Lakelandprojects.

The 2004 results include a charge of $1.80 pershare related to the termination of the Collins Facility lease and the net benefit of the sale of the company'sinterest in Four Star Oil and Gas of two cents at MEHC and earnings of 33 cents per share at SCE from regulatoryadjustments related to its 2003 GRC decision.  The 2003 results include a charge of 46 cents per share at MEHCrelated to the impairment of eight small peaking plants in Illinois and earnings of 16 cents per share at SCEfrom various positive regulatory adjustments.  Excluding these charges, earnings increased five cents per shareprimarily from favorable operating results at several of EME's operating plants, offset by lower earnings at SCEprimarily from the expiration of the SONGS incentive mechanism.        EIX had a loss from continuing operations of $275 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2004,compared with earnings from continuing operations of $85 million for the same period last year.  Continuingoperations exclude the impacts from changes in accounting principles and discontinued operations, as discussedbelow.YEAR-TO-DATE EARNINGS DETAIL        SCE's earnings from continuing operations in the first half of 2004 increased by $20 million, compared tothe same period last year.  The reasons for the increase in SCE's year-to-date earnings from continuingoperations are the same as those discussed in the detailed description of the second quarter above.        MEHC, on a consolidated basis, had a loss from continuing operations of $603 million compared to a lossof $222 million in the same period last year.  MEHC's parent-only results for the six-month period ending June30, 2004 were substantially unchanged from the results in the same period last year.  EME's loss from continuingoperations for the six-month period ending June 30, 2004, increased by $381 million compared to the same periodlast year primarily due to the $586 million charge for the termination of the Collins lease, partially offset bythe 2003 asset impairment charge of                                                      -MORE-$150 million.  EME's results were favorably impacted by higher energy prices and increased generation at theIllinois plants, the gain on the sale of EME's interest in the Four Star Oil & Gas project, and improvedoperating results at First Hydro, Contact Energy, and ISAB.  Partially offsetting these favorable items were areduction in revenue resulting from sale of EME's interest in the Four Star Oil & Gas investment, higher interestexpense and outages in 2004 at the Homer City project.        Edison Capital's earnings for the six-months ended June 30, 2004 were $22 million, down $5 million fromthe same period last year.  This decrease is primarily due to a maturing lease portfolio which produces lowerincome.        The loss for the six months ended June 30, 2004 for "EIX parent company and other" decreased by $6million compared to the results in the same period last year mainly due to lower net interest expense.        The financial results for the six months ended June 30, 2003 include earnings from discontinuedoperations of $6 million from SCE's fuel oil pipeline and storage business which was sold in the third quarter of2003, offset by a $2 million loss from adjustments related to the sale of MEHC's Fiddler's Ferry and Ferrybridge(FFF) and Lakeland projects.        Edison Capital's 2004 results for the six months ended June 30, 2004 include a $1 million charge for thecumulative effect of a change in accounting principle reflecting the impact of Edison Capital's implementation ofan accounting standard that requires the consolidation of certain variable interest entities.  MEHC'sconsolidated results for the six-month period ending June 30, 2003 include a three-cent, or $9 million, chargefor the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for asset retirement obligations adopted in 2003.As SCE follows accounting principles for rate-regulated enterprises, implementation of this new standard did notaffect its earnings.
