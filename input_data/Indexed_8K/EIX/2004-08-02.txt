(USA), July 30, 2004 - Edison Mission Energy (EME) and its parent Edison International(NYSE: EIX) today announced that EME has entered into an agreement to sell its remaining 5,381 MW (net)international power generation portfolio, owned by a Dutch holding company which EME refers to as the "BV", to aconsortium comprised of International Power plc (70%) and Mitsui & Co., Ltd. (30%). The purchase price is$2.3 billion, subject to certain purchase price adjustments prior to closing resulting in an expected net purchaseprice of approximately $2.2 billion.         The BV sale agreement is an important step toward EME achieving its previously announced intention tosell its entire international portfolio of generation assets in Europe, Asia Pacific and Puerto Rico.  Closing ofthe BV transaction is subject to approval by International Power's shareholders, and to a number of regulatoryapprovals and project level consents.  The sale is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2004.         This transaction follows EME's recently reported sale of its 51.2% holding in Contact Energy Ltd. toOrigin Energy Limited for approximately $750 million.  Together, these two transactions represent an aggregateequity purchase price of $3.05 billion, which is expected to yield proceeds of approximately $2.5 billion to EMEafter taxes and transaction expenses.         Upon closing, these transactions will complete the third step in EME's four step restructuring planannounced in November 2003.  These transactions combined with the tax benefits from the decommissioning of theCollins Power Station in Illinois will generate approximately $2.8 billion of cash from restructuringactivities.  EME plans to use this cash to begin the fourth and final delevering step of its restructuring planby paying down an $800 million bridge loan of Mission Energy Holdings International, Inc, a direct subsidiary ofEME.         After completion of the BV and Contact sales, a financially healthier EME will be focused on itsdomestic operations, which include approximately 7,500 MW of low cost, coal-fired generation and just under 1,100MW of contracted gas-fired generation located predominantly in California.                                                     - MORE -         International Power plc is a global independent electricity generating company with 11,210MW (net) inoperation and 1,655MW (net) under construction.
