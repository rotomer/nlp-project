Maintaining a competitive dividend
Balancing dividends with the cash needed to fund robust growth
Maintaining a strong balance sheet
Current annual dividend rate of $0.80/share
Payout ratio is 46% of projected 2004 core earnings Expect to maintain a similar payout ratio for 2005
Plan to recommend a 2005 dividend of $1.00/share to the Board Longer-term, targeting a payout ratio range of 4555% excluding MEHC earnings
With projected earnings, the target range can provide steady increases in the dividend after 2005
1. See Appendix for GAAP reconciliation.

Edison International  Balance Sheet Strength
Sufficient cash generation to support a large investment program producing substantial earnings growth, and a competitive and growing dividend
The projected long-term growth rate does not assume additional equity
MEHC will continue to reduce debt over the long-term to address excess leverage
Expect to maintain SCE capital structure of 48% equity
Edison Capital and the EIX Parent will focus on reducing their cost of debt, improving financing flexibility and reducing overall debt levels while providing for the projected growth at Edison Capital Over the long term, EIX consolidated debt-to-capital is targeted to decline from approximately 60% to 50%
Excluding MEHC, debt to capital is targeted to stay in the range of 4550%

Mission Energy Holding Company MEHC Contribution to EIX
Successful execution of the Restructuring Plan substantially addresses MEHC's survivability. Execution of the strategic plan and solid performance at MEHC will add value for EIX shareholders.
MEHC can contribute meaningfully to EIX earnings growth with reasonable confidence
Continued reduction in high cost debt and G&A expense contributes to earnings
Low cost coal portfolio takes advantage of favorable gas/coal spread
Significant growth in earnings probable from recovery in capacity markets
Current long-term forecasts do not assume or rely on new project investments
Given the hybrid system of electricity regulation in the U.S., EIX benefits from having both a utility and a competitive generator
MEHC provides EIX with a potentially valuable option as a vehicle for discretionary investments and growth
17
 
Mission Energy Holding Company  Strategy
Reduce business and financial risk by improving financial strength, operating efficiency, and predictability of cash flow and earnings
Complete the Restructuring Plan
Close the sale of the international generation facilities maximizing net after-tax proceeds
Pay off the "BV" bridge loan
Continually reduce leverage using cash flow from operations
Manage fuel supply, emissions, and environmental controls to protect operating margins
Reduce overhead expenses in the aftermath of the asset sales Build a laddered, diversified portfolio of power and fuel supply contracts and hedges to lock in margins and reduce earnings and cash flow volatility
18
 
Mission Energy Holding Company  Value Drivers
Even without the international projects, MEHC core earnings are expected to increase in 2005 over 2004, and show significant double-digit compound annual growth in the longer term
Earnings Drivers Estimates of Contribution (pre-tax earnings)
COST REDUCTION
Elimination of restructuring costs and overheads directly associated with international assets $45  $50 million (annually)
Further reductions in overhead costs $30 million (annually)
DEBT REDUCTION
Reduction of callable high-cost debt from net restructuring proceeds $105  $145 million (multi-year)
POWER MARKET METRICS
Energy prices: for every $ 1/MWh increase $47 million
Capacity prices: for every $10/kWyr increase $75 million
19
 
Mission Energy Holding Company Potential Upsides and Risks
Additional future upside potential from:
Contracting for cash and earnings stabilization
New generation investments
Consolidations, providing cost reduction opportunities
Risks
Collapse in gas prices, or a spike in coal and emissions prices
Homer City coal supply contracts progressively rolling off post 2006
Illinois coal plants (78% of MEHC's coal burn) insulated due to use of abundant Powder River Basin coal and transportation contracted for remainder of decade
Credit and collateral requirements to support hedging and contracting
Competes with ability to retire debt early
Environmental regulations requiring additional capex
Approximately $300 million in environmental capex at Homer City in the 5-year outlook for mercury control and SO2
Potential future mercury controls expenditures at MWG plants, but expenditures more likely to be in the next decade

a) Includes earnings from EME's international assets expected to be sold and reported as discontinued operations in 2004. b) Includes one-time items primarily associated with the 2003 GRC Decision. c) Includes a loss from the termination of the Collins lease, loss from the small peaker impairment, gain on sale of EME's interest in Four Star, and an expected net gain on sales of the international assets. The international asset sale gain will be reported as Discontinued Operations. d) Write-off of unamortized costs upon retirement of debt e) Anticipated tax audit settlements
Slide 6: 2005 reported EPS is forecast to be $2.20 and would represent an increase of about 1% from prior year's midpoint due to the inclusion of non-recurring items. The long-term CAGR based on reported earnings would be 4%12%. The lower range reflects the 2004 non-recurring items which include positive one-time regulatory adjustments at SCE totaling $157 million, partially offset by a $14 million charge due to the retirement of the EIX QUIPS.
Slide 7: CAGR ranges are presented based on core earnings. Based on reported earnings, the CAGRs are projected to be 4%12% for EIX, 1%3% for SCE and 4%5% for EIX assuming no earnings from MEHC. The lower ranges reflect the 2004 non-recurring items which include positive one-time regulatory adjustments at SCE totaling $157 million, partially offset by a $14 million charge due to the retirement of the EIX QUIPS.
Slide 8: Ratios presented are based on core earnings. Based on reported earnings per share, the 2004 payout ratio is expected to be 37%.

Appendix
Slide 5: 2005 reported EPS is forecast to be $2.20 and would represent an increase of about 1% from the prior year's midpoint due to the inclusion of non-recurring items.
Slide 6: Based on reported earnings, the individual company long-term CAGR ranges are from 2%3% for SCE and 4%12% for EIX consolidated. The lower ranges reflect the 2004 non-recurring items which include positive one-time regulatory adjustments at SCE totaling $157 million, partially offset by a $14 million charge due to the retirement of the EIX QUIPS.
Slide 19: The calculations for the targeted debt to capital ratios presented exclude non-recourse debt. The calculations also include EME's guarantee of the off-balance sheet Powerton-Joliet Lease of about $1.5 billion as debt and classify redeemable preferred securities as preferred securities. The comparable, expected debt to capital ratios based on the GAAP classifications for the projected capital components, including non-recourse debt, excluding EME guarantee of the Powerton-Joliet Lease and classifying redeemable preferred securities as debt are for the EIX debt ratio 69% for 2004, 63% for 2005, 61% for 2006, 2007, and 2008, and 58% for 2009. For the EIX debt ratio without MEHC the ratios are 52% for 2004, 51% for 2005, 52% for 2006, 2007, and 2008, and 53% for 2009.
