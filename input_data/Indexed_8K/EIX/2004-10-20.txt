The San Onofre units each include a pressurizer tank that contains 30 heater penetrationsfabricated from the same material used in the steam generator tubes.  These penetrations, also known as sleeves,are 13-inch long sections of pipe welded into the bottom of the pressurizer.  During the current Unit 3 refuelingoutage, Southern California Edison performed inspections of two sleeves and found evidence of degradation.Degradation of the pressurizer sleeves has been a concern in the nuclear industry for some time, and SouthernCalifornia Edison had been planning to replace all of the sleeves in Units 2 and 3 during the next refueling foreach unit in 2005 and 2006.  Southern California Edison has decided to move the planned replacement of Unit 3'spressurizer sleeves forward from 2006 to the current outage.  This extra work will lengthen the current outagefrom 55 days to the range of 95 to 110 days.  Extending the current outage to do this work now allows SouthernCalifornia Edison to move the 2006 refueling outage, previously scheduled for the summer of 2006, out of the peaksummer period to the fall or winter of 2006.  Southern California Edison will incur about $9 million of capitalexpenditures during 2005 that otherwise would have occurred in 2006.  Southern California Edison plans to replacethe pressurizer sleeves in Unit 2 during its next scheduled outage in 2005.         During the current outage, Southern California Edison also conducted a planned inspection of the Unit 3reactor vessel head and found indications of degradation.  Although the degradation is far below the level atwhich leakage would occur, Southern California Edison plans to make repairs during the current outage usingreadily available tooling and a Nuclear Regulatory Commission-approved repair technique.  While this is SanOnofre's first experience of this kind of degradation to the reactor vessel heads, the detection and repair ofsimilar degradation at other plants are now common in the industry.  SCE plans to replace the Unit 2 and Unit 3reactor vessel heads during refueling outages in 2009-2010.         The California Public Utilities Commission will review the reasonableness of outage-related capitalcosts and replacement power costs in future ratemaking proceedings.  Southern California Edison believes thecosts are reasonable, recovery of the costs should be authorized, and that the acceleration of the needed repairsshould not impact its earnings.         On October 21, 2004, Southern California Edison issued a press release announcing the plannedreplacement and repair activities.  A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1.Page 2                                   (c)      Exhibits         See the Exhibit Index below.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON COMPANY LOGO                                                        News Release                                                                           Contact:  Raymond Golden, (949) 368-9880                                                                                                 www.edisonnews.com                                             ROSEMEAD, Calif., Oct. 21, 2004 - Officials of Southern California Edison (SCE) today announced theextension of the current scheduled refueling and maintenance outage of its San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station(SONGS) Unit 3 in order to replace certain components in which degradation has been detected.  Tubes, called"sleeves," containing electric heating elements that are part of a "pressurizer" are replaced when inspectionsreveal signs of degradation.  Standard maintenance procedures include either replacing them individually or allat once, as SCE has elected to do in this case in order to maximize efficiencies.  This equipment replacementprocess occurs at other U.S. nuclear plants of this type and poses no danger to the public.         The degradation discovered in Unit 3 was anticipated.  SCE had in place a contingency plan to do thisrepair in the current outage and that plan is now being implemented.  Extending the current outage to do thiswork allows SCE to move the 2006 refueling outage, previously scheduled for the summer of 2006, out of the peaksummer period to the fall or winter of 2006.         "Doing this maintenance work now will help ensure that Unit 3 is online during the critical summerperiod of 2006," said SCE Chief Executive Officer Alan Fohrer.  "In addition, replacement power costs are lowernow than during summer months when supplies are tighter and prices are typically higher."         Utility officials indicated that inspections of two of the 30 Unit 3 heater sleeves revealed noradioactive leaks.  However, inspection crews did discover the type of degradation that triggers this replacementprocess.  The Unit 3 refueling and maintenance outage that began on Sept. 28 originally was scheduled to last 55days.  The unit now will return to service in late December 2004 or January 2005.         A second maintenance project underway during the current outage involves repairing degradation common toplants of this type found in the Unit 3 "reactor vessel head."   As with the heater sleeve inspection and repairprocess, no radioactive leaks resulted from the reactor head degradation and the repair process poses no risk tothe public.         All repair procedures used by SCE crews conform to Nuclear Regulatory Commission guidelines.                                                       # # #
