The sale of     the remaining international assets is also expected to provide a substantial gain.o    Under applicable accounting rules, the company recognized this quarter a "deferred tax benefit" of $327     million.  The balance of the gain from the sale of the international assets will be recorded at the completion of     the sale.o        Earnings per share - $2.49o        Revenues - $3.2 billion        For the third quarter of 2004, EIX recorded consolidated earnings of $2.49 per share compared to earnings of$1.67 per share in the same period last year.  The increase is primarily due to net benefits related to the sale ofMEHC's interest in Contact Energy and the planned sale of its international projects, partially offset by reducedearnings from MEHC's Illinois and Homer City projects and lower net regulatory items at SCE in 2004.        "During the third quarter, the company took a major step to secure the financial recovery of MEHC by selling,at a substantial gain, its interest in Contact Energy and making excellent progress towards completion of the sale ofthe remaining international projects.  This step, coupled with constructive prior regulatory decisions for SCE, set afoundation for an increase in our dividend and a 5-year outlook for earnings growth substantially above our peers'average," commented John Bryson, Chairman, Edison International.        Beginning in the third quarter of 2004, MEHC reclassified the results of its international projects todiscontinued operations.  This reclassification included a 39-cent-per-share net gain on the sale of its interest inContact Energy and a deferred tax benefit of $1.00 per share related to the planned sale of its remaininginternational projects.  The deferred tax benefit was recorded to recognize the higher tax basis of                                                        - more -MEHC's international holding company (BV) over the related book basis, as required by accounting rules applicable todiscontinued operations.        SCE's earnings from continuing operations were $259 million in the third quarter of 2004, compared with $329million in the third quarter of 2003.  The decrease in third quarter earnings primarily reflects a $79 millionreduction in regulatory items.  After adjusting for regulatory items, higher revenue authorized in the utility's 2003general rate case (GRC) for 2004 more than offset the expiration of the incentive mechanism for the San Onofre nuclearplant and higher operating and maintenance expense.  SCE's 2004 third quarter earnings included two positiveregulatory items totaling $64 million resulting from the implementation of the 2003 GRC decision which were partiallyoffset by $14 million for the anticipated refund of employee safety awards previously recognized.  Positive regulatoryitems that occurred in the third quarter of 2003 included $79 million related to the California Public UtilitiesCommission's (CPUC) decision on cost allocation and $50 million for the disposition of the PROACT account.        MEHC's income from continuing operations was $59 million in the third quarter of 2004 compared to $136 millionin the third quarter of 2003.  The decrease was primarily due to Midwest Generation's (MWG) lower capacity paymentsreceived under the Exelon power purchase agreements, an $18 million impairment charge related to MWG's small peakingplants and reduced earnings from the Homer City facilities due to lower generation and higher fuel costs related tothe cost of emission allowances.  The decrease in earnings was also due to the absence of earnings from Four Star Oil& Gas Company as compared to the third quarter of 2003 due to the sale of MEHC's interest in that project in the firstquarter of 2004.  On an annual basis, MEHC's earnings are seasonal with higher earnings expected during the summermonths.         Earnings in the third quarter of 2004 for Edison Capital were substantially unchanged from the sameperiod last year.  The loss for "EIX parent company and other" decreased by $2 million primarily due to lower netinterest expense.        Beginning in the third quarter of 2004, MEHC reclassified the results of its international projects todiscontinued operations for all periods presented due to completion of the sale of its interest in Contact Energyand its agreement to sell the remaining international projects.  The financial results for the third quarter of2004 included a net after-tax gain on sale of Contact Energy of $126 million, which includes a $141 million gainon sale partially offset by a $15 million cost on a foreign exchange option. In addition, MEHC recorded a deferredtax benefit of $327 million to recognize the higher tax basis of its international holding company (BV) over itsbook basis as required by accounting rules applicable to discontinued operations.  The sale of the remaininginternational projects is structured as a sale of the stock of the BV, which held the international assets ofMEHC.  The taxable income from the sale of MEHC's interest in Contact Energy increased the stock basis of the BV,resulting in a reduction to the projected tax on the sale of the remaining projects and recognition underaccounting rules of this deferred tax benefit.        Excluding these items, the earnings from discontinued operations were $47 million during the third quarterof 2004 compared to $39 million during the third quarter of 2003.  The increase in earnings was due to improvedperformance at Loy Yang B and First Hydro offset by interest costs related to the $800 million bridge loancompleted in December 2003.  The third-quarter 2003 financial results also include a gain on sale of $44 millionfrom SCE's pipeline business.                                                      -more-                                                                Quarter Ended Sept. 30,Earnings (Loss) Per Share (Unaudited)                                  2004              2003            Change- -------------------------------------                           -----------------------------------------------  Southern California Edison                                          $0.79             $1.01           $(0.22)  Mission Energy Holding Company                                       0.18              0.42            (0.24)  Edison Capital                                                       0.04              0.04               --  EIX parent company and other                                        (0.05)            (0.06)            0.01- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------EIX Consol.

The 2003non-core adjustments include earnings of 58 cents per share at SCE from various positive regulatory items,discontinued operations along with a gain on sale from SCE's pipeline business of 15 cents per share, a charge of47 cents per share at MEHC related to the impairment of eight small peaking plants in Illinois and theGordonsville facility, and a 3-cent-per-share charge for a change in accounting principles at MEHC related toasset retirement obligations.        Excluding the non-core items, EIX's earnings were $1.55 per share for the nine-month period endingSeptember 30, 2004 compared to $1.69 per share for the same period last year.  Most of the decrease reflects theexpiration of SCE's incentive mechanism for the San Onofre nuclear plant, lower earnings at MEHC's Homer Cityfacility, and the absence of earnings from MEHC's interest in the Four Star Oil & Gas Company, which was sold inthe first quarter of 2004.  The decrease was partially offset by higher authorized revenue at SCE and improvedoperating performance at MEHC's international projects.        SCE's earnings from continuing operations for the nine-month period ending September 30, 2004 decreasedby $50 million, compared to the same period last year.  The decrease primarily reflects the expiration of theincentive mechanism for the San Onofre nuclear plant and the net effect of several regulatory items partiallyoffset by higher authorized revenues. The regulatory items include those discussed above as well as an additional33 cents per share in 2004 primarily related to the implementation of the 2003 GRC decision and 19 cents pershare in 2003 primarily related to prior period incentive awards at the Palo Verde nuclear plant and the taximpact of a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rate case.        MEHC, on a consolidated basis, had a loss from continuing operations of $623 million compared to a lossof $114 million in the same period last year.   MEHC's loss from continuing operations for the nine-month periodending September 30, 2004, increased by $509 million compared to the same period last year primarily due to the$608 million in charges for both the termination of the Collins lease and impairment of Illinois small peakingplants, partially offset by the 2003 asset impairment charge of $150 million related to the Illinois smallpeaking plants.  MEHC's 2004 results were favorably impacted by the gain on the sale of EME's interest in theFour Star Oil & Gas Company which offset the earnings recorded in 2003 from the ownership of the Four Star Oil &Gas investment.  The 2004 earnings from the Homer City facilities were lower in 2004 than 2003 due to lowergeneration and higher fuel costs related to the cost of emission allowances.        Edison Capital's earnings for the nine-months ended September 30, 2004 were $34 million, down $7 millionfrom the same period last year.  This decrease is primarily due to its maturing lease and housing portfolioswhich produce lower income.        The loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 for "EIX parent company and other" decreased by $8million compared to the same period last year mainly due to lower net interest expense.                                                     - more -        Earnings from discontinued operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2004, include a gain onsale and operating results totaling $50 million from SCE's pipeline business which was sold in the third quarterof 2003.  At MEHC, in addition to the net gain on the sale of its interest in Contact Energy and the deferred taxbenefit discussed above, the financial results of discontinued operations for the nine months ended September 30,2004 were $126 million compared to $66 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2003.  Earnings increasedprimarily due to the improved performance of First Hydro, Contact Energy, Loy Yang B and Paiton partially offsetby higher interest costs on the $800 million bridge loan completed in December 2003.     MEHC's consolidated results for the nine-month period ending September 30, 2003 include a $9-million chargefor the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for asset retirement obligations adopted in 2003.As SCE follows accounting principles for rate-regulated enterprises, implementation of this new standard did notaffect its earnings.  Edison Capital's 2004 results for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 include a $1million charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle reflecting the impact of EdisonCapital's implementation of an accounting standard that requires the consolidation of certain variable interestentities.
