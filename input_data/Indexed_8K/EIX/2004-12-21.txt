(MECIBV) pursuant to a Purchase Agreement, datedJuly 29, 2004, by and between EME and a consortium comprised of International Power plc (70%) and Mitsui & Co.,Ltd. (30%), referred to as IPM. The Purchase Agreement was entered into following a competitive bidding process.The sale of MECIBV included the sale of EME's interests in ten electric power generating projects or companieslocated in Europe, Asia, Australia, and Puerto Rico.  As discussed further below, EME's interests in the CBK,TriEnergy and Doga projects were excluded from the sale.  Consideration from the sale of MECIBV and relatedassets was $2.0 billion in cash. The cash proceeds from the sale, net of transaction costs and taxes, may be used byEME to repay debt, to support contracting and hedges of power sales, to make capital expenditures for EME's remainingdomestic projects and for investment.  In anticipation of the sale, the remaining $200 million of the$800 million secured loan at Mission Energy Holdings International, Inc., another subsidiary of EME, was repaid onDecember 14, 2004.         On December 16, 2004, Edison International and EME issued a press release announcing that EME hadcompleted the sale.  A copy of the press release has been attached as Exhibit 99.1. Such information isincorporated herein by reference.         EME has entered into a Purchase Agreement, dated as of November 5, 2004 (the "CBK PSA") with its partnerin the CBK project, IMPSA S.A to sell EME's interest in the CBK project to them.  EME and IMPSA executed the CBKPSA following IMPSA's exercise of its right of first refusal under the terms of the shareholders agreement forthe CBK project.  Accordingly, the price, terms and conditions set forth in the CBK PSA are substantially thesame as those set forth in the MECIBV transaction.  EME has also entered into a separate Purchase Agreement withIPM to sell EME's interest in the CBK project to them if the sale to IMPSA is not completed.  Further, EME hasentered into separate Purchase Agreements with IPM concerning the Tri Energy and Doga projects.  Anticipatedproceeds from these three projects will be approximately $216 million.  EME expects the sale of its interests inthe CBK, Tri Energy and Doga projects will be completed before year end or in early 2005.

The closing of the sale of the BV includes 10 of the13 international projects included in the Purchase and Sale Agreement announced July 30th, one of the remainingthree being purchased by a project partner pursuant to a right of first refusal (CBK in the Philippines) and theother two being projects (Tri-Energy in Thailand and Doga in Turkey) for which project level consents could notbe obtained in time for the sale of the BV.         Consideration from the sale of the BV was approximately $2.0 billion in cash, representing a basepurchase price of $2.3 billion after adjustments for project distributions received by EME during 2004, otherworking capital adjustments and the omission of the three projects from the 13 contemplated in the original saleagreement.

EXHIBIT 99.2                          UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements of Edison International areincluded herein:1.       Pro forma Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 20042.       Pro forma Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 20043.       Pro forma Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 20034.       Pro forma Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 20025.       Pro forma Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 20016.       Notes to the Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements     The above-referenced unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the sale of MECInternational B.V. and related assets by Edison Mission Energy (EME), a subsidiary of Edison International.  Aspreviously described in Item 2.01 of this report, on December 16, 2004, EME completed the sale of itsinternational power generation portfolio (excluding its interests in the CBK, Tri Energy and Doga projects) to aconsortium comprised of International Power plc and Mitsui & Co., Ltd.  Net proceeds from EME's sale of MECInternational B.V. may be used by EME to repay debt, to support contracting and hedges of power sales, to makecapital expenditures for its remaining domestic projects and for investment.  In anticipation of the sale,Mission Energy Holdings International, Inc., a subsidiary of EME, repaid on December 14, 2004 the remaining $200million of the $800 million secured loan that was funded on December 11, 2003.     The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by applying pro formaadjustments to the consolidated financial statements included in Edison International's Annual Report toShareholders, incorporated by reference into Edison International's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year endedDecember 31, 2003, and to the consolidated financial statements included in Edison International's QuarterlyReport on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2004. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidatedbalance sheet reflects EME's sale of MEC International B.V., assuming the transaction had been consummated as ofSeptember 30, 2004. Under the Purchase Agreement for EME's sale of MEC International B.V., EME was required toliquidate a partnership that held an ownership interest in two international projects.  The liquidation of thispartnership, together with dividends that were paid prior to December 16, 2004, has been combined with the saleof the stock of MEC International B.V. in preparing the pro forma balance sheet at September 30, 2004.  OnOctober 22, 2004, The America Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (Act) was enacted which, among other things, includes aprovision regarding repatriation of foreign dividends.  Since this Act was not effective at September 30, 2004,the potential benefits related to repatriation of foreign dividends prior to completion of sale of MECInternational B.V. are not reflected in the pro forma balance sheet set forth herein. The estimated gain on salefor purposes of these unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements will ultimately differ fromthe actual gain to be recorded in the quarter ending December 31, 2004. The unaudited pro forma condensedconsolidated statements of income reflect EME's sale of MEC International B.V., assuming the transaction had beenconsummated as of the beginning of the fiscal period presented. Edison International accounted for thedisposition as discontinued operations in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30,2004 in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment orDisposal of Long-Lived Assets" (SFAS 144). MEC International B.V. was included in Income from continuingoperations for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 because SFAS 144 criteria requiring discontinuedoperations presentation had not been met during these periods.Page     On September 30, 2004, EME completed the sale of Universal Holdings to Origin Energy New Zealand Limited.The sale of Universal Holdings included the sale of EME's 51.2% ownership interest in Contact Energy Ltd.Universal Holdings' operating results were included in Income from continuing operations for the years endedDecember 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 because SFAS 144 criteria requiring discontinued operations presentation had notbeen met during these periods.  Accordingly, pro forma adjustments are included to eliminate these results fromcontinuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.     Pro forma adjustments have also been included to eliminate the operating results of EME's CBK, Tri Energyand Doga projects, which were reclassified as discontinued operations in Edison International's Quarterly Reporton Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 in accordance with SFAS 144.  However, operating resultswere included in Income from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 becauseSFAS 144 criteria requiring discontinued operations presentation had not been met during these periods.Accordingly, pro forma adjustments are included to eliminate these results from continuing operations for theyears ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.     The pro forma adjustments as described in the notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidatedfinancial statements are estimates based on currently available information and certain adjustments thatmanagement believes are reasonable. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements arepresented for informational purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the financial position oroperating results that would have occurred had EME's sale of MEC International B.V. and Universal Holdings beenconsummated on, or as of, the dates indicated, nor are they necessarily indicative of Edison International'sfuture operating results or financial position. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financialstatements should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements of Edison Internationalincluded in its Annual Report to Shareholders, incorporated by reference into Edison International's AnnualReport on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003, and included in Edison International's Quarterly Reporton Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2004.Page                                               EDISON INTERNATIONAL                             UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET                                                SEPTEMBER 30, 2004                                          (In millions, except share amount)                                                                      Sale of MEC                                                         Edison      International       Pro Forma      Pro Forma                                                      International    B.V.
