The Dividend  Equivalents  willbe  credited  on the  ex-dividend  date for EIX  Options  held on that date  unless  the  Dividend  Equivalent  haspreviously been paid or terminated.  Dividend  Equivalents will accumulate in this account without  interest.  Thisaccount will be reduced by the amount of any Dividend Equivalents that are paid or terminated.(b)  Dividend  Equivalents  will be paid on or as soon as  administratively  practical  after the Payment Date thatoccurs on or next follows the later of (i) the date such Dividend  Equivalents are credited,  or (ii) the date suchDividend  Equivalents  vest.  A "Payment  Date"  shall  occur on January 2 of each year;  provided  that if EIX hasdeclared a dividend as of any particular  January 2 for which the ex-dividend  date will not occur until after thatJanuary 2, the "Payment Date" for that particular  calendar year shall be the  ex-dividend  date  corresponding  tothat particular dividend.(c) Dividend  Equivalents  will be paid in cash;  provided,  however,  that the Committee  shall have discretion tomake any such payment in the form of the number of whole  shares of EIX Common  Stock  obtained by dividing (a) theamount of the  vested  Dividend  Equivalents  otherwise  payable  in cash  pursuant  to this  Section 4, by (b) theaverage  of the high and low sales  prices per share of EIX Common  Stock on the New York  Stock  Exchange  for thedate such  amount  becomes  payable.  In the event  vested  Dividend  Equivalents  are paid in shares of EIX CommonStock,  any  fractional  shares  resulting  from the foregoing  calculation  will be paid in cash.  Upon payment ortermination of the Dividend  Equivalent,  no further Dividend  Equivalents will accrue as to the  corresponding EIXOption,  even if the EIX Option  remains  outstanding  and  exercisable.  The Dividend  Equivalents  are subject totermination  and other  conditions  specified in Sections  2(d),  2(e),  2(f),  2(g),  2(h) and 8.  Notwithstandinganything else herein to the contrary,  no further  Dividend  Equivalents will accrue as to any EIX Option once thatEIX Option is exercised, expires or otherwise terminates.5.  PERFORMANCE SHARES AND PS DIVIDENDS(a) Performance  Shares are EIX Common  Stock-based units subject to a performance  measure based on the percentileranking of EIX total  shareholder  return  (TSR)  compared to the TSR for each stock  comprising  the  PhiladelphiaUtility Index,  deleting AES  Corporation  and adding Sempra Energy,  over all of the  Performance  Period.  TSR iscalculated  using a 20-day  trading  average on the  measurement  date. A target number of  contingent  PerformanceShares will be awarded.  The  Performance  Shares include PS Dividends that will accumulate on the target number ofPerformance  Shares awarded and be paid as provided in Section 5(c).  The actual amount of  Performance  Shares andPS Dividends to be paid will depend on the EIX TSR percentile  ranking on the  measurement  date. The target numberof Performance  Shares and  accumulated  PS Dividends  will be paid if the EIX TSR rank is at the 50th  percentile.Payment may range from  nothing if the EIX TSR is below the 40th  percentile  to three  times the target  number ofPerformance  Shares and  accumulated  PS Dividends if the EIX TSR percentile  ranking is at the 90th  percentile orhigher.  The payment multiples for the various EIX TSR rankings are as follows:- -------------------------------------------------------------                 Performance Share Payment- ------------------------------- -----------------------------         EIX TSR Rank               Payment Multiple(1)- ------------------------------- ----------------------------- At or Above 90th Percentile              3 times- ------------------------------- -----------------------------   75th to 89th Percentile         Between 2 and 3 times- ------------------------------- -----------------------------   50th to 74th Percentile         Between 1 and 2 times- ------------------------------- -----------------------------   40th to 49th Percentile        Between 0.25 and 1 times- ------------------------------- -----------------------------    Below 40th Percentile                 0 times- ------------------------------- -----------------------------(1) The payment multiple is interpolated for performancebetween the points indicated on a straight-line basis.Page 4(b) The performance  measurement  date will be the last business day of the Performance  Period.  On that date, theapplicable  payment  multiple  will be  determined  using the table above based on the EIX TSR  percentile  rankingachieved during the Performance Period.(c) A PS Dividend  account will be  established  and credited with an amount equal to each dividend that would havebeen paid during the Performance  Period on the number of shares of EIX Common Stock  equivalent to Holder's targetPerformance  Share award.  The PS Dividends will be credited on the ex-dividend  date and will  accumulate  withoutinterest.  The PS Dividend  payment will be determined by multiplying  the amount  accumulated in the account as ofthe measurement date by the TSR payment multiple determined under section 5(a).(d)  Each  Performance  Share  earned  will be  worth  one  share  of EIX  Common  Stock.  One-half  of the  earnedPerformance  Shares will be paid in EIX Common Stock as a Stock  Payment  under the ECP, and any  fractional  sharewill be paid in cash.  The  remaining  one-half of the earned  Performance  Shares will be paid in cash;  provided,however,  that the Committee shall have discretion to pay such remaining  one-half of the earned Performance Sharesin EIX Common Stock as a Stock Payment under the ECP with any  fractional  shares to be paid in cash.  The value ofeach  Performance  Share paid in cash will be equal to the  average  of the high and low sales  prices per share ofEIX Common Stock on the New York Stock  Exchange for the  measurement  date. The PS Dividends will be paid in cash;provided,  however,  that the  Committee  shall have  discretion  to make such payment in the form of the number ofwhole shares of EIX Common  Stock  obtained by dividing  (a) the amount of the PS  Dividends  otherwise  payable incash  pursuant  to this  Section  5, by (b) the  average  of the high and low sales  prices per share of EIX CommonStock on the New York Stock  Exchange for the date such amount  becomes  payable.  In the event vested PS Dividendsare paid in shares of EIX Common Stock,  any fractional  shares  resulting from the foregoing  calculation  will bepaid in cash.  The shares of EIX Common Stock and the cash (if any) payable for the earned  Performance  Shares andPS Dividends  will be  delivered  within 30 days  following  the end of the  Performance  Period.  The  PerformanceShares and PS Dividends are subject to termination and other  conditions  specified in Sections 2(d),  2(e),  2(f),2(g), 2(h) and 8.6.

For purposes of this clause, "Person" shall not include one or more                  underwriters acquiring newly-issued voting securities (or securities convertible into voting                  securities) directly from EIX with a view towards distribution.         (b)      On any day after the date of grant (the "Reference Date") Continuing Directors cease for any                  reason to constitute a majority of the Board.  A director is a "Continuing Director" if he or                  she either:                  (i)      was a member of the Board on the applicable Initial Date (an "Initial Director"); or                  (ii)     was elected to the Board, or was nominated for election by EIX's shareholders, by a                           vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the Initial Directors then in office.                  A member of the Board who was not a Director on the applicable Initial Date shall be deemed to                  be an Initial Director for purposes of clause (b) above if his or her election, or nomination                  for election by EIX's shareholders, was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the                  Initial Directors (including directors elected after the applicable Initial Date who are deemed                  to be Initial Directors by application of this provision) then in office.
