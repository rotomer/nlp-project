Each Lender will notify the Borrower andthe Administrative Agent of any Regulatory Change occurring after the date of this Agreement which will entitlesuch Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, to compensation pursuant to this Section 2.13(a) aspromptly as practicable after it obtains knowledge thereof and determines to request such compensation.

Such noticeshall specify the basis for requesting such compensation and the method for determining the amount thereof.  SuchLender shall provide any evidence of such requirement to maintain reserves as the Borrower may reasonably request.(c)      Determinations by any Lender or the Issuing Lender for purposes of this Section 2.13 of the effect ofany Regulatory Change shall be conclusive, provided that such determinations are made absent manifest error.2.14.

If any such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees deductions orwithholdings ("Non-Excluded Taxes") or any Other Taxes are required to be withheld from any amounts payable tothe Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or any Lender hereunder or under any Note, the amounts so payable tothe Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or such Lender shall be increased to the extent necessary to yieldto the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or such Lender (after payment of all Non-Excluded Taxes and OtherTaxes) interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in the amounts they would havereceived had no such obligation been imposed on the Borrower; provided, however, that the Borrower shall not berequired to increase any such amounts payable to any Lender with respect to any Non-Excluded Taxes that areattributable to such Lender's designation of a different Lending Office (provided that such Non-Excluded Taxesare imposed at the time of the first payment to such Lender under this Agreement following such designation andexcluding any designation required by any Requirement of Law or occurring pursuant to Section 2.16) or failure tocomply with the requirements of paragraph (d) of this Section 2.14.Page 20(b)      In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes (other than Other Taxes that are being or promptlywill be contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which the Borrower has set aside on its booksadequate reserves in accordance with GAAP, provided that the Borrower shall be permitted not to pay such OtherTaxes being so contested only so long as such nonpayment could not reasonably be expected to have any adverseeffect on the rights or remedies of the Lenders hereunder or under any other Loan Document) to the relevantGovernmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.(c)      Whenever any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes (other than Other Taxes that are being or promptly willbe contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which the Borrower has set aside on its booksadequate reserves in accordance with GAAP, provided that the Borrower shall be permitted not to pay such OtherTaxes being so contested only so long as such nonpayment could not reasonably be expected to have any adverseeffect on the rights or remedies of the Lenders hereunder or under any other Loan Document) are payable by theBorrower, as promptly as possible thereafter the Borrower shall send to the Administrative Agent for the accountof the Administrative Agent or the relevant Lender or Issuing Lender, as the case may be, certificates or othervalid vouchers or receipts received by the Borrower showing payment thereof.  If the Borrower fails to pay anysuch Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to theAdministrative Agent the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, the Borrower shall indemnifythe Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and the Lenders for any incremental taxes, interest or penaltiesthat may become payable by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or any Lender as a result of any suchfailure.(d)      Each Lender (or Transferee) that is not a "United States person" as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) ofthe Code (a "Non-U.S. Lender") shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of aParticipant, to the Lender from which the related participation shall have been purchased) two copies of eitherU.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (certifying as to entitlement to treaty benefits) or Form W-8ECI(claiming exemption from withholding because the income is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business),or, in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of "portfolio interest", a statement substantially in the form ofExhibit B and a Form W-8BEN (certifying as to beneficial ownership), or any subsequent versions thereof orsuccessors thereto properly completed and duly executed by such Non-U.S. Lender claiming complete exemption fromU.S. federal withholding tax on all payments by the Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.Such forms shall be delivered by each Non-U.S. Lender on or before the date it becomes a party to this Agreement(or, in the case of any Participant, on or before the date such Participant purchases the relatedparticipation).
