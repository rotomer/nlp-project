Forward-Looking Statements
This presentation contains forward-looking information. The words "expect," "forecast," "potential," "projected," "anticipated," "predict," "targeted," and similar expressions identify forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially because of important factors such as:
actions of the California Public Utilities Commission, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and other regulatory bodies regarding market structure, customer rates, cost recovery, capital expenditures, and other matters;
changes in prices of electricity, natural gas, coal, and other fuels and in other operating costs;
the operation on a merchant basis of Mission Energy Holding Company's plants that do not have long-term contracts for the sale of their output;
actions of securities rating agencies affecting the credit ratings of Edison International or its subsidiaries;
the ability of Edison International and its subsidiaries to obtain financing on reasonable terms as needed;
the continued operation of Edison International's tax allocation arrangements as contemplated;
the possibility of future state or federal legislation changing the structure or operation of electricity markets or otherwise affecting Edison International's subsidiaries;
the effects of environmental laws and regulations that may require capital expenditures, increased operating costs, or limitations on the operation of power generating facilities;
the effects of increased competition in energy-related businesses; and
the risks of constructing and operating nuclear-, coal-, and gas-fired generating plants and other large and complex energy facilities.
Additional details and factors are set forth in this presentation and reports filed by Edison International, Southern California Edison, and Mission Energy Holding Company on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K.
Certain non-GAAP information appears in this presentation. The reconciliations to GAAP that are required by SEC Regulation G are located in the appendix at the end of this presentation.

Mission Energy Holding Company  Restructuring
Successful execution of the Restructuring Plan, without contributions from EIX, substantially addresses MEHC's survivability
Significant milestones include:
Refinanced Midwest Generation debt of $1.7 billion
Collins lease termination  approximately $370 million tax benefit
Sale of 13 of the 14 international power generation projects sold for about $2.9 billion
$1.2 billion of debt paid down from proceeds
About $1.7 billion of cash after debt pay down
Further debt reduction
Support for contracting merchant power
New generation
 
Mission Energy Holding Company  Strategy
Reduce business and financial risk by improving financial strength, operating efficiency, and predictability of cash flow and earnings
Continually reduce leverage using cash flow from operations
Manage fuel supply, emissions, and environmental controls to protect operating margins
Reduce overhead expenses in the aftermath of the asset sales
Build a laddered, diversified portfolio of power and fuel supply contracts and hedges to lock in margins and reduce earnings and cash flow volatility
MEHC can contribute meaningfully to EIX earnings and eventually dividends with reasonable confidence
 
Mission Energy Holding Company  Value Drivers
Even without the international projects, MEHC core earnings are expected to increase in 2005 over 2004, and show significant double-digit compound annual growth in the longer term

Appendix
Slide 4: The calculation for the equity ratio presented excludes non-recourse debt of $792 million. The comparable equity ratio, including non-recourse debt is 44%.
Slide 5: The 2004 debt ratio includes common equity and preferred securities as reflected on the EIX balance sheet. Debt includes short- and long-term debt and other preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption. Debt excludes non-recourse debt from continuing operations totaling $793 million related to rate reduction bonds and variable interest entity debt. The comparable 2004 debt ratio, based on the same balance sheet classifications, including non-recourse debt is 63%. The 2002 ratio is calculated on the same basis as the 2004 debt ratio, reclassifying other preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption of $1.2 billion and as a component of debt. Non-recourse preferred securities of $131 million and non-recourse debt of $5.4 billion are excluded. The comparable 2002 debt ratio, including non-recourse amounts, based on the same balance sheet classifications and including debt from international assets in discontinued operations is 71%.
Slides 6 & 7: CAGR ranges are presented based on core earnings. Based on reported earnings, the CAGRs are projected to be 4%12% for EIX, 1%3% for SCE and 4%5% for EIX assuming no earnings from MEHC. The lower ranges reflect the 2004 non-core items which include positive regulatory adjustments at SCE totaling $157 million, partially offset by a $14 million charge due to the retirement of the EIX QUIPS.
Appendix
 
Slide 8: The calculation of EIX's payout ratio is based on the 2005 core earnings outlook of $2.14, excluding MEHC's earnings of 34 cents per share. The payout ratio based on the 2005 Outlook for projected reported earnings of $2.20 is 45%. See slide 14 for a reconciliation from core to reported earnings for EIX's 2005 Outlook.
Slide 10: The $1.9 billion includes capital expenditures of $1.7 billion and $0.3 billion of acquisition costs related to nonutility generation plant. Excludes $0.1 of nuclear fuel expenditures.
Note: GAAP measurements that equal or fall into the non-GAAP measurement range are not reconciled in the footnotes above. Non-core items are items that do not reflect ongoing operating performance, and therefore management believes it is useful to present comparative earnings information that omits these items.
