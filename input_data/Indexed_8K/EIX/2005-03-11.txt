"2004 was another strong year for both our utility and our independent power businesses.  The achievements ofthe past three years have set a solid foundation for 2005 and beyond," commented John Bryson, Chairman, EdisonInternational.                                                        - more -        In 2004, MEHC completed the sale of 11 of the 14 projects in its international project portfolio.  Two of theremaining three projects were sold in early 2005 and one project, Doga in Turkey, has not been sold at this time.While EME will continue to seek to sell its ownership interest in this project, there is no assurance that suchefforts will result in a sale.        The resolution of several key events and regulatory proceedings in both 2004 and 2003 resulted in manynon-core adjustments that are excluded from core or operating earnings in an effort to provide a more meaningfulcomparison of ongoing operating performance.        The 2004 non-core adjustments include earnings of $1.01 per share at SCE from the resolution of regulatoryproceedings and prior year tax issues.  The 2004 regulatory proceedings included the 2003 General Rate Case (GRC)decision and a 2003 power procurement reasonableness proceeding.        The 2004 non-core adjustments at MEHC net to a loss of 7 cents per share.  The non-core positive adjustmentsinclude a $1.64 gain on the sale of its interest in international projects; a 9-cent-per-share gain on the sale ofMEHC's interest in Four Star Oil and Gas; and a 6-cents-per-share benefit from ceasing depreciation on the foreignassets held for sale.  The 2004 non-core gains at MEHC were offset by charges of $1.86 per share primarily from thetermination of the Collins lease and the impairment of the small peaking plants in Illinois.        The 2004 non-core adjustments at EIX parent company include a 4-cents-per-share charge related to thewrite-off of unamortized debt costs from the early payment of EIX's quarterly income debt securities in the fourthquarter of 2004.        The 2003 non-core adjustments include earnings of 75 cents per share at SCE from the resolution ofvarious regulatory and tax issues together with a 15-cents-per-share gain from the sale of SCE's pipelinebusiness, impairment charges of 57 cents per share at MEHC primarily related to the eight small peaking plants inIllinois, and a 3-cents-per-share charge for a change in accounting principles at MEHC related toasset-retirement obligations.        Excluding the non-core items, EIX's earnings were $1.91 per share for 2004 compared to $2.22 per sharefor 2003.  The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects the expiration of SCE's performance-incentive mechanismfor the San Onofre nuclear plant, the absence of earnings from MEHC's interest in the Four Star Oil & GasCompany, which was sold in the first quarter of 2004, lower earnings at MEHC's Homer City facility, and a chargefor an indemnity related to asbestos claims at the Illinois plants.  The decrease was partially offset by higherrevenue net of operating expenses at SCE and improved operating performance at MEHC's international projects(including depreciation expense) and the Illinois plants.YEAR 2004 EARNINGS DETAIL        SCE's earnings from continuing operations for the year ending December 31, 2004 increased by $43 million,compared to the same period last year.  The net effect of non-core items related to the resolution of regulatoryproceedings and prior year tax issues increased earnings by $86 million over 2003.  The 2004 proceedings includedthe 2003 GRC that was resolved in July of last year and the 2003 Energy Resource Recovery Account (ERRA)proceeding addressing power procurement reasonableness that was resolved in the fourth quarter.  Also, in thefourth quarter, the company favorably resolved prior year tax issues. Excluding these items, earnings decreased$43 million, primarily from the expiration at year-end 2003 of the incremental cost incentive pricing (ICIP)mechanism at the San Onofre nuclear plant partially offset by the increase in revenues authorized by the 2003 GRCdecision.  Post-test-year revenue increases for 2004 and 2005, to compensate for customer growth and increasedcapital expenditures were authorized in the 2003 GRC decision.                                                     - more -        MEHC, on a consolidated basis, had a loss from continuing operations of $666 million during 2004 comparedto a loss of $194 million during 2003.  MEHC's 2004 loss from continuing operations increased by $472 millionfrom 2003 primarily due to $608 million of charges for both terminating the Collins lease and impairment of theIllinois small-peaking plants during 2004.  This decrease in earnings was partially offset by $186 million ofimpairment charges in 2003 primarily related to the Illinois small-peaking plants and the investment in theBrooklyn Navy Yard project.  MEHC's 2004 results were favorably impacted by a gain on the sale of EME's interestin Four Star Oil & Gas which mostly offset the earnings recorded from the project during 2003.  During the fourthquarter of 2004, MEHC's subsidiary, Midwest Generation, recorded a charge of $34 million related to a contractindemnity for asbestos claims from activities at the Illinois plants prior to their acquisition in 1999.  Inaddition, the earnings from Homer City were lower in 2004 from 2003 due to unplanned outages and higher fuelcosts related to emission allowances. The earnings from MEHC's Illinois plants, excluding the above asbestoscharge, improved in 2004 over 2003 from higher generation and energy prices, which more than offset the lowercapacity revenues under the power purchase agreement with Exelon.        Edison Capital's earnings for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $60 million, compared with $57million in 2003.  This increase is primarily due to higher income from Edison Capital's global infrastructureinvestment funds.  The increase was partially offset by Edison Capital's maturing lease and housing portfolioswhich produce lower income.        The loss for "EIX parent company and other" increased $3 million over last year with the write-off ofunamortized debt costs from the early payment of the EIX quarterly income debt securities  and other expensesbeing virtually offset by lower net interest expense.        At SCE, earnings from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 included a gain onsale and operating results totaling $50 million from SCE's pipeline business which was sold in the third quarterof 2003.  MEHC, on a consolidated basis, had income from discontinued operations of $690 million in 2004 comparedto $124 million in 2003.  The 2004 results of discontinued operations include gains of $533 million related toboth the sale of its interests in Contact Energy and the sale of the Dutch holding company.  In 2004, MEHCcompleted the sale of 11 of its 14 international projects.  Two of the three remaining projects were sold inearly 2005 and one project has not been sold at this time.        Excluding the gain, earnings from discontinued operations were $157 million during 2004 compared to $124million in 2003.  The increase in earnings is due to improved performance at First Hydro, EcoElectrica and LoyYang B offset by interest costs related to the $800 million bridge loan completed in December 2003.        MEHC's consolidated results for the year ending December 31, 2003 include a $9 million charge for thecumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for asset retirement obligations adopted in 2003.  As SCEfollows accounting principles for rate-regulated enterprises, implementation of this new standard did not affectits earnings.                                                     - more -                                                                      Year Ended December 31,Earnings (Loss) (in millions) (Unaudited)                              2004             2003             Change- ----------------------------------------                   ------------------------------------------------------  Southern California Edison                                           $915             $872                $43  Mission Energy Holding Company                                       (666)            (194)              (472)  Edison Capital                                                         60               57                  3  EIX parent company and other                                          (83)             (80)                (3)- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------EIX Consol.

The increase is primarily due to the year-over-year impact fromresolution of regulatory and tax issues, the gain on sale and related items from the sale of MEHC's internationalprojects that closed in the fourth quarter of 2004 and impairment charges recorded in 2003 related to MEHC's BrooklynNavy Yard project.        The fourth quarter results include several non-core adjustments which are summarized in a table below toreconcile fourth quarter reported earnings to core earning.  The 2004 non-core adjustments include the resolution ofregulatory and tax issues, the gain on the sale on MEHC's interest in international assets that closed in 2004 andrelated items, the impairment in 2003 from MEHC's Brooklyn Navy Yard project and cost associated with the earlyextinguishment of EIX quarterly income debt securities.        Excluding the non-core items, EIX's core earnings were 42 cents per share for 2004 compared to 52 centsper share for the same period last year.  Most of the decrease reflects the $34 million charge at MEHC related tothe asbestos indemnity, lower earnings from Four Star Oil and Gas, as the project was sold in 2004, offset by a$24 million increase from higher generation and energy prices at the Illinois plants and higher trading income.FOURTH-QUARTER EARNINGS DETAIL        SCE's earnings from continuing operations were $315 million in the fourth quarter of 2004, compared with $222million in the fourth quarter of 2003.  The increase in fourth quarter earnings primarily reflects a $97 millionincrease from the resolution of regulatory and tax issues.  After adjusting for these items, the decrease in earningsfrom the expiration of the performance-incentive mechanism for the San Onofre nuclear plant was offset by higherrevenue, primarily authorized in SCE's 2003 GRC for 2004.  SCE's 2004 fourth quarter earnings included four positiveregulatory items totaling $157 million including $71 million from the resolution of the 2003 power procurementreasonableness review, $74 million of income tax benefits related to prior years, and $12 million from generatorrefunds and other regulatory items.  Positive regulatory items that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2003 included$60 million related to the tax impact of the FERC rate case.                                                     - more -        MEHC, on a consolidated basis, had a loss from continuing operations of $52 million during the fourth quarter of 2004 compared toa loss of $85 million during the fourth quarter of 2003.  The increase in earnings was primarily due to highergeneration and energy prices at the Illinois plants, higher trading income and the absence of the 2003 impairmentcharges and utilization of a related tax benefit in 2004 for MEHC's Brooklyn Navy Yard project. These increases werepartially offset by a charge of $34 million related to a contract indemnity with Commonwealth Edison related toasbestos claims and the absence of earnings from Four Star Oil and Gas that was sold in the first quarter of 2004.        Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2004 for Edison Capital were $26 million compared to $16 million in thesame period last year.  The increase is primarily due to higher income from its global infrastructure investmentfunds.     The loss for "EIX parent company and other" increased by $11 million over the fourth quarter of 2003primarily due to the write-off of unamortized debt costs associated with the early payment of the EIX quarterlyincome debt securities, partially offset by lower net interest expense.        MEHC, on a consolidated basis, had income from discontinued operations of $120 million during 2004compared to income of $63 million during 2003.  The 2004 results of discontinued operations include a gain onsale of the international projects that closed in the fourth quarter of $65 million and earnings from thediscontinued international projects of $55 million during 2004 compared to $63 million in 2003.  The decreasedquarterly earnings over last year resulted from the sale of a development project and costs incurred inconnection with the sale of the international projects.
