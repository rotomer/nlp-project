EME ceasedconsolidating the activities of Lakeland Power Ltd. in 2002, when an administrative receiver was appointedfollowing a default by Norweb Energi Ltd. under the power sales agreement.         As previously disclosed, the administrative receiver of Lakeland Power Ltd. filed a claim against NorwebEnergi Ltd. for termination of the power sales agreement. On November 19, 2002, TXU UK and TXU Europe, togetherwith a related entity, TXU Europe Energy Trading Limited (TXU Energy), entered into formal administrationproceedings of their own in the United Kingdom (similar to bankruptcy proceedings in the United States).On March 31, 2005, Lakeland Power Ltd. received 112 million pounds (approximately $210 million) from the TXUadministrators, representing an interim payment of 97% of its accepted claim of 116 million pounds (approximately$217 million).         From the amount received, Lakeland Power Ltd., now controlled by a liquidator in the United Kingdom,will make payments due to EME under a secured loan which EME purchased from Lakeland Power Ltd.'s securedcreditors in 2004 (approximately $12 million as of April 6, 2005). Additionally, Lakeland Power Ltd. will pay toEME's subsidiary that owns the equity interest in Lakeland Power Ltd. the amount remaining after resolution ofany remaining secured and unsecured creditor claims and payment of or provision for tax liabilities and the feesand expenses associated with Lakeland Power Ltd.'s liquidation.         EME estimates that the net proceeds after tax (including taxes due in the United States) resulting fromthe above payments will be approximately $100 million and the increase in net income will be approximately $90million.  These proceeds may be received throughout 2005, and possibly 2006, as Lakeland Power Ltd.'s liquidationprogresses.  Because the amounts required to settle outstanding claims and UK taxes have not been finalized andcannot be estimated precisely in the context of the liquidation, the actual amount of net proceeds and increasein net income may vary materially from the above estimate.Page 2                                                             Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused thisreport to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
