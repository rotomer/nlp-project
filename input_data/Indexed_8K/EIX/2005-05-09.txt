This July decision authorized higher revenue for the full year of     2004; therefore, a year-over-year comparison to 2005 is not expected to reflect an increase in core     earnings related to the GRC decision.o    Earnings per common share - $0.61o    Net Income - $201 milliono    Revenues - $2.4 billiono    Assets - $33.5 billion     For the quarter ended March 31, 2005, EIX recorded consolidated earnings per common share of 61 cents,compared to 30 cents in the first quarter of 2004.       "Building on the progress made last year, we had improved results across the entire company.  Ourindependent power company particularly benefited from higher energy prices in the Midwest and Eastern wholesalepower markets," commented John Bryson, Chairman, Edison International.                                                     - more -        SCE's first quarter 2005 earnings from continuing operations were $131 million, $31 million above thesame period last year.  The increase is primarily due to higher authorized revenue in 2005 from theimplementation of the 2003 GRC decision.  SCE received the decision last July, which resulted in a catch-upadjustment to core earnings in the third quarter for the amounts related to the first half of 2004, as well as anincrease in earnings for the second half of 2004.  A comparison of the full year of 2005 versus 2004 is notexpected to reflect a core earnings difference related to the 2003 GRC decision.       MEHC's first quarter 2005 earnings from continuing operations were $25 million compared to a loss of $39million in the same period last year.  MEHC's first quarter 2005 earnings from continuing operations include a$15 million after-tax charge related to the early extinguishment of debt while the first quarter 2004 lossincludes a $27 million after-tax net gain from the sale of EME's interests in Four Star Oil & Gas and theBrooklyn Navy Yard projects.  Excluding these items, MEHC's core earnings were $40 million in the first quarterof 2005, compared to a loss of $66 million in the same period last year.  The improved core earnings were largelydue to stronger operating performance at the Illinois and Homer City Plants, driven by higher merchant generationand wholesale energy prices.  Also contributing to the increase in earnings was higher income from MEHC'smarketing and trading subsidiary, stronger operating results from the Big Four projects in California and lowernet corporate interest costs.       Edison Capital's earnings for the first quarter of 2005 were $52 million, up $41 million from the sameperiod last year.  This increase is primarily due to Edison Capital's share of income from its investment in theEmerging Europe Infrastructure Fund.  The Fund accounts for most of its investments at fair value, with changesin the fair value recorded quarterly through net income.  Edison Capital's share of the Fund's income was $43million during the first quarter of 2005 which primarily resulted from gains on several telecommunicationinvestments in Eastern Europe.         The first quarter 2005 loss from "EIX parent company and other" of $14 million was $6 million lower thanthe same period last year primarily reflecting lower interest expense partially offset by higher taxes.        EIX's earnings from discontinued operations were $7 million in the first quarter of 2005 reflecting theoperating results and sales impacts from MEHC's Tri-Energy and CBK international projects, both of which weresold during the first quarter of 2005.  The earnings from discontinued operations in the first quarter of 2004 of$46 million represent the operating results from MEHC's international projects that were held for sale.                                                     - more -                                                                  Quarter Ended March 31,Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share (Unaudited)                               2005             2004             Change- --------------------------------------------               ---------------------------------------------------------  Southern California Edison Company                                      $0.40            $0.31              $0.09  Mission Energy Holding Company                                           0.08            (0.12)              0.20  Edison Capital                                                           0.16             0.03               0.13  EIX parent company and other                                            (0.05)           (0.06)              0.01- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------EIX Consol.
