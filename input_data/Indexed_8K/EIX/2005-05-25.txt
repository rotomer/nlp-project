For purposes of this clause, "Person" shall not include one or more                  underwriters acquiring newly-issued voting securities (or securities convertible into voting                  securities) directly from EIX with a view towards distribution.         (b)      On any day after the date of grant (the "Reference Date") Continuing Directors cease for any                  reason to constitute a majority of the Board.  A director is a "Continuing Director" if he or                  she either:                  (i)      was a member of the Board on the applicable Initial Date (an "Initial Director"); or                  (ii)     was elected to the Board, or was nominated for election by EIX's shareholders, by a                           vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the Initial Directors then in office.                  A member of the Board who was not a Director on the applicable Initial Date shall be deemed to                  be an Initial Director for purposes of clause (b) above if his or her election, or nomination                  for election by EIX's shareholders, was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the                  Initial Directors (including directors elected after the applicable Initial Date who are deemed                  to be Initial Directors by application of this provision) then in office.
