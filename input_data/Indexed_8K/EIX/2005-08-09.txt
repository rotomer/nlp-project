These comparisons include non-core items    in both 2005 and 2004, including a large lease termination charge taken at an Illinois power station in 2004.o   EIX had core earnings of 55 cents per share in the second quarter of 2005, an increase of 34 cents per    share over the same period last year.(1)o   Key factors contributing to 2005 second-quarter core earnings were lower net interest expense, improved    results from the independent power business and higher revenue at the utility.o   EIX is increasing its core earnings guidance for the full-year 2005 to a range of $2.53 to $2.63 from    $2.14 per share.(2)o   Earnings per common share - $0.61o   Net Income - $201 milliono   Revenue - $2.6 billiono   Assets - $33.5 billion        EIX recorded consolidated earnings of 61 cents per share in the second quarter of 2005, compared to a lossof $1.15 per share for the same period last year.  Excluding non-core items, EIX's second-quarter core earnings were55 cents per share in 2005, an increase of 34 cents per share compared to 2004.(1)        "We achieved improved core earnings at each of our business segments in the second quarter.  The key factorswere lower net interest expense, improved operating results at our independent power business and higher utilityrevenue.  On the strength of our performance to date, and outlook for the rest of the year, we expect core earningsfor 2005 will be stronger than previously forecast," commented John E. Bryson, Chairman, Edison International.- ----------------1  See Core Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share table for the quarters ended June 30, for a reconciliation   of core earnings to earnings calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted   in the United States.2  See Appendix for reconciliation to reported EPS.                                                - more -SECOND-QUARTER EARNINGS DETAIL        SCE's earnings from continuing operations were 49 cents per share in the second quarter of 2005, comparedwith 74 cents per share in the second quarter of 2004.  SCE's second-quarter 2004 results include net positiveregulatory items of about 36 cents per share, primarily related to the implementation of SCE's 2003 GRCdecision.  Excluding these items, SCE's core earnings were 49 cents per share, an increase of 11 cents per sharecompared to the second quarter of 2004.  This increase is primarily due to higher revenue at SCE associated withthe timing of the 2003 GRC decision.  SCE received the decision last July, which resulted in a catch-upadjustment to core earnings in the third quarter for the amounts related to the first half of 2004, as well as anincrease in earnings for the second half of 2004.  A comparison of the full year of 2005 versus 2004 is notexpected to reflect a core earnings difference related to the 2003 GRC decision.  The favorable impact of higherrevenue authorized by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) for 2005, the resolution of certain taxissues and lower net interest costs were mostly offset by higher operating expense.        MEHC's earnings from continuing operations were break-even in the second quarter of 2005 compared to aloss of $1.96 per share in the second quarter of 2004.  MEHC's second-quarter 2004 results include a charge of$1.80 per share related to the termination of the Collins Station lease.  The Collins Station was deemeduneconomic and operations ceased effective September 30, 2004.  Excluding this charge, MEHC's core earnings werebreak-even, an improvement of 16 cents per share over the second quarter of 2004.  This increase is primarily dueto higher wholesale energy prices at the Illinois plants, lower net corporate interest expense, the resolution ofa prior-year tax issue and higher income from Edison Mission Marketing & Trading (EMMT).  On an annual basis,MEHC's earnings are seasonal with higher earnings typically occurring during the summer months.        Earnings in the second quarter of 2005 for Edison Capital were 8 cents per share compared to 4 cents pershare in the second quarter of 2004.  This increase is primarily due to Edison Capital's share of income from itsinvestment in the Emerging Europe Infrastructure Fund which recorded a gain resulting from an announced purchaseof a wireless company held by the Fund.  The Fund has subsequently exited this investment and the related gain ofabout four cents per share has been realized.        The loss for "EIX parent company and other" decreased by 3 cents per share primarily due to lower netinterest expense.        EIX's earnings from discontinued operations were 6 cents per share in the second quarter of 2005 comparedto 8 cents per share in the same period last year.  The 2005 earnings resulted primarily from a settlementrelated to the Lakeland Power project.  The 2004 results include earnings from MEHC's international assets thathave been sold.

The 2004 results include a charge of $1.80 per sharerelated to the termination of the Collins Station lease, a net gain of 8 cents per share at MEHC from the sale ofthe company's interest in Four Star Oil and Gas and the Brooklyn Navy Yard project, and earnings of 36 cents pershare at SCE from regulatory items related to its 2003 GRC decision.  Both years include earnings fromdiscontinued operations related to MEHC's international projects.  Excluding these items, core earnings increased91 cents per share primarily from higher wholesale energy prices in Illinois, higher earnings at SCE associatedwith the 2003 GRC decision received in July 2004, lower net interest expense, earnings from Edison Capital'sinterest in the Emerging Europe Infrastructure Fund and higher income from EMMT.        EIX had earnings from continuing operations of $1.15 per share for the six-month period ended June 30,2005 compared with a loss from continuing operations of $1.07 per share for the same period last year.Continuing operations exclude the impacts from changes in accounting principles and discontinued operations, asdiscussed below.YEAR-TO-DATE EARNINGS DETAIL        SCE's earnings from continuing operations in the first half of 2005 decreased by 16 cents per share,compared to the same period last year.  SCE's results for the first half of 2004 include net positive regulatoryitems of about 36 cents per share primarily related to the implementation of SCE's 2003 GRC decision.  Excludingthese items, SCE's core earnings were 89 cents per share, an increase of 20 cents per share compared to the sameperiod last year.  This increase is primarily due to the favorable impact of higher revenue at SCE associatedwith the timing of the 2003 GRC decision reached in July 2004 as described in the second-quarter earnings detailsection above.  Higher revenue authorized by the CPUC for 2005 and the resolution of certain tax issues wereoffset by higher operating expense.
