MEHC  Coal Supply
Due to rail disruptions, shipments of Powder River Basin coal to our Illinois plants will be curtailed to 80-85% of planned through November of this year
 The railroads are in the process of making repairs
Based on communication with our transport provider, we believe that we will receive sufficient coal supplies to meet our current generation outlook
The Illinois plants use approximately 18 million to 20.5 million tons of coal annually, primarily obtained from the Southern Powder River Basin of Wyoming. In addition, Homer City uses approximately 5 million tons of coal annually, obtained from mines located near Homer City in Pennsylvania. Coal purchases are made under a variety of supply agreements typically ranging from one year to six years in length. The following table summarizes the percent of expected coal requirements for the next five years that are under contract at June 30, 2005.
Percent of Coal Requirements Under Contract

Appendix
Slide 8: The calculation for the second quarter 2005 recourse leverage ratio of 53% includes common equity and preferred securities as reflected on the EIX balance sheets. Debt includes short- and long-term debt and excludes non-recourse debt from continuing operations totaling $2.3 billion. The comparable 2005 leverage ratio based on the same balance sheet classifications, including non-recourse items, is 59%.
The calculation for the 2004 recourse leverage ratio of 56% includes common equity and preferred securities as reflected on the EIX balance sheet. Debt includes short- and long-term debt and other preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption. Debt excludes non-recourse debt from continuing operations totaling $2.8 billion. The comparable 2004 leverage ratio based on the same balance sheet classifications, including non-recourse items is 63%.
The calculation for the 2003 recourse leverage ratio of 61% is calculated on the same basis as 2004, reclassifying other preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption of $141 million as a component of debt. Non-recourse debt of $2.9 billion is excluded. The comparable 2003 leverage ratio including non-recourse amounts is 68%.
The calculation for the 2002 recourse leverage ratio of 69% is calculated on the same basis as 2003, reclassifying other preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption of $1.2 billion as a component of debt. Non-recourse preferred securities of $131 million and non-recourse debt of $5.4 billion are excluded. The comparable 2002 leverage ratio including non-recourse amounts, and based on 2002 balance sheet classifications which classify preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption as preferred stock, is 71%.
