Appendix
Slide 5: The calculation for the second quarter 2005 recourse leverage ratio of 53% includes common equity and preferred securities as reflected on the EIX balance sheets. Debt includes short- and long-term debt and excludes non-recourse debt from continuing operations totaling $2.3 billion. The comparable 2005 leverage ratio based on the same balance sheet classifications, including non-recourse items, is 59%.
The calculation for the 2004 recourse leverage ratio of 56% includes common equity and preferred securities as reflected on the EIX balance sheet. Debt includes short- and long-term debt and other preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption. Debt excludes non-recourse debt from continuing operations totaling $2.8 billion. The comparable 2004 leverage ratio based on the same balance sheet classifications, including non-recourse items is 63%.
The calculation for the 2003 recourse leverage ratio of 61% is calculated on the same basis as 2004, reclassifying other preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption of $141 million as a component of debt. Non-recourse debt of $2.9 billion is excluded. The comparable 2003 leverage ratio including non-recourse amounts is 68%.
The calculation for the 2002 recourse leverage ratio of 69% is calculated on the same basis as 2003, reclassifying other preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption of $1.2 billion as a component of debt. Non-recourse preferred securities of $131 million and non-recourse debt of $5.4 billion are excluded. The comparable 2002 leverage ratio including non-recourse amounts, and based on 2002 balance sheet classifications which classify preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption as preferred stock, is 71%.
