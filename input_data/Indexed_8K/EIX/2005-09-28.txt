Forward-Looking Statements
This presentation contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Forward-looking statements reflect Edison International's current expectations and projections about future events based on Edison International's knowledge of present facts and circumstances and assumptions about future events and include any statement that does not directly relate to a historical or current fact.  In this report and elsewhere, the words "expects," "believes," "anticipates," "estimates," "projects," "intends," "plans," "probable," "may," "will," "could," "would," "should," and variations of such words and similar expressions, or discussions of strategy or of plans, are intended to identify forward- looking statements.  Such statements necessarily involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.  Some of the risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause results to differ, or that otherwise could impact Edison International or its subsidiaries, include but are not limited to:
the ability of Edison International to meet its financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends;
the ability of Edison International to effectively execute its strategic plan;
the ability of SCE to recover its costs in a timely manner from its customers through regulated rates;
decisions and other actions by the CPUC and other regulatory authorities and delays in regulatory actions;
market risks affecting SCE's energy procurement activities;
access to capital markets and the cost of capital;
changes in interest rates and rates of inflation;
governmental, statutory, regulatory or administrative changes or initiatives affecting the electricity industry, including environmental regulations that could require additional expenditures or otherwise affect the cost and manner of doing business;
risks associated with operating nuclear and other power generating facilities, including operating risks, equipment failure, availability, heat rate and output;
the ability to obtain sufficient insurance;
effects of legal proceedings, changes in tax laws, rates or policies, and changes in accounting standards;
supply and demand for electric capacity and energy, and the resulting prices and dispatch volumes, in the wholesale markets to which EME's generating units have access;
EME's and its subsidiaries' ability to provide sufficient collateral in support of their forward sales of electricity and purchases of fuel;
competition from other power plants, including new plants and technologies that may be developed in the future;
the cost of and availability of fuel, fuel transportation services, electric transmission services and required emission credits or allowances;
weather conditions, natural disasters and other unforeseen events; and
changes in the fair value of investments accounted for using fair value accounting.
Additional information about risks and uncertainties, including more detail about the factors described above, is contained in Edison International's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Readers are urged to read such reports and carefully consider the risks, uncertainties and other factors that affect Edison International's business.  Readers also should review future reports filed by Edison International with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The information contained in this report is subject to change without notice. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and Edison International is not obligated to publicly update or revise forward-looking statements.

Appendix
Slide 4:  The calculation for the second quarter 2005 recourse leverage ratio of 53% includes common equity and preferred securities as reflected on the EIX balance sheets. Debt includes short- and long-term debt and excludes non-recourse debt from continuing operations totaling $2.3 billion. The comparable 2005 leverage ratio based on the same balance sheet classifications, including non-recourse items, is 59%.
The calculation for the 2004 recourse leverage ratio of 56% includes common equity and preferred securities as reflected on the EIX balance sheet. Debt includes short- and long-term debt and other preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption. Debt excludes non-recourse debt from continuing operations totaling $2.8 billion. The comparable 2004 leverage ratio based on the same balance sheet classifications, including non-recourse items is 63%.
The calculation for the 2003 recourse leverage ratio of 61% is calculated on the same basis as 2004, reclassifying other preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption of $141 million as a component of debt. Non-recourse debt of $2.9 billion is excluded. The comparable 2003 leverage ratio including non- recourse amounts is 68%.
The calculation for the 2002 recourse leverage ratio of 69% is calculated on the same basis as 2003, reclassifying other preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption of $1.2 billion as a component of debt. Non-recourse preferred securities of $131 million and non-recourse debt of $5.4 billion are excluded. The comparable 2002 leverage ratio including non-recourse amounts, and based on 2002 balance sheet classifications which classify preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption as preferred stock, is 71%.
