In both years, reported earnings include     discontinued operations that primarily reflect gains related to the sale of Mission Energy Holding     Company's (MEHC) international assets.o    Core earnings per share were $1.24 in the third quarter of 2005 compared to 87 cents in the same period     last year.  Core earnings exclude earnings from discontinued operations and other non-core items.o    EIX is increasing its 2005 core earnings guidance to $2.80 - $2.90 per share from $2.53 - $2.63 per share.Third Quarter 2005 Financial Highlights:o    Core earnings per common share - $1.24o    Net Income - $462 milliono    Revenue - $3.8 billiono    Assets - $35.5 billionTHIRD-QUARTER EARNINGS SUMMARY         For the third quarter of 2005, EIX recorded consolidated earnings of $462 million comparedto earnings of $813 million in the same period last year.  The decrease is primarily due to the impactsfrom the sales of the international assets in 2004 reported as discontinued operations, partially offsetby improved operating results at MEHC from higher wholesale energy prices, higher energytrading income, and lower net interest expense.         "Our core earnings for the third quarter were up 43% over the same period last year, driven bystrong results at our independent power business," reported Chairman and CEO, John Bryson.  "SCE continuedto increase its core earnings, in part, on its large capital investment to strengthen and modernize theutility power grid.  Based on our current outlook, we are increasing our prior earnings guidance for2005 by slightly more than 10% to a range of $2.80 to $2.90 per share."                                                               - MORE -EDISON INTERNATIONAL THIRD-QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTSPage 2 of 10THIRD-QUARTER EARNINGS DETAILEarnings from Continuing Operations         SCE's earnings from continuing operations were $280 million in the third quarter of 2005, comparedwith $259 million in the third quarter of 2004.  SCE's 2005 third-quarter earnings included a positive itemof $61 million related to a favorable tax settlement.  Third quarter 2004 earnings included $50 million ofpositive regulatory items, primarily from implementation of the 2003 general rate case (GRC) decision.Excluding these non-core items, core earnings were up $10 million on a quarter-to-quarter comparison basis.Higher net revenue and a tax benefit from a new IRS regulation more than offset the expected timing differencerelated to the implementation of the 2003 GRC decision in July of last year.         MEHC's income from continuing operations was $154 million in the third quarter of 2005 compared to$60 million in the third quarter of 2004.  MEHC's third-quarter 2005 results include an impairment charge of$34 million related to MEHC's March Point project as the rise in forecast fuel costs lowered projected cashflows.  MEHC's 2004 third-quarter results included charges of $22 million, primarily from an impairmentrelated to Midwest Generation's (MWG) small peaking plants and the termination of the Collins Stationlease.  Excluding these charges, MEHC's core earnings increased by $106 million over the third quarter of 2004.This increase is primarily due to higher wholesale energy prices, higher energy trading income, and lower netcorporate interest expense.         Earnings in the third quarter of 2005 for Edison Capital were $3 million compared to $12 millionin the same period last year.  The decrease primarily reflects lower income from Edison Capital's investmentin the Emerging Europe Infrastructure Fund.  The loss for "EIX parent company and other" decreased by $15million primarily due to lower net interest expense.Earnings from Discontinued Operations         The third-quarter 2005 earnings from discontinued operations primarily reflect positive taxadjustments of $28 million resulting from the sales of international projects.  Beginning in the thirdquarter of 2004, MEHC reclassified the results of its international projects to discontinued operationsfor all periods presented due to completion of the sale of its interest in Contact Energy and itsagreement to sell the remaining international projects.  Earnings from discontinued operationsduring the third quarter of 2004, including a gain and recognition of a tax benefit, were $499 million.                                                               - MORE -EDISON INTERNATIONAL THIRD-QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTSPage 3 of 10                                                         Quarter Ended September 30,Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share (Unaudited)                    2005             2004             Change                                                     ----------------------------------------------------  Southern California Edison                                   $0.86            $0.79              $0.07  Mission Energy Holding Company                                0.48             0.18               0.30  Edison Capital                                                0.01             0.04              (0.03)  EIX parent company and other                                 (0.02)           (0.05)              0.03- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------EIX Consol.
