If such Lender or the Issuing Lender requests compensation underthis Section 2.13(a) in respect of any Regulatory Change, the Borrower may, by notice tosuch Lender or the Issuing Lender, as applicable, require that such Lender or the IssuingLender forward to the Borrower a statement setting forth the basis for requesting suchcompensation and the method for determining the amount thereof.(b)     Without limiting the effect of the provisions of Section 2.13(a) (but withoutduplication thereof), the Borrower will pay to any Lender, within 15 Business Days ofreceipt by the Borrower of notice from such Lender, for each day such Lender is required tomaintain reserves against "Eurocurrency liabilities" under Regulation D of the Board as ineffect on the date of this Agreement, an additional amount determined by such Lender equalto the product of the following:(i)     the principal amount of the Eurodollar Loan;(ii)    the remainder of (x) a fraction the numerator of which is the Eurodollar Rate for        such Eurodollar Loan and the denominator of which is one minus the rate at which such        reserve requirements are imposed on such Lender on such day minus (y) such numerator;        and(iii)   1/360.Such Lender shall request payment under this Section 2.13(b) by giving notice to theBorrower as of the last day of each Interest Period for each Eurodollar Loan (and, if suchInterest Period exceeds three months' duration, also as of three months, or a whole multiplethereof, after the first day of such Interest Period).  Such notice shall specify the basisfor requesting such compensation and the method for determining the amount thereof.  SuchLender shall provide any evidence of such requirement to maintain reserves as the Borrowermay reasonably request.Page 20(c)     Determinations by any Lender or the Issuing Lender for purposes of this Section 2.13of the effect of any Regulatory Change shall be conclusive, provided that suchdeterminations are made absent manifest error.2.14.
