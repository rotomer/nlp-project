Core earnings exclude earnings from discontinued operations and other non-core    items.o   Core earnings per common share - $3.13o   Net Income - $1.1 billiono   Revenue - $11.9 billiono   Assets - $34.8 billion        For the year ending December 31, 2005, EIX recorded consolidated earnings of $1.1 billion compared toearnings of $916 million for the prior year.        "2005 was a year of strong performance at our company," said Chairman and CEO John Bryson.  "Earningsincreased 23% over the prior year, driven primarily by our unregulated businesses.  We also fully met ourambitious investment goals to strengthen the distribution and transmission system for the benefit of ourutility customers."        Results for 2005 and 2004 included several non-core adjustments detailed in the tables presented in thisrelease.Earnings (Loss) from Continuing Operations        Southern California Edison's (SCE) earnings from continuing operations were $725 million in 2005,                                                     - more -compared with $915 million in 2004.  SCE's 2005 earnings included positive items of $61 million related to afavorable tax settlement, $55 million from a favorable Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) decision on aSCE transmission proceeding and a $14 million incentive benefit from generator refunds related to the Californiaenergy crisis period.  SCE's 2004 earnings included $329 million of positive regulatory and tax items, primarilyfrom implementation of the 2003 general rate case decision that was received in July 2004.  Excluding thesenon-core items, core earnings were up $9 million due to higher net revenue, including tax benefits, and lowerfinancing costs, partially offset by the impact of a lower authorized rate of return on common equity in 2005.        MEHC's income from continuing operations was $322 million in 2005, compared to a loss of $666 million in2004.  MEHC's 2005 results include an impairment charge of $34 million related to the March Point project and a$15-million charge related to early debt retirements.  MEHC's 2004 results included a charge of $590 million forthe termination of the Collins Station lease, a net gain of $27 million on the sale of its interest in Four StarOil and Gas and the Brooklyn Navy Yard projects and a charge of $18 million related to a peaker impairment.Excluding these non-core items, MEHC's core earnings increased by $456 million over 2004 to $371 million.  Thisincrease was primarily due to higher wholesale energy margins mainly driven by higher prices, higher energytrading income and lower net interest expense.        Earnings in 2005 for Edison Capital were $91 million compared to $60 million in the same period lastyear.  The increase primarily reflects higher income from Edison Capital's investment in the Emerging EuropeInfrastructure Fund.  Excluding the 2004 charge related to the early debt retirements of $14 million, the lossfor "EIX parent company and other" decreased by $39 million primarily due to lower net interest expense.        Earnings from discontinued operations during 2005 primarily reflect positive tax adjustments of $28million resulting from the sales of international projects, a charge of $25 million related to a tax indemnityon an international project sold in 2004, $24 million in partial dividends from the Lakeland receivership, thesale of CBK and Tri-Energy earlier this year and other items.  Earnings from discontinued operations during2004, including a gain and recognition of a tax benefit, were $690 million.

MEHC had earnings from continuing operations and core earnings of $143 million for the quarter endedDecember 31, 2005, compared to a loss of $52 million in the same period last year.

Edison Capital's earnings for the quarter ended December 31, 2005, were $11 million compared to $26million in the same period last year.
