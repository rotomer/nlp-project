This presentation contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements reflect Edison International's current expectations and projections about future events based on Edison International's knowledge of present facts and circumstances and assumptions about future events and include any statement that does not directly relate to a historical or current fact.

Such statements necessarily involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Some of the risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause results to differ, or that otherwise could impact Edison International or its subsidiaries, include but are not limited to: the ability of Edison International to meet its financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends; the ability of SCE to recover its costs in a timely manner from its customers through regulated rates; decisions and other actions by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and other regulatory authorities and delays in regulatory actions; market risks affecting SCE's energy procurement activities; access to capital markets and the cost of capital; changes in interest rates, rates of inflation and foreign exchange rates; governmental, statutory, regulatory or administrative changes or initiatives affecting the electricity industry, including the market structure rules applicable to each market and environmental regulations that could require additional expenditures or otherwise affect the cost and manner of doing business; risks associated with operating nuclear and other power generating facilities, including operating risks, nuclear fuel storage, equipment failure, availability, heat rate and output; the availability of labor, equipment and materials; the ability to obtain sufficient insurance, including insurance relating to SCE's nuclear facilities; effects of legal proceedings, changes in or interpretations of tax laws, rates or policies, and changes in accounting standards; supply and demand for electric capacity and energy, and the resulting prices and dispatch volumes, in the wholesale markets to which MEHC generating units have access; the cost and availability of coal, natural gas, and fuel oil, nuclear fuel, and associated transportation; the cost and availability of emission credits or allowances for emission credits; transmission congestion in and to each market area and the resulting differences in prices between delivery points; the ability to provide sufficient collateral in support of hedging activities and purchased power and fuel; the extent of additional supplies of capacity, energy and ancillary services from current competitors or new market entrants, including the development of new generation facilities and technologies; general political, economic and business conditions; weather conditions, natural disasters and other unforeseen events; and changes in the fair value of investments and other assets accounted for using fair value accounting.
