The increase was primarily    driven by a distribution received from a discontinued operation.o   Excluding earnings from discontinued operations and other non-core items, core earnings per share were    56 cents in the first quarter of 2006 compared to 64 cents in the same period last year.o   Earnings per common share - $0.78o   Net Income - $258 milliono   Revenues - $2.8 billiono   Assets - $34.7 billion        For the quarter ended March 31, 2006, EIX recorded consolidated earnings per common share of 78 cents,compared to 61 cents in the first quarter of 2005. Excluding non-core items, EIX's first-quarter coreearnings per share were 56 cents, 8 cents lower than core earnings per share in the same period last year.        "Our quarterly earnings were impacted by an extended outage of a unit at our Homer City generatingstation and a delay in receiving a decision on our pending general rate case," said Chairman and CEO JohnBryson.  "The Homer City unit is now back online and a California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) decisionon the rate filing is expected soon."                                                   - MORE -EDISON REPORTS FIRST-QUARTER RESULTSPage 2 of 7        Key factors contributing to the decrease in core earnings include the impact from the delay in the2006 general rate case (GRC) decision at Southern California Edison Company (SCE), and at Edison MissionGroup Inc. (EMG), gains recorded in the first quarter of 2005 from Edison Capital's Emerging EuropeInfrastructure Fund, along with an outage at the Homer City facility, partially offset by higher wholesalemargins driven by higher energy prices at Mission Energy Holding Company (MEHC).        Beginning in the first quarter of 2006, the results of MEHC, Edison Capital and other smallersubsidiaries are presented on a consolidated basis as EMG.  This change has been made to reflect theintegrated management of MEHC and Edison Capital.  EMG, a subsidiary of EIX, has no other business activitiesother than through its ownership interest in its subsidiaries, including MEHC and Edison Capital.        SCE's first-quarter 2006 earnings from continuing operations were $121 million, compared to earningsof $131 million in the same period last year.  The decrease is primarily due to the impact of higheroperating costs associated with the utility's customer and system growth and the delay in receiving the 2006GRC decision.  When the 2006 GRC decision is issued, SCE will be authorized by the CPUC to recover itsrevenue requirement effective back to January 12, 2006.  The decrease in SCE's earnings was partially offsetby the return on investment earned by SCE's newly constructed Mountainview plant located in SouthernCalifornia's Inland Empire.        EMG's 2006 first-quarter earnings from continuing operations were $73 million, down $3 million fromthe same period last year.  MEHC's 2006 first-quarter earnings from continuing operations were $56 million,an increase of $31 million from the same period last year.  MEHC's 2005 first-quarter earnings include a$15-million after-tax charge related to the early extinguishment of debt at MEHC.  Excluding this item,MEHC's core earnings were $56 million in the first quarter of 2006, compared to $40 million in the same periodlast year.  The increase in core earnings was primarily due to higher wholesale energy margins driven byhigher prices at the Illinois Plants and higher interest and other income, partially offset by lowergeneration and higher maintenance expenses at Homer City in 2006 due to a transformer failure at Unit 3 onJanuary 29, 2006.  Homer City Unit 3 was returned to service on May 5, 2006.  The earnings for "EdisonCapital and other" were $17 million in the first quarter of 2006, down $34 million from the same period lastyear.  The decrease was largely due to 2005 gains from Edison Capital's investment in the Emerging EuropeInfrastructure Fund.        The first-quarter 2006 loss from "EIX (parent) and other" of $10 million was $3 million lower than thesame period last year primarily reflecting lower tax expense.                                                   - MORE -EDISON REPORTS FIRST-QUARTER RESULTSPage 3 of 7        EIX's earnings from discontinued operations were $73 million in the first quarter of 2006 reflectingthe receipt of a distribution from the U.K. Lakeland project previously owned by MEHC.  The earnings fromdiscontinued operations in the first quarter of 2005 of $7 million represent the operating results and salesimpacts from MEHC's Tri-Energy and CBK international projects.        Effective January 1, 2006, Edison International adopted a new accounting standard that requires thefair value accounting method for stock-based compensation.  Implementation of this new accounting standarddid not result in a material effect on first-quarter 2006 earnings.
