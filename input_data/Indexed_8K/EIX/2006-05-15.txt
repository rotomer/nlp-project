On May 11, 2006, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) issued a final decision in SouthernCalifornia Edison Company's (SCE) 2006 general rate case. SCE is a subsidiary of EdisonInternational.  The general rate case decision authorized a base rate increase above currently-authorizedrates of approximately $134 million for 2006.  The increase authorized by the CPUC is $274 millionabove currently-authorized rates, but SCE will offset $140 million of this increase through a one-time creditfrom an existing balancing account.  The CPUC also authorized increases of $74 million in 2007, and$104 million in 2008.  The decision substantially approved SCE's request to continue its capital investment programfor the infrastructure replacement and expansion.        The decision is retroactive to January 12, 2006, when the decision was initially forecasted to be rendered.The balance in the account established to record the recovery of the authorized rate increase since that datewill be recovered in rates over the next 12 months.Page 2                                                          Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly causedthis report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
