Forward-Looking Statement
This presentation contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements reflect Edison International's current expectations and projections about future events based on Edison International's knowledge of present facts and circumstances and assumptions about future events and include any statement that does not directly relate to a historical or current fact. In this presentation and elsewhere, the words "expects," "believes," "anticipates," "estimates," "projects," "intends," "plans," "probable," "may," "will," "could," "would," "should," and variations of such words and similar expressions, or discussions of strategy or of plans, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements necessarily involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Some of the risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause results to differ, or that otherwise could impact Edison International or its subsidiaries, include but are not limited to: the ability of Edison International to meet its financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends; the ability of Southern California Edison (SCE) to recover its costs in a timely manner from its customers through regulated rates; decisions and other actions by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and other regulatory authorities and delays in regulatory actions; market risks affecting SCE's energy procurement activities; access to capital markets and the cost of capital; changes in interest rates, rates of inflation and foreign exchange rates; governmental, statutory, regulatory or administrative changes or initiatives affecting the electricity industry, including the market structure rules applicable to each market and environmental regulations that could require additional expenditures or otherwise affect the cost and manner of doing business; risks associated with operating nuclear and other power generating facilities, including operating risks, nuclear fuel storage, equipment failure, availability, heat rate and output; the availability of labor, equipment and materials; the ability to obtain sufficient insurance, including insurance relating to SCE's nuclear facilities; effects of legal proceedings, changes in or interpretations of tax laws, rates or policies, and changes in accounting standards; supply and demand for electric capacity and energy, and the resulting prices and dispatch volumes, in the wholesale markets to which MEHC generating units have access; the cost and availability of coal, natural gas, and fuel oil, nuclear fuel, and associated transportation; the cost and availability of emission credits or allowances for emission credits; transmission congestion in and to each market area and the resulting differences in prices between delivery points; the ability to provide sufficient collateral in support of hedging activities and purchased power and fuel; the extent of additional supplies of capacity, energy and ancillary services from current competitors or new market entrants, including the development of new generation facilities and technologies; general political, economic and business conditions; weather conditions, natural disasters and other unforeseen events; and changes in the fair value of investments and other assets accounted for using fair value accounting.
Additional information about risks and uncertainties, including more detail about the factors described above, is contained in Edison International's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Readers are urged to read such reports and carefully consider the risks, uncertainties and other factors that affect Edison International's business. Readers also should review future reports filed by Edison International with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Assumptions Detail
NAPP, "Northern Appalachian"; PRB, "Powder River Basin"
Actual future Fuel Costs, excluding emissions, may differ from estimated future fuel costs, excluding emissions due to a number of factors including SO2 adjustments, Btu adjustments, changes in spot prices/new contracts, inventory build or reduction, changes in costs based on contractually determined escalators and exercise of options under certain agreements.
Fuel Costs, excluding emissions, include coal and coal transportation costs, natural gas and oil used for start-up and, at Homer City, limestone costs and excludes all emissions purchases and/or sales. Reflects average inventory costs.
NAPP Coal is a proxy for the actual coal purchased by Homer City. Two types of coal, ready to burn and raw, are purchased for Units 1 and 2. Ready to burn coal is of a quality that can be burned directly in Units 1 and 2, whereas the raw coal purchased for Units 1 and 2 must be cleaned in the coal cleaning plant. Coal for all three units is generally sourced within 100 miles of the facility.
Coal Contracts (% hedged) are based on expected burn for the calendar year and deliveries during that year. Percentages are calculated without regard to potential changes in coal inventory.
Energy price sensitivities are based on a $1/MWh change in the realized price for each unhedged MWh sold. Additional changes in volume or correlated changes in the price of fuel or emissions are not incorporated. Coal price sensitivities are based on the unhedged fuel requirement and a 10% change in coal commodity price of PRB, related to Midwest Generation requirements, and NAPP coal, as a proxy for the coal types burned at Homer City. A 10% change in NAPP coal is assumed to drive a 10% change in Homer City coal types although the absolute price change may be different.
Average hedge price reflects the total value of the on- and off-peak hedges and is not directly comparable to the flat energy price.
The earnings impact of SO2 price changes incorporates a forecast of emissions that may vary depending upon the sulfur content of coal and generation levels. Generation levels may also impact NOx emissions and the related earnings impact.
