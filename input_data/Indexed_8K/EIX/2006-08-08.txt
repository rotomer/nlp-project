This increase was        primarily driven by improved results from the independent power business, partially offset by gains        recorded in 2005 from an Edison Capital infrastructure fund investment.Second Quarter 2006 Highlights:o       Earnings per common share - $0.54o       Net Income - $177 milliono       Revenue - $3.0 billiono       Assets - $35.2 billiono       Equity - $7.1 billionSECOND-QUARTER EARNINGS SUMMARY        For the quarter ended June 30, 2006, Edison International recorded consolidated earnings of 54 cents pershare, compared to 61 cents per share for the same period last year.  Excluding earnings from discontinuedoperations and other non-core items, Edison International's second-quarter core earnings were 55 cents per sharein 2006, compared to 54 cents per share in the same period in 2005.        "Second quarter core earnings which include results from the 2006 General Rate Case decision weresolid," commented John E. Bryson, chairman and CEO, Edison International.  "The experience of the heat stormjust two weeks ago demonstrated the importance of that decision in supporting our planned continued recordlevels of capital investment in the utility's distribution and transmission system."                                                   - MORE -Page 1EDISON REPORTS SECOND-QUARTER RESULTSPage 2 of 9SECOND-QUARTER EARNINGS DETAILEarnings (Loss) from Continuing Operations        Southern California Edison Company's (SCE) earnings from continuing operations were $234 million inthe second quarter of 2006, an increase of $73 million compared to the second quarter of 2005.  SCE's resultsinclude an $81 million, or 25-cents-per-share, one-time benefit from resolution of an outstanding stateincome tax issue.  Excluding non-core items, SCE's second-quarter 2006 core earnings were $153 millioncompared to $157 million in the second quarter of 2005.  This change reflects the net impact of higherrevenue at SCE associated with the implementation of the 2006 General Rate Case (GRC) decision and the returnon investment earned by SCE's Mountainview plant, more than offset by higher operating and income taxexpenses.  SCE received the 2006 GRC decision in May, allowing the company to recover its net revenue back toearly January, which was recorded in the second quarter.  Also, as a result of the seasonality of thecompany's sales, along with the rate design approved in the GRC decision, SCE's base rate revenue will behigher in the third quarter compared to the other three quarters of 2006.        Edison Mission Group's (EMG) 2006 second-quarter loss from continuing operations was $56 million,down $81 million from results in the same period last year.  As a part of EMG, Mission Energy HoldingCompany's (MEHC) second-quarter 2006 loss of $60 million includes an after-tax charge of $88 million, or 27cents per share, reflecting the early extinguishment of debt related to Edison Mission Energy's bondrefinancing.  Excluding this charge, MEHC's core earnings were $28 million, an improvement of $26 millionover the second quarter of 2005.  The increase is primarily due to higher wholesale energy margins mainlydriven by higher prices at the Illinois Plants and Homer City, an estimated insurance recovery at Homer Cityrelated to the Unit 3 outage, and higher net interest income, partially offset by higher taxes.  Earnings inthe second quarter of 2006 for Edison Capital, also part of EMG, were $4 million compared to $23 million inthe second quarter of 2005.  This decrease is primarily due to Edison Capital's share of income from itsinvestment in the Emerging Europe Infrastructure Fund which recorded a gain in the second quarter of 2005.Earnings from Discontinued Operations        Edison International's earnings from discontinued operations were $4 million in the second quarter of2006 compared to $21 million in the same period last year.  The 2006 and 2005 earnings resulted primarilyfrom distributions received related to the Lakeland project.

Edison International had earnings fromcontinuing operations of $1.08 per share for the six-month period ended June 30, 2006, compared with $1.15 pershare for the same period last year.  Excluding earnings from discontinued operations and other non-core items,Edison International's core earnings for the six-month period were $1.10 per share in 2006, compared to $1.19 pershare in the same period in 2005.YEAR-TO-DATE EARNINGS DETAILEarnings (Loss) from Continuing Operations        SCE's earnings from continuing operations in the first half of 2006 were $355 million, an increase of$63 million compared to the same period last year.  SCE's results include an $81 million one-time benefitfrom the resolution of an outstanding state income tax issue.  Excluding non-core items, SCE's core earningswere $274 million compared to $288 million in the same period last year as the higher base rate revenueauthorized by the 2006 GRC, and the earnings from SCE's Mountainview project, were more than offset by higheroperating and income tax expenses.  Also, as a result of the seasonality of the company's sales, along withthe rate design approved in the GRC decision, SCE's base rate revenue will be higher in the third quartercompared to the other three quarters of 2006.        EMG's earnings from continuing operations for the first six months of 2006 were $17 million, down $85million from the same period last year.  Excluding non-core items, MEHC's core earnings were $86 million, anincrease of $42 million.  This increase primarily reflects higher wholesale energy margins mainly driven byhigher prices at the Illinois Plants, higher net interest income, and higher energy trading income, partiallyoffset by higher taxes.  Edison Capital's earnings for the six months ended June 30, 2006, were $19 million,down $54 million from the same period last year when results included gains from its Emerging EuropeInfrastructure Fund investment.    MEHC's equity in income from its energy projects is seasonal and therefore materially higher in the thirdquarter compared to other quarters of the year, due to warmer weather during the summer months and because anumber of MEHC's energy projects located on the West Coast have power sales contracts that provide for higherpayments during the summer months.                                                   - MORE -Page 3EDISON REPORTS SECOND-QUARTER RESULTSPage 4 of 9Earnings from Discontinued Operations        Edison International's earnings from discontinued operations were $77 million for the six-monthperiod ending June 30, 2006, compared to $28 million for the same period last year, with both years' earningsresulting primarily from distributions from MEHC's Lakeland project.
