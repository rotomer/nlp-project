 -  NAPP, "Northern Appalachian"; PRB, "Powder River Basin"
 -  Actual future Fuel Costs, excluding emissions, may differ from estimated future fuel costs, excluding emissions due
to a number of factors including SO2 adjustments, Btu adjustments, changes in spot prices/new contracts, inventory
build or reduction, changes in costs based on contractually determined escalators and exercise of options under certain
agreements.
 -  Fuel Costs, excluding emissions, include coal and coal transportation costs, natural gas and oil used for start-up and,
at Homer City, limestone costs and excludes all emissions purchases and/or sales. Reflects average inventory costs.
 -  NAPP Coal is a proxy for the actual coal purchased by Homer City. Two types of coal, ready to burn and raw, are
purchased for Units 1 and 2. Ready to burn coal is of a quality that can be burned directly in Units 1 and 2, whereas the
raw coal purchased for Units 1 and 2 must be cleaned in the coal cleaning plant. Coal for all three units is generally
sourced within 100 miles of the facility.
 -  Coal Contracts (% hedged) are based on expected burn for the calendar year and deliveries during that year.
Percentages are calculated without regard to potential changes in coal inventory.
 -  Energy price sensitivities are based on a $1/MWh change in the realized price for each unhedged MWh sold. This
sensitivity does not capture possible changes to generation output or correlated changes in the price of fuel or
emissions.
 -  Coal price sensitivities are based on the unhedged fuel requirement and a 10% change in coal commodity price of PRB,
related to Midwest Generation requirements, and NAPP coal, as a proxy for the coal types burned at Homer City. A
10% change in NAPP coal is assumed to drive a 10% change in Homer City coal types although the absolute price
change may be different.
 -  Average hedge price reflects the total value of the on- and off-peak hedges and is not directly comparable to the flat
energy price.
 -  The earnings impact of SO2 price changes incorporates a forecast of emissions that may vary depending upon the
sulfur content of coal and generation levels. Generation levels may also impact NOx emissions and the related earnings
impact.
