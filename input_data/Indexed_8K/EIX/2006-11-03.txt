For 2007, Edison International is updating total earnings    guidance to a range of $3.05 - $3.45 per share.Third Quarter 2006 Financial Highlights:o   Earnings per common share - $1.38o   Net Income - $458 milliono   Revenue - $3.8 billiono   Assets - $36.3 billiono   Equity - $7.5 billionTHIRD-QUARTER EARNINGS SUMMARY        "During the quarter, we continued to take large steps to meet the future energy needs of our utilitycustomers and to contract the forward generation of our EMG competitive generation power plants," commentedJohn E. Bryson, chairman and CEO, Edison International. "Southern California Edison began work on up to 225megawatts of peaker projects to be operational by next summer and Edison Mission Group substantiallyincreased forward power sales through 2009."                                                   - more -Page 1THIRD-QUARTER EARNINGS DETAILEarnings (Loss) from Continuing Operations       SCE's earnings from continuing operations were $263 million in the third quarter of 2006, compared to$280 million in the third quarter of 2005.  SCE's 2006 third-quarter results include a $24 million, or7-cents-per-share, benefit from a generator settlement.  Third quarter 2005 earnings include a positive itemof $61 million, or 19 cents per share, related to an IRS tax settlement.  Excluding these non-core items,SCE's third-quarter 2006 core earnings were $239 million, up $20 million over the same period last year.  Thisincrease reflects the impact of higher net revenue at SCE associated with the 2006 General Rate Case (GRC)and earnings from the Mountainview plant, offset by higher income tax expense.        EMG's third-quarter earnings from continuing operations in 2006 were $204 million compared to $159million in 2005.  Mission Energy Holding Company (MEHC), a subsidiary of EMG, had earnings of $155 million inthe third quarter of 2005 that included an after-tax impairment charge of $34 million, or 10 cents per share,related to the March Point project.  Excluding non-core items, MEHC's third quarter core earnings in 2006were $180 million, compared to $189 million in the third quarter of 2005.  The decrease is primarily theresult of lower income from energy trading, and lower project income primarily due to the Big Four and Doga.The decrease in MEHC's core earnings is partially offset by favorable quarter-over-quarter results at HomerCity from a SFAS No. 133 net impact and lower net corporate interest expense.  Earnings in the third quarterof 2006 for Edison Capital, also part of EMG, were $24 million, an increase of $20 million over the thirdquarter of 2005.  This increase is primarily due to Edison Capital's share of gains from its investment inthe Emerging Europe Infrastructure Fund.Earnings (Loss) from Discontinued Operations        Edison International's loss from discontinued operations was $2 million in the third quarter of 2006compared to earnings of $27 million in the same period last year.  The 2005 earnings primarily reflectpositive tax adjustments resulting from the sale of international projects.

Excluding earnings from discontinuedoperations and other non-core items, Edison International's core earnings for the nine-month period were $2.43per share in 2006, compared to $2.42 per share in the same period in 2005.YEAR-TO-DATE EARNINGS DETAILEarnings (Loss) from Continuing Operations        SCE's earnings from continuing operations for the nine-month period ending September 30, 2006, were $618million, an increase of $46 million compared to the same period last year.  SCE's results include severalnon-core items:  an $81 million benefit from the resolution of an outstanding state income tax issue in 2006, a$24 million generator settlement in 2006 and a $61 million benefit from an IRS tax settlement and a $4 milliongenerator refund incentive in 2005.  Excluding these non-core items, SCE's year-to-date core earnings in 2006were $513 million, up $6 million from the same period last year. Higher net revenue authorized in the 2006 GRCdecision, along with earnings from SCE's Mountainview project were partially offset by higher income taxexpense.        EMG's earnings from continuing operations for the first nine months of 2006 were $221 million, down $40million from the same period last year.  MEHC's year-to-date earnings include several non-core items:  anafter-tax charge of $88 million, or 27 cents per share, reflecting the early extinguishment of debt related toEdison Mission Energy's debt refinancing in 2006, and the March Point plant impairment of $34 million and acharge of $15 million also related to extinguishment of debt in 2005.  Excluding these non-core items, MEHC'syear-to-date 2006 core earnings were $265 million compared to $233 million in the same period last year.  Thisincrease primarily reflects lower net interest expense, higher wholesale energy margins mainly driven by higherprices at the Illinois Plants, partially offset by tax benefits recognized in 2005 and lower trading and projectincome primarily due to the Big Four and Doga.  Edison Capital's earnings for the nine months ended September30, 2006, were $44 million, down $33 million from the same period last year reflecting the impact of highergains in 2005 from its Emerging Europe Infrastructure Fund investment partially offset by lower net corporateinterest expense in 2006.Earnings from Discontinued Operations        Earnings from discontinued operations for the nine-month period ending September 30, 2006, were  $75million resulting primarily from distributions from MEHC's Lakeland project.  Earnings fromdiscontinued operations for the nine-month period ending September 30, 2005, were $55 million, includingpositive tax adjustments of $28 million related to the international sales and distributions from the Lakelandproject of $24 million.                                                     - more -Page 3                                                   Year-to-Date September 30,Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share (Unaudited)                 2006          2005          Change                                                 ----------------------------------------------  Southern California Edison Company                         $1.90         $1.75         $0.15  Edison Mission Group       Mission Energy Holding Company                         0.54          0.57         (0.03)       Edison Capital                                         0.14          0.23         (0.09)                                                 ----------------------------------------------              Edison Mission Group Total                      0.68          0.80         (0.12)  EIX (Parent) and Other                                     (0.10)        (0.08)        (0.02)- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------EIX Consol.
