1 Represents the mid-point of the EMG guidance range.

Assumptions Detail
 -  NAPP, "Northern Appalachian"; PRB, "Powder River Basin"
 -  Actual future Fuel Costs may differ from estimated future fuel costs, due to a number of factors including contractual SO2 adjustments, emissions price changes, changes in emissions rates and regulations, contractual Btu adjustments, changes in spot prices/new contracts, inventory build or reduction, changes in costs based on contractually determined escalators and exercise of options under certain agreements.
 -  Fuel Costs include coal and coal transportation costs, coal cleaning costs, natural gas and oil used for start-up and, at Homer City, limestone costs and includes emissions purchases. Reflects average inventory costs.
 -  NAPP Coal is a proxy for the actual coal purchased by Homer City. Two types of coal, ready to burn and raw, are purchased for Units 1 and 2. Ready to burn coal is of a quality that can be burned directly in Units 1 and 2, whereas the raw coal purchased for Units 1 and 2 must be cleaned in the coal cleaning plant. Coal for all three units is generally sourced within 100 miles of the facility.
 -  The amount of coal under contracts in tons is calculated based on contracted tons and applying an 8,800 British Thermal units (Btu) equivalent for the Illinois Plants and 13,000 Btu equivalent for the Homer City facilities.
 -  Average hedge price reflects the total value of the on- and off-peak hedges and is not directly comparable to the flat energy price.

EMG  Liquidity Profile
Available Liquidity Collateral
 -  Cash expected to decline in 2008 from payoff of MEHC notes and growth investments
 -  Strong market conditions allowed EME to replace $98 million revolver with $500 million, 6-year facility
 -  Enhanced liquidity: $1 billion of credit facilities between MWG and EME
