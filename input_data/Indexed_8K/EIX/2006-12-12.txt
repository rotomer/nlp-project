Section 8 - Other EventsItem 8.01 Other Events.On December 12, 2006, Edison International's indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary, Midwest Generation, LLC,announced that it had reached an agreement in principle with the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency toreduce mercury, nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions at Midwest Generation's Illinois coal-fired powerplants.A copy of the press release announcing the agreement in principle is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this CurrentReport on Form 8-K.Implementation of the agreement will require further regulatory proceedings in order to become effective, andonce implemented the agreement will provide reasonable certainty of the timing and amount of emissionsreductions which will be required of Midwest Generation's Illinois plants for these pollutants through 2018.No assurance can be given that all required regulatory approvals will be received and if not received MidwestGeneration will remain subject to existing and future requirements as to emissions of these pollutants.If the agreement is implemented as contemplated, Midwest Generation will be required to achieve specifiedemissions reductions through a combination of environmental retrofits or unit shutdowns. The agreementcontemplates three phases with each phase relating to one of the pollutants involved. Capital expenditureswill be required for each phase.The first phase involves installing by 2009 activated carbon injection technology for the removal of mercury,a technology which Midwest Generation has been testing at some of its plants. Capital expenditures relatingto these controls are currently estimated to be approximately $60 million.The second phase requires the installation by the end of 2011 of additional controls to remove nitrogen oxideon several units which do not currently have these controls. Capital expenditures for these controls arecurrently estimated to be approximately $450 million.Thereafter, during the third phase of the plan, the focus will be on the reduction of sulfur dioxideemissions.  Midwest Generation will be required for several units at its six plants in Illinois either toplace controls on these units between 2012 and 2018 for this purpose or to remove them from service.  MidwestGeneration will consider many factors in making this choice including, among others, an assessment of thecost and performance of environmental technologies and equipment, the remaining estimated useful life of eachaffected unit and the market outlook for the prices of various commodities including electrical energy andcapacity, coal and natural gas.  In view of the many factors involved,                                                     2Page 2  Midwest Generation has not at this time determined what actions it may take at each affected unit to providefor optimal compliance with the agreement during its third phase.  At this time, however, additional capitalexpenditures during the third phase of the plan are currently estimated as being in the range ofapproximately $2.2 billion to $2.9 billion depending on the number of units on which controls are placedversus the number which are removed from service.  For a number of the reasons described above, actualcapital expenditures may vary substantially from the above estimates.

Exhibit 99.1FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASETuesday, December 12                                                                             Contact:                                                                             Doug McFarlan                                                                             Midwest Generation                                                                             312/583-6024, or                                                                             312/343-2561                   Midwest Generation, Governor Agree On Long-Range Emissions Reduction PlanChicago-based independent power producer Midwest Generation announced today that it has reached agreementwith Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich on a comprehensive, long-range plan that will begin reducing mercuryemissions from its power plants 18 months ahead of federal regulations, followed by multi-year programs tofurther cut other emissions at each of the company's six plants in Illinois.As part of the agreement, Edison Mission Group (EMG), Midwest Generation's parent company, and the state havecommitted to work jointly to develop up to 400 megawatts of new wind power projects, provided the company canobtain "commercially reasonable" terms for building and selling the output from the projects.  EMG is thefifth largest owner of wind energy projects in the U.S,. and is developing the proposed 200-megawatt Big Skywind project near LaSalle.Further, the company and state have agreed to work jointly on the terms and conditions that would be requiredfor Midwest Gen to build new "clean coal" generation which would gasify Illinois coal to produce electricityand permanently sequester carbon dioxide emissions.The long-range emissions plan has three components.    o   Emissions of mercury will be reduced by the installation of mercury controls at every        Midwest Gen facility by July of 2009.  Due to special concerns about mercury in Lake Michigan,        controls will be installed on plants in the cities of Chicago and Waukegan by July of 2008.  As a        result, installation of mercury controls will begin 18 months ahead of federal regulations and a year        ahead of more stringent state rules that have been approved by the Illinois Pollution Control Board        and which may be acted on by the General Assembly's Joint Committee on Administrative Rules today.    o   The emission rate for nitrogen oxide - a contributor to smog and ozone - will be        reduced by 66 percent as of Jan. 1, 2012.  That reduction is on top of a 50 percent reduction Midwest        Gen has achieved since acquiring its Illinois plants in 1999.    o   The emission rate for sulfur dioxide - a contributor to acid rain and fine        particulates - will be reduced by 78 percent between 2012 and 2018.  That reduction is on top of a 30        percent reduction Midwest Gen has achieved since acquiring its Illinois plants.The reductions in nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions are designed to help the city of Chicago andthe metropolitan area comply with federal regulations for ozone and fine particulates.By the end of the long-range plan, every Midwest Generation station that remains in operation will haveadditional pollution control equipment for nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions.  As part of itsimplementation plan, the company plans to shut down the three smallest generating units in its fleet - twounits at the Will County Station in Romeoville and one at its Waukegan Station - between the end of 2007 andthe end of 2010.  The company also has committed that its smallest plant - the single-unit Fisk GenerationStation in Chicago - will either have additional controls for sulfur dioxide emissions or be shut down by theend of 2015.  The same agreement to shut down or install additional controls applies to the Waukegan Stationby the end of 2014 and to the Crawford Station in Chicago by the end of 2018.Exhibit Page 1
"This agreement means cleaner air and cleaner water, and that means fewer health problems for children, forpregnant women, and for people all across Illinois. It took a lot of work to get to this point, but thanks tothe environmental community, Midwest Generation and the work of people like our EPA Director Doug Scott,we've achieved something no other state has done. And the result means a cleaner, healthier state," saidGovernor Blagojevich."This agreement provides long-term certainty for both the state and our company, helps the state and city ofChicago achieve their clean air goals, and allows us to plan and manage significant capital investments andprojects in a reasonable timeframe," said Ted Craver, Edison Mission Group CEO.  "We came to Illinois in 1999committed to environmental leadership, we delivered with immediate emission reductions at all our sites, andnow we will build on that record with a steady stream of additional reductions over the next decade.""The agreement recognizes the importance of Midwest Generation's plants to reliability of the electric systemand carefully balances environmental concerns with the need for a diverse fuel supply that includes coal, ourmost abundant domestic energy resource," Craver added.  "Equally important is our strong interest in workingwith the governor to grow our business in clean coal and renewable energy generation in Illinois."Craver said the company is especially pleased to help the city of Chicago assume national leadership inreducing mercury emissions from power plants.  The mercury removal technology the company will use was testedlast summer at the Crawford Generation Station in Chicago through a partnership between Midwest Gen and theU.S. Department of Energy.Edison Mission Group and the state have entered into a memorandum of understanding on the agreement.  Themechanics for implementing the agreement will be submitted to the Pollution Control Board.Headquartered in Chicago, Midwest Generation operates six power plants in Illinois: the Fisk and Crawfordstations in Chicago, Waukegan Station, Joliet Station, Will County Station in Romeoville and Powerton Stationin Pekin.  The company has approximately 1,200 employees, about 70 percent of whom are represented by theInternational Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.Midwest Generation is a subsidiary of Edison Mission Group of Irvine, Calif., which manages the competitivepower generation businesses of Rosemead, Calif.-based Edison International (NYSE:EIX).  Edison Internationalis an electric power generator and distributor, and an investor in infrastructure and renewable energyprojects with assets totaling more than $36 billion.  The company is comprised of a regulated utility,Southern California Edison, as well as EMG.Exhibit Page 2                                                       2
