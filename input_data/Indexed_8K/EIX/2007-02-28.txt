The results included non-core adjustments detailedin Chart 1.  Edison International's core earnings were $3.07 per share for 2006, compared to $3.13 per share forthe same period last year.  This decrease primarily reflects lower wholesale energy margins at MidwestGeneration, lower energy trading income at MEHC and higher income tax expense partially offset by higherauthorized net revenue from SCE's general rate case, Mountainview operations, lower net interest and favorableresults from SFAS #133 adjustments.YEAR 2006 EARNINGS DETAILEarnings (Loss) from Continuing Operations        SCE earnings from continuing operations were $776 million in 2006, compared with $725 million in 2005.SCE's 2006 results included non-core items of $158 million, primarily from the resolution of several regulatoryand tax issues, a generator settlement and generator refund incentives.  SCE's 2005 earnings included non-coreitems of $130 million.  (See Chart 1 for details.)  Excluding these non-core items, SCE's core earnings in 2006were $618 million, up $23 million over last year. This increase is due to higher net revenue authorized in the2006 general rate case decision and earnings from Mountainview, partially offset by higher income tax expense.        EMG's earnings from continuing operations in 2006 were $334 million compared to $414 million in 2005.Mission Energy Holding Company (MEHC) had earnings of $246 million in 2006 compared to $332 million in 2005.MEHC's earnings from continuing operations included non-core charges of $90 million in 2006 and $49 million in2005 reflecting the early extinguishment of debt and the impairment of an investment.  (See Chart 1 for details.)Excluding these items, MEHC's core earnings were $336 million, a decrease of $45 million from 2005.  Thisdecrease was primarily due to lower wholesale energy margins at Midwest Generation, lower energytrading income and an increase in income tax expense, partially offset by a favorable SFAS #133 net impact andlower net interest expense.  SFAS #133unrealized gains in 2006 were $39 million compared to unrealized losses of $35 million in 2005.  Edison Capital's2006 earnings were $88 million, an increase of $6 million over last year primarily due to lower net corporateinterest expense and overhead, and a gain on the sale of an affordable housing project, partially offset by lowergains from global infrastructure fund investments.Earnings from Discontinued Operations        Edison International's earnings from discontinued operations were $97 million in 2006 and $30 millionin 2005 primarily due to distributions from MEHC's Lakeland project and other adjustments related toof some of MEHC's international projects that were sold in 2004.

The results included non-core adjustments detailedin Chart 2.  Edison International's core earnings were $0.65 per share for the three-month period endingDecember 31, 2006, compared to $0.71 per share for the same period last year.  This decrease primarily reflectslower results at Midwest Generation and lower energy trading income at MEHC, partially offset by a favorableSFAS #133 net impact at MEHC, higher net revenue at SCE and higher income from Edison Capital.FOURTH-QUARTER EARNINGS DETAILEarnings (Loss) from Continuing Operations        SCE's earnings from continuing operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2006, were $158 millioncompared to $153 million in the same period last year.  SCE's 2006 fourth quarter earnings included $53 millionin non-core items primarily from the favorable resolution of a state tax apportionment issue.  SCE's results for2005 included positive non-core items of $65 million.  (See Chart 2 for details.)  Excluding these items, SCE's2006 core earnings for the quarter were $105 million, compared to $88 million in the same period last year.This increase reflects lower income tax expense, the impact of higher net revenue associated with the 2006general rate case and earnings from Mountainview, partially offset by lower other income.        EMG's fourth-quarter earnings from continuing operations in 2006 were $113 million compared to $153million in 2005. MEHC had earnings from continuing operations of $69 million for the quarter ended December 31,2006, compared to $148 million in the same period last year.  MEHC's 2006 fourth-quarter core earnings of $71million were $77 million lower than the same period last year.  This decrease was primarily due to lowerwholesale energy margins at Midwest Generation and lower trading income partially offset by favorable SFAS #133unrealized gains and lower net interest expense.  Unrealized gains in 2006 fourth-quarter earnings were $17million compared to unrealized gains of $5 million in the fourth quarter of last year.  Earnings in the fourthquarter of 2006 for Edison Capital were $44 million compared to $5 million in the same period last year.  Thisincrease is primarily due to Edison Capital's share of gains from its investments in global infrastructurefunds, additional income from leveraged leases due to favorable guidance from the Internal Revenue Service issuedin the fourth quarter and a gain on the sale of an affordable housing project.                                                   - more -Page 3Earnings (Loss) from Discontinued Operations       Edison International's earnings from discontinued operations were $22 million in the fourth quarter of2006 compared to a loss of $26 million in the same period last year.
