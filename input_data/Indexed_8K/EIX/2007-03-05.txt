EMG/BP  Carson Hydrogen Power Project Overview
 -  Provides up to 500 MW of new, clean generating capacity for southern California
 -  Captures 4 million tons of CO2 per year
- Petroleum coke converted to hydrogen and CO2  about 90% of the CO 2 captured
- Hydrogen gas used to fuel gas turbines to generate electricity
- Captured CO2 transported by pipeline to oilfields and injected into rock formations, stimulating additional oil production and permanently trapping the CO 2
