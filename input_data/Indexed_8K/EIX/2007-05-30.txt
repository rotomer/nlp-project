Constructive Regulatory Environment
Rate Base
General Rate Case (GRC) provides three-year forward looking rate-setting mechanism based on forecast
spending; affirmed twice
2006 GRC Decision approved majority of capital requests and operating expenses
2006 GRC Decision results in increased depreciation providing annual cash flow of about $1 billion for 2006-2008
Plan to file 2009 GRC Notice of Intent in July 2007 and application in November 2007
Investors' Return
11.6% return on common equity (ROCE) approved through 2007
11.8% ROCE requested May 2007 in 2008 Cost of Capital application - to be effective January 2008
Energy Efficiency
CPUC is considering plans to share energy efficiency economic savings between ratepayers and investors
Procurement Cost
Energy Resources Recovery Account (ERRA) and related Trigger Mechanism provides timely recovery of procurement costs and mitigates energy price exposure
Customer Rates
Only limited rate increases expected in GRC as new rate base growth will be partially offset from lower purchased electricity costs as legacy contracts expire
California's regulatory framework has been strengthened to support Growth, reliability needs and mitigate risks of volatile commodity prices
