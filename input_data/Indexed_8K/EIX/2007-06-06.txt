Edison International  What's New
Suzlon Wind Energy Corporation has signed a contract with EMG for 300 units of the S88 - 2.1 MW turbine, or 630 MW of wind turbine capacity. The two-phase contract calls for delivery of 315 MW of turbine capacity in 2008 and another 315 MW of capacity in 2009. The turbines will be sited at various locations across the country, which are yet to be announced.
New meter connections for 2007 expected to be 75,626, slightly lower than our May update number of 77,690 as the drop in housing starts which began in mid-2006 is a little deeper than previously forecasted.
SCE expanded its agreement with Calpine to purchase 225 MW of geothermal energy for 10 years and entered into a new agreement for 714 MW of non-renewable capacity for 2008-2011.
Although DPV2 has received CAISO, CPUC, USFWS and Arizona Siting Commission approvals, the Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC) denied approval of the project on May 30, 2007. The company is evaluating its options for the project.
Bid evaluation in process for 2007 solicitation of 10-, 15- and 20-year renewable contracts; intend to finalize by 2Q 2008.
