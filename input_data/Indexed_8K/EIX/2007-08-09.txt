SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS DETAIL
Earnings (Loss) from Continuing Operations
Southern California Edison Company's (SCE) 2007 second quarter earnings from continuing operations were $144 million, or $0.44 per share, compared to earnings of $234 million, or $0.72 per share, in the same period last year. SCE's 2006 second quarter results include a non-core benefit of $81 million, or $0.25 per share, related to the resolution of an outstanding issue involving a portion of revenue collected during 2001-2003 related to state income taxes. Excluding this item, SCE's core earnings decreased by $9 million, or $0.03 per share, from the second quarter of 2006. This decrease was primarily due to the catch-up adjustment upon receipt of the 2006 general rate case decision in May of last year, which was effective back to January 12, 2006, partially offset by the favorable resolution of an outstanding state income tax issue.
Edison Mission Group's (EMG) 2007 second quarter loss from continuing operations was $49 million, or $0.15 per share, compared to a loss of $56 million, or $0.17 per share in the same period last year. EMG's second quarter results in both 2007 and 2006 were impacted by non-core after-tax charges of $148 million and $88 million, respectively, associated with early extinguishment of debt. Excluding these charges, EMG's 2007 second quarter core earnings were $99 million, or $0.30 per share, an improvement of $67 million, or $0.20 per share, over the second quarter of 2006. The improvement was primarily due to an increase in energy margins at Midwest Generation, driven by higher generation and average realized energy prices, and higher earnings from Edison Capital.
Earnings from Discontinued Operations
Edison International's earnings from discontinued operations were $2 million and $4 million in the second quarter of 2007 and 2006, respectively, or $0.01 per share in each period related to EMG's former international projects.

Edison International had earnings from continuing operations of $421 million, or $1.28 per share, for the six-month period ended June 30, 2007, compared with $357 million, or $1.08 per share, for the same period last year. Excluding earnings from discontinued operations and other non-core items, Edison International's core earnings for the six-month period were $538 million, or $1.63 per share, in 2007, compared to $364 million, or $1.10 per share, in the same period in 2006.
YEAR-TO-DATE EARNINGS DETAIL
Earnings (Loss) from Continuing Operations
SCE's earnings from continuing operations in the first half of 2007 were $325 million, or $1.00 per share, a decrease of $30 million, or $0.09 per share, compared to the same period last year. SCE's 2007 results include a non-core tax benefit of $31 million, or $0.10 per share, primarily reflecting progress on an appeal with the Internal Revenue Service related to the income tax treatment of certain costs associated with environmental remediation. SCE's 2006 results include a non-core benefit of $81 million, or $0.25 per share, related to the resolution of an outstanding issue involving a portion of revenue collected during 2001-2003 related to state income taxes. Excluding non-core items, SCE's core earnings were $294 million, or $0.90 per share, compared to $274 million, or $0.84 per share, in the same period last year, mainly due to higher revenue associated with the 2006 general rate case decision and lower taxes from the favorable resolution of an outstanding state income tax issue.
EMG's earnings from continuing operations for the first six months of 2007 were $106 million, or $0.33 per share, up $89 million, or $0.28 per share, from the same period last year. Both 2007 and 2006 results were impacted by non-core after-tax charges of $148 million and $88 million, or $0.45 and $0.27 per share, respectively, associated with early extinguishment of debt. Excluding non-core items, EMG's core earnings were $254 million, or $0.78 per share, an increase of $149 million, or $0.46 per share. This increase primarily reflects higher energy margins at Midwest Generation and Homer City mainly due to higher average realized energy prices and generation, and higher earnings from Edison Capital.

Earnings from Discontinued Operations
Edison International's earnings from discontinued operations were $5 million for the six-month period ending June 30, 2007, compared to $77 million for the same period last year, with both years' earnings resulting primarily from distributions from EMG's Lakeland project in administrative receivership in the United Kingdom.

Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States and represent the company's earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Edison International's management uses core earnings, which exclude earnings from discontinued operations and certain other non-core items, internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance.

Core earnings per share are reconciled to basic earnings per common share.
