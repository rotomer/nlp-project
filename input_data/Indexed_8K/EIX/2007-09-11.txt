1 The amount of power sold is a portion of the retail load of the purchasing utility and can vary significantly with variations in that retail load. Retail load depends upon a number of factors, including the time of day and year, and the utility's number of new and continuing customers. Estimated MWh have been forecast based on historical patterns and on assumptions regarding the factors that may affect retail loads in the future. The actual load will vary from that used for the above estimate, and the amount of variation may be material.
2 The average price per MWh, which is subject to a seasonal price adjustment, represents the sale of a bundled product that includes, but is not limited to, energy, capacity and ancillary services. Also, Midwest Generation will incur charges from PJM as a load-serving entity. Thus, the average price per MWh is not comparable to the sale of power under an energy only contract. The average price per MWh represents the sale of the bundled product based on an estimated customer load profile.

1 EME expects to make substantial investments in new projects during the next three years. As of June 30, 2007, EME had a development pipeline of potential wind projects with an installed capacity of approximately 3,100 MW (the development pipeline represents potential projects which EME either owns the project rights or has exclusive negotiation rights). Completion of these projects is dependent upon a number of items which may include, depending on the project's status, completion of a power sales agreement, permits, an interconnection agreement or other agreements necessary to start construction. Additional projects may from time to time be added to the development pipeline, and there is no assurance that the projects included in the development pipeline currently or added in the future will lead to the successful completion of a wind project.
Potential Expenditures (2007  2009)
Additional growth opportunities
Additional wind turbines
Balance of plant costs for purchased wind turbines
Potential Expenditures After 2009

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States and represent the company's earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management uses core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. We also use core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary as primary performance measurements when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook, as it allows us to more accurately compare the company's ongoing performance across periods. Core earnings exclude earnings from discontinued operations and other non-core items. EPS by principal operating subsidiary is based on the principal operating subsidiary net income and the weighted average outstanding common shares held by Edison International. The impact of participating securities (vested stock options that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for each principal operating subsidiary is not material to each principal operatingsubsidiary's EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which we refer to as EIX Holding Company in this presentation. A reconciliation of Non-GAAP information to GAAP information, including the impact of participating securities for each principal operating subsidiary is included either on the slide where the information appears or on another slide referenced in the presentation.
