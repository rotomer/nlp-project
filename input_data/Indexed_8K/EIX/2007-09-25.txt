Forward-Looking Statements
Statements contained in this presentation about future performance, including, without limitation, earnings, asset and rate base growth, load growth, capital investments, and other statements that are not purely historical, are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect our current expectations; however, such statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from current expectations. Important factors that could cause different results are discussed under the headings "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis" in Edison International's 2006 Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available on our website: www.edison.com. These forward-looking statements represent our expectations only as of the date of this presentation, and Edison International assumes no duty to update them to reflect new information, events or circumstances.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States and represent the company's earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management uses core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. We also use core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary as primary performance measurements when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook, as it allows us to more accurately compare the company's ongoing performance across periods. Core earnings exclude earnings from discontinued operations and other non-core items. EPS by principal operating subsidiary is based on the principal operating subsidiary net income and Edison International's weighted average outstanding common shares. The impact of participating securities (vested stock options that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for each principal operating subsidiary is not material to each principal operating subsidiary's EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which we refer to as EIX Holding Company in this presentation. A reconciliation of Non-GAAP information to GAAP information, including the impact of participating securities for each principal operating subsidiary is included either on the slide where the information appears or on another slide referenced in the presentation.
