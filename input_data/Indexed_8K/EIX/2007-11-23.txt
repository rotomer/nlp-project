SCE Value Driver  Energy Efficiency
Our Goal
Continue to strengthen our commitment to creating and improving energy efficiency (EE) in an environmentally responsible manner by supporting the strong regulatory framework in California where energy efficiency programs can thrive, and creating joint alliances with utilities and other select organizations
Our Past Accomplishments
During the past 5 years, SCE has led the nation in energy-efficiency savings
More than 4B in kWh savings  enough energy to power 500K homes for an entire year
Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by > 2M tons  the equivalent of taking 250K cars off the road
SCE has been nationally recognized by the U.S. EPA six times
SCE has consistently offered a wide array of energy efficiency and demand response programs, providing financial incentives and/or other benefits for saving energy and shifting usage from on-peak periods
Our Current Achievements
SCE, along with 7 other utilities, recently announced their commitment to invest in energy efficiency and to seek regulatory actions to 
Increase total investment by $500M to $1.5B annually1
Reduce carbon dioxide emissions by an estimated 30M tons by 20161, the equivalent of removing 6M cars from the road, and avoiding the need for fifty 500-MW peaking power plants
Create a national institute within EEI to develop regulatory models and to foster support in the power sector
Recent Developments
On September 20, the CPUC adopted an Energy Efficiency Risk/Reward Incentive Mechanism for two three-year periods: 2006  2008 & 2009  2011 (CPUC Decision No. D.0709043)
November 23, 2007 18 EDISON INTERNATIONAL
 
Leading the Way in Electricity SM
SCE Energy Efficiency Program Incentives
Under the final decision, SCE would be eligible to receive incentives based on meeting certain targets for savings, measured in terms of kilowatt hours and kilowatts
The CPUC set a cumulative three-year energy efficiency savings goal for each utility for the 20062008 program cycle. SCE expects to achieve the following stated CPUC targets for its customers in the three-year period:
3.1 billion kilowatt-hours of energy savings; 687 megawatts of demand reduction
More than $2 billion in gross benefits and nearly $1.2 billion in net benefits, after costs
Incentives are provided in a range of 9% of net customer benefits for achieving between 85% and 100% of energy efficiency targets and 12% for achieving 100% or more of the targets. Should SCE fall below 65 percent of the CPUC goals, shareholders would incur penalties
Both incentives and penalties are capped at $200 million for the three-year period
If SCE achieves its energy efficiency and net benefit goals of approximately $1.2 billion, the three-year pre-tax earnings opportunity would be approximately $146 million

Leading the Way in Electricity SM
Constructive Regulatory Environment
Rate Base
General Rate Case (GRC) provides three-year forward looking rate-setting mechanism based on forecast spending; affirmed twice
2006 GRC Decision approved majority of capital requests and operating expenses; resulted in increased depreciation providing annual cash flow of about $1 billion for 20062008
SCE filed its 2009-2011 GRC with the CPUC on November 19, 2007
Requests a utility revenue increase in 2009 of about 6.2% above 2007 rates, or $726 million.
Target final decision on December 8, 2008, with new rates effective January 1, 2009
Investors' Return
11.6% return on common equity (ROCE) approved through 2007; 11.8% requested for 2008
11.4% ROCE approved in proposed ALJ decision, November 6, 2007 (subject to CPUC final decision)
Energy Efficiency
CPUC adopted mechanism allows for incentives and penalties capped at $200 million for two three-year periods: 20062008 & 20092011
Procurement Cost
Energy Resources Recovery Account (ERRA) and related Trigger Mechanism provides timely recovery of procurement costs and mitigates energy price exposure
Customer Rates
Increases in base rates
(i.e. GRC) expected as the result of rate base growth. Total customer rates, however, not expected to increase appreciably due to reduction in natural gas prices
California's regulatory framework has been strengthened to support growth and reliability needs, and mitigate risks of volatile commodity prices

1 The amount of power sold is a portion of the retail load of the purchasing utility and can vary significantly with variations in that retail load. Retail load depends upon a number of factors, including the time of day and year, and the utility's number of new and continuing customers. Estimated MWh have been forecast based on historical patterns and on assumptions regarding the factors that may affect retail loads in the future. The actual load will vary from that used for the above estimate, and the amount of variation may be material.
2 The average price per MWh, which is subject to a seasonal price adjustment, represents the sale of a bundled product that includes, but is not limited to, energy, capacity and ancillary services. Also, Midwest Generation will incur charges from PJM as a load-serving entity. Thus, the average price per MWh is not comparable to the sale of power under an energy only contract. The average price per MWh represents the sale of the bundled product based on an estimated customer load profile.

1 EME expects to make substantial investments in new projects during the next three years. As of September 30, 2007, EME had a development pipeline of potential wind projects with an estimated installed capacity of approximately 3,000 MW (the development pipeline represents potential projects for which EME either owns the project rights or has exclusive negotiation rights). Completion of these projects is dependent upon a number of items which may include, depending on the project's status, completion of a power sales agreement, permits, an interconnection agreement or other agreements necessary to start construction. Additional projects may from time to time be added to the development pipeline, and there is no assurance that the projects included in the development pipeline currently or added in the future will lead to the successful completion of a wind project.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States and represent the company's earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management uses core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. We also use core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary as primary performance measurements when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook, as it allows us to more accurately compare the company's ongoing performance across periods. Core earnings exclude discontinued operations and other non-core items and are reconciled to basic earnings per common share.
EPS by principal operating subsidiary is based on the principal operating subsidiary net income and Edison International's weighted average outstanding common shares. The impact of participating securities (vested stock options that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for each principal operating subsidiary is not material to each principal operating subsidiary's EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which we refer to as EIX parent company. EPS and core EPS by principal operating subsidiary are reconciled to basic earnings per common share.
A reconciliation of Non-GAAP information to GAAP information, including the impact of participating securities, is included either on the slide where the information appears or on another slide referenced in the presentation.
