Edison International Fourth Quarter and 2007 Financial Highlights
 
ROSEMEAD, Calif., February 27, 2008  Edison International (NYSE: EIX) today reported 2007 earnings of $3.33 per share. Excluding non-core items, 2007 core earnings were $3.69 per share, up 20 percent compared with $3.07 per share last year. This increase was driven mainly by higher energy margins at EMG and solid operating results at SCE.
"Edison International performed well in 2007, reflecting completion of record utility infrastructure improvements and strong performance in our competitive power generation business," said John Bryson, chairman and CEO. "During the year, our team also significantly moved forward our leading national positions in advanced smart grid and meter technologies, energy efficiency, and renewable energy."
 
Note: GAAP earnings refers to net income and GAAP earnings per share refers to basic earnings per share throughout this release. Core earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure; see reconciliation of core earnings to GAAP earnings and reconciliation of core earnings guidance to GAAP earnings guidance.

FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS DETAIL
Fourth quarter 2007 GAAP earnings were $0.64 per share, compared to $0.87 in the fourth quarter of 2006 as the result of non-core items in the fourth quarter of last year. Excluding non-core items, fourth quarter core earnings were $0.65 per share, unchanged from the same period a year ago, as higher earnings at SCE were offset by lower results at EMG.
Earnings from Continuing Operations
SCE fourth quarter 2007 earnings from continuing operations were $0.37 per share compared to earnings of $0.48 per share in the same period last year, primarily from the favorable resolution of a state tax issue in the 2006 period. Excluding 2006 non-core benefits, SCE's core earnings increased $0.05 per share to $0.37 per share. This increase was primarily due to settlement of a tariff dispute.
EMG fourth quarter 2007 earnings from continuing operations were $0.30 per share compared to $0.35 per share in the same period last year. Excluding non-core items, EMG's core earnings were $0.30 per share compared to $0.36 per share a year earlier. The decrease was primarily due to lower earnings from Edison Capital and higher EMG corporate costs, partially offset by lower interest expense and higher trading margin.
Results of Discontinued Operations
Edison International's loss from discontinued operations was $0.01 per share in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to earnings of $0.07 per share in the fourth quarter of 2006. Discontinued operations relate to adjustments resulting from the sale of EMG's former international projects.

FULL-YEAR EARNINGS DETAIL
Earnings from Continuing Operations
SCE's earnings from continuing operations in 2007 were $2.17 per share compared with $2.38 per share a year ago. SCE's 2007 results include a non-core tax benefit of $0.10 per share primarily related to the income tax treatment of certain costs associated with environmental remediation. SCE's 2006 results include $0.49 per share in benefits related primarily to favorable resolution of tax and regulatory matters and generator settlements. Excluding these non-core items, SCE's core earnings in 2007 were $2.07 per share, compared with $1.89 per share in 2006. The increase is mainly due to higher operating margin, lower income taxes, and the tariff settlement, partially offset by higher net interest expense.

EMG's earnings from continuing operations in 2007 were $1.27 per share compared with $1.02 per share in 2006. Both 2007 and 2006 results were impacted by non-core early debt extinguishment costs. Excluding non-core items, EMG's core earnings in 2007 were $1.72 per share compared with $1.30 per share in 2006. This increase primarily reflects higher operating income at Midwest Generation and Homer City, lower interest expense, and higher project income and trading margin, partially offset by higher development and other corporate costs and lower earnings from Edison Capital.
Results of Discontinued Operations
Edison International's loss per share from discontinued operations was $0.01 for 2007, compared with earnings per share from discontinued operations of $0.30 per share for 2006. 2006 results include distributions from EMG's Lakeland project in administrative receivership in the United Kingdom.

Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States and represent the company's earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management uses core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. We also use core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary as primary performance measurements when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook, as it allows us to more accurately compare the company's ongoing performance across periods. Core earnings exclude discontinued operations and other non-core items and are reconciled to GAAP earnings per share.
EPS by principal operating subsidiary is based on the principal operating subsidiary net income and Edison International's weighted average outstanding common shares. The impact of participating securities (vested stock options that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for each principal operating subsidiary is not material to each principal operating subsidiary's EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which we refer to as EIX parent company. EPS and core EPS by principal operating subsidiary are reconciled to GAAP earnings per share.
Today, Edison International will hold a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter 2007 financial results and 2008 earnings guidance at 8 a.m. (Pacific Standard Time). Two-way participation in the telephone call is limited to financial analysts and investors, while all other interested parties are invited to participate in a simultaneous webcast at www.edisoninvestor.com. A presentation accompanying management's comments on the conference call will be available on the web site as well at www.edisoninvestor.com. The domestic call-in number is (800) 356-8584 and the ID# is 11500. In addition to the live simulcast, the webcast will remain posted at www.edisoninvestor.com and telephone replays will be available through Wednesday, March 5, 2008, at the following numbers: (877) 693-4277  for callers in the U.S.; and (402) 220-0042  for international callers. The ID# is 11501.
