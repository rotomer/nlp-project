Energy Efficiency Earnings Opportunity
CPUC Approved Energy Efficiency (EE) Shareholder Incentive Mechanism1
SCE, the national leader in energy efficiency, is targeting $1.2 billion in net customer savings for 2006-2008 Three-year earnings opportunity of up to ~$146 million (pre-tax) for the 2006-2008 period4
1 Based upon September 20, 2007 and January 31, 2008 decisions released by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC).
2 There is no assurance of earnings in any given year. If approved by the CPUC, SCE currently projects, based on preliminary results, that it will record a progress payment in the range of $41 million to $49 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 for the years (2006-2007) of the program cycle. SCE expects to collect this progress payment in rates in 2009. SCE is scheduled to file advice filings in September of each year requesting recovery of the progress payments. SCE expects it will recognize earnings in the amount of the progress payments upon CPUC acceptance of its filing, expected in the fourth quarter of each year.
3 Assumes SCE achieves all of its energy efficiency goals, and delivers customer benefits of approximately $1.2 billion. Based on forecast, cash is received in the year following the period when earnings are recognized.
4 The January 2008 modifications incorporate an update to the effective useful life of the energy efficiency measures installed. If the draft CPUC effective useful life study is adopted in its current form, the effective useful life of residential compact fluorescent lights, one of the largest contributors to SCE's energy efficiency portfolio, would be reduced and SCE's earnings opportunity would decrease to approximately $124 million.

EMG Hedge Program Status
Status at December 31, 2007
1 The amount of power sold is a portion of the retail load of the purchasing utility and can vary significantly with variations in that retail load. Retail load depends upon a number of factors, including the time of day and year, and the utility's number of new and continuing customers. Estimated MWh have been forecast based on historical patterns and on assumptions regarding the factors that may affect retail loads in the future. The actual load will vary from that used for the above estimate, and the amount of variation may be material.
2 The average price per MWh, which is subject to a seasonal price adjustment, represents the sale of a bundled product that includes, but is not limited to, energy, capacity and ancillary services. Also, Midwest Generation will incur charges from PJM as a load-serving entity. Thus, the average price per MWh is not comparable to the sale of power under an energy only contract. The average price per MWh represents the sale of the bundled product based on an estimated customer load profile.
3 Homer City hedge position for 2009 was incorrectly reported as 3,890/GWh at September 30, 2007. The correct hedge position for 2009 was 2,867/GWh. There was no change in the hedge position during the fourth quarter.
4 The average price/MWh for Homer City's hedge position is based on PJM West Hub prices. As a result of transmission congestion in the PJM, actual energy prices at the Homer City busbar have been lower than those at the PJM West Hub.

1 EMG expects to make substantial investments in new projects during the next three years. As of December 31, 2007, EMG had a development pipeline of potential wind projects with an estimated installed capacity of over 5,000 MW (the development pipeline represents potential projects for which EME either owns the project rights or has exclusive negotiation rights). Completion of these projects is dependent upon a number of items which may include, depending on the project's status, completion of a power sales agreement, permits, an interconnection agreement or other agreements necessary to start construction. Additional projects may from time to time be added to the development pipeline, and there is no assurance that the projects included in the development pipeline currently or added in the future will lead to the successful completion of a wind project.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States and represent the company's earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management uses core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. We also use core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary as primary performance measurements when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook, as it allows us to more accurately compare the company's ongoing performance across periods. Core earnings exclude discontinued operations and other non-core items and are reconciled to basic earnings per common share.
EPS by principal operating subsidiary is based on the principal operating subsidiary net income and Edison International's weighted average outstanding common shares. The impact of participating securities (vested stock options that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for each principal operating subsidiary is not material to each principal operating subsidiary's EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which we refer to as EIX parent company. EPS and core EPS by principal operating subsidiary are reconciled to basic earnings per common share.
A reconciliation of Non-GAAP information to GAAP information, including the impact of participating securities, is included either on the slide where the information appears or on another slide referenced in the presentation.
