Edison International Financial Highlights
 
ROSEMEAD, Calif., May 8, 2008  Edison International (NYSE: EIX) today reported first quarter 2008 earnings of $0.91 per share. Excluding non-core items, first quarter 2008 core earnings were $0.92 per share, up two percent compared with $0.90 per share in the year-ago first quarter.
"First quarter results were solid. Our improved outlook for the full year reflects positive margin trends in our unregulated power generation business," said John E. Bryson, chairman and chief executive officer of Edison International.
 
Note: GAAP earnings refer to net income and GAAP earnings per share refer to basic earnings per share throughout this release. Core earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure; see reconciliation of core earnings to GAAP earnings and reconciliation of core earnings guidance to GAAP earnings guidance.

Earnings from Continuing Operations
SCE's first-quarter 2008 earnings from continuing operations were $0.46 per share, compared to earnings of $0.55 per share in the same quarter last year; this decrease was primarily due to a non-core tax benefit of $0.10 per share last year from the favorable resolution of the income tax treatment of certain environmental remediation costs. Excluding the tax item, SCE's core earnings in the first quarter increased $0.01 per share, compared to the same quarter last year. This increase was primarily due to lower net interest expense.
EMG's first-quarter 2008 earnings from continuing operations and core earnings were $0.49 per share, compared to $0.48 per share in the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to higher gross margin and the buy-out of a coal contract at Midwest Generation together with higher energy trading results. This was partially offset by lower earnings from Edison Capital and other generation projects together with higher costs associated with EMG's growth programs.
Discontinued Operations
Edison International's loss from discontinued operations was $(0.01) per share in the first quarter of 2008 versus earnings from discontinued operations of $0.01 per share in the first quarter of 2007; both related to the 2004 sale of its international businesses.

Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States and represent the company's earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management uses core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. We also use core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary as primary performance measurements when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook, as it allows us to more accurately compare the company's ongoing performance across periods. Core earnings exclude discontinued operations and other non-core items and are reconciled to GAAP earnings per share.
EPS by principal operating subsidiary is based on the principal operating subsidiary net income and Edison International's weighted average outstanding common shares. The impact of participating securities (vested stock options that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for each principal operating subsidiary is not material to each principal operating subsidiary's EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which we refer to as EIX parent company. EPS and core EPS by principal operating subsidiary are reconciled to GAAP earnings per share.
Today, Edison International will hold a conference call to discuss its first quarter 2008 financial results at 8 a.m. (Pacific Daylight Time). Two-way participation in the telephone call is limited to financial analysts and investors, while all other interested parties are invited to participate in a simultaneous webcast at www.edisoninvestor.com. A presentation accompanying management's comments on the conference call will be available on the web site as well at www.edisoninvestor.com. The domestic call-in number is (800) 356-8584 and the number for international callers is (850) 429-1225. The ID# is 11600. In addition to the live simulcast, the webcast will remain posted at www.edisoninvestor.com and telephone replays will be available through Thursday, May 15, 2008, at the following numbers: (877) 693-4277 for callers in the United States and (402) 220-0042 for international callers. The ID# is 11601.

1 The amount of power sold is a portion of the retail load of the purchasing utility and can vary significantly with variations in that retail load. Retail load depends upon a number of factors, including the time of day and year, and the utility's number of new and continuing customers. Estimated MWh have been forecast based on historical patterns and on assumptions regarding the factors that may affect retail loads in the future. The actual load will vary from that used for the above estimate, and the amount of variation may be material.
2 The average price per MWh, which is subject to a seasonal price adjustment, represents the sale of a bundled product that includes, but is not limited to, energy, capacity and ancillary services. Also, Midwest Generation will incur charges from PJM as a load-serving entity. Thus, the average price per MWh is not comparable to the sale of power under an energy only contract. The average price per MWh represents the sale of the bundled product based on an estimated customer load profile.
3 The average price/MWh for Homer City's hedge position is based on PJM West Hub prices. As a result of transmission congestion in the PJM, actual energy prices at the Homer City busbar have been lower than those at the PJM West Hub.

2 Actual contract price for Homer City sale is a function of NYISO capacity auction clearing prices. Expected price per MW-day is based on forward over-the-counter NYISO prices on March 31, 2008.
3 During 1Q 08, PJM updated capacity prices for the period June 1, 2008 to May 31, 2009 to reflect the final incremental auction for this planning year. Homer City's adjusted prices for capacity per megawatt hour is $113.22 compared to the original price of $111.92. In addition, the price was affected by Midwest Generation's participation in a supplemental RPM auction which resulted in purchasing certain capacity amounts at a price of $10/MW-day, thereby reducing the aggregate forward capacity sales for this period and increasing the effective capacity price to $123.77 at March 31, 2008.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States and represent the company's earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management uses core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. We also use core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary as primary performance measurements when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook, as it allows us to more accurately compare the company's ongoing performance across periods. Core earnings exclude discontinued operations and other non-core items and are reconciled to basic earnings per common share.
EPS by principal operating subsidiary is based on the principal operating subsidiary net income and Edison International's weighted average outstanding common shares. The impact of participating securities (vested stock options that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for each principal operating subsidiary is not material to each principal operating subsidiary's EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which we refer to as EIX parent company. EPS and core EPS by principal operating subsidiary are reconciled to basic earnings per common share.
EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA includes production tax credits from EMG's wind projects and excludes amounts from gain on the sale of assets, loss on early extinguishment of debt and leases, and impairment of assets and investments. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA as an important financial measure for evaluating EMG.
A reconciliation of Non-GAAP information to GAAP information, including the impact of participating securities, is included either on the slide where the information appears or on another slide referenced in the presentation.
