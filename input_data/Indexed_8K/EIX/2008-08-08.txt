EIX Financial Highlights
 
 
 
 
 
ROSEMEAD, Calif., Aug. 8, 2008  Edison International (NYSE: EIX) today reported second quarter 2008 core earnings of $0.79 per share, up 8 percent from the second quarter of 2007.
"Our second quarter results are consistent with meeting our earnings guidance for the year," said Theodore F. Craver, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of Edison International. "Our focus remains executing well to realize our full potential meeting customer needs and producing solid returns for our shareholders."

Earnings from Continuing Operations
SCE's second-quarter 2008 earnings from continuing operations and core earnings were $0.48 per share, compared to $0.44 per share in the same quarter last year. This increase was primarily due to lower taxes and interest, partially offset by lower operating income. Lower operating income is consistent with electric utility revenue being higher during the third quarter of each year due to seasonality and the company's rate design, while operating expenses are recognized more evenly throughout the year.
EMG's second-quarter 2008 earnings from continuing operations were $0.34 per share, compared to a loss of $0.15 per share in the same quarter last year. This increase was primarily due to a non-core after-tax charge in the second quarter of 2007 associated with early debt extinguishment. Excluding non-core items, EMG's core earnings in the second quarter increased $0.04 per share, compared to the same quarter last year. This increase was primarily due to higher gross margin at Midwest Generation from higher generation and average realized energy prices and capacity prices. Also contributing to the increase was the gain on sale of Edison Capital's Beaver Valley lease, partially offset by lower operating revenues and higher plant maintenance expense at Homer City.

YEAR-TO-DATE EARNINGS SUMMARY
Edison International reported earnings of $1.70 per share for the six-month period ending June 30, 2008, compared to $1.29 per share for the same period last year. Edison International had earnings from continuing operations of $1.72 per share for the six-month period ended June 30, 2008, compared with $1.28 per share for the same period last year. Excluding earnings from discontinued operations and other non-core items, Edison International's core earnings for the six-month period in 2008 were $1.72 per share, compared to $1.63 per share in the same period in 2007.
YEAR-TO-DATE EARNINGS DETAIL
SCE's earnings from continuing operations in the first half of 2008 were $0.94 per share, a decrease of $0.06 per share compared to the same period last year. SCE's 2007 results include income tax benefits of $0.10 per share related to certain environmental remediation costs. Excluding this non-core item, SCE's year-to-date core earnings were $0.94 per share, compared to $0.90 per share in the same period last year. This increase is primarily from lower interest and taxes, partially offset by lower operating income. Lower operating income is consistent with electric utility revenue being higher during the third quarter of each year due to seasonality and the company's rate design, while operating expenses are recognized more evenly throughout the year.
EMG's earnings from continuing operations for the first six months of 2008 were $0.84 per share, up $0.51 per share from the same period last year. EMG's GAAP results include a $0.02 loss and a $0.01 gain from discontinued operations in 2008 and 2007, respectively, and a $0.45 charge for early debt retirement in 2007. Excluding these non-core items, EMG's core earnings were $0.84 per share, an increase of $0.06 per share. This increase primarily reflects higher gross margin at Midwest Generation from higher generation, average realized energy prices and capacity prices, and higher trading income at EMMT, partially offset by lower operating revenues and higher plant maintenance expense at Homer City.

2008 EARNINGS GUIDANCE
The company reaffirmed its previously announced 2008 earnings guidance of $3.61 to $4.01 per share. See the risk disclosure statement on page 5 and the presentation accompanying the company's conference call for further information.
 
 
Note: Earnings Guidance also excludes the potential impact of IRS issues, and the possible impairment of up to $48 million for NOx allowances purchased by EMG for the CAIR compliance program.
Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States and represent the company's earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management uses core earnings and EPS by principal

operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. We also use core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary as primary performance measurements when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook, as it allows us to more accurately compare the company's ongoing performance across periods. Core earnings exclude discontinued operations and other non-core items and are reconciled to GAAP earnings per share.
EPS by principal operating subsidiary is based on the principal operating subsidiary net income and Edison International's weighted average outstanding common shares. The impact of participating securities (vested stock options that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for each principal operating subsidiary is not material to each principal operating subsidiary's EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which we refer to as EIX parent company. EPS and core EPS by principal operating subsidiary are reconciled to GAAP earnings per share.
Today, Edison International will hold a conference call to discuss its second quarter 2008 financial results at 8 a.m. (Pacific Daylight Time). Two-way participation in the telephone call is limited to financial analysts and investors, while all other interested parties are invited to participate in a simultaneous webcast at www.edisoninvestor.com. A presentation accompanying management's comments on the conference call will be available on the web site as well at www.edisoninvestor.com. The domestic call-in number is (800) 356-8584 and the number for international callers is (850) 429-1225. The ID# is 11700. In addition to the live simulcast, the webcast will remain posted at www.edisoninvestor.com and telephone replays will be available through Friday, August 15, 2008, at the following numbers: (877) 693-4277 for callers in the United States and (402) 220-0042 for international callers. The ID# is 11701.

1 The amount of power sold is a portion of the retail load of the purchasing utility and can vary significantly with variations in that retail load. Retail load depends upon a number of factors, including the time of day and year, and the utility's number of new and continuing customers. Estimated MWh have been forecast based on historical patterns and on assumptions regarding the factors that may affect retail loads in the future. The actual load will vary from that used for the above estimate, and the amount of variation may be material.
2 The average price per MWh, which is subject to a seasonal price adjustment, represents the sale of a bundled product that includes, but is not limited to, energy, capacity and ancillary services. Also, Midwest Generation will incur charges from PJM as a load-serving entity. Thus, the average price per MWh is not comparable to the sale of power under an energy only contract. The average price per MWh represents the sale of the bundled product based on an estimated customer load profile.
3 The average price/MWh for Homer City's hedge position is based on PJM West Hub prices. As a result of transmission congestion in the PJM, actual energy prices at the Homer City busbar have been lower than those at the PJM West Hub.
4 At june 30, 2008, ther are options to purchase additional coal of 1.7 million tons in 2010 and 1.2 million tons in 2011.

2 The original price of $111.92 was affected by Midwest Generation's participation in a supplemental RPM auction during the first quarter of 2008, which resulted in purchasing certain capacity amounts at a price of $10 per MW-day, thereby reducing the aggregate forward capacity sales for this period and increasing the effective capacity price to $122.36.
3 Actual contract price is a function of NYISO capacity auction clearing prices in June 2008 through July 2008 and forward over-the-counter NYISO capacity prices on June 30, 2008 for August 2008 through May 2009.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States and represent the company's earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management uses core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. We also use core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary as primary performance measurements when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook, as it allows us to more accurately compare the company's ongoing performance across periods. Core earnings exclude discontinued operations and other non-core items and are reconciled to basic earnings per common share.
EPS by principal operating subsidiary is based on the principal operating subsidiary net income and Edison International's weighted average outstanding common shares. The impact of participating securities (vested stock options that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for each principal operating subsidiary is not material to each principal operating subsidiary's EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which we refer to as EIX parent company. EPS and core EPS by principal operating subsidiary are reconciled to basic earnings per common share.
EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA includes production tax credits from EMG's wind projects and excludes amounts from gain on the sale of assets, loss on early extinguishment of debt and leases, and impairment of assets and investments. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA as an important financial measure for evaluating EMG.
A reconciliation of Non-GAAP information to GAAP information, including the impact of participating securities, is included either on the slide where the information appears or on another slide referenced in the presentation.
