SCE, the national leader in energy efficiency, is targeting $1.2 billion in net customer savings and an earnings opportunity of up to ~$146 million (pre-tax) for 2006-20083
1 Based upon September 20, 2007 and January 31, 2008 decisions released by the CPUC. There is no assurance of earnings. If CPUC approves, SCE estimates to record a progress payment in the range of $41-$49 million in 4Q08 for the first two years of the program cycle and expects to collect the payment in 2009 rates.
2 Assumes SCE achieves all EE goals and delivers customer benefits of approximately $1.2 billion. Cash expected to be received in the following year.
3 The $146 million earnings opportunity (pre-tax) for 2006-2008 EE cycle. January 2008 modifications incorporate an update to the effective useful life of residential compact fluorescent lights. If the draft CPUC effective useful life study is adopted in its current form, SCE's earnings opportunity would decrease to approximately $124 million.

Constructive Regulatory Environment
What's Changed Since the Power Crisis
Advance approval of annual procurement plans for purchased power
Trigger mechanism for fuel and purchased power cost recovery
Forward-looking rate-making includes expected cost inflation
State support for reliable electric system infrastructure
Benefits to Customers and Investors
Upfront review of utility purchasing decisions through a defined procurement plan
Better matching of revenues and cash expenditures for fuel and purchased power costs with predetermined trigger mechanisms for recovering higher costs
Three-year process based on forecast expenses, capital spending and asset base increases between rate cases
Regulatory decisions address emerging issues (such as adding peaking capacity for 2007 summer season) and opportunities (new energy efficiency program and incentives for utility renewable energy investment)
California's regulatory framework supports growth and reliability needs, while longstanding decoupling policies mitigate risks of volatile commodity prices and economic changes

1 Power sold is a portion of the retail load of the purchasing utility and can vary significantly. Retail load depends upon a number of factors, and the actual load will vary from that used for the above estimate, and the amount of variation may be material.
2 The average price per MWh, subject to a seasonal price adjustment, represents the sale of a bundled product that includes, but is not limited to, energy, capacity and ancillary services. Midwest Generation will incur charges from PJM as a load-serving entity. The average price per MWh is not comparable to the sale of power under an energy only contract. The average price per MWh represents the sale of the bundled product based on an estimated customer load profile.
3 The average price/MWh for Homer City's hedge position is based on PJM West Hub prices. As a result of transmission congestion in the PJM, actual energy prices at the Homer City busbar have been lower than those at the PJM West Hub.
4 At June 30, 2008, there are options to purchase additional coal of 1.7 million tons in 2010 and 1.2 million tons in 2011.

2 The original price of $111.92 was affected by Midwest Generation's participation in a supplemental RPM auction during the first quarter of 2008, which resulted in purchasing certain capacity amounts at a price of $10 per MW-day, thereby reducing the aggregate forward capacity sales for this period and increasing the effective capacity price to $122.36.

1 EMG expects to make substantial investments in new projects during the next three years. As of June 30, 2008, EMG had a development pipeline of potential wind projects with an estimated installed capacity of approximately 5,000 MW (the development pipeline represents potential projects for which EME either owns the project rights or has exclusive negotiation rights). Completion of these projects is dependent upon a number of items, and there is no assurance that the projects included in the development pipeline currently or added in the future will lead to the successful completion of a wind project.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States and represent the company's earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management uses core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. We also use core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary as primary performance measurements when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook, as it allows us to more accurately compare the company's ongoing performance across periods. Core earnings exclude discontinued operations and other non-core items and are reconciled to basic earnings per common share.
EPS by principal operating subsidiary is based on the principal operating subsidiary net income and Edison International's weighted average outstanding common shares. The impact of participating securities (vested stock options that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for each principal operating subsidiary is not material to each principal operating subsidiary's EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which we refer to as EIX parent company. EPS and core EPS by principal operating subsidiary are reconciled to basic earnings per common share.
EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA includes production tax credits from EMG's wind projects and excludes amounts from gain on the sale of assets, loss on early extinguishment of debt and leases, and impairment of assets and investments. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA as an important financial measure for evaluating EMG.
A reconciliation of Non-GAAP information to GAAP information, including the impact of participating securities, is included either on the slide where the information appears or on another slide referenced in the presentation.
