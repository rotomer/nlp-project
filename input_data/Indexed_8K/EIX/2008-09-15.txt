Bid Evaluation Approach
B/C Ratio =
Present Value of Total Benefits
Present Value of Total Costs
Energy Benefit
Reduction in total energy costs as a result of the project Capacity Benefit
The value of the increased reliability as a result of the project
The maximum production amount that SCE can reasonably rely upon during peak periods
Direct Costs
Based on the proposed energy price, expected generation profile and contract term Indirect Costs
Transmission costs related to the project
Debt Equivalence  impacts of contract commitments on SCE's balance sheet
Proposals are ranked based on a benefitttocost (B/C) ratio that weighs the total costs with the benefits to SCE's resource portfolio

Solicitation Factors of Success
Competitively priced proposal
 Projects that qualify for federal subsidies have an advantage
 On-peak deliveries produce higher benefits, yielding higher benefit/cost ratios
 Federal subsidies include Production Tax Credits (for wind) or Investment Tax Credits (for solar)
Early place in the interconnection queue
 Provides priority for completing studies
 Allows for earlier interconnection, which can potentially avoid future transmission upgrade costs
 Helps bidders better understand their interconnection costs
Demonstrated signs of a viable project
 Site control
 Plan to deliver into CAISO grid
 Strong financial backing
 Realistic on-line dates and forecasted operating performance
Thoughtful edits to Pro Forma Contract
 Demonstrates major issues between buyer and seller to execute contract
 Gives some indication to the time required to develop and execute contract
SCE considers many factors when evaluating renewable energy projects
