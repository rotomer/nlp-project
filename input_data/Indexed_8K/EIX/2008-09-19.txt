The decision will result in Southern California Edison Company recording a non-recurring charge of approximately $52 million (or approximately $0.16 per share) after-tax in the third quarter of 2008. As further discussed in Edison International's second quarter 2008 Form 10-Q (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements therein), Southern California Edison Company had previously recorded a reserve of approximately $52 million, pre-tax, plus interest, in connection with the PBR proceeding.
