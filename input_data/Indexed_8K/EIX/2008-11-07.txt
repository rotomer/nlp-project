Superior execution of capital expenditure program and continued regulatory support could nearly double SCE's 2007 rate base by 2012
1 Forecast is as of October 2008 and includes impact of 2006 CPUC and FERC GRC decisions, forecasted rate base for FERC (2007-2012) and CPUC (2009-2012) which are subject to timely receipt of permitting, licensing and regulatory approvals and are based in part on March 2008 construction forecasts. Forecast includes estimated impacts of the November 15, 2007 FERC incentives decision allowing construction work-in-progress (CWIP) recovery in rate base and updated estimates for benefits of accelerated depreciation based upon the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, and timing of forecasted project completions. The forecast includes $692 million of capital spending for DPV2, the majority of which is forecast to occur in 2009 and 2010. The Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC) denied approval of the DPV2 project which has resulted in a minimum two-year delay of the project and could be delayed further. SCE has initiated pre-filing activities with the FERC and is continuing to work with the ACC on acceptable alternatives. Rate base forecast includes update for September 4, 2008 GRC update filing which could be affected by changes in capital spending and other operating and decision related impacts associated with final 2009-2011 general rate case decision.

SCE SmartConnectTM Program
CPUC approved deployment to 5.3 million residential and small commercial customers between 2008  2012 in September 2008
Total project cost is $1.7 billion (approximately $1.25 billion capital cost to be included in rate base)1
Full Edison SmartConnectTM implementation is expected to:
Enable higher energy efficiency targets, including reducing as much as 1,000 MW of peak power consumption
reduce GHG emissions by 365,000 metric tons per year
Integrate Homes with the Utility Circuit
Integrate Smart Appliances with the Home
1 SCE expects to update its year-by-year timeline for program implementation in the near future, but this is not expected to change the target completion in 2012 or overall project costs.

SCE is targeting $1.2 billion in net customer savings and an earnings opportunity of up to ~$146 million (pre-tax) for 2006-20082
1 Timing and amount of progress payments is based upon CPUC reports, which may be delayed. As an alternate means to receive the first payment for the 2006-2007 earnings opportunity, SCE and the other California investor-owned utilities filed a petition with the CPUC in August 2008. In the petition, SCE requested a progress payment equal to 65% of the 2006-2007 earnings opportunity of $71 million or $46 million, using the approved 35% holdback. On November 4, 2008, the CPUC issued a proposed decision denying the petition and which, if adopted, would continue the current earnings process to continue. The CPUC verification report may result in reductions to SCE's projected savings and earnings amounts. The CPUC also issued an alternate decision that, if adopted, would approve SCE's first requested progress payment using a 50% holdback percentage, resulting in a potential $35 million progress payment. Future progress payments would be based on CPUC reports or CPUC-approved interim payments. SCE expects a final decision in December 2008. Actual earnings may differ from SCE's projections and there is no assurance of earnings in any given year. The CPUC may modify portions of the risk/reward mechanism for the 2009-2011 program cycles.

1 The energy only contracts exclude power contracts held with Lehman Brothers Commodity Services totaling 1,434 GWh for 2009 and 1,428 GWh for 2010, which were suspended at September 30, 2008 and subsequently terminated in October 2008.
2 The amount of power sold is a portion of the retail load of the purchasing utility and can vary significantly with variations in that retail load. Retail load depends upon a number of factors, including the time of day and year, and the utility's number of new and continuing customers. Estimated GWh have been forecast based on historical patterns and on assumptions regarding the factors that may affect retail loads in the future. The actual load will vary from that used for the above estimate, and the amount of variation may be material.
3 The average price per MWh, which is subject to a seasonal price adjustment, represents the sale of a bundled product that includes, but is not limited to, energy, capacity and ancillary services. Also, Midwest Generation will incur charges from PJM as a load-serving entity. Thus, the average price per MWh is not comparable to the sale of power under an energy only contract. The average price per MWh represents the sale of the bundled product based on an estimated customer load profile.
4 The average price/MWh for Homer City's hedge position is based on PJM West Hub prices. As a result of transmission congestion in the PJM, actual energy prices at the Homer City busbar have been lower than those at the PJM West Hub.
5 At September 30, 2008, there are options to purchase additional coal of 0.3 million tons in 2009, 1.9 million tons in 2010 and 1.4 million tons in 2011.

2 The original price of $111.92 was affected by Midwest Generation's participation in a supplemental RPM auction during the first quarter of 2008, which resulted in purchasing certain capacity amounts at a price of $10 per MW-day, thereby reducing the aggregate forward capacity sales for this period and increasing the effective capacity price to $122.42.

Capital Expenditure Update
Pending recovery of the capital markets, EME intends to preserve capital by focusing on a more selective growth strategy
Completion of projects under construction, including the Big Sky project in Illinois
Development of sites for future renewable projects that would deploy turbines under commitments
Use cash and future cash flow to meet existing contractual commitments
2008
Estimated capital expenditures are $2.0 billion for the next three years
1 EMG expects to make substantial investments in new projects during the next several years. As of September 30, 2008, EMG had a development pipeline of potential wind projects with an estimated installed capacity of approximately 5,000 MW (the development pipeline represents potential projects for which EME either owns the project rights or has exclusive negotiation rights). Completion of these projects is dependent upon a number of items, and there is no assurance that the projects included in the development pipeline currently or added in the future will lead to the successful completion of a wind project.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States and represent the company's earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management uses core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. We also use core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary as primary performance measurements when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook, as it allows us to more accurately compare the company's ongoing performance across periods. Core earnings exclude discontinued operations and other non-core items and are reconciled to basic earnings per common share.
EPS by principal operating subsidiary is based on the principal operating subsidiary net income and Edison International's weighted average outstanding common shares. The impact of participating securities (vested stock options that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for each principal operating subsidiary is not material to each principal operating subsidiary's EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which we refer to as EIX parent company. EPS and core EPS by principal operating subsidiary are reconciled to basic earnings per common share.
EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA includes production tax credits from EMG's wind projects and excludes amounts from gain on the sale of assets, loss on early extinguishment of debt and leases, and impairment of assets and investments. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA as an important financial measure for evaluating EMG.
A reconciliation of Non-GAAP information to GAAP information, including the impact of participating securities, is included either on the slide where the information appears or on another slide referenced in the presentation.
