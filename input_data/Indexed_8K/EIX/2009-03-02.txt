Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
ROSEMEAD, Calif., March 2, 2009  Edison International (NYSE: EIX) today reported fourth quarter and full year 2008 results.
"Edison International had solid performance in 2008 amidst the dramatic decline in both the economy and financial markets," said Theodore F. Craver, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of Edison International.
Fourth Quarter Earnings Detail
Southern California Edison Company's (SCE) fourth quarter 2008 GAAP and core earnings were $0.43 per share, compared to $0.37 per share in the same quarter last year. This increase was primarily due to higher operating income related to rate base growth, including $0.05 per share of energy efficiency rewards.
Note: GAAP earnings refer to net income and GAAP earnings per share refer to basic earnings per share throughout this release. Core earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure. See Reconciliation of Core Earnings to GAAP Earnings.

Edison Mission Group's (EMG) GAAP earnings were $0.25 per share in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to $0.29 per share in the fourth quarter of 2007. Excluding a $0.01 per share charge for discontinued operations in the 2007 period, EMG's core earnings decreased $0.05 per share. A loss arising from the termination of a natural gas turbine supply agreement, lower results from the Big 4 projects, lower interest income, and lower trading income at Edison Mission Marketing & Trading (EMMT) were partially offset by higher operating income at Midwest Generation, positive results from new wind projects in operation, and lower corporate expenses.
Full-Year Earnings Detail
SCE's GAAP earnings in 2008 were $2.10 per share, a decrease of $0.07 per share compared to $2.17 per share in 2007. SCE's 2008 results include a non-core charge of $0.15 per share associated with the CPUC decision on SCE's performance-based ratemaking mechanism. SCE's 2007 results include a non-core tax benefit of $0.10 per share from the resolution of the income tax treatment of certain environmental remediation costs. Excluding these non-core items, SCE's 2008 core earnings were $2.25 per share compared to $2.07 per share in 2007. This $0.18 per share core earnings increase is primarily attributable to higher operating income related to rate base growth, including authorized energy efficiency rewards, and lower net interest expense.
EMG's GAAP earnings in 2008 were $1.72 per share compared to $1.26 per share in 2007. EMG's 2007 results include non-core charges of $0.46 per share, mainly due to $0.45 per share for early debt extinguishment costs. EMG's 2008 core earnings remained at the 2007 level of $1.72 per share. Higher operating income at Midwest Generation, positive results from new wind projects in operation, and higher trading income at EMMT were offset by lower results from the Big 4 projects, lower interest income, a loss arising from the termination of a natural gas turbine supply agreement, and lower results at Homer City and Edison Capital.
Edison International parent company and other GAAP earnings were down from the prior year due to higher net interest expense.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States and represent the company's earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management uses core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. We also use core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary as primary performance measurements when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook, as it allows us to more accurately compare the company's ongoing performance across periods. Core earnings exclude discontinued operations and other non-core items and are reconciled to GAAP earnings.
EPS by principal operating subsidiary is based on the principal operating subsidiary net income and Edison International's weighted average outstanding common shares. The impact of participating securities (vested stock options that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for each principal operating subsidiary is not material to each principal operating subsidiary's EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which we refer to as EIX parent company and other. EPS and core EPS by principal operating subsidiary are reconciled to GAAP earnings per share.
Reminder: Edison International Will Hold a Conference Call Today

Two-way participation in the telephone call is limited to financial analysts and investors, while all other interested parties are invited to participate in a simultaneous webcast at www.edisoninvestor.com.

In addition to the live simulcast, the webcast will remain posted at www.edisoninvestor.com and telephone replays will be available through March 9, 2009, at the following numbers: (800) 642-1687 for callers in the United States and (706) 645-9291 for international callers.

2 The original price of $111.92 was affected by Midwest Generation's participation in a supplemental RPM auction during the first quarter of 2008 which resulted in purchasing certain capacity amounts at a price of $10 per MW-day, thereby reducing the aggregate forward capacity sales for this period and increasing the effective capacity price to $122.41.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States and represent the company's earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management uses core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. We also use core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary as primary performance measurements when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook, as it allows us to more accurately compare the company's ongoing performance across periods. Core earnings exclude discontinued operations and other non-core items and are reconciled to basic earnings per common share.
EPS by principal operating subsidiary is based on the principal operating subsidiary net income and Edison International's weighted average outstanding common shares. The impact of participating securities (vested stock options that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for each principal operating subsidiary is not material to each principal operating subsidiary's EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which we refer to as EIX parent company and other. EPS and core EPS by principal operating subsidiary are reconciled to basic earnings per common share.
EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA includes production tax credits from EMG's wind projects and excludes amounts from gain on the sale of assets, loss on early extinguishment of debt and leases, and impairment of assets and investments. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA as an important financial measure for evaluating EMG.
A reconciliation of Non-GAAP information to GAAP information, including the impact of participating securities, is included either on the slide where the information appears or on another slide referenced in the presentation.
