1 The all-in average realized price reflects the average price for sale of energy, capacity and ancillary services sold into the market, including the effects of hedges, real-time and day ahead sales and PJM fees and ancillary services. It is determined by dividing: (i) operating revenues less (plus) unrealized SFAS No. 133 gains (losses) by (ii) generation. Operating revenues includes capacity sales and sales under load services requirements contracts.
2 Average realized gross margin is equal to all-in average realized prices less average fuel and emission costs. Columns may not add due to rounding.

1 Load requirements services contracts include energy, capacity and ancillary services.
2 The original price of $111.92 was affected by Midwest Generation's participation in a supplemental RPM auction during the first quarter of 2008 which resulted in purchasing certain capacity amounts at a price of $10 per MW-day, thereby reducing the aggregate forward capacity sales for this period and increasing the effective capacity price to $122.41.
3 Actual contract price is a function of NYISO capacity auction clearing prices in January 2009 through April 2009 and forward over-the-counter NYISO capacity prices on December 31, 2008 for May 2009.

Installation of Activated Carbon Injection (ACI) technology by July 2009
Estimated cost $43 million
NOX Reductions
Emissions of 0.11 lbs. per million Btus by December 31, 2011
Current compliance cost estimate $513 million4
SO2 Reductions
Emissions of 0.11 lbs. per million Btus by year-end 2018, with interim step-downs
Firm deadlines for Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) technology installation - varies by plant (2013-2018)
Average estimated cost $650/kW
Homer City Compliance Plan
Use of existing technology and allowances for current compliance
Additional environmental control equipment would likely need to be installed to meet the 2015 Clean Air Act deadline
Next Steps
EMG continues to look at various innovative and less costly technologies that may be employed
EMG is also evaluating several interim and alternative compliance solutions including combinations of retrofits and specific unit shutdowns
EMG has not yet decided on any specific course to meet the NOX and SO2 emissions requirements nor committed to any specific capital investments.
1 The MWG and Homer City facilities continue to be governed by state rules as well as the existing "SIP Call" ozone season NOx cap-and-trade program. Changes in the cost of labor, equipment, materials and other factors may materially affect the above estimates for SCR, SNCR & FGD equipment. See the "Environmental Developments" section in Management Overview of the 2008 EIX 10-K for additional information concerning environmental compliance.
2 Cost estimates are in 2008 dollars. Prior estimates (in 2006 dollars) were $60 million, $450 million and $600/kW for mercury, NOX and SO2 reduction, respectively.
3 Except Will County #3 which is in 2016.
4 Includes SCR and SNCR equipment at Powerton and Joliet Unit 6, respectively, but excludes potential future SNCR equipment at Crawford by 2015.

Capital Expenditure Update
Pending recovery of the capital markets, EME intends to preserve capital by focusing on a more selective growth strategy
Completion of projects under construction, including the Big Sky wind project in Illinois
No decision made on environmental upgrades at Midwest Generation - engineering work in process
Development of sites that would deploy committed wind turbines
Use cash and future cash flow to meet existing contractual commitments
1 EMG expects to make substantial investments in new projects during the next several years. As of December 31, 2008, EMG had a wind development pipeline of 4,994 MW (the development pipeline represents potential projects for which EME either owns the project rights or has exclusive negotiation rights). Completion of these projects is dependent upon a number of items, and there is no assurance that the projects included in the development pipeline currently or added in the future will lead to the successful completion of a wind project.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States and represent the company's earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management uses core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. We also use core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary as primary performance measurements when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook, as it allows us to more accurately compare the company's ongoing performance across periods. Core earnings exclude discontinued operations and other non-core items and are reconciled to basic earnings per common share.
EPS by principal operating subsidiary is based on the principal operating subsidiary net income and Edison International's weighted average outstanding common shares. The impact of participating securities (vested stock options that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for each principal operating subsidiary is not material to each principal operating subsidiary's EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which we refer to as EIX parent company and other. EPS and core EPS by principal operating subsidiary are reconciled to basic earnings per common share.
EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA includes production tax credits from EMG's wind projects and excludes amounts from gain on the sale of assets, loss on early extinguishment of debt and leases, and impairment of assets and investments. EBITDA is the principal financial metric used by the financial community in assessing the relative cash-generation power of companies. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA as an important financial measure for evaluating EMG.
A reconciliation of Non-GAAP information to GAAP information, including the impact of participating securities, is included either on the slide where the information appears or on another slide referenced in the presentation.
