(e)   Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers      The Board of Directors of Edison International (the "Board") previously approved,subject to shareholder approval, amendments to the Edison International 2007 PerformanceIncentive Plan (the "2007 Plan") that would (1) increase the number of shares of EdisonInternational's common stock that may be delivered pursuant to awards granted under the2007 Plan by an additional 13,000,000 shares, (2) replace the existing limit on the numberof shares of Edison International common stock that may be delivered pursuant to"full-value awards" with a fungible share limit approach, which provides that shares issuedin respect of any "full-value award" granted under the 2007 Plan after February 26, 2009would be counted against the aggregate share limit as 1.75 shares for every one shareactually issued in connection with the award (for this purpose, a "full-value award"generally means any award granted under the 2007 Plan other than a stock option or stockappreciation right), and (3) extend Edison International's authority to grant awards underthe 2007 Plan intended to qualify as "performance-based awards" within the meaning ofSection 162(m) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code through the 2013 annual meeting ofshareholders.  According to the preliminary results from Edison International's annualshareholder meeting held on April 23, 2009, Edison International's shareholders haveapproved the amendments to the 2007 Plan.      The following summary of the 2007 Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference tothe text of the 2007 Plan, which was previously filed as Appendix A to the EdisonInternational and Southern California Edison Company ("SCE") Joint Proxy Statement filed onMarch 13, 2009, and is incorporated by reference herein.      The Board or one or more committees appointed by the Board administers the 2007Plan.  The Board has delegated general administrative authority for the 2007 Plan to itsCompensation and Executive Personnel Committee.  The administrator of the 2007 Plan hasbroad authority under the 2007 Plan to, among other things, select participants anddetermine the type(s) of award(s) that they are to receive, and determine the number ofshares that are to be subject to awards and the terms and conditions of awards, includingthe price (if any) to be paid for the shares or the award.      Persons eligible to receive awards under the 2007 Plan include officers or employeesof Edison International or any of its subsidiaries, and non-employee members of the EdisonInternational and SCE Boards of Directors.      After giving effect to the 2007 Plan amendments, the maximum number of shares ofEdison International's common stock that may be issued or transferred pursuant to awardsunder the 2007 Plan equals the sum of: (1) 21,500,000 shares, plus (2) the number of anyshares subjectPage Twoto awards granted under the Edison International Equity Compensation Plan(the "ECP") and the Edison International 2000 Equity Plan (the "2000 Plan" and togetherwith the ECP, the "Prior Plans") and outstanding on April 26, 2007, which expire, or forany reason are cancelled or terminated, after that date without being exercised or sharesbeing delivered (including shares that become available because outstanding awards aresettled in cash, but not any shares exchanged or withheld or deemed exchanged or withheldas full or partial payment for any award or for withholding taxes thereon).
