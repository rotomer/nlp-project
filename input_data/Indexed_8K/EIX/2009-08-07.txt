Exhibit 99.1
 
 
ROSEMEAD, Calif., August 7, 2009  Edison International (NYSE: EIX) today reported a second quarter 2009 GAAP loss of $0.05 per share. The loss includes a $0.81 per share charge from finalizing a global settlement with the Internal Revenue Service in May 2009 and the related termination of cross-border, leveraged leases (the "overall tax settlement"). The overall tax settlement resolves numerous federal income tax issues dating back to 1986.
Excluding the overall tax settlement charge and other non-core items, second quarter 2009 core earnings were $0.78 per share, or $0.01 per share less than the second quarter 2008. The core earnings decline is attributable to lower results at Edison Mission Group (EMG) offset largely by higher results at Southern California Edison (SCE).
"Although not reflected in our reported earnings, our second quarter core earnings are on track with our expectations for the quarter," said Theodore F. Craver, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of Edison International. "We established several key milestones to accomplish this year and are pleased with the progress to date such as the completion of the global tax settlement with the IRS which removes a major uncertainty for investors."
Second Quarter Earnings Detail
SCE's second quarter 2009 GAAP earnings from continuing operations were $1.53 per share and core earnings were $0.61 per share compared to $0.48 per share GAAP earnings from continuing operations and core earnings in the same quarter last year. The increase in core earnings was primarily due to higher operating income associated with the 2009 General Rate Case (GRC) and lower operating expenses due mainly to timing differences. SCE second quarter 2009 core earnings exclude the impact of the overall tax settlement.
Note: GAAP earnings and losses refer to net income or losses attributable to Edison International and GAAP earnings or losses per share refer to basic earnings or losses per common share attributable to Edison International throughout this release. Core earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure. See Reconciliation of Core Earnings to GAAP Earnings and Reconciliation of Core Earnings Guidance to GAAP Earnings Guidance.

EMG reported a GAAP loss from continuing operations of $1.69 per share in the second quarter of 2009 and core earnings of $0.19 per share compared to GAAP earnings from continuing operations and core earnings of $0.34 per share in the second quarter of 2008. Core earnings declined primarily from lower income at Midwest Generation and gas-fired projects driven by lower energy and natural gas prices, lower trading income and lower earnings at Edison Capital, partially offset by improved earnings at the Homer City plant. Second quarter 2009 results also include a $0.06 per share gain on the sale of Edison Capital's Midland Cogeneration Ventures lease; a $0.07 per share gain on sale of Edison Capital's Beaver Valley lease is included in the second quarter 2008 results. Second quarter 2009 EMG core earnings exclude the impact of the overall tax settlement and discontinued operations.
Edison International parent company and other second quarter 2009 GAAP earnings from continuing operations were $0.13 per share and core losses were $0.02 per share compared to a $0.03 per share GAAP loss from continuing operations and core loss in the second quarter of 2008. Second quarter 2009 Edison International parent company and other core results exclude the impact of the overall tax settlement.
Year-to-Date Earnings Summary
Edison International reported GAAP earnings of $0.72 per share for the six-month period ending June 30, 2009, compared to $1.70 per share for the same period last year. Excluding the impact of the overall tax settlement and discontinued operations, core earnings for the first six months of 2009 were $1.58 per share, compared to $1.72 per share in the same period in 2008.
Year-to-Date Earnings Detail
SCE's GAAP earnings from continuing operations in the first half of 2009 were $2.17 per share and core earnings were $1.25 per share compared to $0.94 per share GAAP earnings from continuing operations and core earnings in the same period last year. This increase reflects higher operating income related to the GRC decision and lower operating expenses due mainly to timing differences. SCE's first half 2009 core earnings exclude the impact of the overall tax settlement.
EMG's GAAP loss from continuing operations through June 30, 2009 was $1.55 per share compared to GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $0.84 per share in the same period last year. Year-to-date core earnings were $0.37 per share compared to $0.84 per share in the same period last year. This decrease reflects lower income at Midwest Generation and gas-fired projects driven by lower energy and natural gas prices, lower trading income, lower earnings at Edison Capital and a favorable buy-out of a coal contract at Midwest Generation in 2008. Partially off-setting these decreases were improved earnings at the Homer City plant. EMG's core earnings in the first half of 2009 exclude the impacts of the overall tax settlement together with discontinued operations.
Edison International parent company and other GAAP earnings from continuing operations in the first half of 2009 were $0.11 per share and core losses were $0.04 per share compared to a $0.06 per share GAAP loss from continuing operations and core loss in the same period last year. The core loss in the first half of 2009 excludes the impact of the overall tax settlement.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States and represent the company's earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management uses core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. We also use core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary as primary performance measurements when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook, as it allows us to more accurately compare the company's ongoing performance across periods. Core earnings exclude discontinued operations and other non-core items and are reconciled to GAAP earnings.
Earnings per share (EPS) by principal operating subsidiary is based on the principal operating subsidiary net income attributable to the common shareholders of each operating subsidiary, respectively, and Edison International's weighted average outstanding common shares. The impact of participating securities (vested stock options that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for each principal operating subsidiary is not material to each principal operating subsidiary's EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which we refer to as EIX parent company and other. EPS and core EPS by principal operating subsidiary are reconciled to GAAP EPS.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States and represent the company's earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management uses core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. We also use core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary as primary performance measurements when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook, as it allows us to more accurately compare the company's ongoing performance across periods. Core earnings exclude discontinued operations and other non-core items and are reconciled to basic earnings per common share.
EPS by principal operating subsidiary is based on the principal operating subsidiaries' net income attributable to the common shareholders of each subsidiary, respectively, and Edison International's weighted average outstanding common shares. The impact of participating securities (vested stock options that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for each principal operating subsidiary is not material to each principal operating subsidiary's EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which we refer to as EIX parent company and other. EPS and core EPS by principal operating subsidiary are reconciled to basic earnings per common share.
EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA includes production tax credits from EMG's wind projects and excludes amounts from gain on the sale of assets, loss on early extinguishment of debt and leases, and impairment of assets and investments. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA as an important financial measure for evaluating EMG.
The average realized energy price and average realized fuel cost is a non-GAAP performance measure since such statistical measures exclude unrealized gains or losses recorded as operating revenues and unrealized gains or losses recorded as fuel expenses. Management believes that the average realized energy price and average realized fuel cost is more meaningful for investors as it reflects the impact of hedge contracts at the time of actual generation in period-over-period comparisons or as compared to real-time market prices.
A reconciliation of Non-GAAP information to GAAP information, including the impact of participating securities, is included either on the slide where the information appears or on another slide referenced in this presentation.
