Environmental Agreement with Illinois EPA
In 2006, Midwest Generation entered into agreement with Illinois EPA to reduce Mercury, NOx and SO2 emissions at its Illinois coal plants
Key Elements
Mercury (90% removal by 2015)
Installed Dry Sorbent Injection equipment utilizing activated carbon on all units
Evaluating particulate removal upgrades to meet 2015 removal standards
NOx (Beginning Jan. 1, 2012, 0.11 lbs./mmBTU average annual emission rate)
Testing of Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) utilizing urea injection for NOx removal
Preliminary results conclude emission rate can be met by SNCR only
SO2 (Beginning in 2013, average annual emission rate reductions with final limit of 0.11 lbs./mmBTU by 2019)
Testing sodium based dry sorbent injection
Preliminary results on removal rates favorable
Evaluating impact on particulate removal
Comments
Testing alternative environmental compliance plan to reduce NOx & SO2
Illinois IPA granted permits for testing
Spending capital on SCR or FGD scrubber technologies infeasible given uncertainty with CO2 legislation and commodity price risk

Capacity not sold arises from: (1) capacity retained to meet forced outages under the RPM auction guidelines; and (2) capacity that PJM does not purchase at the clearing price resulting from the RPM auction.
Other capacity sales and purchases, net includes contract executed in advance of the RPM base residual auction to hedge the price risk related to such auction, participation in RPM incremental auctions and other capacity transactions entered to manage capacity risks.
Includes 342 MW purchases in January 2009 from RPM incremental auction at $40.00 MW-day.
The RPM auction capacity prices for the delivery period of June 1, 2012 to May 31, 2013 varied between different areas of PJM. In the western portion of PJM, affecting Midwest Generation, the price of $16.46 per MW-day was substantially lower than previous capacity prices. The decrease in forward capacity prices was attributable to a substantial increase in demand side management resources. The impact of lower capacity prices for this period on available resources and energy prices is uncertain.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States and represent the company's earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management uses core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. We also use core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary as primary performance measurements when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook, as it allows us to more accurately compare the company's ongoing performance across periods. Core earnings exclude discontinued operations and other non-core items and are reconciled to basic earnings per common share.
EPS by principal operating subsidiary is based on the principal operating subsidiaries' net income attributable to the common shareholders of each subsidiary, respectively, and Edison International's weighted average outstanding common shares. The impact of participating securities (vested stock options that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for each principal operating subsidiary is not material to each principal operating subsidiary's EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which we refer to as EIX parent company and other. EPS and core EPS by principal operating subsidiary are reconciled to basic earnings per common share.
EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA includes production tax credits from EMG's wind projects and excludes amounts from gain on the sale of assets, loss on early extinguishment of debt and leases, and impairment of assets and investments. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA as an important financial measure for evaluating EMG.
The average realized energy price and average realized fuel cost is a non-GAAP performance measure since such statistical measures exclude unrealized gains or losses recorded as operating revenues and unrealized gains or losses recorded as fuel expenses. Management believes that the average realized energy price and average realized fuel cost is more meaningful for investors as it reflects the impact of hedge contracts at the time of actual generation in period-over-period comparisons or as compared to real-time market prices.
A reconciliation of Non-GAAP information to GAAP information, including the impact of participating securities, is included either on the slide where the information appears or on another slide referenced in this presentation.
