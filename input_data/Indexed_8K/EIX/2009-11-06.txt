The Traditional Electric System is Changing
Grid Control, Integration of New Resources & Asset Optimization
Smart Metering
Energy Smart Customer Solutions & Electric Vehicles
Historical Grid Technology Advances:
 -  Improving heat-rate efficiency for steam-generated power
 -  Increased voltages of transmission
 -  Grid control and communications
Future Grid Technology Advances:
 -  Artificial intelligence  quick response to unstable conditions
 -  Grid management systems mitigate intermittent and unpredictable renewable resources
 -  Integration of intermittent renewables, distributed generation and storage
 -  Robust customer usage information
 -  Sends price signals that better match costs
 -  Manages aggregate customer load
 -  Optimizes load profile
 -  Improves generation and procurement
 -  Support for potential electric transportation growth
For the last one hundred years, the basic design of the electric system has been unchanged. SCE is taking steps to develop and integrate new resources and advanced technologies such as a proposed $54 million Tehachapi Wind Energy Storage Project to evaluate utility scale lithium-ion battery technology and implementing smart metering technology across its service territory.

 -  Preliminary results on removal rates favorable
 -  Evaluating impact on particulate removal
Comments
Testing alternative environmental compliance plan to reduce NOx & SO2 Illinois EPA granted permits for testing
Spending capital on SCR or FGD scrubber technologies infeasible given uncertainty with CO2 legislation and commodity price risk
In 2006, Midwest Generation entered into agreement with Illinois EPA to reduce Mercury, NOx and SO2 emissions at its Illinois coal plants
