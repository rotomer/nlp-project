Exhibit 99.1
 
ROSEMEAD, Calif., Mar. 1, 2010  Edison International (NYSE: EIX) today reported fourth quarter 2009 basic earnings of $0.65 per share, compared to $0.66 per share in the same quarter last year. Fourth quarter 2009 core earnings were $0.59 per share compared to $0.66 per share in the fourth quarter of 2008. The decline is largely attributable to lower earnings at Edison Mission Group (EMG), partially offset by higher operating results at Southern California Edison (SCE). Core earnings exclude discontinued operations and other non-core items as discussed below.
"Despite a difficult economy, our 2009 performance was solid, and we are pleased we were able to achieve earnings above the high end of our earnings guidance range," said Theodore F. Craver, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of Edison International.
Fourth Quarter Earnings Detail
SCE's fourth quarter 2009 basic earnings were $0.53 per share compared to $0.43 per share in the fourth quarter 2008. Core earnings were $0.51 per share compared to $0.43 per share in the same quarter last year. This increase was primarily due to higher operating income associated with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) General Rate Case (GRC) decisions, partially offset by higher income taxes. Fourth quarter 2009 non-core results include $0.02 per share from revised interest costs related to the global tax settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
Note: Basic earnings or losses per share refer to basic earnings or losses per common share attributable to Edison International throughout this release. Core earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure. See Reconciliation of Core Earnings to Basic Earnings and Reconciliation of Core Earnings Guidance to Basic Earnings Guidance.

EMG's fourth quarter 2009 basic earnings were $0.17 per share compared to $0.25 per share in the fourth quarter of 2008. Core earnings were $0.13 per share compared to $0.25 per share in the same quarter last year. Core earnings declined primarily from lower energy prices at merchant coal-fired projects, lower trading income and lower results at Edison Capital, partially offset by lower income taxes. Core earnings included unrealized gains on hedge contracts of $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter of 2009 and $0.04 per share in the fourth quarter of 2008. Core results in 2008 included a $0.04 charge to cancel a contract to supply natural gas turbines. Fourth quarter 2009 non-core items include $0.04 per share from the global tax settlement with the IRS, reflecting the revised interest costs discussed above.
Edison International parent company and other reported a fourth quarter 2009 loss of $0.05 per share compared to a $0.02 per share loss in the fourth quarter 2008. Earnings declined primarily from higher income tax expenses.
Full Year Earnings Summary
Edison International reported 2009 basic earnings of $2.59 per share compared to $3.69 per share in 2008. Core earnings for 2009 were $3.25 per share compared to $3.84 per share in 2008. Non-core items in 2009 include $0.78 per share loss related to the global tax settlement with the IRS and the associated termination of Edison Capital's cross-border leveraged leases, a $0.14 per share non-cash accounting benefit at SCE from the transfer of its Mountainview power plant to utility rate base and a $0.02 per share loss from discontinued operations at EMG.
Full Year Earnings Detail
SCE's basic earnings in 2009 were $3.76 per share compared to $2.10 per share in 2008. Core earnings for 2009 were $2.68 per share compared to $2.25 per share in 2008. The increase in core earnings was primarily due to higher operating income associated with the CPUC and FERC GRC decisions, partially offset by higher income taxes. In addition, core earnings were favorably impacted from lower than planned financings during the year, primarily from cash received for tax-related timing differences and other benefits. SCE's 2009 core earnings exclude a $0.94 per share benefit from the global tax settlement, a $0.14 per share benefit from the transfer of the Mountainview power plant to utility rate base and SCE's 2008 core earnings exclude the $0.15 per share charge from the CPUC's performance-based ratemaking decision.
EMG's basic loss in 2009 was $1.21 per share compared to basic earnings of $1.72 per share in 2008. Core earnings in 2009 were $0.68 per share compared to $1.72 per share in 2008. The decrease in core earnings reflects lower income from merchant coal and gas-fired projects driven by lower energy prices, as well as lower trading income and lower earnings at Edison Capital. Core earnings included unrealized gains on hedge contracts of $0.11 per share in 2009 and gains of $0.03 per share in 2008. Core results for 2008 included $0.03 per share for the favorable buy-out of a coal contract, and a $0.04 per share charge for a natural gas turbine supply agreement cancellation. EMG's 2009 core earnings exclude losses of $1.87 per share from the global tax settlement and a loss of $0.02 per share from discontinued operations.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States and represent the company's earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management uses core earnings and earnings per share (EPS) by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. We also use core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook to facilitate comparisons of the Company's performance from period to period.
Core earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Core earnings are defined as earnings attributable to common shareholders less income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings. Core earnings are reconciled to basic earnings in the attached tables. EPS by principal operating subsidiary is based on the principal operating subsidiary net income attributable to the common shareholders of each operating subsidiary, respectively, and Edison International's weighted average outstanding common shares. The impact of participating securities (vested stock options that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for each principal operating subsidiary is not material to each principal operating subsidiary's EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which we refer to as EIX parent company and other. EIX core EPS and core EPS by principal operating subsidiary are reconciled to basic EPS.

In February 2010, Homer City entered into additional contractual agreements for the purchase of 0.4 million tons for 2011.
4 The amount of coal under contract in tons is calculated based on contracted tons and applying an 8,800 Btu equivalent for the Midwest Generation plants and a 13,000 Btu equivalent for the Homer City facilities.

1 Environmental expenditures include primarily expenditures related to SNCR equipment. Additional expenditures are anticipated; however, the amounts and timing have not been determined.
2 Includes Taloga and Laredo Ridge added to projects under construction and pending construction after December 31, 2009 and $206 million in turbine purchases for 2010 where financing has been arranged.
3 Turbine commitments related to the Taloga and Laredo Ridge wind projects totaling $106 million are excluded from turbine commitments and included in capital and construction expenditures in 2010. 2010 commitments include amounts related to escalation adjustment sought pursuant to one of the turbine supply agreements. These amounts are subject to dispute. Amounts exclude balance of project costs for 302 MW available for new projects, which would be an additional $225 million to $350 million based on typical project costs.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States and represent the company's earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management uses core earnings and earnings per share (EPS) by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. We also use core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook to facilitate comparisons of the Company's performance from period to period.
Core earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Core earnings are defined as earnings attributable to common shareholders less income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings. EPS by principal operating subsidiary is based on the principal operating subsidiary net income attributable to the common shareholders of each operating subsidiary, respectively, and Edison International's weighted average outstanding common shares. The impact of participating securities (vested stock options that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for each principal operating subsidiary is not material to each principal operating subsidiary's EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which we refer to as EIX parent company and other. EIX core EPS and core EPS by principal operating subsidiary are reconciled to basic EPS.
EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA includes production tax credits from EMG's wind projects and excludes amounts from gain on the sale of assets, loss on early extinguishment of debt and leases, and impairment of assets and investments. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA as an important financial measure for evaluating EMG.
The average realized energy price and average realized fuel cost is a non-GAAP performance measure since such statistical measures exclude unrealized gains or losses recorded as operating revenues and unrealized gains or losses recorded as fuel expenses. Management believes that the average realized energy price and average realized fuel cost is more meaningful for investors as it reflects the impact of hedge contracts at the time of actual generation in period-over-period comparisons or as compared to real-time market prices.
A reconciliation of Non-GAAP information to GAAP information, including the impact of participating securities, is included either on the slide where the information appears or on another slide referenced in this presentation.
