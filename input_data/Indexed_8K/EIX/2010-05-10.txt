Exhibit 99.1
 
ROSEMEAD, Calif., May 7, 2010  Edison International (NYSE: EIX) today reported first quarter 2010 results.
First quarter 2010 basic earnings per share were $0.72 compared to $0.76 per share in the same quarter last year. Core earnings in the first quarter of 2010 were $0.82 per share compared to $0.79 per share in the same quarter last year, mainly due to higher operating results at Edison Mission Group (EMG), partially offset by expense timing differences at Southern California Edison (SCE). Core earnings exclude discontinued operations and other non-core items as discussed below.
"During the first quarter, we achieved solid earnings in a difficult power market," said Theodore F. Craver, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of Edison International.
First Quarter Earnings Detail
SCE's first quarter 2010 basic earnings were $0.50 per share compared to $0.64 per share in the first quarter of 2009. This decrease included a non-core charge of $0.12 per share to reverse previously recognized tax benefits eliminated by the federal health care legislation enacted in March 2010. Core earnings were $0.62 per share for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $0.64 per share in the same quarter last year. The two-cent decrease is primarily due to higher operating expense, including the impact of curtailed spending in the first quarter of last year until the 2009 CPUC General Rate Case decision was received in March 2009. This decrease was almost entirely offset by rate base growth and higher capitalized financing costs.
Note: Basic earnings or losses per share refer to basic earnings or losses per common share attributable to Edison International throughout this release. Core earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure. See Reconciliation of Core Earnings to Basic Earnings and Reconciliation of Core Earnings Per Share Guidance to Revised Basic Earnings Per Share Guidance.

EMG's first quarter 2010 basic earnings were $0.24 per share compared to $0.14 per share in the first quarter of 2009. Core earnings were $0.22 per share compared to $0.17 per share in the same quarter last year. EMG's 2010 core earnings increased from 2009 primarily due to higher distributions from EMG's Doga and March Point natural gas facilities and higher trading income. Mainly offsetting this increase were lower results from EMG's merchant coal plants driven primarily by lower energy prices and higher 2009 unrealized gains, partially offset by lower emission costs and higher capacity prices. Renewable project income was lower mainly due to less wind. First quarter 2010 non-core items include $0.02 per share of earnings from discontinued operations. First quarter 2009 per share non-core items include a $0.04 charge related to Edison Capital's lease terminations, partially offset by $0.01 in earnings from discontinued operations.
2010 Earnings Guidance
Previously announced annual core earnings guidance of $3.15 - $3.45 per share is reaffirmed. The company has revised its 2010 GAAP earnings guidance by ($0.10) per share to reflect a $0.12 per share charge at SCE related to a change in the tax deductibility of a portion of retiree health care expenses, partially offset by earnings from discontinued operations of $0.02 per share at EMG. See the risk disclosure statement on page 3 and the financial teleconference presentation accompanying the company's earnings conference call for further information.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States and represent the company's earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management uses core earnings and earnings per share (EPS) by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. We also use core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook to facilitate comparisons of the Company's performance from period to period.
Core earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Core earnings and core earnings per share are defined as GAAP earnings and GAAP earnings per share excluding income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings. GAAP earnings refer to net income attributable to Edison International common shareholders or attributable to the common shareholders of each subsidiary and Edison International GAAP earnings per share refers to basic earnings per common share attributable to Edison International common shareholders. Core earnings are reconciled to basic earnings in the attached tables. EPS by principal operating subsidiary is based on the principal operating subsidiaries' net income attributable to the common shareholders of each operating subsidiary, respectively, and Edison International's weighted average outstanding common shares. The impact of participating securities (vested stock options that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for each principal operating subsidiary is not material to each principal operating subsidiary's EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which we refer to as EIX parent company and other. EIX core EPS and core EPS by principal operating subsidiary are reconciled to basic EPS.

SCE 2010 20% Renewable Energy Goal
Contracts are in place to meet 20% of customers' energy requirement with renewable resources, but a portion of energy delivery may be delayed in 2010 due to transmission constraints. SCE expects to meet the 2010 goal with flexible compliance that allows banking and earmarking of past and future renewable energy surplus.

 If index exceeds a 1% deadband from starting index value of 6.26%, ROE changes by half the difference

 At September 2010, index must exceed 7.26% or be below 5.26% to trigger ROE change
 If not triggered, SCE's authorized ROE for 2011 will continue at 11.5%
