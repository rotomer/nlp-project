In 2008, CPUC approved multi-year cost of capital mechanism through 2010 with authorized return on equity (ROE) at 11.5%
??In 2009, the CPUC extended the mechanism through 2012
Cost of Capital mechanism allows for indexed changes in SCE's authorized ROE:
??Triggers based on 12-month average of Moody's Baa utility bond index, measured in September of each year
??If index exceeds a 1% deadband from starting index value of 6.26%, ROE changes by half the difference As of April 2010, index is averaging 6.20%
??At September 2010, index must exceed 7.26% or be below 5.26% to trigger ROE change
??If not triggered, SCE's authorized ROE for 2011 will continue at 11.5%
1 Spot rate is daily yield on Moody's Baa Utility Bond Index and the Measurement Period Average is the average of the monthly yields on the index beginning with the first month of the measurement period.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States and represent the company's earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management uses core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. We also use core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook, to facilitate comparison of the company's performance from period to period.
Core earnings is a Non-GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Core earnings and core earnings per share are defined as GAAP earnings and GAAP earnings per share excluding income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings. GAAP earnings refer to net income attributable to Edison International or attributable to the common shareholders of each subsidiary and Edison International GAAP earnings per share refers to basic earnings per common share attributable to Edison International common shareholders. EPS by principal operating subsidiary is based on the principal operating subsidiaries' net income attributable to the common shareholders of each subsidiary, respectively, and Edison International's weighted average outstanding common shares. The impact of participating securities (vested stock options that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for each principal operating subsidiary is not material to each principal operating subsidiary's EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which we refer to as EIX parent company and other.
