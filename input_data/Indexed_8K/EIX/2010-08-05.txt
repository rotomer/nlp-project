Exhibit 99.1
 
ROSEMEAD, Calif., August 5, 2010  Edison International (NYSE: EIX) today reported second quarter 2010 results.
Second quarter 2010 basic earnings per share were $1.05 compared to a loss of $0.05 per share in the second quarter of 2009. Results for the second quarter of 2009 included a $0.81 per share charge related to a global tax settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and related termination of cross-border, leveraged leases. During the second quarter of 2010, the California Franchise Tax Board accepted the tax positions in the IRS settlement. This resulted in a second quarter 2010 gain of $0.43 per share. The impact of the global tax settlement, including state taxes, and related lease terminations are non-core items in the company's quarterly and year-to-date results for both years.
Excluding non-core items and discontinued operations, second quarter 2010 core earnings were $0.62 per share compared to core earnings of $0.78 per share in the year-ago quarter. The core earnings decrease is attributable to lower results at Edison Mission Group (EMG), partially offset by higher results at Southern California Edison (SCE).
"Our second quarter results are consistent with our plan for the year," said Theodore F. Craver, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of Edison International. "This plan included completing substantially all planned maintenance for our EMG coal fleet during the spring, which significantly impacted second quarter results. Our year-to-date performance and outlook, however, suggest that we could achieve results toward the higher end of our core earnings guidance range."
Note: GAAP earnings and losses refer to net income or losses attributable to Edison International throughout this release. Core earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure. See Reconciliation of Core Earnings to GAAP Earnings and Reconciliation of Core Earnings Per Share Guidance to Basic Earnings Per Share Guidance.

Second Quarter Earnings Detail
SCE's second quarter 2010 basic earnings were $0.92 per share compared to $1.53 per share in the second quarter last year. Second quarter 2010 core earnings were $0.75 per share compared to $0.61 per share in the prior-year period. The increase in core earnings was due to lower income tax expense and higher authorized revenue to support rate base growth. The increase was partially offset by higher operating expense, including the impact of curtailed spending last year due to the timing of the 2009 California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) General Rate Case decision. The lower tax expense was driven by the timing of certain federal tax deductions related to SCE's capital investment program.
EMG's second quarter 2010 basic earnings were $0.08 per share compared to a loss of $1.71 per share in the second quarter of 2009. Core losses in the second quarter of 2010 were $0.10 per share, compared to core earnings of $0.19 per share in the second quarter of 2009. The decline in core earnings reflects increased coal fleet maintenance activities for scheduled plant outages, impact of unrealized gains and losses and lower generation. In addition, second quarter 2009 results included $0.06 per share related to the sale of an interest in a leveraged lease.
Edison International parent company and other second quarter 2010 basic earnings were $0.05 per share and $0.13 per share in the prior period. Core losses were $0.03 per share and $0.02 per share in the second quarter of 2010 and 2009 respectively.
Year-to-Date Earnings Summary
Edison International reported basic earnings of $1.77 per share for the six-month period ending June 30, 2010 compared to $0.72 per share for the same period last year. Core earnings for the first six months of 2010 were $1.44 per share, $0.14 per share below the first half of 2009 due to lower EMG results.
Year-to-Date Earnings Detail
For the first six months of 2010, SCE's basic earnings were $1.43 per share compared to $2.17 per share for the same period last year. Core earnings were $1.38 per share compared to $1.25 per share in the same period of 2009. The increase in core earnings reflects higher authorized revenue for rate base growth, lower income tax expense and higher capitalized financing costs. This increase was partially offset by higher operating expense including the impact of curtailed spending last year due to the timing of the 2009 CPUC General Rate Case decision. The lower tax expense was driven by the timing of certain federal tax deductions related to SCE's capital investment program.
EMG's basic earnings for the first six months of 2010 were $0.32 per share compared to a basic loss of $1.56 per share in the prior-year period. Core earnings were $0.12 per share compared to $0.37 per share in the first half of 2009. The decrease in core earnings reflects the increased scheduled plant outages in the second quarter, impact of unrealized gains and losses and lower coal fleet realized energy prices. Partially offsetting these items were higher trading revenues and higher distributions from two projects recorded in the first quarter. In addition, results for the 2009 period include $0.06 per share related to the sale of an interest in a leveraged lease.

Edison International parent company and other basic earnings in the first half of 2010 were $0.02 per share compared to $0.11 per share in the first half of 2009. Core losses were $0.06 per share in the 2010 period and $0.04 per share in the 2009 period.
2010 Earnings Guidance
Edison International reaffirmed its 2010 core earnings guidance of $3.15 to $3.45 per share and updated its basic earnings per share guidance to reflect year-to-date non-core items. See the risk disclosure statement on page 4 and the financial teleconference presentation accompanying the company's earnings conference call for further information.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States and represent the company's earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management uses core earnings and earnings per share (EPS) by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. We also use core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook to facilitate comparisons of the Company's performance from period to period.
Core earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Core earnings and core earnings per share are defined as GAAP earnings and basic earnings per share excluding income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings. GAAP earnings refer to net income attributable to Edison International common shareholders or attributable to the common shareholders of each subsidiary. Core earnings are reconciled to GAAP earnings in the attached tables. EPS by principal operating subsidiary is based on the principal operating subsidiaries' net income attributable to the common shareholders of each operating subsidiary, respectively, and Edison International's weighted average outstanding common shares. The impact of participating securities (vested stock options that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for each principal operating subsidiary is not material to each principal operating subsidiary's EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which we refer to as EIX parent company and other. EIX core EPS and core EPS by principal operating subsidiary are reconciled to basic EPS.

 -  In 2008, CPUC approved multi -year cost of capital mechanism through 2010 with authorized return on equity (ROE) at 11.5%
2012
 -  Cost of Capital mechanism allows for indexed changes in SCE's authorized ROE:
Triggers based on 12-month average of Moody's Baa utility bond index, measured in September of each year
If index exceeds a 1% deadband from starting index value of 6.26%, ROE changes by half the difference
 -  As of July 2010, index is averaging 6.15%
At September 2010, index must exceed 7.26% or be below 5.26% to trigger ROE change
If not triggered, SCE's authorized ROE for 2011 will continue at 11.5%
1 Spot rate is daily yield on Moody's Baa Utility Bond Index and the Measurement Period Average is the average of the monthly yields on the index beginning with the first month of the measurement period.
