Exhibit 99.1
 
 
ROSEMEAD, Calif., Oct. 29, 2010  Edison International (NYSE: EIX) today reported third quarter 2010 basic earnings of $1.56 per share compared to $1.23 per share in the same quarter last year. Excluding non-core items and discontinued operations, third quarter 2010 core earnings were $1.46 per share compared to $1.09 per share in the third quarter of 2009. The core earnings increase is attributable to higher results at both Southern California Edison (SCE) and Edison Mission Group (EMG).
"Both of our companies delivered solid earnings growth this quarter," said Theodore F. Craver, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of Edison International. "Given our strong year-to-date performance, we've increased our full-year earnings guidance accordingly," Craver added. The company raised its 2010 core earnings guidance range from $3.15 to $3.45 per share to $3.45 to $3.60 per share.
Third Quarter Earnings Detail
SCE's third quarter 2010 basic earnings were $1.21 per share compared to $1.06 per share in the third quarter of 2009. Core earnings were $1.08 per share compared to $0.92 per share in the same quarter last year. The increase in core earnings was primarily due to higher authorized revenue to support rate base growth and higher capitalized financing costs. Non-core items included a $0.13 per share benefit in the third quarter of 2010 from final resolution of interest charges related to a California Franchise Tax Board settlement and a $0.14 per share benefit in the third quarter of 2009 related to transferring a power plant to rate base.
EMG's third quarter 2010 basic earnings were $0.34 per share compared to $0.19 per share in the third quarter of 2009. Core earnings were $0.37 per share compared to $0.19 per share in the same quarter last year. Core earnings increased due to higher operating revenues from Midwest Generation and Homer City primarily from higher average realized energy prices, higher capacity revenues, and a gain from the sale of bankruptcy claims. Non-core items in the third quarter of 2010 included a $0.03 per share charge related to the California tax settlement and discontinued operations.
Note: GAAP earnings and losses refer to net income or losses attributable to Edison International throughout this release. Core earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure. See Reconciliation of Core Earnings to GAAP Earnings and Reconciliation of Core Earnings Per Share Guidance to Basic Earnings Per Share Guidance.

Edison International parent company and other reported third quarter 2010 earnings of $0.01 per share compared to a $0.02 per share loss in the third quarter of 2009. Earnings in the third quarter of 2010 were mainly due to consolidated income tax benefits.
Year-to-Date Earnings Summary
Edison International reported basic earnings of $3.33 per share for the nine-month period ending September 30, 2010, compared to $1.94 per share for the same period last year. Core earnings for the first nine months of 2010 were $2.90 per share compared to $2.66 per share for the same period in 2009. Non-core items were a $0.43 per share benefit in the 2010 period compared to a $0.72 per share loss in the 2009 period, both primarily related to tax settlements.
Year-to-Date Earnings Detail
SCE's year-to-date basic earnings through September 30, 2010 were $2.63 per share compared to $3.23 per share in the same period last year. Core earnings for the first nine months of 2010 were $2.45 per share compared to $2.17 per share for the same period in 2009. The increase reflects higher authorized revenue to support rate base growth, lower income tax expense, and higher capitalized financing costs. The year-to-date increase was partially offset by higher operating expenses that continue to reflect the impact of curtailed spending in the prior year period due to the timing of the 2009 general rate case decision. The year-to-date lower tax expense includes a change in method of tax accounting for asset removal costs primarily related to SCE's infrastructure replacement program. Non-core items in the 2010 period included a $0.30 per share benefit from tax settlements and a $0.12 per share charge related to the tax impact of health care legislation. Non-core items in 2009 included a $0.92 per share benefit from the tax settlement and a $0.14 per share benefit related to transferring a power plant to rate base.
EMG's year-to-date basic earnings were $0.66 per share compared to a loss of $1.38 per share in the same period last year. Year-to-date core earnings were $0.49 per share compared to $0.55 per share in the 2009 period. EMG's core earnings were lower primarily from higher plant maintenance costs in 2010 due to scheduled outages at EMG's merchant power plants, partially offset by higher energy trading revenues. Non-core items included a $0.16 per share benefit from tax settlements and a $0.01 per share benefit from discontinued operations in the 2010 period and a $1.93 per share charge primarily related to lease terminations and the tax settlement in the 2009 period.
Edison International parent company and other reported basic earnings through September 30, 2010 of $0.04 per share compared to basic earnings of $0.09 per share in the same period last year. Core losses were $0.04 per share in the 2010 period and $0.06 per share in the 2009 period, with the improvement due primarily to consolidated income tax benefits.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States and represent the company's earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management uses core earnings and earnings per share (EPS) by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. We also use core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook to facilitate comparisons of the Company's performance from period to period.
Core earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Core earnings and core earnings per share are defined as GAAP earnings and basic earnings per share excluding income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings. GAAP earnings refer to net income attributable to Edison International common shareholders or attributable to the common shareholders of each subsidiary. Core earnings are reconciled to GAAP earnings in the attached tables. EPS by principal operating subsidiary is based on the principal operating subsidiaries' net income attributable to the common shareholders of each operating subsidiary, respectively, and Edison International's weighted average outstanding common shares. The impact of participating securities (vested stock options that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for each principal operating subsidiary is not material to each principal operating subsidiary's EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which we refer to as EIX parent company and other. EIX core EPS and core EPS by principal operating subsidiary are reconciled to basic EPS.

1 Environmental expenditures include primarily expenditures related to selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) equipment and $174 million for expenditures during the remainder of 2010 to 2012 to begin to retrofit initial units using dry scrubbing with sodium-based sorbents to comply with the CPS requirements for SO2 emissions. Midwest Generation could elect to shut down units instead of installing controls to be in compliance with the CPS, and, therefore, decisions about any particular combination of retrofits and shutdowns it may ultimately employ to comply remain subject to conditions applicable at the time decisions are required or made.
3 Amounts include an unconsolidated project in which construction expenditures will be substantially funded by EME. Amounts also include projects under construction where project financing has been secured. The available balance under secured financing arrangements was $254 million as of September 30, 2010.
4 Amounts exclude balance of project costs for the 75 MW available for new projects, which EME estimates to be an additional $50 million to $90 million based on typical project costs. Turbine commitment figures include the impact of the October 8, 2010 Mitsubishi settlement agreement.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States and represent the company's earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management uses core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. We also use core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook, to facilitate the company's performance from period to period.
Core earnings is a Non-GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Core earnings and core earnings per share are defined as GAAP earnings and basic earnings per share excluding income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings. GAAP earnings refer to net income attributable to Edison International common shareholders or attributable to the common shareholders of each subsidiary. EPS by principal operating subsidiary is based on the principal operating subsidiaries' net income attributable to the common shareholders of each subsidiary, respectively, and Edison International's weighted average outstanding common shares. The impact of participating securities (vested stock options that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for each principal operating subsidiary is not material to each principal operating subsidiary's EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which we refer to as EIX parent company and other.
EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA includes production tax credits from EMG's wind projects and excludes amounts from gain on the sale of assets, loss on early extinguishment of debt and leases, and impairment of assets and investments. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA as an important financial measure for evaluating EMG.
The average realized energy price and average realized fuel cost is a non-GAAP performance measure since such statistical measures exclude unrealized gains or losses recorded as operating revenues and unrealized gains or losses recorded as fuel expenses. Management believes that the average realized energy price and average realized fuel cost is more meaningful for investors as it reflects the impact of hedge contracts at the time of actual generation in period-over-period comparisons or as compared to real-time market prices.
A reconciliation of Non-GAAP information to GAAP information, including the impact of participating securities, is included either on the slide where the information appears or on another slide referenced in this presentation.
