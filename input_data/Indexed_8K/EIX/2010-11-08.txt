Item  8.01 Other Events
 
   
On November 8, 2010, Southern California Edison Company (SCE), Edison Internationals subsidiary, entered into an agreement to sell its ownership interest in Units 4 and 5 of the Four Corners coal-fired electric generating facility located in Farmington, New Mexico to the operator of the facility, Arizona Public Service Company.  The sale price is $294 million, subject to certain adjustments, and the associated after-tax gain will be for the benefit of SCEs ratepayers and, therefore, will not affect SCEs earnings. 0; In addition, completion of the sale will not have a material impact on SCEs rate base.  The closing of the sale is contingent upon the receipt of regulatory approvals, execution of amendments extending the existing facility lease, execution of a new coal supply contract, and other specified closing conditions and is currently estimated to occur in the second half of 2012.
