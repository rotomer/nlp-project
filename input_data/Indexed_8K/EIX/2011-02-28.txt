EXHIBIT 99.1
 
ROSEMEAD, Calif., Feb. 28, 2011  Edison International (NYSE: EIX) today reported fourth quarter 2010 basic earnings of $0.51 per share, compared to $0.65 per share in the same quarter last year. Fourth quarter 2010 core earnings were $0.58 per share, compared to core earnings of $0.59 per share in the fourth quarter of 2009. Higher fourth quarter earnings at Southern California Edison (SCE) were more than offset by lower results at Edison Mission Group (EMG) and higher parent company costs.
For 2010, the company reported basic earnings of $3.84 per share compared to $2.59 per share in 2009, while core earnings for 2010 increased 7 percent to $3.48 per share compared to $3.25 per share in 2009. The improvement in core earnings was driven by higher earnings at SCE, offset by a decline in earnings at EMG and a slight increase in parent company costs.
"Edison International had a solid year, led by SCE's strong earnings growth," said Theodore F. Craver, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of Edison International. "Looking ahead to 2011, we expect continued earnings growth at SCE. EMG faces weak power market fundamentals in the year ahead, but we see positive value in the business as power market fundamentals improve."
Fourth Quarter Earnings Detail
SCE's fourth quarter 2010 basic earnings were $0.56 per share compared to $0.53 per share in the fourth quarter of 2009. Core earnings were also $0.56 per share while fourth quarter 2009 earnings were $0.51 per share. The core earnings increase was primarily driven by rate base growth. Fourth quarter 2009 results included a non-core benefit related to tax settlements.
Note: GAAP earnings and losses refer to net income or losses attributable to Edison International throughout this release. Core earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure. See Reconciliation of Core Earnings to GAAP Earnings and Reconciliation of Core Earnings Guidance to GAAP Earnings Guidance.

EMG's fourth quarter 2010 basic earnings were $0.03 per share compared to $0.17 per share in the fourth quarter of 2009. Core earnings were $0.10 per share compared to $0.13 per share in the same quarter last year. Core earnings declined largely from higher income tax expense and lower trading revenues. Fourth quarter 2010 results included a non-core charge related to write-offs of capitalized costs at its Powerton plant in Illinois. Fourth quarter 2009 results included a non-core benefit from tax settlements.
Edison International parent company and other reported a fourth quarter 2010 loss of $0.08 per share compared to a $0.05 per share loss in the fourth quarter of 2009 due to higher income tax expense.
Full-Year Earnings Detail
SCE's basic earnings in 2010 were $3.19 per share compared to $3.76 per share in 2009. Core earnings in 2010 were $3.01 per share compared to $2.68 per share in 2009. The increase in core earnings was primarily due to rate base growth, lower income tax expense and earnings from construction activities. The lower tax expense in 2010 includes a change in the method of tax accounting for asset removal costs primarily related to SCE's infrastructure replacement programNon-core items in 2010 included benefits from tax settlements and a charge related to health care legislation, and in 2009 included benefits from the tax settlements and transferring a power plant to utility rate base.
.
EMG's basic earnings in 2010 were $0.69 per share compared to a 2009 loss of $1.21 per share. Core earnings were $0.59 per share compared to $0.68 per share in 2009. EMG's core earnings were lower primarily from higher plant maintenance costs in 2010 due to scheduled merchant power plant outages, unrealized hedge-related accounting losses in 2010 compared to unrealized gains in 2009, and higher income tax expense. The decline was partially offset by higher energy trading revenues. Non-core items included the impacts of discontinued operations in both periods, a benefit from tax settlements and the charge from the write-off of capitalized costs in 2010, and a charge related to the tax settlements and related termination of leases in 2009.
Edison International parent company and other reported a 2010 basic loss of $0.04 per share compared to basic earnings of $0.04 per share in the prior year. Core losses were $0.12 per share in 2010 and $0.11 per share in 2009. Core losses exclude non-core benefits associated with the global settlement in both years.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States and represent the company's earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management uses core earnings and earnings per share (EPS) by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. We also use core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook to facilitate comparisons of the Company's performance from period to period.
Core earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Core earnings and core earnings per share are defined as GAAP earnings and basic earnings per share excluding income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings. GAAP earnings refer to net income attributable to Edison International common shareholders or attributable to the common shareholders of each subsidiary. Core earnings are reconciled to GAAP earnings in the attached tables. EPS by principal operating subsidiary is based on the principal operating subsidiaries' net income attributable to the common shareholders of each operating subsidiary, respectively, and Edison International's weighted average outstanding common shares. The impact of participating securities (vested stock options that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for each principal operating subsidiary is not material to each principal operating subsidiary's EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which we refer to as EIX parent company and other. EIX core EPS and core EPS by principal operating subsidiary are reconciled to basic EPS.

Summary of Bonus Depreciation Impact
 -  Bonus depreciation expected to have the following impacts on Edison International
Results in an EIX consolidated net operating loss for federal income tax purposes for 2010 and 2011
Increases deferred taxes and reduces SCE's rate base and revenue requirement
Provides additional cash flow benefits during 2011 to SCE of approximately $550 million
Delays tax allocation payments to EMG until tax benefits are utilized by EIX on a consolidated basis which may be for several years
Eliminates income tax benefits from the domestic production activities deduction (also known as Section 199 deductions) of $16 million in 2011. The negative impact on 2010 net income was $15 million from the recapture of the 2008 Section 199 deductions taken in prior years resulting from the carry back of net operating losses

1 The above hedge positions include forward contracts for the sale of power and futures contracts during different periods of the year and the day. Market prices tend to be higher during on-peak periods and during summer months, although there is significant variability of power prices during different periods of time. Accordingly, the above hedge positions are not directly comparable to the 24-hour Northern Illinois Hub or PJM West Hub prices set forth above.
2 Includes hedging transactions primarily at the PJM West Hub and to a lesser extent at other trading locations. Years 2011 and 2012 include hedging activities entered into by EMMT for the Homer City plant that are not designated under the intercompany agreements with Homer City due to limitations under the sale leaseback transaction documents.

1 Midwest Generation plants' environmental expenditures include $109 million for expenditures in 2011 related to SNCR equipment and $372 million for expenditures in 2011 to 2013 to begin to retrofit initial units using dry scrubbing with sodium-based sorbents to comply with the CPS requirements for SO2 emissions. Midwest Generation could elect to shut down units instead of installing controls to be in compliance with the CPS, and, therefore, decisions about any particular combination of retrofits and shutdowns it may ultimately employ to comply remain subject to conditions applicable at the time decisions are required or made. EME's use of less expensive dry scrubbing equipment with sodium-based absorbents to meet CPS requirements may be impacted by the content of forthcoming regulations expected to be proposed by the US EPA related to HAPs. If the HAPs regulations issued by the US EPA are not consistent with EME's less costly environmental compliance plan.
