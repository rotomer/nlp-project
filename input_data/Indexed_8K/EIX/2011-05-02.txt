Exhibit 99.1
 
ROSEMEAD, Calif., May 2, 2011  Edison International (NYSE: EIX) today reported first quarter 2011 basic earnings of $0.61 per share, compared to $0.72 per share in the same quarter last year. Core earnings in the first quarter of 2011 were $0.62 per share compared to $0.82 per share in the first quarter of 2010. Higher first quarter earnings at Southern California Edison (SCE) were more than offset by lower results at Edison Mission Group (EMG).
"Our first quarter results are consistent with our 2011 earnings outlook," said Ted Craver, chairman and chief executive officer of Edison International.
First Quarter Earnings Detail
SCE's first quarter 2011 basic earnings were $0.68 per share compared to $0.50 per share in the first quarter of 2010. This increase reflects a non-core charge of $0.12 per share related to federal health care legislation recorded during the first quarter of 2010. Core earnings were $0.68 per share for the first quarter of 2011 compared to $0.62 per share in the same quarter last year. The increase in core earnings was primarily due to rate base growth.
EMG's first quarter 2011 basic losses were $(0.06) per share compared to earnings of $0.24 per share in the first quarter of 2010. Core losses were $(0.05) per share compared to core earnings of $0.22 per share in the same quarter last year. The decline in results was driven by lower generation, realized energy prices and trading revenue. In addition, EMG recorded income from two projects of $0.06 per share in the first quarter of 2010 without comparable amounts in 2011.
Edison International parent company and other losses were $(0.01) per share in the first quarter of 2011, compared to losses of $(0.02) per share in the first quarter of 2010.
Note: Basic earnings (losses) per share refer to basic earnings (losses) per common share attributable to Edison International throughout this release. Core earnings (losses) is a non-GAAP financial measure. See Reconciliation of Core Earnings to Basic Earnings and Reconciliation of Core Earnings Per Share Guidance to Revised Basic Earnings Per Share Guidance.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States and represent the company's earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management uses core earnings (losses) and earnings (losses) per share (EPS) by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. We also use core earnings (losses) and EPS by principal operating subsidiary when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook to facilitate comparisons of the Company's performance from period to period.
Core earnings (losses) is a non-GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Core earnings and core earnings per share are defined as GAAP earnings and GAAP earnings per share excluding income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings. GAAP earnings refer to net income attributable to Edison International common shareholders and Edison International GAAP earnings per share refers to basic earnings per common share attributable to Edison International common shareholders. Core earnings are reconciled to basic earnings in the attached tables. EPS by principal operating subsidiary is based on the principal operating subsidiaries' net income (loss) attributable to the common shareholders of each operating subsidiary, respectively, and Edison International's weighted average outstanding common shares. The impact of participating securities (vested stock options that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for each principal operating subsidiary is not material to each principal operating subsidiary's EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which we refer to as EIX parent company and other. EIX core EPS and core EPS by principal operating subsidiary are reconciled to basic EPS.

1 The above hedge positions include forward contracts for the sale of power and futures contracts during different periods of the year and the day. Market prices tend to be higher during on-peak periods and during summer months, although there is significant variability of power prices during different periods of time. Accordingly, the above hedge positions are not directly comparable to the 24-hour Northern Illinois Hub or PJM West Hub prices set forth above.
2 Includes hedging transactions primarily at the PJM West Hub and to a lesser extent at other trading locations. Years 2011 and 2012 include hedging activities entered into by EMMT for the Homer City plant that are not designated under the intercompany agreements with Homer City due to limitations under the sale leaseback transaction documents.
3 The average price/MWh includes 182 to 191 MW of capacity for periods ranging from April 1, 2011 to May 31, 2012 at Homer City sold in conjunction with load requirements services contracts.

SCE 2012 CPUC General Rate Case
Application filed November 23, 2010 requesting a 2012 revenue requirement of $6.3 billion
On April 28, 2011, SCE submitted an update of its 2012 GRC application primarily to reflect bonus depreciation deductions under the 2010 Tax Relief Act
Revenue requirement reduced by $38 million, $133 million, and $145 million for 2012, 2013, and 2014, respectively
SCE's revised request, after considering the effects of sales growth, would result in an incremental customer rate increase of $828 million in 2012 and post test year1 increases of $152 million in 2013 and $514 million in 2014
GRC sets base revenue requirement for 2012-2014

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States and represent the company's earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management uses core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. We also use core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook, to facilitate the company's performance from period to period.
 
Core earnings is a Non-GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Core earnings and core earnings per share are defined as GAAP earnings and basic earnings per share excluding income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings. GAAP earnings refer to net income attributable to Edison International common shareholders or attributable to the common shareholders of each subsidiary. EPS by principal operating subsidiary is based on the principal operating subsidiaries' net income attributable to the common shareholders of each subsidiary, respectively, and Edison International's weighted average outstanding common shares. The impact of participating securities (vested stock options that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for each principal operating subsidiary is not material to each principal operating subsidiary's EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which we refer to as EIX parent company and other.
EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA includes production tax credits from EMG's wind projects and excludes amounts from gain on the sale of assets, loss on early extinguishment of debt and leases, and impairment of assets and investments. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA as an important financial measure for evaluating EMG.
The average realized energy price and average realized fuel cost is a non-GAAP performance measure since such statistical measures exclude unrealized gains or losses recorded as operating revenues and unrealized gains or losses recorded as fuel expenses. Management believes that the average realized energy price and average realized fuel cost is more meaningful for investors as it reflects the impact of hedge contracts at the time of actual generation in period-over-period comparisons or as compared to real-time market prices.
A reconciliation of Non-GAAP information to GAAP information, including the impact of participating securities, is included either on the slide where the information appears or on another slide referenced in this presentation.
