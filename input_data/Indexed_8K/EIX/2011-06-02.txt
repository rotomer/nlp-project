SCE Rates and Bills Comparison
2009 Average Residential Rates1 (/kWh)
11.9 U.S. Average
29% Higher
15.3 SCE
2009 Average Residential Bills1 ($ per Month)
101 U.S. Average
12% Lower
90 SCE
Key Factors
 -  SCE's residential rates are above national average due, in part, to
Cleaner fuel mix - costs for renewables are higher than high carbon sources; and
Rate design
 -  Average monthly residential bills are lower than national average
High rate levels offset by significantly lower average customer usage
31% lower residential usage than national average, due to a combination of factors including relatively mild climate and higher efficiency building standards
 -  Public policy mandates (33% RPS, AB32 GHG, Once-through Cooling) and electric system requirements will drive rates and bills higher

SCE 2012 CPUC General Rate Case
 -  Application filed November 23, 2010 to set base revenue requirement for 2012-2014
Rate increase driven by system reliability, load growth, capital-related projects, and IT
 -  On April 28, 2011, SCE submitted an updated application primarily to reflect bonus depreciation
Updated application, net of effects of sales growth, would result in revenue requirement increase of $828 million in 2012, $152 million in 2013, and $514 million in 2014
Excludes fuel and purchased power costs and transmission projects under FERC jurisdiction
Cost of Capital determined in separate proceeding
 -  DRA testimony received on May 11, 2011  recommended increase materially lower than SCE's updated request

California Renewable Policy
 -  On April 12, 2011, Governor Brown signed SB2x, which codifies a 33% renewables portfolio standard for California
Allows use of Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) for up to 25% of target with decreasing percentages over time
Applies similar RPS rules to all electricity providers (investor- and publicly-owned utilities, as well as Electric Service Providers)
Allows for self-build, utility-owned generation for up to 16.5% of retail sales approved by CPUC
 -  SCE's actual 2010 renewable resources represented 14.5 billion kWh, or 19.4% of SCE's portfolio
 -  SCE's focus is to build transmission facilities to interconnect renewable resources

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States and represent the company's earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management uses core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. We also use core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook, to facilitate the company's performance from period to period.
Core earnings is a Non-GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Core earnings and core earnings per share are defined as GAAP earnings and basic earnings per share excluding income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings. GAAP earnings refer to net income attributable to Edison International common shareholders or attributable to the common shareholders of each subsidiary. EPS by principal operating subsidiary is based on the principal operating subsidiaries' net income attributable to the common shareholders of each subsidiary, respectively, and Edison International's weighted average outstanding common shares. The impact of participating securities (vested stock options that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for each principal operating subsidiary is not material to each principal operating subsidiary's EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which we refer to as EIX parent company and other.
A reconciliation of Non-GAAP information to GAAP information, including the impact of participating securities, is included either on the slide where the information appears or on another slide referenced in this presentation.
