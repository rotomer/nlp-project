Exhibit 99.1
 
ROSEMEAD, Calif., August 4, 2011  Edison International (NYSE: EIX) today reported second quarter 2011 basic earnings of $0.54 per share, compared to $1.05 per share in the same quarter last year. The second quarter of 2010 included a gain of $0.43 per share related to a tax settlement. The impacts of the settlement, including state taxes and related lease terminations, were non-core items in the company's quarterly and year-to-date results.
Excluding non-core items and discontinued operations, core earnings in the second quarter of 2011 were $0.54 per share compared to $0.62 per share in the second quarter of 2010. Core earnings declined primarily due to lower income at Southern California Edison (SCE) as rate base growth was more than offset by tax benefits recorded in the second quarter of 2010 from a change in tax accounting.
"Our second quarter and year-to-date earnings performance is fully consistent with our 2011 earnings guidance," said Ted Craver, chairman and chief executive officer of Edison International, "and we now see full-year 2011 earnings at the high end of our guidance range."
Second Quarter Earnings Detail
SCE's second quarter 2011 basic earnings were $0.65 per share compared to $0.92 per share in the second quarter last year. Second quarter 2011 core earnings were $0.65 per share compared to $0.75 per share in the prior-year period. Core earnings decreased as rate base growth was more than offset by a $0.12 per share benefit in the second quarter of 2010 from a change in tax accounting for asset removal costs primarily related to SCE's infrastructure replacement program.
 
Note: GAAP earnings and losses refer to net income or losses attributable to Edison International throughout this release. Core earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure. See Reconciliation of Core Earnings to GAAP Earnings and Reconciliation of Core Earnings Per Share Guidance to Basic Earnings Per Share Guidance.

EMG's second quarter 2011 basic losses were $(0.09) per share compared to basic earnings of $0.08 per share in the second quarter of 2010. Core losses were $(0.09) per share compared to core losses of $(0.10) per share in the second quarter of 2010. Comparisons reflect higher trading revenue and a project distribution, which were largely offset by lower realized energy prices and higher plant maintenance and outage costs.
Edison International parent company and other second quarter 2011 basic losses were $(0.02) per share compared to basic earnings of $0.05 per share in the prior-year period. Core losses were $(0.02) per share in the second quarter of 2011 compared to core losses of $(0.03) per share in the second quarter of 2010. Non-core items in the second quarter of 2010 included tax settlement impacts at Edison International as well as SCE and EMG.
Year-to-Date Earnings Summary
Edison International reported basic earnings of $1.15 per share for the six-month period ending June 30, 2011, compared to $1.77 per share for the same period last year. Core earnings for the first six months of 2011 were $1.16 per share compared to $1.44 per share for the first half of 2010.
Year-to-Date Earnings Detail
SCE's basic earnings were $1.33 per share compared to $1.43 per share for the same period last year. Core earnings were $1.33 per share compared to $1.38 per share in the same period of 2010. Core earnings decreased as rate base growth was more than offset by higher income tax expense reflecting the 2010 change in tax accounting.
EMG's basic losses were $(0.16) per share compared to basic earnings of $0.32 per share in the prior-year period. Core losses were $(0.15) per share compared to core earnings of $0.12 per share in the first half of 2010. The decrease in core earnings reflects Homer City outages, lower realized energy prices, and higher plant maintenance costs.
Edison International parent company and other basic losses in the first half of 2011 were $(0.02) per share compared to basic earnings of $0.02 per share in the first half of 2010. Core losses were $(0.02) per share in the 2011 period compared to core losses of $(0.06) in the 2010 period. Non-core items in the 2010 period included tax settlement impacts at Edison International as well as SCE and EMG.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States and represent the company's earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management uses core earnings and core earnings per share (core EPS) by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. We also use core earnings and core EPS by principal operating subsidiary when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook to facilitate comparisons of the Company's performance from period to period. Financial measures referred to net income, basic EPS, core earnings, or core EPS also applies to the description of losses or losses per share.
Core earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Core earnings and core EPS are defined as GAAP earnings and basic EPS excluding income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings. GAAP earnings refer to net income attributable to Edison International common shareholders or attributable to the common shareholders of each subsidiary. Core earnings are reconciled to GAAP earnings in the attached tables. EPS by principal operating subsidiary is based on the principal operating subsidiaries' net income attributable to the common shareholders of each operating subsidiary, respectively, and Edison International's weighted average outstanding common shares. The impact of participating securities (vested stock options that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for each principal operating subsidiary is not material to each principal operating subsidiary's EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which we refer to as EIX parent company and other. EIX core EPS and core EPS by principal operating subsidiary are reconciled to basic EPS.

1 Net change from Q1 in GWh for 2011 includes 1,682 GWh and 1,054 GWh of new hedges at Midwest Generation and Homer City, respectively.
2 The above hedge positions include forward contracts for the sale of power and futures contracts during different periods of the year and the day. Market prices tend to be higher during on-peak periods and during summer months, although there is significant variability of power prices during different periods of time. Accordingly, the above hedge positions are not directly comparable to the 24-hour Northern Illinois Hub or PJM West Hub prices set forth above.
3 Includes hedging transactions primarily at the Northern Illinois Hub and to a lesser extent the AEP/Dayton and Cinergy Hubs.
4 Includes hedging transactions primarily at the PJM West Hub and to a lesser extent at other trading locations. Years 2011 and 2012 include hedging activities entered into by EMMT for the Homer City plant that are not designated under the intercompany agreements with Homer City due to limitations under the sale leaseback transaction documents.
5 The average price/MWh includes 175 MW of capacity for periods ranging from July 1, 2011 to May 31, 2012 at Homer City sold in conjunction with load requirements services contracts.
6 In July 2011, Midwest Generation entered into additional coal purchase agreements of 0.5 million tons for the remainder of 2011, 2.0 million tons for 2012, 9.8 million tons for 2013, and 9.8 million tons for 2014.

SCE 2012 CPUC General Rate Case
 -  Application filed November 23, 2010 to set base revenue requirement for 2012-2014
Rate increase driven by system reliability, load growth, capital-related projects, and IT
Excludes fuel and purchased power costs, and transmission projects under FERC jurisdiction
Cost of Capital determined in separate proceeding
 -  On April 28, 2011, SCE submitted updated testimony primarily to reflect bonus depreciation
 -  DRA testimony received May 11, 2011; Intervenors' testimony received June 1, 2011
DRA and Intervenors proposed significant adjustments to SCE's request
 -  On July 5, 2011, SCE submitted rebuttal testimony
Updated testimony, net of effects of sales growth, would result in revenue requirement increase of $794 million in 2012, $155 million in 2013, and $515 million in 2014

Percent reduction requirement is based on mercury concentration in coal before and after treatment system. 2010 percent reduction is across all units, including Waukegan 7 and Will County 3, which will require particulate removal upgrades to meet fleet-wide emission and unit-specific requirements.
