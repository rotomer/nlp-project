ROSEMEAD, Calif., Nov. 2, 2011  Edison International (NYSE: EIX) today reported third quarter 2011 basic earnings of $1.31 per share compared to $1.56 per share in the same quarter last year. Results for the 2010 period included a non-core earnings benefit relating to the California impact of a federal tax settlement. Excluding the non-core item and discontinued operations, third quarter 2011 core earnings were $1.31 per share compared to $1.46 per share in the third quarter of 2010. Higher Southern California Edison (SCE) core earnings were more than offset by lower results at Edison Mission Group (EMG).
 
"We are pleased that our third quarter financial results are consistent with delivering 2011 earnings at the high end of our guidance range," said Ted Craver, chairman and chief executive officer of Edison International. "Based on our improved outlook across the company, we have increased our 2011 core earnings guidance to a range of $2.90 to $3.00 per share."
Third Quarter Earnings Detail
SCE's third quarter 2011 basic earnings were $1.25 per share compared to $1.21 per share in the third quarter of 2010. Core earnings were $1.25 per share compared to $1.08 per share in the same quarter last year. Core earnings increased primarily due to rate base growth and lower income taxes.
 
 
 
 
Note: GAAP earnings and losses refer to net income or losses attributable to Edison International throughout this release. Core earnings are a non-GAAP financial measure. See Reconciliation of Core Earnings to GAAP Earnings and Reconciliation of Core Earnings Per Share Guidance to Basic Earnings Per Share Guidance.

EMG's third quarter 2011 basic earnings were $0.10 per share compared to $0.34 per share in the third quarter of 2010. Core earnings were $0.10 per share compared to $0.37 per share in the same quarter last year. 2011 results were due to lower capacity revenues, realized energy prices, merchant coal plant generation, and trading income, as well as lower capacity factors from renewable projects. Prior period results also included a gain from the sale of bankruptcy claims.
 
Edison International parent company and other reported third quarter 2011 basic and core losses of $(0.04) per share. Third quarter 2010 basic and core earnings were $0.01 per share reflecting income tax benefits recorded during this period.
 
Year-to-Date Earnings Summary
 
Edison International reported basic earnings of $2.46 per share for the nine-month period ending September 30, 2011, compared to $3.33 per share for the same period last year. Core earnings for the first nine months of 2011 were $2.47 per share compared to $2.90 per share for the same period in 2010. Non-core items included a $(0.01) per share loss in the 2011 period compared to a $0.43 per share benefit in the 2010 period, primarily related to tax settlements and the impact of health care legislation.
 
Year-to-Date Earnings Detail
 
SCE's year-to-date basic earnings through September 30, 2011, were $2.57 per share compared to $2.63 per share in the same period last year. Core earnings for the first nine months of 2011 were $2.57 per share compared to $2.45 per share for the same period in 2010. The year-to-date increase was due to rate base growth partially offset by higher income tax expense, including a $0.12 per share benefit in the second quarter of 2010 from a change in tax accounting for asset removal costs primarily related to SCE's infrastructure replacement program. Non-core items in the 2010 period included a $0.30 per share benefit from tax settlements and a $0.12 per share charge related to the tax impact of health care legislation.
 
EMG's year-to-date basic losses were $(0.05) per share compared to $0.66 per share earnings in the same period last year. Year-to-date core losses were $(0.04) per share compared to earnings of $0.49 per share in the 2010 period.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
        Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles used in the United States and represent the company's earnings as reported to the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management uses core earnings and core earnings per
share (core EPS) by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis
of performance. We also use core earnings and core EPS by principal operating subsidiary when
communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook to facilitate
comparisons of the Company's performance from period to period. Financial measures referred to
net income, basic EPS, core earnings, or core EPS also applies to the description of losses or losses per share.
 
        Core earnings are a non-GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Core earnings and core EPS are defined as GAAP earnings and basic EPS excluding income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings. GAAP earnings refer to net income attributable to Edison International common shareholders or attributable to the common shareholders of each subsidiary. Core earnings are reconciled to GAAP earnings in the attached tables. EPS by principal operating subsidiary is based on the principal operating subsidiaries' net income attributable to the common shareholders of each operating subsidiary, respectively, and Edison International's weighted average outstanding common shares. The impact of participating securities (vested stock options that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for each principal operating subsidiary is not material to each principal operating subsidiary's EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which we refer to as EIX parent company and other. EIX core EPS and core EPS by principal operating subsidiary are reconciled to basic EPS.

Recent Developments
 -  In October 2011, SCE submitted updated 2012 GRC testimony to reflect changes in escalation rates and known changes due to governmental action, which changed the requested 2012 base revenue requirement to $6.3 billion.
 -  SCE's cost of capital mechanism did not trigger an annual adjustment, therefore the 11.5% authorized rate of return on equity will remain in effect through 2012.
 -  FERC 2012 Formula Rates:
In September 2011, SCE reduced its forecasted 2012 transmission revenue requirement for the lower FERC-ordered ROE and applied for rehearing of its ROE.
In October 2011, FERC rejected SCE's request for rehearing of the ROE. SCE is evaluating and must decide by December 2011 whether to appeal the FERC order at the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.

Transmission expenditures needed to improve system reliability and increase access to renewable energy
1 FERC jurisdictional assets only. Subject to timely receipt of permitting, licensing, and regulatory approvals.
2 Segments 1-3A were energized and in-service in 2009. The remainder is under construction and will be placed in-service under a phased approach from 2011 through 2015.
3 SCE is currently completing the final engineering design for the Tehachapi Transmission Project and anticipates an increase in its 2011-2014 expenditures for the project as a result of cost pressures associated with engineering design and scope changes, environmental mitigation work, and regulatory and permit delays. The project may be further impacted by the CPUC's response to SCE's petition to modify the 2009 decision approving the project for the purpose of obtaining authorization to install aviation marking and lighting. In October 2011, the CPUC staff notified SCE that the constructed portions of the project could be marked and lighted as required, but instructed SCE to defer completion of remaining project components that may require aviation marking or lighting pending CPUC review of the petition to modify. Community opposition to portions of the project continues and requests for reconsideration of the CPUC's 2009 decision are pending. Once final engineering is complete, SCE will file a revised cost estimate with the CPUC. As with all transmission investments, cost recovery will be subject to future rate proceedings.
4 Project was approved at $411 million with reduced contingency by the CPUC. SCE has the ability to file an updated cost with final engineering at a later date.
5 Includes new transmission projects to connect renewable generation and projects related to reliability, load growth, infrastructure replacement, and grid monitoring and control.
