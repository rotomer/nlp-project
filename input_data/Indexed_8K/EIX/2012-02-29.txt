Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
ROSEMEAD, Calif., Feb. 29, 2012  Edison International (NYSE: EIX) today reported fourth quarter 2011 basic losses of $(2.57) per share, compared to basic earnings of $0.51 per share in the same quarter last year. Fourth quarter 2011 core earnings were $0.75 per share, compared to core earnings of $0.58 per share in the fourth quarter of 2010. Higher fourth quarter core earnings at Southern California Edison (SCE) were partially offset by losses at EMG driven by lower energy prices, capacity prices, and generation.
For 2011, the company reported basic losses of $(0.11) per share compared to basic earnings of $3.84 per share in 2010, while core earnings for 2011 decreased 7 percent to $3.22 per share compared to $3.48 per share in 2010. The increase in core earnings at SCE was more than offset by losses at EMG driven by lower energy prices, capacity prices, and generation.
"For 2011, Edison International posted core earnings above its earnings guidance range and above Street consensus, although we reported a full-year loss due to impairment charges at our competitive generation subsidiary, EMG," said Ted Craver, chairman and chief executive officer of Edison International. "Southern California Edison continued to contribute strong earnings growth from its ongoing capital investment program. Given the challenging market conditions facing EMG, we have taken important steps at EMG to preserve and enhance liquidity."
Note: GAAP earnings and losses refer to net income or losses attributable to Edison International throughout this release. Core earnings are a non-GAAP financial measure. See Reconciliation of Core Earnings to GAAP Earnings and Reconciliation of Core Earnings Per Share Guidance to Basic Earnings Per Share Guidance.

Fourth Quarter Earnings Detail
SCE's fourth quarter 2011 basic and core earnings were $0.76 per share compared to $0.56 per share in the fourth quarter of 2010. Core earnings increased primarily due to rate base growth and also included a $0.09 per share benefit related to cumulative changes to deferred income taxes.
EMG's fourth quarter 2011 basic losses were $(3.29) per share compared to earnings of $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter of 2010. Core losses were $(0.03) per share compared to earnings of $0.10 per share in the same quarter last year. Core losses resulted from lower capacity revenues, realized energy prices, and generation, and higher interest expense, partially offset by higher trading and renewables project income. Fourth quarter 2011 results included the following non-core items: impairment charges for Homer City, three Midwest Generation facilities, and certain wind assets, charges resulting from reduced wind development activity, and charges from the write-off of an American Airlines aircraft lease receivable. Also included was a benefit related to the prior March Point sale. Fourth quarter 2010 results included a non-core charge related to the write-off of capitalized costs at Midwest Generation.
The Homer City impairment charge reflects EMG's expectation that it is likely to lose substantially all beneficial economic interest in Homer City as a result of an inability to secure third-party financing of environmental controls and the current process underway to transfer Homer City to the owner-lessors. Reflecting low power prices and required retrofits which are less economical for some smaller coal-fired generation stations, EMG decided to shut down Midwest Generation's Fisk by the end of 2012 and Crawford by the end of 2014. It also concluded it was less likely to retrofit Waukegan than the remaining larger stations, though no final decision has been made. These decisions resulted in impairments of all three Midwest Generation stations.
Edison International parent company and other reported a fourth quarter 2011 basic loss of $(0.04) per share compared to a $(0.08) per share basic loss in the same quarter last year. Core earnings were $0.02 per share in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to core losses of $(0.08) per share in the fourth quarter of 2010. Non-core charges in the fourth quarter of 2011 included a $(0.06) per share consolidated deferred tax adjustment related to EMG asset impairments.
Full-Year Earnings Detail
SCE's basic earnings in 2011 were $3.33 per share compared to $3.19 per share in 2010. Core earnings were $3.33 per share compared to $3.01 per share in 2010. The increase in core earnings was primarily driven by rate base growth.
EMG's basic losses in 2011 were $(3.34) per share compared to earnings of $0.69 per share in 2010. Core losses were $(0.07) per share compared to earnings of $0.59 per share in 2010. EMG's core losses were driven by lower average realized energy prices, capacity prices, and generation for the merchant coal plants, higher interest expense, and lower trading revenue. Losses were partially offset by an increase in renewable project income. Non-core items in 2011 included the fourth quarter non-core items discussed above together with impacts from discontinued operations. Non-core items in 2010 included benefits from tax settlements and discontinued operations, and a charge from the write-off of capitalized costs.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States and represent the company's earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management uses core earnings and core earnings per share (core EPS) by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. We also use core earnings and core EPS by principal operating subsidiary when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook to facilitate comparisons of the Company's performance from period to period. Financial measures referred to net income, basic EPS, core earnings, or core EPS also applies to the description of losses or losses per share.
Core earnings are a non-GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Core earnings and core EPS are defined as GAAP earnings and basic EPS excluding income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings. GAAP earnings refer to net income attributable to Edison International common shareholders or attributable to the common shareholders of each subsidiary. Core earnings are reconciled to GAAP earnings in the attached tables. EPS by principal operating subsidiary is based on the principal operating subsidiaries' net income attributable to the common shareholders of each operating subsidiary, respectively, and Edison International's weighted average outstanding common shares. The impact of participating securities (vested stock options that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for each principal operating subsidiary is not material to each principal operating subsidiary's EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which we refer to as EIX parent company and other. EIX core EPS and core EPS by principal operating subsidiary are reconciled to basic EPS.
About Asset Impairment Charges
Long-lived assets, including intangible assets, are evaluated for impairment in accordance with applicable authoritative guidance. Authoritative guidance requires that if the undiscounted expected future cash flow from a company's assets or group of assets (without interest charges) is less than its carrying value, asset impairment must be recognized on the financial statements. The impairment charges, if applicable, are calculated as the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value, which represents the discounted expected future cash flows attributable to the asset or, in the case of assets expected to be sold, at fair value less costs to sell. Long-lived assets for impairment are evaluated whenever indicators of impairment exist or when there is a commitment to sell or dispose of the asset. These evaluations may result from significant decreases in the market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used in its physical condition, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset, as well as economic or operational analyses.

SCE 2012 CPUC General Rate Case
Leading the Way in Electricity SM
Application filed November 23, 2010 to set base revenue requirement for 2012-2014
Rate increase driven by system reliability, load growth, capital-related expense, and technology needs
Excludes fuel and purchased power costs, and transmission projects under FERC jurisdiction
Cost of capital determined in separate proceeding
SCE's current request based on October 24 update testimony: Revenue Requirement increase of $809 million in 2012, $117 million in 2013, and $513 million in 2014, net of sales growth
The Division of Ratepayer Advocates (DRA) recommends a decrease in 2012 revenue requirement of approximately $850 million
$630 million operation and maintenance expense reductions
$220 million capital-related revenue requirement reductions
The Utility Reform Network and other interveners recommend an additional $610 million reduction beyond DRA adjustments, primarily capital-related in nature
Public participation hearing held January 26 on SCE's response to the December 1 windstorm
Proposed decision pending
Final decision is retroactive to January 1, 2012, through memorandum account

SCE Cost of Capital Mechanism
Moody's Baa Utility Index - 12-month moving average and spot rate through 2/15/12
Starting Index = 6.26% Moody's Baa Utility Index Spot Rate Moving Average (since October 1, 2011 = 5.07%)
Feb-08 Feb-09 Feb-10 Feb-11 Feb-12
Since 2008, SCE's CPUC authorized ROE has been 11.5%. The CPUC's mechanism sets Return on Equity (ROE) annually through end of 2012
ROE adjustment based on 12-month average of Moody's Baa utility bond index, measured in September of each year
If index exceeds a 1% deadband from starting index value of 6.26%, authorized ROE changes by half the difference
Moving average was 5.76% for final period ending 9/30/11; 2012 ROE will continue at 11.5% through year- end (mechanism not operative for 2013)
By April 20, 2012, SCE will submit an application to the CPUC for its 2013 Cost of Capital and authorized ROE

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States and represent the company's earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management uses core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. We also use core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook, to facilitate the company's performance from period to period.
Core earnings is a Non-GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Core earnings and core earnings per share are defined as GAAP earnings and basic earnings per share excluding income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings. GAAP earnings refer to net income attributable to Edison International common shareholders or attributable to the common shareholders of each subsidiary. EPS by principal operating subsidiary is based on the principal operating subsidiaries' net income attributable to the common shareholders of each subsidiary, respectively and Edison International's weighted average shares respectively, International s outstanding common shares. The impact of participating securities (vested stock options that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for each principal operating subsidiary is not material to each principal operating subsidiary's EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which we refer to as EIX parent company and other.
EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA includes production tax credits from EMG's wind projects and excludes amounts from gain on the sale of assets, loss on early extinguishment of debt and leases, and impairment of assets and investments. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA as an important financial measure for evaluating EMG.
The average realized energy price and average realized fuel cost is a non-GAAP performance measure since such statistical measures exclude unrealized gains or losses recorded as operating revenues and unrealized gains or losses recorded as fuel expenses. Management believes that the average realized energy price and average realized fuel cost is more meaningful for investors as it reflects the impact of hedge contracts at the time of actual generation in period-overperiod comparisons or as compared to real-time market prices.
A reconciliation of Non-GAAP information to GAAP information, including the impact of participating securities, is included either on the slide where the information appears or on another slide referenced in this presentation.

Exhibit 99.3
Today, Edison International reported fourth quarter core earnings of $0.75 per share and full-year core earnings of $3.22 per share. We are pleased that our fourth-quarter results have allowed us to deliver 2011 core earnings well above the high end of our guidance range. Southern California Edison, Edison Mission Group and the Parent Company all contributed to out-performing the earnings guidance. Of particular note, Southern California Edison's core earnings increased 20 cents in the quarter and 32 cents for the full year due to rate base growth and a favorable tax adjustment that Jim will discuss.
Typically at this time of the year we provide earnings guidance for the coming year. However, we will not be providing 2012 guidance until we receive a final decision in SCE's General Rate Case, which we hope will be in the first half of 2012. In the absence of specific earnings guidance, Jim will discuss some of the key drivers to our 2012 earnings in his remarks.
On a reported basis, we showed a loss for the full-year of 11 cents per share, due primarily to impairment charges at EMG. These impairment charges are largely the result of a sharp decline in power prices, combined with the need for substantial investment in retrofits to our coal fleet to comply with environmental regulations. I'll say more about those charges later, during my remarks about EMG.
Let me begin by covering some recent developments at Southern California Edison.
First, let me provide a brief update on the timing of Southern California Edison's 2012 General Rate Case. As of now, we don't have a timeline for when we will get a final decision, although we hope it will be in the first half of this year. The Commission is aware of the need for a timely GRC decision, and we expect a Proposed Decision will be forthcoming shortly. But it is also important to remember that the final decision will be retroactive to January 1.
Our value proposition at Southern California Edison is driven by growth in capital investment, which is expected to result in average annual growth in rate base growth of 7 to 9% through 2014. This growth is largely driven by California policy mandates as well as infrastructure replacement to ensure public safety and reliability. Over the last five years, SCE has delivered compound annual growth in rate base of 11 percent, and its core earnings have increased at a 12 percent compound annual growth rate.
One large component of SCE's capital program is investment in transmission to connect renewable generators, such as the Tehachapi and Devers-Colorado River projects. At these projects, we are seeing higher costs to mitigate various environmental impacts, and from permitting delays. These additional costs are included in SCE's updated capital spending forecast.
 
I would also like to provide an update on the outage work taking place at our San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, or what we refer to as SONGS. Unit 2 is off-line for a planned refueling outage, and we took Unit 3 off line on January 31 to inspect a water leak in its steam generator. The steam generators in Unit 2 were replaced in 2010, and Unit 3's were replaced in 2011. Our planned inspections of the steam generators in Unit 2 found isolated areas of wear in some of the heat transfer tubes. We are in the process of preventively removing tubes from service as prescribed by industry guidelines and well within design margins for this kind of repair activity. We are still conducting a battery of tests and performing a root cause evaluation on the Unit 3 tube water leak. SCE is committed to the safe operation of SONGS and, of course, will not return the plant's generating units to service until we are entirely satisfied it is completely safe to do so.
The final update I will provide on SCE is that this year it will complete the installation of 5 million smart meters in a $1.2 billion infrastructure capital investment. There were 3.8 million meters installed by the end of last year, and the program is on schedule and on budget. As the system is rolled-out, SCE is developing programs that provide customers with enhanced information and services on their energy usage, while providing us with new tools to better manage outages. We continue to see opportunities for this investment to enhance our customer service platform by facilitating energy efficiency and providing the ability to integrate customer's smart appliances and devices within the home.
Let me now turn to Edison Mission Group. We continue to believe that a dual platform of regulated and competitive businesses best positions our company for the transformative change we believe will sweep across the electric power industry. For the last 18 months, we have been focused on unlocking the option value at EMG by reducing and extending the timeline for required capital investments and creating new liquidity to provide additional time for a recovery in power and capacity prices. However, power prices have not recovered. Indeed, their deterioration accelerated in late 2011 and early 2012. Additionally, EMG's liquidity has been reduced in the near-term by losing its ability to monetize its tax losses until at least 2013, primarily because the federal stimulus programand especially the enactment of 50%, and then 100%, deductibility of "bonus" depreciationhas created Net Operating Losses in the consolidated EIX tax group. These two factors have added to EMG's stressed condition.
The efforts to stabilize EMG continue, focusing on cost-effectively meeting its environmental requirements, reducing its unsecured debt, and diversifying its generation portfolio with additional natural gas and renewable generation. Ultimately, the test will be the ability to generate sufficient cash flows such that it can refinance a sustainable portion of its unsecured debt. If current power market conditions persist, EMG expects to incur further reductions in cash flow and earnings losses in 2012 and beyond. Current conditions, coupled with pending debt maturities and retrofit investments, will strain EMG's liquidity such that it may need to divest assets and restructure or reorganize its capital structure to get through this period to see if option value is indeed there.
We have repeatedly said that EIX will be financially disciplined and not invest new funds into EMG unless we can see a clear and compelling path to obtaining both a return of and on any investment. In the face of deteriorating financial conditions at EMG, we reaffirm that pledge.
 
EMG will likewise maintain its financial discipline, and the impairments being announced today reflect this, as they reflect the decision not to invest, or the reduced likelihood of investing, in retrofits at certain coal plants. The $623 million after-tax impairment charge at Homer City reflects the assessment that EMG is not going to control this investment going forward due to the inability to attract outside investment for the Homer City retrofits under its current financial structure and current market conditions. We are working with the owner-lessors to transition control of Homer City over to them subject to their discussions with their bondholders. Today, we also announced a $386 million after-tax impairment charge on three of our Midwest Generation plants: Fisk, Crawford, and Waukegan. We have also reached the conclusion that it is not economic to continue operating Fisk beyond 2012 or Crawford beyond 2014. We retain flexibility on the decision whether to retrofit Waukegan, since we don't have to make major capital commitments there for a while.
With the challenging market environment facing EMG, the primary focus is to preserve and enhance liquidity, and seek a sustainable capital structure. While the impairments reflect deteriorating conditions, they also reflect this focus. The reductions in spending at Fisk, Crawford and potentially Waukegan will help liquidity. They also facilitate extending the timeline for deciding on retrofitting the remaining Midwest Generation plants while maintaining full environmental compliance by burning ultra-low sulfur coal. And, while EME terminated its largely undrawn revolver in February, the termination of the revolver has the benefit of freeing up collateral for future debt financing.
Actions in our wind business reflect the focus on preserving and enhancing liquidity as well. First, EMG reduced development spending on its existing wind pipeline and rationalized development and support staff. Second, it continues to project-finance its existing wind portfolio. To this end, during December of last year, EMG closed a $242 million portfolio financing of three contracted wind projects representing 204 megawatts. Third, and perhaps most significantly, a sizable equity financing was completed for EMG's wind developments. On February 13, EMG received a $460 million commitment to facilitate the development of wind projects. This unique structure involves the transfer of three operating EMG wind projects totaling 291 megawatts to a new venture with outside investors. Also, two projects in construction totaling 120 megawatts will be sold to the venture upon their completion. This transaction will net EMG approximately $235 million as the five projects are transferred. It also allows EMG to do additional development of wind projects without consuming its equity capital, while retaining project upside after the investors achieve their targeted return.
Completing these strategic actions results in a more focused EMG, better positioned to weather its challenges. Late last summer, I began saying the next 6 to 12 months would likely be determinative for EMG, and that during that timeframe a number of important issues would need to get resolved. That remains the case. We have important steps we'll continue to address with investors in the coming months as we continue to focus on seeking shareholder value.
