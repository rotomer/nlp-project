Percent reduction requirement is based on mercury concentration in coal before and after treatment system. Reduction is across all units, including Waukegan 7 and Will County 3, which will require particulate removal upgrades to meet fleet-wide emission and unit-specific requirements. Midwest Generation believes that currently installed ACI and particulate removal equipment is sufficient to achieve or exceed the requirements outlined in the final MATS Rule. 3 The estimated cost of retrofitting Joliet Unit 6, if made, would be approximately $75 million, while the estimated cost of retrofitting the Waukegan Station, if made, would be approximately $160 million.

EDISON INTERNATIONAL Leading the Way in Electricity SM March 1, 2012 52 Edison Internationals earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States and represent the companys earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management uses core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. We also use core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook, to facilitate the companys performance from period to period. Core earnings is a Non-GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Core earnings and core earnings per share are defined as GAAP earnings and basic earnings per share excluding income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings. GAAP earnings refer to net income attributable to Edison International common shareholders or attributable to the common shareholders of each subsidiary. EPS by principal operating subsidiary is based on the principal operating subsidiaries net income attributable to the common shareholders of each subsidiary, respectively, and Edison Internationals weighted average outstanding common shares. The impact of participating securities (vested stock options that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for each principal operating subsidiary is not material to each principal operating subsidiarys EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which we refer to as EIX parent company and other. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA includes production tax credits from EMGs wind projects and excludes amounts from gain on the sale of assets, loss on early extinguishment of debt and leases, and impairment of assets and investments. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA as an important financial measure for evaluating EMG. The average realized energy price and average realized fuel cost is a non-GAAP performance measure since such statistical measures exclude unrealized gains or losses recorded as operating revenues and unrealized gains or losses recorded as fuel expenses. Management believes that the average realized energy price and average realized fuel cost is more meaningful for investors as it reflects the impact of hedge contracts at the time of actual generation in period-over- period comparisons or as compared to real-time market prices. A reconciliation of Non-GAAP information to GAAP information, including the impact of participating securities, is included either on the slide where the information appears or on another slide referenced in this presentation.
