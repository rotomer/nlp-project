Edison International Reports First Quarter 2012 Results
ROSEMEAD, Calif., May 2, 2012  Edison International (NYSE: EIX) today reported first quarter 2012 basic earnings of $0.28 per share, compared to basic earnings of $0.61 per share in the same quarter last year. First quarter 2012 core earnings were $0.35 per share, compared to core earnings of $0.65 per share in the first quarter of 2011.
The decrease in earnings primarily related to losses at Edison Mission Groups (EMG) Midwest Generation unit and to a delay in the 2012 rate case decision at Southern California Edison (SCE). SCE incurred higher costs in the quarter to support its ongoing investment programs, but the revenues to support these investment programs are pending a decision from California regulators.
"The timing impact on SCEs first quarter results should correct itself when a final rate case decision is received, said Ted Craver, chairman and chief executive officer of Edison International. "Prospects remain strong for rate base and earnings growth at SCE.
In anticipation of the transfer of EMGs Homer City station to its owner-lessors, results for Homer City are now classified as non-core for both periods.
First Quarter Earnings Detail
SCEs first quarter 2012 basic and core earnings were $0.56 per share compared to $0.68 per share in the first quarter of 2011. The core earnings decrease was primarily due to a delay in the 2012 California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) general rate case decision as higher depreciation and net interest expenses are not being recovered in currently authorized revenue. The revenue requirement ultimately adopted by the CPUC will be retroactive to January 1, 2012. SCE also incurred $0.04 per share of incremental steam generator inspection and repair costs related to outages at the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station that were offset by other operation and maintenance cost reductions.

Note: GAAP earnings and losses refer to net income or losses attributable to Edison International throughout this release. Core earnings are a non-GAAP financial measure. See Reconciliation of Core Earnings to GAAP Earnings and Reconciliation of Core Earnings Per Share Guidance to Basic Earnings Per Share Guidance.

EMGs first quarter 2012 basic losses were $(0.26) per share compared to losses of ($0.06) per share in the first quarter of 2011. Core losses were $(0.19) per share compared to losses of ($0.02) per share in the same quarter last year. 2012 core losses were due to lower generation, average realized energy, and capacity prices, along with higher fuel costs at Midwest Generation. Non-core items for both quarters included the results for Homer City in anticipation of the transfer of Homer City to the owner-lessors.
Edison International parent company and other reported a first quarter 2012 basic and core loss of $(0.02) per share compared to a $(0.01) per share basic and core loss in the same quarter last year.
2012 Earnings Guidance
The company will provide 2012 earnings guidance after SCE has received a final decision on its 2012 General Rate Case from the CPUC. See the risk disclosure statement on page 3 and the financial teleconference presentation accompanying the companys earnings conference call for further information.

Appendix
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Edison Internationals earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States and represent the companys earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management uses core earnings and core earnings per share (core EPS) by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. We also use core earnings and core EPS by principal operating subsidiary when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook to facilitate comparisons of the Companys performance from period to period. Financial measures referred to net income, basic EPS, core earnings, or core EPS also applies to the description of losses or losses per share.
Core earnings are a non-GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Core earnings and core EPS are defined as GAAP earnings and basic EPS excluding income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings. GAAP earnings refer to net income attributable to Edison International common shareholders or attributable to the common shareholders of each subsidiary. Core earnings are reconciled to GAAP earnings in the attached tables. EPS by principal operating subsidiary is based on the principal operating subsidiaries net income attributable to the common shareholders of each operating subsidiary, respectively, and Edison Internationals weighted average outstanding common shares. The impact of participating securities (vested stock options that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for each principal operating subsidiary is not material to each principal operating subsidiarys EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which we refer to as EIX parent company and other. EIX core EPS and core EPS by principal operating subsidiary are reconciled to basic EPS.

EDISON INTERNATIONAL Leading the Way in Electricity SM May 2, 2012 38 Edison Internationals earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States and represent the companys earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management uses core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. We also use core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook, to facilitate the companys performance from period to period. Core earnings is a Non-GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Core earnings and core earnings per share are defined as GAAP earnings and basic earnings per share excluding income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings. GAAP earnings refer to net income attributable to Edison International common shareholders or attributable to the common shareholders of each subsidiary. EPS by principal operating subsidiary is based on the principal operating subsidiaries net income attributable to the common shareholders of each subsidiary, respectively, and Edison Internationals weighted average outstanding common shares. The impact of participating securities (vested stock options that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for each principal operating subsidiary is not material to each principal operating subsidiarys EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which we refer to as EIX parent company and other. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA includes production tax credits from EMGs wind projects and excludes amounts from gain on the sale of assets, loss on early extinguishment of debt and leases, and impairment of assets and investments. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA as an important financial measure for evaluating EMG. The average realized energy price and average realized fuel cost is a non-GAAP performance measure since such statistical measures exclude unrealized gains or losses recorded as operating revenues and unrealized gains or losses recorded as fuel expenses. Management believes that the average realized energy price and average realized fuel cost is more meaningful for investors as it reflects the impact of hedge contracts at the time of actual generation in period-over- period comparisons or as compared to real-time market prices. A reconciliation of Non-GAAP information to GAAP information, including the impact of participating securities, is included either on the slide where the information appears or on another slide referenced in this presentation.
