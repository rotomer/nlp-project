ARTICLE I - PRINCIPAL OFFICE
Section 1.
    
Principal Office.
The principal office of the Corporation is hereby fixed and located at 2244 Walnut Grove Avenue, in the City of Rosemead, County of Los Angeles, State of California. The Board of Directors is hereby granted full power and authority to change said principal office from one location to another.
ARTICLE II - SHAREHOLDERS
Section 1.
    
Meeting Locations.
All meetings of shareholders shall be held at the principal office of the corporation or at such other place or places within or without the State of California as may be designated by the Board of Directors (the "Board") or specified in the notice of the meeting. In the event such places shall prove inadequate in capacity for any meeting of shareholders, an adjournment may be taken to and the meeting held at such other place of adequate capacity as may be designated by the officer of the corporation presiding at such meeting.
Section 2.
    
Annual Meetings.
Annual meetings of shareholders shall be held on the fourth Thursday of the month of April of each year at such time as the Chairman of the Board shall designate on said day to elect directors to hold office for the year next ensuing and until their successors shall be elected, and to consider and act upon such other matters as may lawfully be presented to such meeting; provided, however, that should said day fall upon a legal holiday, then any such annual meeting of shareholders shall be held at such designated time and place on the next day thereafter ensuing which is not a legal holiday.
1
ARTICLE II
Section 3.
    
Special Meetings.
Special meetings of the shareholders may be called at any time by the Board, the Chairman of the Board, the President, or upon written request of any three members of
the Board, or by the holders of shares entitled to cast not less than ten percent of the votes at such meeting. Upon request in writing to the Chairman of the Board, the President, any Vice President or the Secretary by any person (other than the Board) entitled to call a special meeting of shareholders, the officer forthwith shall cause notice to be given to the shareholders entitled to vote that a meeting will be held at a time requested by the person or persons calling the meeting, not less than thirty-five nor more than sixty days after the receipt of the request. If the notice is not given within twenty days after receipt of the request, the persons entitled to call the meeting may give the notice.
Section 4.
    
Notice of Annual or Special Meeting.
Written notice of each annual or special meeting of shareholders shall be given not less than ten (or if sent by third-class mail, thirty) nor more than sixty days before the date of the meeting to each shareholder entitled to vote thereat. Such notice shall state the place, date, and hour of the meeting and (i) in the case of a special meeting, the general nature of the business to be transacted, and no other business may be transacted, or (ii) in the case of an annual meeting, those matters which the Board, at the time of the mailing of the notice, intends to present for action by the shareholders, but, subject to the provisions of applicable law and these Bylaws, any proper matter may be presented at an annual meeting for such action. The notice of any special or annual meeting at which directors are to be elected shall include the names of nominees intended at the time of the notice to be presented by the Board for election. For any matter to be presented by a shareholder at an annual meeting, including the nomination of any person (other than a person nominated by or at the direction of the Board) for election to the Board, written notice must be received by the Secretary of the corporation from the shareholder not more than one hundred eighty days nor less than one hundred twenty days prior to the date on which the proxy materials for the prior year's annual meeting were first released to shareholders by the corporation; provided however, that in the event the annual meeting to which the shareholder's written notice relates is to be held on a date which is more than thirty days earlier or later than the date of the annual meeting specified in these Bylaws, the notice from a shareholder must be received by the Secretary not earlier than two hundred twenty days prior to the date of the annual meeting to which the shareholder's notice relates nor later than one hundred sixty days prior to the date of such annual meeting, unless less than one hundred seventy days' prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting is made by the earliest possible quarterly report on Form 10-Q, or, if impracticable, any means reasonably calculated to inform shareholders including without limitation a report on Form 8-K, a press release or publication once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the principal office is located, in which event
2
ARTICLE II
notice by the shareholder to be timely must be received not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the date of such public disclosure. The shareholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth (a) a brief description of each matter to be presented at the annual meeting by the shareholder; (b) the name and address, as they appear on the corporation's books, of the shareholder; (c) the class and number of shares of the corporation which are beneficially owned by the shareholder; and (d) any material interest of the shareholder in the matters to be presented. Any shareholder who intends to nominate a candidate for election as a director shall also set forth in such a notice (i) the name, age, business address and residence address of each nominee that he or she intends to nominate at the meeting, (ii) the principal occupation or employment of each nominee, (iii) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the corporation beneficially owned by each nominee, and (iv) any other information concerning the nominee that would be required under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission in a proxy statement soliciting proxies for the election of the nominee. The notice shall also include a consent, signed by the shareholder's nominees, to serve as a director of the corporation if elected. Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, and subject to the provisions of any applicable law, no business shall be conducted at a special or annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 4.
Notice of a shareholders' meeting shall be given either personally or by first-class mail (or, if the outstanding shares of the corporation are held of record by 500 or more persons on the record date for the meeting, by third-class mail) or by other means of written communication, addressed to the shareholder at the address of such shareholder appearing on the books of the corporation or given by the shareholder to the corporation for the purpose of notice; or, if no such address appears or is given, at the place where the principal office of the corporation is located or by publication at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the principal office is located. Notice by mail shall be deemed to have been given at the time a written notice is deposited in the United States mails, postage prepaid. Any other written notice shall be deemed to have been given at the time it is personally delivered to the recipient or is delivered to a common carrier for transmission, or actually transmitted by the person giving the notice by electronic means, to the recipient.
Section 5.
    
Quorum.
A majority of the shares entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at any meeting of shareholders. The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented and voting at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present (which shares voting affirmatively also constitute at least a majority of the required quorum) shall be the act of the shareholders, unless the vote of a greater number or voting by classes is required by law or the Articles; provided, however, that the shareholders present at a duly called or held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to do business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to
3
ARTICLE II
have less than a quorum, if any action taken (other than adjournment) is approved by at least a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum.
Section 6.
    
Adjourned Meeting and Notice Thereof.
Any shareholders' meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of a majority of the shares, the holders of which are either present in person or represented by proxy thereat, but in the absence of a quorum (except as provided in Section 5 of this Article) no other business may be transacted at such meeting.
It shall not be necessary to give any notice of the time and place of the adjourned meeting or of the business to be transacted thereat, other than by announcement at the meeting at which such adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting, the corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. However, when any shareholders' meeting is adjourned for more than forty-five days or, if after adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as in the case of an original meeting.
Section 7.
    
Voting.
The shareholders entitled to notice of any meeting or to vote at any such meeting shall be only persons in whose name shares stand on the stock records of the corporation on the record date determined in accordance with Section 8 of this Article.
Voting shall in all cases be subject to the provisions of Chapter 7 of the California General Corporation Law, and to the following provisions:
(a)
    
Subject to clause (g), shares held by an administrator, executor, guardian, conservator or custodian may be voted by such holder either in person or by proxy, without a transfer of such shares into the holder's name; and shares standing in the name of a trustee may be voted by the trustee, either in person or by proxy, but no trustee shall be entitled to vote shares held by such trustee without a transfer of such shares into the trustee's name.
(b)
    
Shares standing in the name of a receiver may be voted by such receiver; and shares held by or under the control of a receiver may be voted by such receiver without the transfer thereof into the receiver's name if authority to do so is contained in the order of the court by which such receiver was appointed.
(c)
    
Subject to the provisions of Section 705 of the California General Corporation Law and except where otherwise agreed in writing between the parties, a shareholder whose shares are pledged shall be entitled to vote such shares until the shares
4
ARTICLE II
have been transferred into the name of the pledgee, and thereafter the pledgee shall be entitled to vote the shares so transferred.
(d)
    
Shares standing in the name of a minor may be voted and the corporation may treat all rights incident thereto as exercisable by the minor, in person or by proxy, whether or not the corporation has notice, actual or constructive, of the non-age unless a guardian of the minor's property has been appointed and written notice of such appointment given to the corporation.
(e)
    
Shares standing in the name of another corporation, domestic or foreign, may be voted by such officer, agent or proxyholder as the bylaws of such other corporation may prescribe or, in the absence of such provision, as the Board of Directors of such other corporation may determine or, in the absence of such determination, by the chairman of the board, president or any vice president of such other corporation, or by any other person authorized to do so by the chairman of the board, president or any vice president of such other corporation. Shares which are purported to be voted or any proxy purported to be executed in the name of a corporation (whether or not any title of the person signing is indicated) shall be presumed to be voted or the proxy executed in accordance with the provisions of this subdivision, unless the contrary is shown.
(f)
    
Shares of the corporation owned by any of its subsidiaries shall not be entitled to vote on any matter.
(g)
    
Shares of the corporation held by the corporation in a fiduciary capacity, and shares of the corporation held in a fiduciary capacity by any of its subsidiaries, shall not be entitled to vote on any matter, except to the extent that the settlor or beneficial owner possesses and exercises a right to vote or to give the corporation binding instructions as to how to vote such shares.
(h)
    
If shares stand of record in the names of two or more persons, whether fiduciaries, members of a partnership, joint tenants, tenants in common, husband and wife as community property, tenants by the entirety, voting trustees, persons entitled to vote under a shareholder voting agreement or otherwise, or if two or more persons (including proxyholders) have the same fiduciary relationship respecting the same shares, unless the secretary of the corporation is given written notice to the contrary and is furnished with a copy of the instrument or order appointing them or creating the relationship wherein it is so provided, their acts with respect to voting shall have the following effect:
5
ARTICLE II
If the instrument so filed or the registration of the shares shows that any such tenancy is held in unequal interests, a majority or even split for the purpose of this section shall be a majority or even split in interest.
No shareholder of any class of stock of this corporation shall be entitled to cumulate votes at any election of directors of this corporation.
Elections for directors need not be by ballot; provided, however, that all elections for directors must be by ballot upon demand made by a shareholder at the meeting and before the voting begins.
In any uncontested election of directors, approval of the shareholders (as defined in Section 153 of the California General Corporation Law) shall be required to elect a director. If an incumbent director fails to be elected by approval of the shareholders in an uncontested election, then, unless the incumbent director has earlier resigned, the term of the incumbent director shall end on the date that is the earlier of 90 days after the date on which the voting results are determined pursuant to Section 707 of the California General Corporation Law or the date on which the Board selects a person to fill the office held by that director in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article III, Section 4 of these Bylaws and Section 305 of the California General Corporation Law.
In any election of directors that is not an uncontested election, the candidates receiving the highest number of affirmative votes of the shares entitled to be voted for them up to the number of directors to be elected by such shares shall be elected, and votes against a director and votes withheld shall have no legal effect.
For purposes of these Bylaws, an uncontested election means an election of directors of this corporation in which the number of candidates for election does not exceed the number of directors to be elected by the shareholders at that election, determined at the expiration of the time fixed under Article II, Section 4 of these Bylaws requiring advance notification of director candidates, or for special meetings of shareholders, at the date notice of the meeting is given or at a time fixed by the Board that is not more than 14 days before notice of the meeting is given.
Section 8.
    
Record Date.
The Board may fix, in advance, a record date for the determination of the shareholders entitled to notice of any meeting or to vote or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution, or any allotment of rights, or to exercise rights in
6
ARTICLE II
respect of any other lawful action. The record date so fixed shall be not more than sixty days nor less than ten days prior to the date of the meeting nor more than sixty days prior to any other action. When a record date is so fixed, only shareholders of record at the close of business on that date are entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting or to receive the dividend, distribution, or allotment of rights, or to exercise the rights, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of shares on the books of the corporation after the record date, except as otherwise provided by law or these Bylaws. A determination of shareholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting unless the Board fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting. The Board shall fix a new record date if the meeting is adjourned for more than forty-five days.
If no record date is fixed by the Board, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders shall be at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. The record date for determining shareholders for any purpose other than as set forth in this Section 8 or Section 10 of this Article shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution relating thereto, or the sixtieth day prior to the date of such other action, whichever is later.
Section 9.
    
Consent of Absentees.
The transactions of any meeting of shareholders, however called and noticed, and wherever held, are as valid as though had at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum is present either in person or by proxy, and if, either before or after the meeting, each of the persons entitled to vote, not present in person or by proxy, signs a written waiver of notice or a consent to the holding of the meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof. All such waivers, consents or approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting. Neither the business to be transacted at nor the purpose of any regular or special meeting of shareholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice, consent to the holding of the meeting or approval of the minutes thereof, except as provided in Section 601 (f) of the California General Corporation Law.
Section 10.
    
Action Without Meeting.
Subject to Section 603 of the California General Corporation Law, any action which, under any provision of the California General Corporation Law, may be taken at any annual or special meeting of shareholders may be taken without a meeting and without prior notice if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding shares having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all
7
ARTICLE II
shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. Unless a record date for voting purposes be fixed as provided in Section 8 of this Article, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to give consent pursuant to this Section 10, when no prior action by the Board has been taken, shall be the day on which the first written consent is given.
Section 11.
    
Proxies.
Every person entitled to vote shares has the right to do so either in person or by one or more persons, not to exceed three, designated by a proxy authorized by such shareholder or the shareholder's attorney in fact and filed with the corporation, in accordance with Section 178 of the California General Corporation Law. Subject to the following sentence, any proxy duly authorized continues in full force and effect until revoked by the person authorizing it prior to the vote pursuant thereto by a writing delivered to the corporation stating that the proxy is revoked or by a subsequent proxy authorized by the person authorizing the prior proxy and presented to the meeting, or by attendance at the meeting and voting in person by the person authorizing the proxy; provided, however, that a proxy is not revoked by the death or incapacity of the maker unless, before the vote is counted, written notice of such death or incapacity is received by this corporation. No proxy shall be valid after the expiration of eleven months from the date of its authorization unless otherwise provided in the proxy.
Section 12.
    
Inspectors of Election.
In advance of any meeting of shareholders, the Board may appoint any persons other than nominees as inspectors of election to act at such meeting and any adjournment thereof. If inspectors of election are not so appointed, or if any persons so appointed fail to appear or refuse to act, the chairman of any such meeting may, and on the request of any shareholder or shareholder's proxy shall, make such appointments at the meeting. The number of inspectors shall be either one or three. If appointed at a meeting on the request of one or more shareholders or proxies, the majority of shares present shall determine whether one or three inspectors are to be appointed.
The duties of such inspectors shall be as prescribed by Section 707 (b) of the California General Corporation Law and shall include: determining the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, the shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, and the authenticity, validity and effect of proxies; receiving votes, ballots or consents; hearing and determining all challenges and questions in any way arising in connection with the right to vote; counting and tabulating all votes or consents; determining when the polls shall close; determining the result; and doing such acts as may be proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all shareholders. If there are three inspectors of election, the decision, act or certificate of a majority is effective in all respects as the decision, act or certificate of all. Any report or certificate made by the inspectors of election is prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.

ARTICLE III - DIRECTORS
Section 1.
    
Powers.
Subject to limitations of the Articles, of these Bylaws and of the California General Corporation Law relating to action required to be approved by the shareholders or by the outstanding shares, the business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed and all corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the direction of the Board. The Board may delegate the management of the day-to-day operation of the business of the corporation provided that the business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed and all corporate powers shall be exercised under the ultimate direction of the Board. Without prejudice to such general powers, but subject to the same limitations, it is hereby expressly declared that the Board shall have the following powers in addition to the other powers enumerated in these Bylaws:
(a)
    
To select and remove all the other officers, agents and employees of the corporation, prescribe the powers and duties for them as may not be inconsistent with law, with the Articles or these Bylaws, fix their compensation and require from them security for faithful service.
(b)
    
To conduct, manage and control the affairs and business of the corporation and to make such rules and regulations therefor not inconsistent with law, or with the Articles or these Bylaws, as they may deem best.
(c)
    
To adopt, make and use a corporate seal, and to prescribe the forms of certificates of stock, and to alter the form of such seal and of such certificates from time to time as in their judgment they may deem best.
(d)
    
To authorize the issuance of shares of stock of the corporation from time to time, upon such terms and for such consideration as may be lawful.
(e)
    
To borrow money and incur indebtedness for the purposes of the corporation, and to cause to be executed and delivered therefor, in the corporate name, promissory notes, bonds, debentures, deeds of trust, mortgages, pledges, hypothecations or other evidences of debt and securities therefor.
Section 2.
    
Number of Directors.
The authorized number of directors shall be not less than nine nor more than seventeen until changed by amendment of the Articles or by a Bylaw duly adopted by the shareholders. The exact number of directors shall be fixed, within the limits specified, by the Board by adoption of a resolution or by the shareholders in the same manner provided in these Bylaws for the amendment thereof.
9
ARTICLE III
Section 3.
    
Election and Term of Office.
The directors shall be elected at each annual meeting of the shareholders, subject to Article II, Section 7 of these Bylaws, but if any such annual meeting is not held or no vote is taken on the election of directors thereat, the directors may be elected at any special meeting of shareholders held for that purpose. Subject to Article II, Section 7 of these Bylaws, each director shall hold office until the next annual meeting and until a successor has been elected and qualified.
Section 4.
    
Vacancies.
Any director may resign effective upon giving written notice to the Chairman of the Board, the President, the Secretary or the Board, unless the notice specifies a later time for the effectiveness of such resignation. If the resignation is effective at a future time, a successor may be elected to take office when the resignation becomes effective.
Vacancies in the Board, except those existing as a result of a removal of a director, may be filled by a majority of the remaining directors, though less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, and each director so elected shall hold office until the next annual meeting and, subject to Article II, Section 7 of these Bylaws, until such director's successor has been elected and qualified. Vacancies existing as a result of a removal of a director may be filled by the shareholders as provided by law. Any vacancy on the Board resulting from any expiration of the term of an incumbent director as provided in Article II, Section 7 of these Bylaws shall be deemed to have been created by resignation, and not removal, of the incumbent director.
A vacancy or vacancies in the Board shall be deemed to exist in case of the death, resignation or removal of any director, or if the authorized number of directors be increased, or if the shareholders fail, at any annual or special meeting of shareholders at which any director or directors are elected, to elect the full authorized number of directors to be voted for at that meeting.
The Board may declare vacant the office of a director who has been declared of unsound mind by an order of court or convicted of a felony.
The shareholders may elect a director or directors at any time to fill any vacancy or vacancies not filled by the directors. Any such election by written consent other than to fill a vacancy created by removal requires the consent of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote.
No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director prior to the expiration of the director's term of office.
10
ARTICLE III
Section 5.
    
Place of Meeting.
Regular or special meetings of the Board shall be held at any place within or without the State of California which has been designated from time to time by the Board, specified in the notice of the meeting, or as otherwise provided in these Bylaws.

Special meetings and regular meetings other than organization meetings of the Board for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the Chairman of the Board, the President, any Vice President, the Secretary or by any two directors.
Such meetings of the Board shall be held upon four days' notice by mail or twenty-four hours' notice delivered personally or by telephone, including a voice messaging system or other system or technology designed to record and communicate messages, telegraph, telex, facsimile, electronic mail or other similar means of communication. Any such notice shall be addressed or delivered to each director at such director's address, telephone number, telex number, facsimile number, E-mail address, or other designated location(s), as shown upon the records of the corporation or as may have been given to the corporation by the director for purposes of notice or, if such information is not shown on such records or is not readily ascertainable, at the place in which the meetings of the directors are regularly held. The notice need not specify the purpose of such meeting.
Notice by mail shall be deemed to have been given at the time a written notice is deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid. Any other written notice shall be deemed to have been given at the time it is personally delivered to the recipient or is delivered to a common carrier for transmission, or actually transmitted by the person giving the notice by electronic means to the recipient. Oral notice shall be deemed to have been given at the time it is communicated, in person or by telephone, wireless, or other similar means, to the recipient or to a person at the office of the recipient who the person giving the notice has reason to believe will promptly communicate it to the recipient, or actually transmitted to the recipient by the person giving the notice by a system or technology designed to record and communicate messages.

ARTICLE III
Section 8.

Section 9.
    
Participation in Meetings by Conference Telephone.
Members of the Board may participate in a meeting through use of conference telephone or similar communications equipment, so long as all members participating in such meeting can hear one another. Such participation constitutes presence in person at such meeting.
Section 10.
    
Waiver of Notice.
The transactions of any meeting of the Board, however called and noticed or wherever held, are as valid as though had at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice if a quorum is present and if, either before or after the meeting, each of the directors not present signs a written waiver of notice, a consent to holding such meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof. All such waivers, consents or approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting.
Section 11.

23
ARTICLE VI
indemnification hereunder is unlawful; and (iv) as to circumstances in which indemnity is expressly prohibited by Section 317 of the General Corporation Law of California (the "Law"); and (D) that no such person shall be indemnified with regard to any action brought by or in the right of the corporation for breach of duty to the corporation and its shareholders (a) for acts or omissions involving intentional misconduct or knowing and culpable violation of law; (b) for acts or omissions that the director or officer believes to be contrary to the best interests of the corporation or its shareholders or that involve the absence of good faith on the part of the director or officer; (c) for any transaction from which the director or officer derived an improper personal benefit; (d) for acts or omissions that show a reckless disregard for the director's or officer's duty to the corporation or its shareholders in circumstances in which the director or officer was aware, or should have been aware, in the ordinary course of performing his or her duties, of a risk of serious injury to the corporation or its shareholders; (e) for acts or omissions that constitute an unexcused pattern of inattention that amounts to an abdication of the director's or officer's duties to the corporation or its shareholders; and (f) for costs, charges, expenses, liabilities and losses arising under Section 310 or 316 of the Law. The right to indemnification conferred in this Article shall include the right to be paid by the corporation expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that if the Law permits the payment of such expenses incurred by a director or officer in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a director or officer, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding, such advances shall be made only upon delivery to the corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such director or officer, to repay all amounts to the corporation if it shall be ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified.

Neither the failure of the corporation (including its Board, independent legal counsel, or its shareholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is permissible in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct, if any, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its Board, independent legal counsel, or its shareholders) that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption for the purpose of an action that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
