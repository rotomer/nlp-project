Edison International Reports Second Quarter 2012 Results
ROSEMEAD, Calif., July 31, 2012  Edison International (NYSE: EIX) today reported second quarter 2012 basic earnings of $0.23 per share, compared to basic earnings of $0.54 per share in the same quarter last year. Second quarter 2012 core earnings were $0.32 per share, compared to core earnings of $0.56 per share in the second quarter of 2011.
The decrease in earnings was primarily related to losses at Edison Mission Group (EMG) and to a delay in the 2012 rate case decision at Southern California Edison (SCE). SCE incurred higher costs in the quarter to support its ongoing infrastructure investment programs, but the increased revenues to support these investment programs are pending a decision from California regulators.
Second quarter results reflect higher, unrecovered costs at SCE, which will be addressed with a final rate case decision, and continued inspection and repair costs related to the San Onofre Nuclear Station outage, which we will look to recover in the future, said Ted Craver, chairman and chief executive officer of Edison International. We also saw increased losses at EMG, reflecting poor power prices. This further underscores the need to restructure and stabilize our competitive generation business.
Second Quarter Earnings Detail
SCEs second quarter 2012 basic and core earnings were $0.59 per share compared to $0.65 per share in the second quarter of 2011. The core earnings decrease was primarily due to a delay in the 2012 California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) General Rate Case decision as higher depreciation and interest expenses are not being recovered in currently authorized revenue. The revenue requirement ultimately adopted by the CPUC will be retroactive to January 1, 2012. SCE also incurred $0.05 per share of incremental steam generator inspection and repair costs related to outages at San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station. These are currently being offset by other operation and maintenance cost reductions.

EMGs second quarter 2012 basic losses were $(0.34) per share compared to losses of $(0.09) per share in the second quarter of 2011. Core losses were $(0.25) per share compared to losses of $(0.07) per share in the same quarter last year. Core losses increased primarily due to lower average realized energy and capacity prices and higher fuel prices, partially offset by lower planned maintenance costs at Midwest Generation; lower distributions from the Doga project; decreased energy trading revenues; lower renewable energy income; and higher interest expense from new project financings. Non-core items for both quarters included the results for Homer City in anticipation of its transfer to the owner-lessors.
Edison International parent company and other reported a second quarter basic and core loss of $(0.02) per share in both periods.
Year-to-Date Earnings Summary
Edison International reported basic earnings of $0.51 per share for the six-month period ending June 30, 2012, compared to $1.15 per share for the same period last year. Core earnings for the first six months of 2012 were $0.67 per share compared to $1.21 per share for the first half of 2011.
Year-to-Date Earnings Detail
SCEs year-to-date 2012 basic and core earnings were $1.14 per share compared to $1.33 per share for the same period last year. The core earnings decrease was primarily due to a delay in the 2012 CPUC General Rate Case decision as higher depreciation and interest expenses are not being recovered in currently authorized revenue. The revenue requirement ultimately adopted by the CPUC will be retroactive to January 1, 2012. SCE also incurred $0.09 per share of incremental steam generator inspection and repair costs related to outages at San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station. These are currently being offset by other operation and maintenance cost reductions. The decrease also reflects a lower capitalization rate on funds used during construction.
EMGs basic losses were $(0.59) per share compared to basic losses of $(0.16) per share in the prior-year period. Core losses were $(0.43) per share compared to core losses of $(0.10) per share in the first half of 2011. Core losses in the first half of 2012 increased primarily due to lower average realized energy and capacity prices, higher fuel prices, and reduced generation, partially offset by lower planned maintenance costs at Midwest Generation; lower distributions from the Doga project; an increase in interest expense from new project financings; and a decrease in energy trading. Non-core items for both periods included the results for Homer City in anticipation of its transfer to the owner-lessors.
Edison International parent company and other basic and core losses in the first half of 2012 were $(0.04) per share compared to basic and core losses of $(0.02) per share in the first half of 2011.
2012 Earnings Guidance
The company will not provide 2012 earnings guidance until SCE receives a final decision on its 2012 CPUC General Rate Case. See the risk disclosure statement on page 4 and the financial teleconference presentation accompanying the companys earnings conference call for further information.

Appendix
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Edison Internationals earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States and represent the companys earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management uses core earnings and core earnings per share (core EPS) by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. We also use core earnings and core EPS by principal operating subsidiary when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook to facilitate comparisons of the Companys performance from period to period. Financial measures referred to net income, basic EPS, core earnings, or core EPS also applies to the description of losses or losses per share.
Core earnings are a non-GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Core earnings and core EPS are defined as GAAP earnings and basic EPS excluding income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings. GAAP earnings refer to net income attributable to Edison International common shareholders or attributable to the common shareholders of each subsidiary. Core earnings are reconciled to GAAP earnings in the attached tables. EPS by principal operating subsidiary is based on the principal operating subsidiaries net income attributable to the common shareholders of each operating subsidiary, respectively, and Edison Internationals weighted average outstanding common shares. The impact of participating securities (vested stock options that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for each principal operating subsidiary is not material to each principal operating subsidiarys EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which we refer to as EIX parent company and other. EIX core EPS and core EPS by principal operating subsidiary are reconciled to basic EPS.
Risk Disclosure Statement
Forward-looking statements about the financial outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries are included in this news release.

EDISON INTERNATIONAL Leading the Way in Electricity SM July 31, 2012 44 Edison Internationals earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States and represent the companys earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management uses core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. We also use core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook, to facilitate the companys performance from period to period. Core earnings is a Non-GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Core earnings and core earnings per share are defined as GAAP earnings and basic earnings per share excluding income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings. GAAP earnings refer to net income attributable to Edison International common shareholders or attributable to the common shareholders of each subsidiary. EPS by principal operating subsidiary is based on the principal operating subsidiaries net income attributable to the common shareholders of each subsidiary, respectively, and Edison Internationals weighted average outstanding common shares. The impact of participating securities (vested stock options that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for each principal operating subsidiary is not material to each principal operating subsidiarys EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which we refer to as EIX parent company and other. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA includes production tax credits from EMEs wind projects and excludes amounts from gain on the sale of assets, loss on early extinguishment of debt and leases, and impairment of assets and investments. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA as an important financial measure for evaluating EME which represents substantially all of the EMG business segment. The average realized energy price and average realized fuel cost is a non-GAAP performance measure since such statistical measures exclude unrealized gains or losses recorded as operating revenues and unrealized gains or losses recorded as fuel expenses. Management believes that the average realized energy price and average realized fuel cost is more meaningful for investors as it reflects the impact of hedge contracts at the time of actual generation in period-over- period comparisons or as compared to real-time market prices. A reconciliation of Non-GAAP information to GAAP information, including the impact of participating securities, is included either on the slide where the information appears or on another slide referenced in this presentation.

Prepared Remarks of Ted Craver
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Edison International
Second Quarter 2012 Financial Teleconference
July 31, 2012, 2:00 p.m. (PDT)
Today Edison International reported second quarter GAAP earnings of 23 cents per share and core earnings of 32 cents per share. As expected, this was below last year's 54 cents per share in GAAP earnings and 56 cents per share in core earnings. Second quarter results reflect unrecovered costs at Southern California Edison, due to the delayed general rate case decision. In addition we have continued inspection and repair costs related to the outage at the San Onofre Nuclear Station. SCE will look to recover these costs in the future. We also saw additional losses at EMG this quarter, primarily reflecting low power prices. This further underscores the need to restructure and stabilize our competitive generation business, as I'll talk about in a few minutes.
There are several important developments at Southern California Edison this quarter. I'll spend most of my time on our San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, or SONGS as we call it. Both Units at SONGS remain safely shut down for inspections, analysis and testing following the January 31 Unit 3 steam generator tube leak. SCE has retained several outside industry experts, consultants, and steam generator manufacturers in addition to Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which designed and manufactured our steam generators, to analyze the causes of the unique tube-to-tube wear and potential remedial actions.
On July 19, the NRC released its detailed findings from its augmented inspection team. It summarized its findings by saying that faulty computer modeling inadequately predicted conditions in the steam generators and manufacturing issues contributed to excessive wear of the components. The report states that the excessive wear arose from tube-to-tube contact caused by vibration of the tubes in certain areas of the steam generators. The excessive vibration is due to a phenomenon called fluid elastic instability, which is discussed in detail in the report. The NRC has identified a number of outstanding issues that it is still reviewing.
To date, the inspection and repair effort has focused on a substantial amount of technical analysis work, and preventive plugging of tubes where appropriate based on indications of prior or potential future wear, both in areas where there was tube to tube contact and tube to support contact. Each of the four steam generators has over 9,700 heat transfer tubes and is designed to include sufficient tubes to accommodate a need to remove some from service for a variety of reasons, and the tubes that SCE has preventively removed from service are well within this margin.
SONGS will not be restarted until SCE determines that it is safe to do so and when start-up has been approved by the NRC pursuant to the terms of a Confirmatory Action Letter. Any remedial action that will permit restart of one or both of the Units will need to ensure that the Fluid Elastic Instability phenomenon does not reoccur.
Because Unit 2 experienced considerably less tube-to-tube wear, it could restart months in advance of Unit 3. Any such restart of Unit 2 would likely operate at reduced power levels and with mid-cycle scheduled outages to provide for additional inspection and testing to assure safe operation. Inasmuch as Unit 3 had much more tube-to-tube wear than Unit 2, it is not clear at this time whether Unit 3 will be able to restart without extensive additional repairs.

SCE is also looking longer-term at what repairs, if any, could allow the steam generators to operate safely at full power as originally specified. At this time, SCE has not determined what those repairs might be, or whether the generators will need to be replaced for the Units to operate at full output. In the interim, SCE is reviewing its O&M and capital expenditures at SONGS with a view to reducing expenditures to mitigate the added cost pressures with both Units being out of service.
I would like to clear up some confusion that has arisen in the past regarding potential dates for submitting our response to the Confirmatory Action Letter. We have never released a specific date for our submittal. Under the California Independent System Operator rules, we are required to post an estimated restart date on their website whenever we have a generating unit down for an outage, but these are only rough estimates and not formal forecast timelines.
We will not be forecasting specific timelines for a Confirmatory Action Letter submittal or potential start-up dates. As we have said many times, there is no timeline for safety, and to forecast dates is inconsistent with prudent decision making.
Turning to the regulatory review at the state level, there are several mechanisms in place for the California Public Utilities Commission to provide oversight and review the reasonableness of expenditures related to the outage.
My remaining SCE comments will be brief. We still have no indication of the timeline for receiving a general rate case proposed decision but are hopeful this can be concluded in the third quarter. We recognize the significant workload on the Commission and staff at this time but remain hopeful that we can soon gain the clarity we need to run the utility efficiently.

Turning to EME, we remain focused on developing clarity on the best approach for financially stabilizing EME. There has been continued progress this year across several self-help initiatives to improve liquidity and operating cash flow.
However, our greatest focus has been on the need to restructure the $3.7 billion of unsecured debt. This is because despite EME's efforts at managing liquidity, our internal forecasts anticipate that EME's liquidity will rapidly decline in future quarters and, absent a restructuring of its obligations, EME will not have sufficient liquidity to repay the $500 million dollars in unsecured debt due in June 2013.
For EME to be viable it must have a clear path to adequate liquidity, particularly over the near-term when it will have the cash cost of retrofits and the tightest operating cash flows. A successful restructuring will require at least two things:
EME and Edison International are engaging on a confidential basis with advisors representing certain of EME's unsecured bondholders to discuss EME's financial condition.
Should we be unsuccessful in negotiating a debt restructuring adequate to stabilize EME as part of Edison International and in accordance with the requirements I just outlined, then EME would need to be reorganized under new ownership.
Our objectives remain the same - eliminate the overhang of uncertainty about EME, restore EME to a healthy financial condition that would position it for future success, and act with purpose and a sense of urgency. While the exact path forward to success is not clear at this point, we are engaged with bondholders, and we plan on moving our discussions along as rapidly as we can.

Despite some of the challenges that I've touched on, when I step back, the investment thesis in Edison International is very much intact. I'm optimistic that we can resolve some important issues this year. At SCE, we continue to have a sustained need for capital investment in system reliability and meeting public policy mandates, with the potential for sustained mid-to-high single digit rate base growth.
Finally, as we move beyond SCE's 2012 capital spending peak, and get the rate case and cost of capital decisions, we will seek to return our dividend in steps over the subsequent years to our target payout ratio range of 45-55% of SCE earnings. The earnings power at SCE, along with gaining clarity on EME, provide the key value drivers for Edison International shareholders.
