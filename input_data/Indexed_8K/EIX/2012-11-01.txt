Edison International Reports Third Quarter 2012 Results
ROSEMEAD, Calif., November 1, 2012  Edison International (NYSE: EIX) today reported third quarter 2012 basic earnings of $0.58 per share, compared to basic earnings of $1.31 per share in the same quarter last year. Third quarter 2012 core earnings were $0.72 per share, compared to core earnings of $1.26 per share in the third quarter of 2011.
The decrease in earnings was primarily related to losses at Edison Mission Group (EMG) and to a delay in the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) final decision on Southern California Edisons (SCE) 2012 General Rate Case. SCE incurred higher costs in the quarter to support its ongoing infrastructure investment programs, while the increased revenues to support these investment programs are pending the rate case decision from California regulators.
SCEs third quarter results reflect the delay in receiving a final rate case decision from California regulators, as well as severance and continued inspection and repair costs related to the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, said Ted Craver, chairman and chief executive officer of Edison International. A final rate case decision is an important part of moving forward with SCEs capital program to invest in Californias electric infrastructure and provide safe, reliable, and affordable power.
Third Quarter Earnings Detail
SCEs third quarter 2012 basic and core earnings were $1.11 per share compared to $1.25 per share in the third quarter of 2011. The core earnings decrease was primarily due to a delay in the 2012 General Rate Case decision as higher depreciation and interest expenses are not being recovered in currently authorized revenue, and to higher costs at San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station. These include $(0.09)
per share of incremental steam generator inspection and repair costs and $(0.06) per share in severance costs, which are both included in core earnings. These costs were partially offset by other operating and maintenance cost reductions. The General Rate Case revenue requirement ultimately adopted by the CPUC will be retroactive to January 1, 2012.

EMGs third quarter 2012 basic losses were $(0.42) per share compared to earnings of $0.10 per share in the third quarter of 2011. Core losses were $(0.28) per share compared to earnings of $0.05 per share in the same quarter last year. Third quarter losses increased primarily due to lower average realized energy and capacity prices, reduced generation, and higher fuel prices partially offset by lower planned maintenance costs and depreciation at Midwest Generation, decreased earnings from natural gas-fired projects, and lower income tax benefits. Non-core items for both quarters included the results for Homer City, which were classified as discontinued operations beginning in the third quarter of 2012. Homer City losses from discontinued operations during the third quarter of 2012 were $(0.24) per share, including an impairment charge of $(0.21) per share, compared to earnings of $0.05 per share in the prior-year period. Non-core items also included a gain of $0.09 per share on the sale of an Edison Capital lease interest in a power plant.
Edison International parent company and other reported a third quarter 2012 basic and core losses of $(0.11) per share compared to $(0.04) per share in the same period last year. Losses increased primarily due to higher consolidated state income taxes of $(0.09) per share.
Year-to-Date Earnings Summary
Edison International reported basic earnings of $1.09 per share for the nine-month period ending September 30, 2012, compared to $2.46 per share for the same period last year. Core earnings for the first nine months of 2012 were $1.40 per share compared to $2.47 per share in the same period last year.
Year-to-Date Earnings Detail
SCEs year-to-date 2012 basic and core earnings were $2.26 per share compared to $2.57 per share for the same period last year. The core earnings decrease was primarily due to the delay in the 2012 General Rate Case decision and the higher costs at the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station. The higher costs include $(0.17) per share of incremental steam generator inspection and repair costs and the $(0.06) per share in severance costs. These costs were partially offset by other operation and maintenance cost reductions. The General Rate Case revenue requirement ultimately adopted by the CPUC will be retroactive to January 1, 2012.
EMGs year-to-date 2012 basic losses were $(1.02) per share compared to basic losses of $(0.05) per share in the prior-year period. Core losses were $(0.71) per share compared to core losses of $(0.04) per share in the same period last year.

Appendix
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Edison Internationals earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States and represent the companys earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management uses core earnings and core earnings per share (EPS) by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. We also use core earnings and core EPS by principal operating subsidiary when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook to facilitate comparisons of the Companys performance from period to period. Financial measures referred to net income, basic EPS, core earnings, or core EPS also applies to the description of earnings or earnings per share.
Core earnings and core EPS are non-GAAP financial measures and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Core earnings and core EPS are defined as GAAP earnings and basic EPS excluding income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings. GAAP earnings refer to net income attributable to Edison International common shareholders or attributable to the common shareholders of each subsidiary. Core earnings are reconciled to GAAP earnings in the attached tables. EPS by principal operating subsidiary is based on the principal operating subsidiaries net income attributable to the common shareholders of each operating subsidiary, respectively, and Edison Internationals weighted average outstanding common shares. The impact of participating securities (vested stock options that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for each principal operating subsidiary is not material to each principal operating subsidiarys EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which we refer to as EIX parent company and other. EIX core EPS and core EPS by principal operating subsidiary are reconciled to basic EPS.

Exhibit 99.2 EDISON INTERNATIONAL Leading the Way in Electricity SM November 1, 2012 39 Edison Internationals earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States and represent the companys earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management uses core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. We also use core earnings and EPS by principal operating subsidiary when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook, to facilitate the companys performance from period to period. Core earnings is a Non-GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Core earnings and core earnings per share are defined as GAAP earnings and basic earnings per share excluding income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings. GAAP earnings refer to net income attributable to Edison International common shareholders or attributable to the common shareholders of each subsidiary. EPS by principal operating subsidiary is based on the principal operating subsidiaries net income attributable to the common shareholders of each subsidiary, respectively, and Edison Internationals weighted average outstanding common shares. The impact of participating securities (vested stock options that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for each principal operating subsidiary is not material to each principal operating subsidiarys EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which we refer to as EIX parent company and other. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA includes production tax credits from EMEs wind projects and excludes amounts from gain on the sale of assets, loss on early extinguishment of debt and leases, and impairment of assets and investments. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA as an important financial measure for evaluating EME which represents substantially all of the EMG business segment. The average realized energy price and average realized fuel cost is a non-GAAP performance measure since such statistical measures exclude unrealized gains or losses recorded as operating revenues and unrealized gains or losses recorded as fuel expenses. Management believes that the average realized energy price and average realized fuel cost is more meaningful for investors as it reflects the impact of hedge contracts at the time of actual generation in period-over- period comparisons or as compared to real-time market prices. A reconciliation of Non-GAAP information to GAAP information, including the impact of participating securities, is included either on the slide where the information appears or on another slide referenced in this presentation.

Exhibit 99.3
Prepared Remarks of Ted Craver
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Edison International
Third Quarter 2012 Financial Teleconference
November 1, 2012, 2:00 p.m. (PDT)
Today, Edison International reported third quarter GAAP earnings of 58 cents per share compared to $1.31 per share a year ago. Core earnings were 72 cents per share compared to $1.26 per share a year ago. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to three factors: losses at Edison Mission Group, a delay in the California Public Utilities Commission final decision on SCE's 2012 general rate case, and an increase in holding company costs due to state tax adjustments.
There are three main areas on which I will focus my comments this afternoon: our restructuring efforts at Edison Mission Energy; the recently received Proposed Decision on SCE's 2012 general rate case, and an update on the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, or SONGS.
Let me start with EME. In past earnings calls I have explained Edison International's overall strategy. We believe the most effective way to participate in the growth opportunities arising from the substantial changes occurring in the electric power industry is through a dual platform of regulated and competitive businesses. However, we are acutely aware that the competitive generation sector has been deeply challenged for some time by cyclically low margins and capacity values. For the last few years, EME has focused on developing innovative approaches to environmental compliance, and careful capital stewardship, principally as a means to buy time for a recovery in power markets and energy margins and stabilize the company.
But despite great efforts and many successes by EME, the adverse power market trends have persisted, and EME's operating losses this year have increased significantly, and are expected to continue. At the same time, EME has a capital structure and financial leverage created in better times that is no longer workable under current and foreseeable conditions.
Under current projections, EME will not be able to repay the June 2013 bond maturity of $500 million. There is also no assurance that EME will pay the $97 million interest due on its bonds on November 15 or during the 30 day grace period that follows. Failure to pay interest on the bonds will likely result in EME filing for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. A bankruptcy filing by EME this year will result in its being deconsolidated from Edison International. This means that the assets and liabilities of EME would be removed from Edison International's consolidated balance sheet upon a bankruptcy filing. The earnings of EME would be included in Edison International's earnings up to a bankruptcy filing, together with any charges related to deconsolidation. After a bankruptcy filing, the results of EME would no longer be included as part of Edison International's earnings and our results will largely be the earnings of Southern California Edison less our holding company costs.

As we discussed on our last call, EME entered into non-disclosure agreements in June with the advisors to holders of a majority of its unsecured bonds. Since that time, discussions with the advisors have been ongoing. As disclosed in our 10Q filed today, certain of the advisors' clients executed non-disclosure agreements last month to facilitate further discussions.
 
We remain in discussions and under non-disclosure agreements, and therefore will not be able to comment further in Q&A or in subsequent discussions with investors until a public filing about the discussions occurs. I recognize this may be frustrating to some of you, but we appreciate your understanding in this regard.
Let me turn now to SCE. Rate base growth at SCE, spurred by needed infrastructure investment and California public policy mandates, has been the cornerstone of our stock's investment thesis.
SCE received its long awaited Proposed Decision for its 2012 General Rate Case on October 19. The Proposed Decision provides the base revenue through 2014. As is normal procedure, SCE will identify various technical and other procedural items that need correction in its comments, which will be filed on November 8. Oral arguments are scheduled for November 16
th
, and a final decision could come at either the November 29 or December 20 meetings.
The Proposed Decision does significantly reduce SCE's requested operations and maintenance expenses, overhead expenses and rate base in order to moderate customer rates. Although challenging, we expect SCE will manage its costs over the rate case period consistent with the final authorized revenue requirement such that it can earn its allowed return on common equity. Moreover, during the 2012 to 2014 rate case period, capital spending continues to support infrastructure investment and results in rate base within our previously disclosed forecast range.
Turning to our San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, SCE has filed plans with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to restart Unit 2 at 70% load for an initial five month period. Unit 2 did not experience anything near the level of tube-to-tube wear found in Unit 3, even though it operated twice as long as Unit 3, and consequently is in a condition that it can be restarted earlier. A team of outside experts has confirmed that operating at reduced power will eliminate the physical conditions that caused fluid elastic instability, which is the phenomenon that caused the unusual tube to tube wear and tube failure in Unit 3. The shorter, five-month operating period we are proposing is designed to provide an additional margin of safety. The NRC has made clear that they will not commit to any schedule for a return to service decision. Concurrently with their review, SCE continues to work with its outside experts and the steam generator designer and manufacturer, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, on what it will take to restore both units to full load. It is not clear at this time if the units can be repaired, and it appears complete replacement of the steam generators would take some years.
We continue to place the highest priority on safety before a restart of any unit at SONGS. And we will remain diligent in recovering costs incurred from the outage from warranties and insurance. A comprehensive review of the outage at San Onofre by the CPUC will take place under the Order Instituting Investigation adopted on October 25. This will consolidate all proceedings and consider appropriate cost recovery for applicable SONGS costs after January 1, 2012, including the steam generator project as well as market power costs, capital and O&M costs, and seismic study costs. SCE will file a response to the order by November 26 and testimony by December 10 detailing costs subject to refund pursuant to the provisions of Public Utilities Code 455.5.

I would like to note that the EdisonConnect
TM
smart meter program is nearing completion. The program remains on schedule for completion this year and is on target at its authorized capital cost of $1.25 billion. Close to all of the planned 5 million meters have been installed as of September 30, 2012. SCE is rolling out new products and services to its customers providing monthly budgeting tools and incentives for managing electric use, which will be increasingly helpful when tight supply and demand conditions return next summer as a result of reduced output from SONGS.
And finally, the other key regulatory decision upcoming at the CPUC in December is the first phase of the cost of capital decision. The first phase includes SCE's allowed return on equity for 2013. The proceeding remains on schedule for a proposed decision on November 19 and a final decision on December 20. The second phase of the proceeding, which would address terms of any trigger mechanism, is scheduled to conclude in April of next year.
SCE continues to make its case for its proposed 11.1% rate of return, a 40 basis point reduction from the current 11.5%. As the general rate case Proposed Decision acknowledges, California wants strong public safety, and infrastructure and policy-related investment from its utilities. We expect the Commission will similarly consider the California policy-specific facts that have traditionally resulted in an above national-average rate of return.
I would like to finish by reiterating what I mentioned on our last call regarding our dividend policy. As we gain clarity on the cash flow outlook for Southern California Edison with the final general rate case and cost of capital decisions, we will be in a better position to - over time - move back toward our target payout ratio of 45 to 55% of utility earnings. This will of course depend on successful execution of our capital spending program and earning our allowed return. I believe the resolution of several strategic uncertainties combined with strong rate base and dividend growth potential make Edison International an increasingly attractive company to investors.
