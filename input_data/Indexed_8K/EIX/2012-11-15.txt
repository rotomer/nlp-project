This current report and its exhibit include forward-looking statements. Edison International based these forward-looking statements on its current expectations and projections about future events in light of its knowledge of facts as of the date of this current report and its assumptions about future circumstances. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties that may be outside the control of Edison International. Edison International has no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether due to new information, future events, or otherwise. This current report should be read with Edison International's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.
On November 15, 2012, $97 million of interest payments were due on unsecured bonds maturing in 2017, 2019 and 2027 issued by Edison Mission Energy (EME), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Edison International. EME elected not to make the November 15 interest payments at this time. EME's unsecured bonds generally provide for a 30-day grace period for interest payments before an event of default shall be deemed to have occurred. If the interest payments are not made prior to the expiration of the grace period on December 17, 2012, then generally either the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the bonds may declare the entire principal amount of the bonds and the interest accrued thereon to be due and payable immediately. EME's failure to pay indebtedness under its unsecured bonds will likely result in EME's filing for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
Edison International and EME continue to engage in discussions with the bondholders' financial and legal advisors regarding potential EME restructuring transactions.
By filing this Current Report on Form 8-K, Edison International makes no admission as to the materiality of any information in Item 8.01 of this report.
