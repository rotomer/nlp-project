2012 General Rate Case Decision
On November 29, 2012, the California Public Utilities Commission approved a final decision in Edison International's subsidiary Southern California Edison's (SCE) 2012 General Rate Case. The decision authorized a base rate revenue requirement of $5.67 billion for 2012. The final decision also authorized a post-test year ratemaking methodology that escalates capital additions by 3.05% for 2013 and 2.93% for 2014 and allows operations and maintenance expense to be escalated for 2013 and 2014 through the use of various escalation factors for labor, non-labor and medical expenses. The methodology adopted in the decision results in a revenue requirement of $6.03 billion for 2013 and $6.39 billion for 2014. SCE does not expect the final decision to materially alter SCE's capital expenditures forecast provided in SCE's third quarter 2012 quarterly report on Form 10-Q and in the November Business Update presentation posted on www.edisoninvestor.com.
The final decision is retroactive to January 1, 2012. The balance in the account established to record recovery of the authorized rate increase since that date will be recovered in rates over 12 months, beginning in January 2013.
