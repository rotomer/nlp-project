This current report and its exhibits include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties that may be outside the control of Edison International. Edison International has no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether due to new information, future events, or otherwise.

See Item 2.01 below, which is incorporated by reference herein.
On December 17, 2012 (the Petition Date), Edison Mission Energy (EME), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Edison International, and certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the Debtor Entities) filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division (the Bankruptcy Court). The Debtor Entities will continue to operate their businesses as debtors-in-possession under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. The employees of Edison International who were serving on the EME Board of Directors immediately prior to the filing of the petitions have resigned as EME directors.
Edison International has determined that, as a result of the bankruptcy filing and beginning on the Petition Date, EME and the other Debtor Entities will be deconsolidated from Edison International's financial statements. Edison International expects to impair its investment in EME and the other Debtor Entities to its estimated fair value of zero. Edison International expects to record an after tax charge of approximately $1.5 billion during the fourth quarter as a result of the deconsolidation of EME, recognition of losses previously deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income, estimated assumed liabilities under the support agreement described below and related items. Edison International also expects to account for EME as a discontinued operation in its 2012 financial statements. In connection with the deconsolidation of EME and the other Debtor Entities, Edison International is filing herewith certain pro forma financial information, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein.
EME, Edison International and certain of EME's senior unsecured noteholders have entered into a Transaction Support Agreement dated December 16, 2012 (the Support Agreement), in which each party agrees to support Bankruptcy Court approval of certain transactions. Pursuant to the Support Agreement:

Exhibit 99.1
EDISON INTERNATIONAL
The following Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Statements of Edison International and its consolidated subsidiaries are included herein:
The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes presented reflect the deconsolidation of Edison Mission Energy and its subsidiaries and affiliates ("EME") as a result of voluntary filings by EME and certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries on December 17, 2012 (the Petition Date) for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division. Edison International has determined that as a result of the bankruptcy filing and beginning on the Petition Date, that it will no longer consolidate EME for financial reporting purposes. The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared by applying pro forma adjustments to the amounts previously reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Edison International's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 and Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Edison International's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2012. The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Statements of Income for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and the year ended December 31, 2011 reflect the deconsolidation of EME, assuming the bankruptcy filing had occurred as of the beginning of the respective calendar year. The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects the deconsolidation of EME, assuming the bankruptcy filing had occurred on September 30, 2012. The pro forma adjustments, as described in the Notes to the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Statements, are based on currently available information.
The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the reclassification of EME from a consolidated entity together with subsidiaries and affiliates to an investment accounted for on the cost method as a result of filing for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. For purposes of the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2012, the investment in EME is reflected at a fair value of zero. The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Statements are presented for informational purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the operating results or financial position that would have occurred had the bankruptcy filing occurred on, or as of, the dates indicated, nor are they necessarily indicative of future operating results or financial position.

Exhibit 99.1
International's consolidated or combined federal and state tax returns. Such amounts are based on the carrying value at September 30, 2012 and may be impacted by future events. During the period that EME continues to be included in the consolidated and/or combined federal and state tax returns of Edison International and is subject to tax allocation agreements that currently exist, Edison International would make tax payments to EME when net operating losses and production tax credits are utilized to reduce tax liabilities of the consolidated group.
