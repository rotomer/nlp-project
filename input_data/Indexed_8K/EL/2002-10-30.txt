Langhammer,President and Chief Executive Officer, reviewed historical financial results and trends and described the Company's strategies. At the meeting, stockholders re-elected Charlene Barshefsky, Leonard A. Lauder, Ronald S.

Following the meeting, the Board of Directors declared an annual dividend of $.20 per share on the Company's Class A and Class B common stock, payable on January 3, 2003 to stockholders of record at the close of business on December 12, 2002. In May 2002, the Company announced that it would pay future cash dividends on its common stock annually rather than quarterly in order to reduce dividend payment processing costs and deliver more value to stockholders earlier. The Board of Directors also authorized the repurchase of up to 10.0 million shares of Class A Common Stock or about 4% of the total outstanding common stock. This increases the total authorization to 18.0 million shares, of which 7.0 million shares have been repurchased to date. The Company has a total of approximately 233 million common shares outstanding. Repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market or in private transactions, and there will be no specific time frame. The repurchased shares will be held as treasury shares and used for general corporate purposes including employee stock option programs. Internally generated cash flow will be used to fund the purchases. Page 1 of 2
