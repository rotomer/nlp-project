(NYSE: EL) announced today that it has called for redemption all $291.6 million aggregate principal amount of Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock that could be redeemed at this time. The redemption date has been set for June 10, 2004. Upon redemption, the dividend rate on the remaining $68.4 million principal amount of Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock shall be reduced, for the period from April 25, 2004 through June 30, 2004, to 0.62% per annum, which is a rate based on the after-tax yield on six-month U.S. Treasuries. So long as the remaining shares are outstanding, the dividend rate will be reset semi-annually in January and July at the then existing after-tax yield on six-month U.S. Treasuries. The remaining $68.4 million principal amount of preferred shares may be put to the Company at any time, but may not be called for redemption by the Company until May 24, 2005. As a result of the redemption of the $291.6 million principal amount of preferred shares and the reduction of the dividend on the remaining preferred shares, the Company expects to save, net of financing costs, approximately $14.9 million in its fiscal year ending June 30, 2005. The Company also announced that its Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to another 10.0 million shares of Class A Common Stock or about 4% of the total outstanding common stock. This increases the total authorization to 28.0 million shares, of which 16.3 million have been repurchased to date. The Company has a total of approximately 228 million common shares outstanding. Repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market or in private transactions, and there will be no specific time frame. The repurchased shares will be held as treasury shares and may be used for general corporate purposes including employee stock option programs. Internally generated cash flow will be used to fund the purchases. The forward-looking statements in this press release involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements include unexpected changes in the Company's needs for cash, changes in interest rates and changes in law.
