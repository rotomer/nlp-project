ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS AND REQUIRED FD DISCLOSURE. On June 7, 2004, we were notified that we have been added as a defendant in litigation brought by the Office of the Attorney General of the State of New York with respect to the Blydenburgh landfill in Islip, New York. The Blydenburgh matters are described under Item 1 (Legal Proceedings) of Part II of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2004. We and certain other potentially responsible parties continue to be in discussions with the State regarding possible settlement of the matter. Furthermore, while no assurance can be given as to the ultimate outcome, management continues to believe that the Blydenburgh matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. 2
