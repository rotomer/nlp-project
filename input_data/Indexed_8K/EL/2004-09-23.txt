(C) "Good Reason" means the occurrence of any of the following, without the express written consent of the Executive, after the occurrence of a Change in Control: (1) (a) the assignment to the Executive of any duties inconsistent in any material adverse effect with the Executive's position, authority or responsibilities as contemplated by Section 2 hereof, or (b) any other material adverse change in such position, including title, authority or responsibilities; 7
(2) any failure by the Company to comply with any provisions of Sections 3, 4 or 5 hereof, other than an insubstantial or inadvertent failure remedied by the Company promptly after receipt of notice thereof given by the Executive; (3) the Company's requiring the Executive to be based at any office or location more than fifty (50) miles from that location at which he performed his services specified under the provisions of Section 2 immediately prior to the Change in Control, except for travel reasonably required in the performance of the Executive's responsibilities; or (4) any failure by the Company to obtain the assumption and agreement to perform this Agreement by a successor as contemplated by Section 14. (ii) Termination for Good Reason. Following the occurrence of a Change of Control, the Executive may terminate his employment for Good Reason. Such termination shall be deemed to be a termination without cause and shall be controlled by the provisions of Section 6(c) hereof. (h) Certain Payments by the Company. (i) In the event that any amount or benefit paid or distributed to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement, taken together with any amounts or benefits otherwise paid or distributed to the Executive by the Company or any affiliated company (collectively, the "Covered Payments"), are or become subject to the tax (the "Excise Tax") imposed under Section 4999 of the Code, or any similar tax that may hereafter be imposed, the Company shall pay to the Executive at the time specified in Section 6(h) (v) below an additional amount (the "Tax Reimbursement Payment") such that the net amount retained by the Executive with respect to such Covered Payments, after deduction of any Excise Tax on the Covered Payments and any Federal, state and local income or employment tax and Excise Tax on the Tax Reimbursement Payment provided for by this Section 6(f), but before deduction for any Federal, state or local income or employment tax withholding on such Covered Payments, shall be equal to the amount of the Covered Payments. (ii) For purposes of determining whether any of the Covered Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax and the amount of such Excise Tax, (A) such Covered Payments will be treated as "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, and all "parachute payments" in excess of the "base amount" (as defined under Section 28OG(b) (3) of the Code) shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax, unless, and except to the extent that, in the good faith judgment of the Company's independent certified public accountants appointed prior to the date of the Change in Control or tax counsel selected by such Accountants (the "Accountants"), the Company has a reasonable basis to conclude that such Covered Payments (in whole or in part) either do not constitute "parachute payments" or represent reasonable compensation for personal services actually rendered (within the meaning of Section 28OG(b) (4) (B) of the Code) in excess of the allocable "base amount," or such "parachute payments" are otherwise not subject to such Excise Tax, and 8
(B) the value of any non-cash benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be determined by the Accountants in accordance with the principles of Section 280G of the Code. (iii) For purposes of determining the amount of the Tax Reimbursement Payment, the Executive shall be deemed to pay: (A) Federal income, social security, medicare and other employment taxes at the highest applicable marginal rate of Federal income taxation for the calendar year in which the Tax Reimbursement Payment is to be made, and (B) any applicable state and local income or other employment taxes at the highest applicable marginal rate of taxation for the calendar year in which the Tax Reimbursement Payment is to be made, net of the maximum reduction in Federal income taxes which could be obtained by Executive from the deduction of such state or local taxes if paid in such year. (iv) In the event that the Excise Tax is subsequently determined by the Accountants or pursuant to any proceeding or negotiations with the Internal Revenue Service to be less than the amount taken into account hereunder in calculating the Tax Reimbursement Payment made, the Executive shall repay to the Company, at the time of such determination, the portion of such prior Tax Reimbursement Payment that would not have been paid if such reduced Excise Tax had been taken into account in initially calculating such Tax Reimbursement Payment, plus interest on the amount of such repayment at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(b) of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event any portion of the Tax Reimbursement Payment to be refunded to the Company has been paid to any Federal, state or local tax authority, repayment thereof shall not be required until actual refund or credit of such portion has been made to the Executive, and interest payable to the Company shall not exceed interest received or credited to the Executive by such tax authority for the period it held such portion. The Executive and the Company shall mutually agree upon the course of action to be pursued (and the method of allocating the expenses thereof) if the Executive's good faith claim for refund or credit is denied. In the event that the Excise Tax is later determined by the Accountants or pursuant to any proceeding or negotiations with the Internal Revenue Service to exceed the amount taken into account hereunder at the time the Tax Reimbursement Payment is made (including, but not limited to, by reason of any payment the existence or amount of which cannot be determined at the time of the Tax Reimbursement Payment), the Company shall make an additional Tax Reimbursement Payment in respect of such excess (plus any interest or penalty payable with respect to such excess) at the time that the amount of such excess is finally determined. (v) The Tax Reimbursement Payment (or portion thereof) provided for in Section 6(f) (i) above shall be paid to the Executive not later than ten (10) business days following the payment of the Covered Payments; provided, however, that if the amount of such Tax Reimbursement Payment (or portion thereof) cannot be finally determined on or before the date on which payment is due, the Company shall pay to the Executive by such date an amount estimated in good faith by the Accountants to be the minimum amount of such Tax Reimbursement Payment and shall pay the remainder of such Tax Reimbursement Payment (together with interest at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code) as soon as the amount thereof can be determined, but in no event later than forty-five (45) calendar days after payment of the related Cover Payment. In the event that the amount of the estimated Tax Reimbursement Payment exceeds the amount subsequently determined to have been due, such excess shall constitute a loan by the Company to the Executive, payable on the fifth business day after written demand by the Company for payment (together with interest at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code). 9
(i) Non-Renewal. In the event the Company does not offer the Executive renewal of the Term of Employment on the basis of terms no less favorable than those pending at the time of the conclusion of the Term of Employment, the Executive shall be entitled to a severance arrangement providing Base Salary and continuation of certain benefits for two years consistent with Company policy at that time. (j) Effect of Termination. In addition to the foregoing, in the event that this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to the provisions of subparagraphs 6(a), 6(b), 6(c), 6(f) or 6(g) above, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Company's Share Incentive Plan or other similar option plan, all Stock Option awards previously made to the Executive shall vest and Stock Options shall become immediately exercisable for the one (1) year period from the effective date of such termination, subject to applicable share incentive plan and option agreement provisions, after which all such option awards shall expire and be of no further force or effect. Subject to the preceding sentence, upon the termination of the Executive's employment hereunder for any reason, the Company shall have no further obligations hereunder, except as otherwise provided herein. The Executive, however, shall continue to have the obligations provided for in Sections 7 and 8 hereof. Furthermore, upon such termination, the Executive shall be deemed to have resigned immediately from all offices and directorships held by him in the Company or any of its subsidiaries. (k) Release of Claims. As a condition precedent to the receipt of certain payments and benefits pursuant to this Section, the Executive, or, in the case of his death or Disability that prevents the Executive from performing his obligation under this Section 6(k), his personal representative, and his beneficiary, if applicable, will execute an effective general release of claims against the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, attorneys and agents; provided, however, that such release will not affect any right that the Executive, or in the event of his death, his personal representative or beneficiary, otherwise has to any payment or benefit provided for in this Agreement or to any vested benefits the Executive may have in any employee benefit plan of Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, or any right the Executive has under any other agreement between the Executive and the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates that expressly states that the right survives the termination of the Executive's employment. 7. Confidentiality; Ownership. (a) The Executive agrees that he shall forever keep secret and retain in strictest confidence and not divulge, disclose, discuss, copy or otherwise use or suffer to be used in any manner, except in connection with the Business of the Company, its subsidiaries or affiliates and any other business or proposed business of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, any "Protected Information" in any "Unauthorized" manner or for any "Unauthorized" purpose (as such terms are hereinafter defined). 10

(ii) "Unauthorized" means: (A) in contravention of the policies or procedures of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates; (B) otherwise inconsistent with the measures taken by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates to protect their interests in any Protected Information; (C) in contravention of any lawful instruction or directive, either written or oral, of an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates empowered to issue such instruction or directive; or (D) in contravention of any duty existing under law or contract. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 7, the Executive may disclose any Protected Information to the extent required by court order or decree or by the rules and regulations of a governmental agency or as otherwise required by law or to his legal counsel and, in connection with a determination under Section 6(h), to accounting experts; provided that the Executive shall provide the Company with prompt notice of such required disclosure in advance thereof so that the Company may seek an appropriate protective order in respect of such required disclosure. (b) The Executive acknowledges that all developments, including, without limitation, inventions (patentable or otherwise), discoveries, formulas, improvements, patents, trade secrets, designs, reports, computer software, flow charts and diagrams, procedures, data, documentation, ideas and writings and applications thereof relating to the Business or any business or planned business of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates that, alone or jointly with others, the Executive may conceive, create, make, develop, reduce to practice or acquire during the Term of Employment (collectively, the "Developments") are works made for hire and shall remain the sole and exclusive property of the Company. The Executive hereby assigns to the Company, in consideration of the payments set forth in Section 3(a) hereof, all of his right, title and interest in and to all such Developments. The Executive shall promptly and fully disclose all future material Developments to the Board of Directors of the Company and, at any time upon request and at the expense of the Company, shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company all instruments that the Company shall prepare, give evidence and take all other actions that are necessary or desirable in the reasonable opinion of the Company to enable the Company to file and prosecute applications for and to acquire, maintain and enforce all letters patent and trademark registrations or copyrights covering the Developments in all countries in which the same are deemed necessary by the Company. All memoranda, notes, lists, drawings, records, files, computer tapes, programs, software, source and programming narratives and other documentation (and all copies thereof) made or compiled by the Executive or made available to the Executive concerning the Developments or otherwise concerning the Business or planned business of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates shall be the property of the Company or such subsidiaries or affiliates and shall be delivered to the Company or such subsidiaries or affiliates promptly upon the expiration or termination of the Term of Employment. 11
(c) The provisions of this Section 7 shall, without any limitation as to time, survive the expiration or termination of the Executive's employment hereunder, irrespective of the reason for any termination. 8. Covenant Not to Compete. Subject to the last sentence of this Section 8, the Executive agrees that during the Term of Employment and for a period of two (2) years commencing upon the expiration or termination of the Executive's employment hereunder (the "Non-Compete Period"), the Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of the Company: (a) solicit, entice, persuade or induce any employee, consultant, agent or independent contractor of the Company or of any of its subsidiaries or affiliates to terminate his, her or its employment with the Company or such subsidiary or affiliate, to become employed by any person, firm or corporation other than the Company or such subsidiary or affiliate or approach any such employee, consultant, agent or independent contractor for any of the foregoing purposes, or authorize or assist in the taking of any such actions by any third party (for purposes of this Section 8 (a), the terms "employee," "consultant," "agent" and "independent contractor" shall include any persons with such status at any time during the six (6) months preceding any solicitation in question); or (b) directly or indirectly engage, participate, or make any financial investment in, or become employed by or render consulting, advisory or other services to or for any person, firm, corporation or other business enterprise, wherever located, which is engaged, directly or indirectly, in competition with the Business or any business of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates as conducted or any business proposed to be conducted at the time of the expiration or termination of the Executive's employment hereunder; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 8(b) shall be construed to preclude the Executive from making any investments in the securities of any business enterprise whether or not engaged in competition with the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, to the extent that such securities are actively traded on a national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter market in the United States or on any foreign securities exchange and represent, at the time of acquisition, not more than 0.5% of the aggregate voting power of such business enterprise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive shall not be subject to the terms and provisions of paragraph (b) of this Section 8 if the Term of Employment is terminated pursuant to Section 6(c) hereof. 9. Specific Performance. The Executive acknowledges that the services to be rendered by the Executive are of a special, unique and extraordinary character and, in connection with such services, the Executive will have access to confidential information vital to the Company's Business and the other current or planned businesses of it and its subsidiaries and affiliates. By reason of this, the Executive consents and agrees that if the Executive violates any of the provisions of Sections 7 or 8 hereof, the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates would sustain irreparable injury and that monetary damages would not provide adequate remedy to the Company and that the Company shall be entitled to have Section 7 or 8 hereof specifically enforced by any court having equity jurisdiction. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as prohibiting the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates from pursuing any other remedies available to it or them for such breach or threatened breach, including the recovery of damages from the Executive. 12
10. Deductions and Withholding. The Executive agrees that the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates, as applicable, shall withhold from any and all compensation paid to and required to be paid to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement, all Federal, state, local and/or other taxes which the Company determines are required to be withheld in accordance with applicable statutes or regulations from time to time in effect and all amounts required to be deducted in respect of the Executive's coverage under applicable employee benefit plans. For purposes of this Agreement and calculations hereunder, all such deductions and withholdings shall be deemed to have been paid to and received by the Executive. 11. Entire Agreement. Except for the Fiscal 2002 Share Incentive Plan, the Executive's outstanding stock option agreements, the Executive Annual Incentive Plan, the 401(k) Savings Plan, the term life insurance arrangement between the Company and the Executive, the Qualified Plan and the Non-Qualified Plan and applicable successor plans or agreements, this Agreement embodies the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the Executive's employment, compensation, perquisites and related items and supersedes any other prior oral or written agreements, arrangements or understandings between the Executive and the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, and any such prior agreements, arrangements or understandings are hereby terminated and of no further effect. This Agreement may not be changed or terminated orally but only by an agreement in writing signed by the parties hereto. 12. Waiver. The waiver by the Company of a breach of any provision of this Agreement by the Executive shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach by him. The waiver by the Executive of a breach of any provision of this Agreement by the Company shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach by the Company. 13. Governing Law; Jurisdiction. (a) This Agreement shall be subject to, and governed by, the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts made and to be performed therein. (b) Any action to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be brought in a court of the State of New York located in the Borough of Manhattan of the City of New York or in a Federal court located within the Southern District of New York. The parties consent to the jurisdiction of such courts and to the service of process in any manner provided by New York law. Each party irrevocably waives any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such court and any claim that such suit, action or proceeding brought in such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum and agrees that service of process in accordance with the foregoing sentences shall be deemed in every respect effective and valid personal service of process upon such party. 14. Assignability. The obligations of the Executive may not be delegated and, except with respect to the designation of beneficiaries in connection with any of the benefits payable to the Executive hereunder, the Executive may not, without the Company's written consent thereto, assign, transfer, convey, pledge, encumber, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of this Agreement or any interest herein. Any such attempted delegation or disposition shall be null and void and without effect. The Company and the Executive agree that this Agreement and all of the Company's rights and obligations hereunder may be assigned or transferred by the Company to and shall be assumed by and be binding upon any successor to the Company. The Company shall require any successor by an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Executive, expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent as the Company would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place. The term "successor" means, with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, any corporation or other business entity which, by merger, consolidation, purchase of the assets or otherwise acquires all or a majority of the operating assets or business of the Company. 13
15. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or any part thereof, including, without limitation, Sections 7 and 8 hereof, as applied to either party or to any circumstances shall be adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction to be void or unenforceable, the same shall in no way affect any other provision of this Agreement or remaining part thereof, or the validity or enforceability of this Agreement, which shall be given full effect without regard to the invalid or unenforceable part thereof. If any court construes any of the provisions of Section 7 or 8 hereof, or any part thereof, to be unreasonable because of the duration of such provision or the geographic scope thereof, such court may reduce the duration or restrict or redefine the geographic scope of such provision and enforce such provision as so reduced, restricted or rede 16.

Employment Term. (a) The Company hereby agrees to employ the Executive, and the Executive hereby agrees to enter into such employment as Group President of the Company for the period commencing on July 1, 2004 and ending on June 30, 2007 unless terminated sooner pursuant to Section 6 hereof ("the Term of Employment").

Duties and Extent of Services. (a) During the Term of Employment, the Executive shall serve as Group President of the Company, and, in such capacity, shall serve as the senior-most executive responsible for one or more of the Company's brands and/or
business units as he may be assigned to from time to time reporting to the Chief Executive Officer. In such capacity, he shall render such executive, managerial, administrative and other services as customarily associated with and incident to such positions, and as the Company may, from time to time, reasonably require of him consistent with such positions.

(b) The Executive shall hold such other positions and executive offices of the Company and/or of any of the Company's subsidiaries or affiliates as may from time to time be agreed by the Executive or assigned by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company, provided that each such position shall be commensurate with the Executive's standing in the business community as Group President of the Company. The Executive shall not be entitled to any compensation other than the compensation provided for herein for serving during the Term of Employment in any other office or position of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, unless the Board of Directors of the Company or appropriate committee thereof shall specifically approve such additional compensation. (c) The Executive shall be a full-time employee of the Company and shall exclusively devote all his business time and efforts faithfully and competently to the Company and shall diligently perform to the best of his ability all of the duties required of him as Group President of the Company, and in the other positions or offices of the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates required of him hereunder.

(c) Deferral. The Executive may elect to defer payment of all or any part of his incentive bonus compensation payable in accordance with Section 3(b) hereof in respect of any Contract Year during the Term of Employment, by giving to the Company written notice thereof, on or before March 31 of such Contract Year or part year (or such earlier date as may be necessary to comply with the applicable tax laws and regulations). Additionally, in the event that in respect of any fiscal year of the Company any amount of Base Salary, any amount payable under the Incentive Bonus Plan or any other amount payable to the Executive hereunder or otherwise shall, either alone or in combination with other amounts payable hereunder or otherwise, result in the payment by the Company of any amount that shall not be currently deductible by it pursuant to the provisions of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the "Code"), or like or successor provisions (a "Non-Deductible Amount"), the Company may elect to defer the payment of the Non-Deductible Amount. Any amounts so deferred, either by election of the Executive or by election of the Company, shall be credited to a bookkeeping account in the name of the Executive as of the date scheduled for payment hereunder. Such amounts shall be credited with interest as of each June 30 during the term of deferral, compounded annually, at a rate per annum equal to the annual rate of interest announced by Citibank N.A. in New York, New York as its base rate in effect on such June 30, but in no event shall such rate exceed 9%. The entire amount credited to such bookkeeping account shall be paid to the Executive (subject to all applicable withholding taxes) on a date to be chosen by the Company, but in no event later than ninety (90) days after the termination of the Executive's employment with the Company, unless the Executive requests prior to termination of his employment from the Company to continue the deferral of such payments until a later date and the Company agrees to such request. The Company, in its sole discretion, may provide an investment facility for all or a portion of such deferred amounts, but shall not be required to do so. 3
(d) Supplemental Deferral. The Company shall credit to a bookkeeping account in the name of the Executive an annual supplemental deferral amount of $200,000 on each January 1 during the Term of Employment in compensation for pension benefits forgone as a result of the Executive's termination of employment with his prior employer to accept employment with the Company. Such amounts shall be credited with interest as of each June 30 for the duration of this supplemental pension bookkeeping account, compounded annually, at a rate per annum equal to the annual rate of interest announced by Citibank N.A. in New York, New York as its base rate in effect on such June 30, but in no event shall such rate exceed 9%. The entire amount credited to such bookkeeping account shall be paid to the Executive (subject to all applicable withholding taxes) on a date to be chosen by the Company, but in no event later than ninety (90) days after the termination of the Executive's employment with the Company, unless the Executive requests prior to termination of his employment from the Company to defer payment of such amounts until a later date and the Company agrees to such request. The Company, in its sole discretion, may provide an investment facility for all or a portion of such supplemental pension amounts, but shall not be required to do so. 4. Share Incentive Plan. (a) Stock Options. The Stock Plan Subcommittee of the Compensation Committee has approved the grant to the Executive of options to purchase no fewer than 100,000 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock ("Stock Options") under the Fiscal 2002 Share Incentive Plan (the "Share Incentive Plan") and subject to the provisions of Section 6(i) below in respect of the First Contract Year. Such grant shall be made at such time during the Contract Year determined by Stock Plan Subcommittee. The option grant is subject to the terms and conditions of the Share Incentive Plan (or applicable successor plan), which are incorporated herein by reference. The terms of the options shall be set forth in a separate grant letter approved by the Stock Plan Subcommittee of the Compensation Committee. (b) Equity-Based Compensation. In respect of the Second and Third Contract Years, the Company shall recommend to the Stock Plan Subcommittee of the Compensation Committee that the Executive be awarded under the terms and conditions of the Fiscal 2002 Share Incentive Plan (which are incorporated herein by reference) or successor plan and subject to the provisions of Section 6(i) below Equity-Based Compensation awards in accordance with the policies and procedures of the Company as in effect from time to time for its Executive Officers. The terms of such Equity-Based Compensation awards shall be set forth in a separate grant letter approved by the Stock Plan Subcommittee of the Compensation Committee. The recommended equity-based compensation awards shall be of an equivalent value to a grant of stock option with respect to 100,000 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock determined in accordance with procedures generally utilized by the Company for its financial reporting at the time of grant. 4

For purposes of this Agreement, "Cause" means: (i) a material breach of, or the willful failure or refusal by the Executive to perform and discharge duties or obligations he has agreed to perform or assume under this Agreement that, (other than by reason of disability or death) that, if capable of correction, is not corrected within ten (10) business days following notice thereof to the Executive by the Company, such notice to state with specificity the nature of the breach, failure or refusal; (ii) willful misconduct by the Executive, unrelated to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, that could reasonably be anticipated to have an adverse effect on the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates; (iii) the Executive's gross negligence, whether related or unrelated to the business of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates which could reasonably be anticipated to have an adverse effect on the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates that, if capable of correction, is not corrected within ten (10) business days following notice thereof to the Executive by the Company, such notice to state with specificity the nature of the conduct complained of; (iv) the Executive's failure to follow a lawful directive of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company that is within the scope of the Executive's duties for a period of ten (10) business days after notice from the Chief Executive Officer specifying the performance required; (v) any violation by the Executive of a policy contained in the Code of Conduct of the Company; or (vi) drug or alcohol abuse by the Executive that materially affects the Executive's performance of his duties under this Agreement.

thirty (30) days after the Executive's obtaining knowledge of the occurrence of the circumstances giving rise to such Good Cause; and provided, further, that such termination will not become effective if within such thirty (30) day notice period the Company shall have cured all matters constituting Good Cause hereunder.

(f) Failure to Renew. In the event that this Agreement shall expire by its terms and thereafter the Company shall not offer to continue the employment of Executive on terms not less favorable to Executive as existing as of the date of such expiry, the termination of Executive occasioned by such expiration shall be deemed to be a Termination Without Cause by the Company, and the provisions of subparagraph 6(c) above shall control. (g) Termination by Executive for Reasons Other than Good Cause. The Executive shall have the right, exercisable at any time during the Term of Employment, to terminate his employment for any reason other than for Good Cause as provided for in Section 6(e) hereof, upon ninety (90) days' prior written notice to the Company. Upon such termination, the Company shall have no further obligations hereunder other than to pay the Executive his accrued compensation and benefits through the date of such termination. (h) Certain Limitations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event that any payment received or to be received by the Executive pursuant to Section 6 hereof or otherwise (a "Severance Payment") would be subject to the excise tax (the "Excise Tax") imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (in whole or part), the Severance Payment shall be reduced (but not below zero) until no portion of such payments would be subject to Excise Tax. (i) Effect of Termination. In addition to the foregoing, in the event that this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to the provisions of subparagraphs 6(a), 6(b), 6(c) or 6(e), above, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Company's Share Incentive Plan or other similar option plan, all Stock Option awards previously made to the Executive shall vest and 9

By reason of this, the Executive consents and agrees that if the Executive violates any of the provisions of Sections 7 or 8 hereof, the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates would sustain irreparable injury and that monetary damages would not provide adequate remedy to the Company and that the Company shall be entitled to have Section 7 or 8 hereof specifically enforced by any court having equity jurisdiction. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as prohibiting the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates from pursuing any other remedies available to it for such breach or threatened breach, including the recovery of damages from the Executive. 10.

The parties consent to the jurisdiction of such courts and to the service of process in any manner provided by New York law. Each party irrevocably waives any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such court and any claim that such suit, action or proceeding brought in such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum and agrees that service of process in accordance with the foregoing sentences shall be deemed in every respect effective and valid personal service of process upon such party. 14.

The term "successor" means, with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, any corporation or other business entity which, by merger, consolidation, purchase of the assets or otherwise acquires all or a majority of the operating assets or business of the Company. 15. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or any part thereof, including, without limitation, Sections 7 and 8 hereof, as applied to either party or to any circumstances shall be adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction to be void or unenforceable, the same shall in no way affect any other provision of this Agreement or remaining part thereof, or the validity or enforceability of this Agreement, which shall be given full effect without regard to the invalid or unenforceable part thereof. 14
