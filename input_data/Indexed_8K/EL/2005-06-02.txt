Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. On May 27, 2005, The Estee Lauder Companies Inc.

The Facility (as defined below) created by the Agreement replaces the Company's previously existing, and unused, $400 million revolving credit facility. The Agreement provides for a 5-year senior revolving credit facility (the "Facility") to the Company and the Eligible Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Borrowers"), in the amount of $600,000,000, of which the entire amount is currently undrawn and available. The proceeds of any loans made under the Agreement will be used for general corporate purposes in the ordinary course of business of the Company and its subsidiaries, as shall be determined by the Company from time to time. The Company will also use the Facility as credit support for its commercial paper program and the commercial paper program, if any, of any other Borrower. Estee Lauder Inc. will act as Guarantor with respect to the obligations of the Borrowers under the Agreement and the Company will act as Guarantor with respect to the obligations of the Borrowers under the Agreement, other than itself, each pursuant to the terms set forth in the Agreement. The Lenders, as defined in the Agreement (the "Lenders"), have committed to provide the amounts indicated in the Commitment Schedule, subject to terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement, for an aggregate $600,000,000 commitment to the Company and its Eligible Subsidiaries under the Facility. Up to the equivalent of $250,000,000 of the Facility will be available for multicurrency loans in Pounds Sterling, Euros, Japanese Yen and Swiss Francs. A portion of the Facility not to exceed $100,000,000 will be available for the issuance of letters of credit by JPMCB as the Issuing Lender. The Facility may be increased, at the election of the Company, by up to $150,000,000 in accordance with the terms set forth in the Agreement. The Facility commenced on May 27, 2005 and expires by its terms on May 27, 2010. Interest and fees payable under the Agreement shall be determined pursuant to the terms set forth in the Agreement. The Agreement also contains certain affirmative, negative and financial covenants customary for facilities of this type, including, furnishing to Lenders periodic financial information of the Company and all reports, proxy statements and registration statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission; paying and discharging, at or before maturity, material obligations and liabilities; maintenance of corporate existence and ability to do business; limitations on ability to consolidate, merge or sell, lease or otherwise transfer all or substantially all assets; limitations on the incurrence of 2
liens; limitations on the incurrence of debt by subsidiaries of the Company; and limitations on transactions with affiliates. The Agreement also contains certain events of default customary for facilities of this type (with customary grace periods), including nonpayment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts when due; material inaccuracies of representations and warranties; violations of covenants; the occurrence of certain bankruptcy events; certain ERISA events; material judgments; changes of control; or the invalidity of the guaranty provided by the Guarantors. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, any outstanding loans under the Agreement may be accelerated and/or the Lenders' commitments may be terminated, provided however, that upon the occurrence of certain insolvency or bankruptcy related events of default, all amounts payable under the Agreement will automatically become immediately due and payable, and the Lenders' commitments will automatically terminate. In the ordinary course of their respective businesses, one or more of the Lenders, or their affiliates, have or may have various relationships with the Company and its subsidiaries involving the provision of a variety of financial services, including cash management, commercial banking, investment banking, trust, stock transfer, stock plan administration, advisory or other financial services, for which they received, or will receive, customary fees and expenses.

Borrowing, in a minimum aggregate Dollar Amount of $5,000,000 and in integral multiples of 500,000 units of the applicable Alternative Currency; (iii) acceptance of offers may only be made on the basis of ascending Competitive Bid Margins or Competitive Bid Absolute Rates, as the case may be; and (iv) the applicable Borrower may not accept any offer that is described in subsection (d)(iii) or that otherwise fails to comply with the requirements of this Agreement. (g) Allocation by Administrative Agent. If offers are made by two or more Lenders with the same Competitive Bid Margins or Competitive Bid Absolute Rates, as the case may be, for a greater aggregate principal amount than the amount in respect of which such offers are accepted for the related Interest Period, the principal amount of Competitive Bid Loans in respect of which such offers are accepted shall be allocated by the Administrative Agent among such Lenders as nearly as possible (as the Administrative Agent may deem appropriate) in proportion to the aggregate principal amounts of such offers. Determinations by the Administrative Agent of the amounts of Competitive Bid Loans shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. Section 2.04. Notice To Lenders; Funding of Loans. Upon receipt of a Notice of Borrowing, the Applicable Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the contents thereof and of such Lender's share (if any) of such Borrowing and such Notice of Borrowing shall not thereafter be revocable by the applicable Borrower. (b) On the date of each Borrowing, each Lender participating therein shall (except as provided in subsection (c) of this Section): (1) if such Borrowing is to be made in dollars, make available its share of such Borrowing in dollars not later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time), in Federal or other funds immediately available in New York City, to the Administrative Agent at its office specified in or pursuant to Section 10.01; or (2) if such Borrowing is to be made in an Alternative Currency, make available its share of such Borrowing in such Alternative Currency (in such funds as may then be customary for the settlement of international transactions in such Alternative Currency) to the account of the Applicable Agent at such time and place as shall have been notified by the Applicable Agent to the Lenders by at least three Euro-Currency Business Days' notice (or, solely in the case of such Borrowing denominated in Sterling, by 25
telephonic notice on the Euro-Currency Business Day of the date of such Borrowing, such notice to be promptly confirmed in writing). (c) Unless the Applicable Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Applicable Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Applicable Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available to the Applicable Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with subsection (b) of this Section and the Applicable Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have so made such share available to the Applicable Agent, such Lender and the applicable Borrower severally agree to repay to the Applicable Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the applicable Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Applicable Agent, at (i) in the case of the applicable Borrower, a rate per annum equal to the higher of the Federal Funds Rate and the interest rate applicable thereto pursuant to Section 2.07 and (ii) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Rate (if such Borrowing is in dollars) or the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate (if such Borrowing is in an Alternative Currency). If such Lender shall repay to the Applicable Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement. Section 2.05. Evidence Of Debt. (a) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of each Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender by such Borrower from time to time hereunder. (b) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the Dollar Amount of each Loan made to a Borrower hereunder, the class, type and, in the case of any Committed Alternative Currency Loans, currency thereof and the Interest Period (if any) applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof. (c) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error 26
therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of each Borrower to repay the Lenders in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. (d) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the applicable Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by each such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 10.06) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns). Each reference in this Agreement to the "NOTE" of such Lender shall be deemed to refer to and include any or all of such Notes. Section 2.06. Maturity of Loans. (a) Each Committed Loan shall mature, and the principal amount thereof shall be due and payable, together with accrued interest thereon, on the Termination Date. (b) Each Competitive Bid Loan shall mature, and the principal amount thereof shall be due and payable, together with accrued interest thereon, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan. Section 2.07. Interest Rates. Each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from the date such Loan is made until it becomes due, at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate for such day. Such interest shall be payable quarterly in arrears on each Quarterly Date and, with respect to the principal amount of any Base Rate Loan converted to a Euro-Dollar Loan, on each date a Base Rate Loan is so converted. Any overdue principal of or interest on any Base Rate Loan shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day until paid at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to Base Rate Loans for such day. (b) Each Euro-Currency Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day during the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Euro-Currency Margin plus the London Interbank Offered Rate applicable to such Interest Period. Such interest shall be payable for each Interest Period on the last day thereof and, if such Interest Period is longer than three months, at intervals of three months after the first day of such Interest Period. The "LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE" applicable to any Interest Period means the rate appearing on "Page BBAM 1" on the Bloomberg Service (or on any successor or substitute page of such Service, or any successor to or substitute for such Service, providing rate quotations comparable to those currently 27
provided on such page of such Service, as determined by the Administrative Agent from time to time for purposes of providing quotations of interest rates applicable to deposits in the relevant currency in the London interbank market) at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, two Business Days before the beginning (or, solely in the case of Borrowings denominated in Sterling, on the first day) of such Interest Period, as the rate for deposits in the relevant currency with a maturity comparable to such Interest Period. If such rate is not available at such time for any reason, then the "LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE" with respect to such Interest Period shall be the average (rounded upward, if necessary, to the next higher 1/16 of 1%) of the respective rates per annum at which deposits in the relevant currency are offered to each of the Reference Banks in the London interbank market at approximately 11:00 A.M. (London time) on the Rate Fixing Date in an amount approximately equal to the principal amount of the Euro-Currency Loan of such Reference Bank to which such Interest Period is to apply and for a period of time comparable to such Interest Period. (c) Any overdue principal of or interest on any Euro-Currency Loan shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day until paid at a rate per annum equal to the higher of (i) the sum of 2% plus the Euro-Currency Margin plus the London Interbank Offered Rate applicable to the Interest Period for such Loan and (ii) the sum of 2% plus the Euro-Currency Margin plus the average (rounded upward, if necessary, to the next higher 1/16 of 1%) of the respective rates per annum at which one day (or, if such amount due remains unpaid more than three Euro-Currency Business Days, then for such other period of time not longer than three months as the Administrative Agent may select) deposits in the relevant currency in an amount approximately equal to such overdue payment due to each of the Reference Banks are offered to such Reference Bank in the London interbank market for the applicable period determined as provided above (or, if the circumstances described in clause (a) or (b) of Section 8.01 shall exist, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 2% plus the rate applicable to Base Rate Loans for such day). (d) Subject to Section 8.01, each Competitive Bid LIBOR Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the London Interbank Offered Rate for such Interest Period (determined in accordance with Section 2.07(b) as if the related Competitive Bid LIBOR Borrowing were a Committed Euro-Dollar Borrowing) plus (or minus) the Competitive Bid Margin quoted by the Lender making such Loan in accordance with Section 2.03. Each Competitive Bid Absolute Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the Competitive Bid Absolute Rate quoted by the Lender making such Loan in accordance with Section 2.03. Such interest shall be payable for each Interest Period on the last day thereof and, if such Interest Period is 28
longer than three months, at intervals of three months after the first day thereof. (e) Any overdue principal of or interest on any Competitive Bid Loan shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day until paid at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 2% plus the Base Rate for such day. (f) The Administrative Agent shall determine each interest rate applicable to the Loans hereunder. The Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to the applicable Borrower and the participating Lenders of each rate of interest so determined, and its determination thereof shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. (g) Each Reference Bank agrees to use its best efforts to furnish quotations to the Administrative Agent as contemplated by this Section. If any Reference Bank does not furnish a timely quotation, the Administrative Agent shall determine the relevant interest rate on the basis of the quotation or quotations furnished by the remaining Reference Bank or Banks or, if none of such quotations is available on a timely basis, the provisions of Section 8.01 shall apply. Section 2.08. Fees. (a) The Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders ratably a facility fee (the "FACILITY FEE"), which shall accrue at the Facility Fee Rate (i) from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the date of termination of the Commitments in their entirety, on the average daily aggregate amount of the Commitments (whether used or unused) and (ii) from and including such date of termination to but excluding the date the Loans shall be repaid in their entirety, on the average daily aggregate outstanding principal Dollar Amount of the Loans. (b) The Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent (i) for the account of the Lenders ratably a letter of credit fee in Dollars accruing daily on the aggregate Dollar Amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit at the Letter of Credit Fee Rate (determined daily in accordance with the Pricing Schedule) and (ii) for the account of the Issuing Lender a letter of credit fronting fee accruing daily on the aggregate Dollar Amount of all Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Lender at a rate per annum mutually agreed from time to time by the Company and the Issuing Lender. The Company shall also pay to the Issuing Lender for its own account issuance, drawing, amendment and extension charges in the amounts and at the times as agreed between the Company and the Issuing Lender. (c) Accrued fees under this Section shall be payable quarterly in arrears on each Quarterly Date and on the date of termination of the Commitments in their entirety (and, in the case of clause (a), if later, the date the Loans 29
shall be repaid in their entirety and, in the case of clause (b), if later, the date on which all Letters of Credit shall have been terminated). Section 2.09. Optional Termination or Reduction of Commitments. During the Revolving Credit Period, the Company may, upon at least three Domestic Business Days' notice to the Administrative Agent, (i) terminate the Commitments at any time, if no Loans or Letter of Credit Liabilities are outstanding at such time or (ii) ratably reduce from time to time by an aggregate amount of $20,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000, the aggregate amount of the Commitments in excess of the Total Outstanding Amount. Section 2.10. Method of Electing Interest Rates. (a) The Committed Dollar Loans included in each Committed Borrowing shall bear interest initially at the type of rate specified by the applicable Borrower in the applicable Notice of Committed Dollar Borrowing. Thereafter, the applicable Borrower may from time to time elect to change or continue the type of interest rate borne by each Group of Committed Dollar Loans (subject in each case to Section 2.07(c) and the provisions of Article 8 and the last sentence of this subsection (a)), as follows: (i) if such Loans are Base Rate Loans, the applicable Borrower may elect to convert such Loans to Euro-Dollar Loans as of any Euro-Dollar Business Day; and (ii) if such Loans are Euro-Dollar Loans, the applicable Borrower may elect to convert such Loans to Base Rate Loans as of any Domestic Business Day, or elect to continue such Loans as Euro-Dollar Loans for an additional Interest Period as of any Euro-Dollar Business Day, subject to Section 2.15 in the case of any such conversion or continuation effective on any day other than the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable to such Loans. Each such election shall be made by delivering a notice (a "NOTICE OF INTEREST RATE ELECTION") to the Administrative Agent not later than 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the third Euro-Dollar Business Day before the conversion or continuation selected in such notice is to be effective. A Notice of Interest Rate Election may, if it so specifies, apply to only a portion of the aggregate principal Dollar Amount of the relevant Group of Loans; provided that (i) such portion is allocated ratably among the Loans comprising such Group and (ii) the portion to which such Notice applies, and the remaining portion to which it does not apply, are each (x) in the case of a Dollar-Denominated Borrowing, $20,000,000 or any larger multiple of $1,000,000 and (y) in the case of an Alternative Currency Borrowing, $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of 500,000 units of the applicable Alternative Currency. If no Notice of Interest Rate Election is timely delivered prior to the end of an Interest Period for any Euro-Dollar Loan, the Borrower shall be deemed to have elected that all Loans 30
having such Interest Period shall be converted to Base Rate Loans effective as of the last day of such Interest Period. (b) Each Notice of Interest Rate Election shall specify: (i) the Group of Loans (or portion thereof) to which such notice applies; (ii) the date on which the conversion or continuation selected in such notice is to be effective, which shall comply with the applicable clause of subsection (a) above; (iii) if the Loans comprising such Group are to be converted, the new type of Loans and, if the Loans being converted are to be Euro-Dollar Loans, the duration of the next succeeding Interest Period applicable thereto; provided that, if at the time such notice is delivered an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the duration of the Interest Period with respect to any Euro-Dollar Loans to which such notice applies shall be one month; and (iv) if such Loans are to be continued as Euro-Dollar Loans for an additional Interest Period, the duration of such additional Interest Period; provided that, if at the time such notice is delivered an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the duration of the Interest Period with respect to any Euro-Dollar Loans to which such notice applies shall be one month. Each Interest Period specified in a Notice of Interest Rate Election shall comply with the provisions of the definition of Interest Period. (c) Upon receipt of a Notice of Interest Rate Election from the applicable Borrower pursuant to subsection (a) above, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the contents thereof and such notice shall not thereafter be revocable by such Borrower. (d) A Borrower shall not be entitled to elect to convert any Committed Dollar Loans to, or continue any Committed Dollar Loans for an additional Interest Period as, Euro-Dollar Loans, in each case made to it, if a Default shall have occurred and be continuing when such Borrower delivers notice of such election to the Administrative Agent. (e) An election by any Borrower to change or continue the rate of interest applicable to any Group of Loans pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a "BORROWING" subject to the provisions of Section 3.02. 31
(f) The initial Interest Period for each Group of Committed Alternative Currency Loans shall be specified by the applicable Borrower in the applicable Notice of Borrowing. The applicable Borrower may specify the duration of each subsequent Interest Period applicable to such Group of Loans by delivering to the Administrative Agent, not later than 10:30 A.M. (New York City time) on the third Euro-Currency Business Day before the end of the immediately preceding Interest Period, a notice specifying the Group of Loans to which such notice applies and the duration of such subsequent Interest Period (which shall comply with the provisions of the definition of Interest Period). Such notice may, if it so specifies, apply to only a portion of the aggregate principal amount of the relevant Group of Loans; provided that (i) such portion is allocated ratably among the Loans comprising such Group and (ii) the Dollar Amounts of the portion to which such notice applies, and the remaining portion to which it does not apply, are each at least $5,000,000 and shall be in integral multiples of 500,000 units of the relevant Alternative Currency. If no such notice is timely received by the Administrative Agent before the end of any applicable Interest Period, the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have elected that the subsequent Interest Period for such Group of Loans shall have a duration of one month (subject to the provisions of the definition of Interest Period). Section 2.11. Mandatory Termination of Commitments. Unless previously terminated, the Commitments shall terminate on the Termination Date and any Loans then outstanding (together with accrued interest thereon) shall be due and payable on such date. Section 2.12. Optional Prepayments. Subject in the case of any Fixed Rate Borrowing to Section 2.15, each Borrower may, upon at least one Domestic Business Day's notice to the Administrative Agent, prepay any Base Rate Borrowing (or any Competitive Bid Borrowing bearing interest at the Base Rate pursuant to Section 8.01) made to it or upon at least three Euro-Currency Business Days' notice to the Administrative Agent and the Applicable Agent (if different), prepay any Euro-Currency Borrowing made to it, in each case in whole at any time, or from time to time in part in an aggregate Dollar Amount not less than $20,000,000 or in the case of any Loan denominated in dollars, any larger multiple of $1,000,000, or in the case of any Committed Alternative Currency Loan in an aggregate Dollar Amount not less than $5,000,000 or any larger integral multiple of 500,000 units of the relevant Alternative Currency, by paying (in the relevant currency) the principal Dollar Amount to be prepaid together with accrued interest thereon to the date of prepayment. Each such optional prepayment shall be applied to prepay ratably the Loans of the several Lenders included in such Borrowing. (b) A Borrower may not prepay all or any portion of the principal amount of any Competitive Bid Loan made to it prior to the maturity thereof except (i) as provided in subsection (a) above or (ii) with respect to any particular Competitive Bid Loan, as agreed upon between the Lender making such 32
Loan and such Borrower so long as at the time such Borrower makes such prepayment no Default has occurred and is continuing. (c) Upon receipt of a notice of prepayment pursuant to this Section, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the contents thereof and of such Lender's ratable share (if any) of such prepayment and such notice shall not thereafter be revocable by the applicable Borrower. Section 2.13. Determining Dollar Amounts of Committed Alternative Currency Loans; Related Mandatory Prepayments. The Administrative Agent shall determine the Dollar Amount of each Committed Alternative Currency Loan promptly after it receives the related Notice of Committed Borrowing, based on the Exchange Rate on the third Euro-Currency Business Day before (or, solely in the case of Alternative Currency Borrowings denominated in Sterling, on) the date of Borrowing specified in such notice. Thereafter, the Administrative Agent shall redetermine the Dollar Amount of each Committed Alternative Currency Loan on the last Euro-Currency Business Day of each calendar month while such Loan remains outstanding, based in each case on the Exchange Rate on such Euro-Currency Business Day. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the applicable Borrower and the participating Lenders of each Dollar Amount so determined, and its determination thereof shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. (b) The Administrative Agent shall determine the Dollar Amount of the Letter of Credit Liabilities related to each Letter of Credit promptly after it receives the related Notice of Issuance, based on the Exchange Rate on the third Euro-Currency Business Day before (or, solely in the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in Sterling, on) the date of issuance specified in such notice. Thereafter, the Administrative Agent shall redetermine the Dollar Amount of each Letter of Credit on the last Euro-Currency Business Day of each calendar month while such Letter of Credit remains outstanding, based in each case on the Exchange Rate on such Euro-Currency Business Day. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the applicable Borrower and the participating Lenders of each Dollar Amount so determined, and its determination thereof shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. (c) If, (i) on the last day of any Interest Period for any Borrowing, the Total Outstanding Amount at such time exceeds the aggregate amount of Commitments, the relevant Borrower shall, on such day, prepay Committed Loans included in such Borrowing in an amount equal to the lesser of (x) such excess and (y) the amount of such Borrowing and (ii) on the last day of any Interest Period for any Committed Alternative Currency Borrowing, the Dollar Amount of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Alternative Currency Loans exceeds the Alternative Currency Sublimit, the relevant Borrower shall, on such date, 33
prepay Committed Alternative Currency Loans included in such Borrowing in an amount equal to the lesser of (x) such excess and (y) the amount of such Borrowing. (d) If, on the last Euro-Currency Business Day of any calendar month, after any redetermination of the Dollar Amounts pursuant to Section 2.13(a), the Total Outstanding Amount at such time exceeds 105% of the aggregate amount of Commitments, then the Borrowers shall, on the last Euro-Currency Business Day of the next calendar month (the "PREPAYMENT DATE"), prepay one or more Groups of Borrowings in an aggregate principal amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Total Outstanding Amount as of such Prepayment Date over the then outstanding Commitments. (e) If, on the last Euro-Currency Business Day of any calendar month, after any redetermination of the Dollar Amounts pursuant to Section 2.13(a), the aggregate Dollar Amount of the aggregate Committed Alternative Currency Loans exceeds 105% of the Alternative Currency Sublimit, then the Borrowers shall, on the Prepayment Date, prepay one or more Groups of Borrowings in an aggregate principal amount equal to the excess, if any, of the aggregate Dollar Amount of the aggregate Committed Alternative Currency Loans as of such Prepayment Date over the Alternative Currency Sublimit. Section 2.14. General Provisions as to Payments. (a) Each Borrower shall make each payment of principal of, and interest on, the Loans and Letter of Credit Liabilities denominated in Dollars and of fees hereunder, not later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the date when due, in Federal or other funds immediately available in New York City, without defense, set-off or counterclaim and free of any restriction or condition, to the Administrative Agent at its address referred to in Section 10.01. Each Borrower shall make each payment of principal of, and interest on, the Committed Alternative Currency Loans in the relevant Alternative Currency in such funds as may then be customary for the settlement of international transactions in such Alternative Currency, to such account and at such time and at such place as shall have been notified by the Applicable Agent to such Borrower and the Lenders by at least three Euro-Currency Business Days' notice (or, solely in the case of Alternative Currency Borrowings denominated in Sterling, by at least one Euro-Currency Business Days' notice). The Borrower may specify in any notice delivered to the Administrative Agent and the Applicable Agent with respect to any Alternative Currency, one or more locations from which such Borrower may make payments of principal or of interest on any Committed Alternative Currency Loan in such Alternative Currency; provided that the Administrative Agent approve such location. The Applicable Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its ratable share of each such payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders. Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Base Rate Loans, Letter of Credit Liabilities denominated in Dollars or of 34
fees shall be due on a day which is not a Domestic Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Domestic Business Day. Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Euro-Currency Loans shall be due on a day which is not a Euro-Currency Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Euro-Currency Business Day unless such Euro-Currency Business Day falls in another calendar month, in which case the date for payment thereof shall be the next preceding Euro-Currency Business Day. Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Competitive Bid Loans shall be due on a day which is not a Euro-Dollar Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Euro-Dollar Business Day. Whenever any payment of principal of or interest on Letter of Credit Liabilities denominated in an Alternative Currency shall be due on a day which is not a Euro-Currency Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Euro-Currency Business Day. If the date for any payment of principal is extended by operation of law or otherwise, interest thereon shall be payable for such extended time. (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent that such Borrower shall not have so made such payment, each Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate (if such amount was distributed in dollars) or (ii) the rate per annum at which one-day deposits in the relevant currency are offered to the Administrative Agent in the London interbank market for such day (if such amount was distributed in an Alternative Currency). Section 2.15. Funding Losses. If a Borrower makes any payment of principal with respect to any Fixed Rate Loan, any Fixed Rate Loan is converted (pursuant to Article 2, 6 or 8 or otherwise) or continued on any day other than the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto, or the last day of an applicable period fixed pursuant to Section 2.07(c), or if any Committed Alternative Currency Loan is converted to a Loan denominated in dollars pursuant to Article 8, or if a Borrower fails to borrow, prepay, convert or continue any Fixed Rate Loans after notice has been given to any Lender in accordance with Section 2.04(a), 2.12(a) or Section 2.10, respectively, such Borrower shall reimburse each Lender within 15 days after demand for any resulting loss or expense incurred by it (or by an existing or prospective Participant in the related Loan), including (without limitation) any loss incurred in obtaining, 35
liquidating or employing deposits from third parties, but excluding loss of margin for the period after any such prepayment or conversion or continuation or failure to borrow, prepay, convert or continue; provided that such Lender shall have delivered to such Borrower and the Administrative Agent a certificate as to the amount of such loss or expense and setting forth the calculation thereof in reasonable detail, which certificate shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. Section 2.16. Computation of Interest and Fees. Interest based on the Prime Rate and, in the case of Committed Alternative Currency Loans denominated in Sterling, the Euro-Currency Rate hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year) and paid for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). All other interest and fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and paid for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day); provided that if the Administrative Agent reasonably determines that a different basis of computation is the market convention for a particular Alternative Currency, such different basis shall be used. Section 2.17. [Intentionally Omitted] Section 2.18. Regulation D Compensation. (a) Each Lender may require each Borrower to pay, contemporaneously with each payment of interest on the Euro-Currency Loans, additional interest on the related Euro-Currency Loan of such Lender at a rate per annum determined by such Lender up to but not exceeding the excess of (i) (A) the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate divided by (B) one minus the Euro-Currency Reserve Percentage over (ii) the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate. Any Lender wishing to require payment of such additional interest (x) shall so notify such Borrower and the Administrative Agent, in which case such additional interest on the Euro-Currency Loans of such Lender shall be payable to such Lender at the place indicated in such notice with respect to each Interest Period commencing at least three Euro-Currency Business Days after the giving of such notice and (y) shall notify such Borrower at least five Euro-Currency Business Days prior to each date on which interest is payable on the Euro-Currency Loans of the amount then due it under this Section. (b) If and so long as any Lender is required to make special deposits with the Bank of England, to maintain reserve asset ratios or to pay fees in respect of such Lender's Euro-Currency Loans, such Lender may require each Borrower to pay, contemporaneously with each payment of interest on each of such Loans, additional interest on such Loan at a rate per annum equal to the Mandatory Costs Rate calculated in accordance with the formula and in the manner set forth in Exhibit H hereto. 36
(c) If and so long as any Lender is required to comply with reserve assets, liquidity, cash margin or other requirements of any monetary or other authority (including any such requirement imposed by the European Central Bank or the European System of Central Banks, but excluding requirements referred to in subsections (a) and (b) above) in respect of any of such Lender's Euro-Currency Loans, such Lender may require each Borrower to pay, contemporaneously with each payment of interest on each of such Lender's Euro-Currency Loans subject to such requirements, additional interest on such Loan at a rate per annum specified by such Lender to be the cost to such Lender of complying with such requirements in relation to such Loan. (d) Any additional interest owed pursuant to subsection (a), (b) or (c) above shall be determined by the relevant Lender, which determination shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes except in the case of manifest error, and notified to each Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) at least five Euro-Currency Business Days before each date on which interest is payable for the relevant Loan, and such additional interest so notified to such Borrower by such Lender shall be payable to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender on each date on which interest is payable for such Loan. Section 2.19. Letters of Credit. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Issuing Lender agrees to issue Letters of Credit hereunder denominated in Dollars or in an Alternative Currency from time to time until the tenth day prior to the Termination Date upon the request of the Company for its account or the account of any Subsidiary; provided that, immediately after each Letter of Credit is issued (i) the Total Outstanding Amount shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the Commitments, (ii) the aggregate Dollar Amount of Letter of Credit Liabilities shall not exceed the Letters of Credit Sublimit and (iii) the sum of the aggregate Dollar Amount of the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Committed Alternative Currency Loans plus the aggregate Dollar Amount of the aggregate Letter of Credit Liabilities for Letters of Credit in an Alternative Currency shall not exceed the Alternative Currency Sublimit. Upon the date of issuance by the Issuing Lender of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to have sold to each Lender, and each Lender shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to have purchased from the Issuing Lender, a participation in such Letter of Credit and the related Letter of Credit Liabilities in the proportion their respective Commitments bear to the aggregate Commitments. (b) The Company shall give the Issuing Lender notice at least (i) five Euro-Currency Business Days prior to the requested issuance of an Alternative Currency Letter of Credit and (ii) three Domestic Business Days prior to the requested issuance of a Dollar Letter of Credit specifying the date such Letter of Credit is to be issued, and describing the terms of such Letter of Credit, the nature of the transactions to be supported thereby and the proposed Alternative Currency of such Letter of Credit (such notice, including 37
any such notice given in connection with the extension of a Letter of Credit, a "NOTICE OF ISSUANCE"). Upon receipt of a Notice of Issuance, the Issuing Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the contents thereof and of the amount of such Lender's participation in such Letter of Credit. The issuance by the Issuing Lender of each Letter of Credit shall, in addition to the conditions precedent set forth in Article 3, be subject to the conditions precedent that such Letter of Credit shall be in such form and contain such terms as shall be satisfactory to the Issuing Lender and that the Company shall have executed and delivered such other instruments and agreements relating to such Letter of Credit as the Issuing Lender shall have reasonably requested. The extension or renewal of any Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be an issuance of such Letter of Credit, and if any Letter of Credit contains a provision pursuant to which it is deemed to be extended unless notice of termination is given by the Issuing Lender, the Issuing Lender shall timely give such notice of termination unless it has theretofore timely received a Notice of Issuance and the other conditions to issuance of a Letter of Credit have also theretofore been met with respect to such extension. (c) Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date that is five Business Days prior to the Termination Date. (d) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Company and each other Lender as to the amount to be paid as a result of such demand or drawing and the payment date. The Company shall be irrevocably and unconditionally obligated forthwith to reimburse the Issuing Lender for any amounts paid by the Issuing Lender upon any drawing under any Letter of Credit, in the currency of such payment (a "REIMBURSEMENT OBLIGATION") without presentment, demand, protest or other formalities of any kind. All such amounts paid by the Issuing Lender and remaining unpaid by the Company shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day until paid at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 2% plus (i) if such amount is denominated in Dollars, the Base Rate for such day and (ii) if such amount is denominated in an Alternative Currency, the sum of the Euro-Currency Margin plus the rate per annum at which one-day deposits in the relevant currency are offered by the principal London office of the Administrative Agent in the London interbank market for such day. In addition, each Lender will pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Lender, immediately upon the Issuing Lender's demand at any time during the period commencing after such drawing until reimbursement therefor in 38
full by the Company, an amount equal to such Lender's ratable share of such drawing (in proportion to its participation therein), together with interest on such amount for each day from the date of the Issuing Lender's demand for such payment (or, if such demand is made after 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on such date, from the next succeeding Domestic Business Day) to the date of payment by such Lender of such amount at a rate of interest per annum equal to (i) if such amount is denominated in Dollars, the Federal Funds Rate and (ii) if such amount is denominated in an Alternative Currency, the rate per annum at which one-day deposits in the relevant currency are offered by the principal London office of the Administrative Agent in the London interbank market for such day. The Issuing Lender will pay to each Lender ratably all amounts received from the Company for application in payment of its reimbursement obligations in respect of any Letter of Credit, but only to the extent such Lender has made payment to the Issuing Lender in respect of such Letter of Credit pursuant hereto. (e) The obligations of the Company and each Lender under subsection 2.19(d) above shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, under all circumstances whatsoever, including without limitation the following circumstances: (i) the use which may be made of any Letter of Credit by, or any acts or omission of, a beneficiary of any Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom the beneficiary may be acting); (ii) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other rights that the Company may have at any time against a beneficiary of a Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom the beneficiary may be acting), the Lenders (including the Issuing Lender) or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement or the Letter of Credit or any document related hereto or thereto or any unrelated transaction; (iii) any statement or any other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect whatsoever; (iv) payment under a Letter of Credit to the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit against presentation to the Issuing Lender of a draft or certificate that does not comply with the terms of the Letter of Credit; or (v) any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by any Lender (including the Issuing Lender), the Administrative Agent or any other Person or any other event or circumstance whatsoever that might, but for the provisions of this subsection (v), 39
constitute a legal or equitable discharge of the Company's or the Lender's obligations hereunder. (f) The Company hereby indemnifies and holds harmless each Lender (including the Issuing Lender) and the Administrative Agent from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses which such Lender or the Administrative Agent may incur (including, without limitation, any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses which the Issuing Lender may incur by reason of or in connection with the failure of any other Lender to fulfill or comply with its obligations to the Issuing Lender hereunder (but nothing herein contained shall affect any rights the Company may have against such defaulting Lender)), and none of the Lenders (including the Issuing Lender) nor the Administrative Agent nor any of their officers or directors or employees or agents shall be liable or responsible, by reason of or in connection with the execution and delivery or transfer of or payment or failure to pay under any Letter of Credit, including without limitation any of the circumstances enumerated in subsection 2.19(e) above, as well as (i) any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or otherwise, (ii) any loss or delay in the transmission of any document required in order to make a drawing under a Letter of Credit, and (iii) any consequences arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Lender, including without limitation any government acts, or any other circumstances whatsoever in making or failing to make payment under such Letter of Credit; provided that the Company shall not be required to indemnify the Issuing Lender for any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses, and the Company shall have a claim for direct (but not consequential) damage suffered by it, to the extent found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been caused by (x) the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Issuing Lender in determining whether a request presented under any Letter of Credit complied with the terms of such Letter of Credit or (y) the Issuing Lender's failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it of a request strictly complying with the terms and conditions of the Letter of Credit. Nothing in this Section 2.19(f) is intended to limit the obligations of the Company under any other provision of this Agreement. To the extent the Company does not indemnify the Issuing Lender as required by this subsection, the Lenders agree to do so ratably in accordance with their Commitments. (g) If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the day that the Company receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Company shall deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash in the relevant currency equal to the Letter of Credit Liabilities as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, 40
and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Company described in clause (g) or (clause (h) of Section 6.01 . Such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Company under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Company's risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Lender for Letter of Credit Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Company for the Letter of Credit Liabilities at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Company under this Agreement. If the Company is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Company within three Euro-Dollar Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived. Section 2.20. Incremental Increase in Commitments. (a) At any time, if no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Company may, if it so elects but subject to due authorization by all necessary corporate action, increase the aggregate amount of the Commitments (the "INCREMENTAL COMMITMENTS"), either by designating one or more financial institutions not theretofore Lenders to become a Lender (such designation to be effective only with the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), or by agreeing with one or more existing Lenders that such Lender's Commitment shall be increased. The Incremental Commitments shall be treated as Commitments for all purposes under this Agreement, except as specifically addressed herein. No Lender shall be obligated to make any Incremental Commitment unless it shall elect to do so in its sole and absolute discretion in response to the Company's request. (b) Upon execution and delivery by the Company and such Lender or other financial institution of an instrument (the "INCREMENTAL COMMITMENT NOTICE") in form reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent (which instrument shall specify the amount of each Commitment), such existing Lender shall have a Commitment as therein set forth or such other financial institution shall become a Lender with a Commitment as therein set forth and all the rights and obligations of a Lender with such a Commitment hereunder; provided that: 41
(i) the Company shall provide prompt notice of such increase to the Administrative Agent, who shall promptly notify the Lenders; (ii) the amount of such Incremental Commitment, together with all other increases in the aggregate amount of the Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.20 since the date of this Agreement, shall not exceed $150,000,000; (iii) the Letter of Credit Sublimit and Alternative Currency Sublimit shall each be increased by an amount which bears the same ratio to the Increased Commitments as the Letter of Credit Sublimit and Alternative Currency Sublimit, respectively, bears to the aggregate Commitments then existing; and (iv) after giving effect to such increase or new Commitment, the amount of the Commitment of any Lender shall not exceed 20% of the aggregate amount of the Commitments (excluding, for purposes of this clause (iv), any increase resulting solely from the merger or the acquisition of one Lender into or by another Lender). ARTICLE 3 CONDITIONS Section 3.01. Closing. The closing hereunder shall occur upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of the following documents, each dated the Closing Date unless otherwise indicated: (a) an opinion of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, LLP, counsel for the Obligors, substantially in the form of Exhibit E hereto and covering such additional matters relating to the transactions contemplated hereby as the Required Lenders may reasonably request; (b) an opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell, special counsel for the Administrative Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit F hereto and covering such additional matters relating to the transactions contemplated hereby as the Required Lenders may reasonably request; (c) an advice from the Administrative Agent that it has received all fees and other amounts due and payable on or prior to the Closing Date, including reimbursement or payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses to be reimbursed or paid by the Company; (d) all documents the Administrative Agent may reasonably request relating to the existence of each of the Company and the Company Guarantor, the corporate authority for and the validity of this Agreement and the Notes, and 42
any other matters relevant hereto, all in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent; and (e) the Administrative Agent shall have received evidence reasonably satisfactory to it that all principal of any loans outstanding under, and all accrued interest and fees under, the Existing Credit Agreement shall have been paid in full and that the commitments under the Existing Credit Agreement have been terminated. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Company and the Lenders of the Closing Date, and such notice shall be conclusive and binding on all parties hereto. Section 3.02. Borrowings and Issuances of Letters of Credit. The obligation of any Lender to make a Loan on the occasion of any Borrowing and the obligation of the Issuing Lender to issue (or renew or extend the term of ) any Letter of Credit is subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions: (a) receipt by the Administrative Agent of a Notice of Borrowing as required by Section 2.02 or Section 2.03, or receipt by the Issuing Lender of a Notice of Issuance as required by Section 2.19, as the case may be; (b) the fact that, immediately after such Borrowing or issuance of such Letter of Credit (i) the Total Outstanding Amount will not exceed the aggregate amount of the Commitments, (ii) the aggregate amount of Letter of Credit Liabilities will not exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit, and (iii) the sum of the aggregate Dollar Amount of the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Committed Alternative Currency Loans plus the aggregate Dollar Amount of the aggregate Letter of Credit Liabilities for Letters of Credit in an Alternative Currency shall not exceed the Alternative Currency Sublimit; (c) the fact that, immediately before and after such Borrowing or issuance of such Letter of Credit, no Default shall have occurred and be continuing; (d) the fact that the representations and warranties of the Company and the Company Guarantor (and, in the case of a Borrowing or an issuance of a Letter of Credit by an Eligible Subsidiary, of such Eligible Subsidiary) contained in this Agreement shall be true on and as of the date of such Borrowing or issuance of such Letter of Credit; and (e) the closing shall have occurred in accordance with Section 3.01. Each Borrowing and issuance of a Letter of Credit hereunder shall be deemed to be a representation and warranty by the Company and the Company Guarantor (and, 43
in the case of a Borrowing or an issuance of a Letter of Credit by an Eligible Subsidiary, of such Eligible Subsidiary) on the date of such Borrowing as to the facts specified in clauses (b), (c) and (d) of this Section. Section 3.03. First Borrowing by Each Eligible Subsidiary. The obligation of each Lender to make a Loan, and the obligation of the Issuing Lender to issue a Letter of Credit, on the occasion of the first Borrowing by or issuance of a Letter of Credit for the account of each Eligible Subsidiary is subject to the satisfaction of the following further conditions: (a) receipt by the Administrative Agent of an opinion of counsel for such Eligible Subsidiary reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent covering such matters relating to the transactions contemplated hereby as the Required Lenders may reasonably request; and (b) receipt by the Administrative Agent of all documents which it may reasonably request relating to the existence of such Eligible Subsidiary, the corporate authority of and the validity of the Election to Participate of such Eligible Subsidiary, this Agreement and the Notes (if any) of such Eligible Subsidiary, and any other matters relevant thereto, all in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

Section 4.02. Corporate and Governmental Authorization; No Contravention. The execution, delivery and performance by each of the Company and the Company Guarantor (and, as applicable, each Eligible Subsidiary) of this Agreement and by the Company (and, as applicable, each Eligible Subsidiary) of the Notes (if any) are within the corporate powers of the Company and the Company Guarantor, as applicable (and, as applicable, each Eligible Subsidiary), have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or official and do not contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision of applicable law or regulation or of the certificate of incorporation, organizational documents or by-laws of the Company or the Company Guarantor, as applicable (and, as applicable, each Eligible Subsidiary), or of any agreement evidencing or governing Debt or of any other material agreement, or of any judgment, injunction, order, decree or other material instrument binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Section 4.03. Binding Effect. This Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of each Obligor and each Note (if any), when executed and delivered by the Company (and, as applicable, any Eligible Subsidiary) in accordance with this Agreement, will constitute a valid and binding obligation of the Company (and, as applicable, such Eligible Subsidiary), in each case enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as the same may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity. Section 4.04. Financial Information. (a) The consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as of June 30, 2004 and the related consolidated statements of earnings and cash flows for the fiscal year then ended, reported on by KPMG LLP, a copy of which has been delivered to each of the Lenders, fairly present, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, the consolidated financial position of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as of such date and their consolidated results of operations and cash flows for such fiscal year. (b) The unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as of March 31, 2005 and the related unaudited consolidated statements of earnings and cash flows for the nine months then 45

Section 4.06. Compliance with ERISA. Each member of the ERISA Group has fulfilled its obligations under the minimum funding standards of ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code with respect to each Plan and is in compliance in all material respects with the presently applicable provisions of ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code with respect to each Plan. No member of the ERISA Group has (i) sought a waiver of the minimum funding standard under Section 412 of the Internal Revenue Code in respect of any Plan, (ii) failed to make any contribution or payment to any Plan or Multiemployer Plan or in respect of any Benefit Arrangement, or made any amendment to any Plan or Benefit Arrangement, which has resulted or could result in the imposition of a Lien or the posting of a bond or other security under ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code or (iii) incurred any liability under Title IV of ERISA other than a liability to the PBGC for premiums under Section 4007 of ERISA. Section 4.07. Environmental Matters. In the ordinary course of its business, the Company conducts an ongoing review of the effect of Environmental Laws on the business, operations and properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in the course of which it identifies and evaluates associated liabilities and costs (including, without limitation, any capital or operating expenditures required for clean-up or closure of properties presently or previously owned, any capital or operating expenditures required to achieve or maintain compliance with environmental protection standards imposed by law or as a condition of any license, permit or contract, any related constraints on operating activities, including any periodic or permanent shutdown of any facility or reduction in the level of or change in the nature of operations conducted thereat, any costs or 46
liabilities in connection with off-site disposal of wastes or Hazardous Substances, and any actual or potential liabilities to third parties, including employees, and any related costs and expenses). On the basis of this review, the Company has reasonably concluded that such associated liabilities and costs, including the costs of compliance with Environmental Laws, are unlikely to have a Material Adverse Effect. Section 4.08. Taxes. The Company and its Subsidiaries have filed all United States Federal income tax returns and all other material tax returns which are required to be filed by them and have paid all taxes due pursuant to such returns or pursuant to any assessment received by the Company or any Subsidiary, other than taxes due pursuant to any such assessment which are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings.

Section 6.02. Notice of Default. The Administrative Agent shall give notice to the Company under Section 6.01(c) promptly upon being requested to do so by any Lender and shall thereupon notify all the Lenders thereof. ARTICLE 7 THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT Section 7.01. Appointment and Authorizations.

Section 7.08. Successor Agents. The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving notice thereof to the Lenders and each Obligor and shall resign if requested by the Required Lenders. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right (after consulting with the Company) to appoint a successor to the Administrative Agent. If no successor to the Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders, and 57
shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a commercial bank organized or licensed under the laws of the United States of America or of any State thereof and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000.

ARTICLE 8 CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES Section 8.01. Basis for Determining Interest Rate Inadequate or Unfair. If on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period for any Euro-Currency Loan or Competitive Bid LIBOR Loan: (a) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Reference Banks that deposits in the relevant currency (in the applicable amounts) are not being offered to the Reference Banks in the relevant market for such Interest Period, or (b) in the case of Euro-Currency Loans, Lenders having 50% or more of the aggregate amount of the Commitments advise the Administrative Agent that the London Interbank Offered Rate as determined by the Administrative Agent will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding their Euro-Currency Loans in the relevant currency for such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders, whereupon until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, (i) the 58
obligations of the Lenders to make Euro-Currency Loans in the relevant currency or to continue or convert outstanding Loans as or into Euro-Currency Loans in the relevant currency, as the case may be, shall be suspended, (ii) each outstanding Euro-Currency Loan shall be prepaid (or in the case of an affected Loan denominated in dollars, converted into a Base Rate Loan) on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto, (iii) unless the Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent at least two Domestic Business Days before the date of any Fixed Rate Borrowing denominated in dollars for which a Notice of Borrowing has previously been given that it elects not to borrow on such date, (x) if such Fixed Rate Borrowing is a Committed Dollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall instead be made as a Base Rate Borrowing and (y) if such Fixed Rate Borrowing is a Competitive Bid LIBOR Borrowing, the Competitive Bid LIBOR Loans comprising such Borrowing shall bear interest for each day from and including the first day to but excluding the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto at the Base Rate for such day and (iv) any request for a Committed Alternative Currency Loan shall be ineffective. Section 8.02. Illegality. If, on or after the date of this Agreement, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender (or its Euro-Currency Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency shall make it unlawful or impossible for any Lender (or its Euro-Currency Lending Office) to make, maintain or fund any of its Euro-Currency Loans in any currency and such Lender shall so notify the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the other Lenders and the Company, whereupon until such Lender notifies the Company and the Administrative Agent that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligation of such Lender to make Euro-Currency Loans in such currency, or to convert or continue outstanding Loans into Euro-Currency Loans in such currency, shall be suspended. Before giving any notice to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section, such Lender shall designate a different Euro-Currency Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice and will not, in the sole judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender. If such notice is given, each Euro-Currency Loan of such Lender then outstanding in such currency shall be converted at the Exchange Rate on the day of conversion to a Base Rate Loan either (a) on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable to such Euro-Currency Loan if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain and fund such Loan to such day or (b) immediately if such Lender shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain and fund such Loan to such day. 59
Section 8.03. Increased Cost and Reduced Return. (a) If on or after (x) the date hereof, in the case of any Committed Loan or Letter of Credit or any obligation to make Committed Loans or issue or participate in any Letter of Credit or (y) the date of any related Competitive Bid Quote, in the case of any Competitive Bid Loan, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve (including, without limitation, any such requirement imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, but excluding with respect to any Euro-Currency Loan any such requirement with respect to which such Lender is entitled to compensation during the relevant interest period under Section 2.20), special deposit, insurance assessment or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) or shall impose on any Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) or on the London interbank market any other condition affecting its Fixed Rate Loans, its Note (if any) or its obligation to make Fixed Rate Loans or its obligations hereunder with respect of Letters of Credit and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) of making or maintaining any Fixed Rate Loan or issuing or participating in any Letter of Credit, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) under this Agreement or under its Note (if any) with respect thereto, by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then, within 15 days after demand by such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Company shall pay, or shall cause another Borrower to pay, to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction. (b) If any Lender shall have determined that, after the date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change in any such law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on capital of such Lender (or its Parent) as a consequence of such Lender's obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender (or its Parent) could have achieved but for such adoption, change, request or directive (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time, within 15 days after demand by such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the 60
Company shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender (or its Parent) for such reduction. (c) Each Lender will promptly notify the Company and the Administrative Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle such Lender to compensation pursuant to this Section and will designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the sole judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender. A certificate of any Lender claiming compensation under this Section and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder and the calculation thereof in reasonable detail shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining such amount, such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods. Section 8.04. Taxes. (a) For the purposes of this Section 8.04, the following terms have the following meanings: "TAXES" means any and all present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings with respect to any payment by any Obligor pursuant to this Agreement or under any Note, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding (i) in the case of each Lender and the Administrative Agent, taxes imposed on its income, and franchise or similar taxes imposed on it, by a jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) is organized or in which its principal executive office is located or, in the case of each Lender, in which its Applicable Lending Office is located and (ii) in the case of each Lender, any United States withholding tax imposed on such payments but only to the extent that such Lender is subject to United States withholding tax that is not creditable against such Lender's tax liability in the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender is organized or in which its principal executive office is located or in which its Applicable Lending Office is located at the time such Lender first becomes a party to this Agreement. "OTHER TAXES" means any present or future stamp or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes, or similar charges or levies, which arise from any payment made pursuant to this Agreement or under any Note or from the execution or delivery of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any Note. (b) Any and all payments by any Obligor to or for the account of any Lender or the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any Note shall be made without deduction for any Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that, if an Obligor shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes or Other Taxes from any such payments, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional 61
sums payable under this Section) such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Obligor shall make such deductions, (iii) such Obligor shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law and (iv) such Obligor shall furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 10.01, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof. (c) Each Obligor agrees to indemnify each Lender and the Administrative Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section) paid by such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto. This indemnification shall be paid within 30 days after such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) makes demand therefor. (d) Each Lender organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this Agreement in the case of each Lender listed on the signature pages hereof and on or prior to the date on which it becomes a Lender in the case of each other Lender, and from time to time thereafter if requested in writing by the Company (but only so long as such Lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide the Company and the Administrative Agent with Internal Revenue Service form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, as appropriate, or any successor form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, certifying that such Lender is entitled to benefits under an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party which exempts the Lender from United States withholding tax or reduces the rate of withholding tax on payments of interest for the account of such Lender or certifying that the income receivable pursuant to this Agreement is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. (e) For any period with respect to which a Lender has failed to provide the Company or the Administrative Agent with the appropriate form pursuant to Section 8.04(d) (unless such failure is due to a change in treaty, law or regulation occurring subsequent to the date on which such form originally was required to be provided), such Lender shall not be entitled to indemnification under Section 8.04(b) or (c) with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States; provided that if a Lender, which is otherwise exempt from or subject to a reduced rate of withholding tax, becomes subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required hereunder, the Company shall take such steps as such Lender shall reasonably request to assist such Lender to recover such Taxes. 62
(f) If any Obligor is required to pay additional amounts to or for the account of any Lender pursuant to this Section, then such Lender will change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office if, in the sole judgment of such Lender, such change (i) will eliminate or reduce any such additional payment which may thereafter accrue and (ii) is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender. Section 8.05. Base Rate Loans Substituted for Affected Fixed Rate Loans. If (i) the obligation of any Lender to make, or to convert or continue outstanding Loans to, Euro-Currency Loans in any currency has been suspended pursuant to Section 8.02 or (ii) any Lender has demanded compensation under Section 8.03 or 8.04 with respect to its Euro-Currency Loans in any currency and the Company shall, by at least five Euro-Dollar Business Days' prior notice to such Lender through the Administrative Agent, have elected that the provisions of this Section shall apply to such Lender, then, unless and until such Lender notifies the Company that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension or demand for compensation no longer exist: (a) all Loans which would otherwise be made by such Lender as (or continued as or converted into) Euro-Currency Loans in such currency shall be made instead as Base Rate Loans (in the case of Committed Alternative Currency Loans, in the same Dollar Amount as the Euro-Currency Loan that such Lender would otherwise have made in the Alternative Currency (on which interest and principal shall be payable contemporaneously with the related Fixed Rate Loans of the other Lenders); and (b) after each of its Euro-Currency Loans in such currency has been repaid (or converted to a Base Rate Loan), all payments of principal which would otherwise be applied to repay such Fixed Rate Loans shall be applied to repay its Base Rate Loans instead. If such Lender notifies the Company that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer apply, the principal amount of each such Base Rate Loan shall be converted into a Euro-Currency Loan denominated in the relevant currency, as the case may be, on the first day of the next succeeding Interest Period applicable to the related Euro-Currency Loans of the other Lenders. If such Loan is converted into an Committed Alternative Currency Loan, such Lender, the Administrative Agent and the relevant Borrower shall make such arrangements as shall be required (including increasing or decreasing the amount of such Committed Alternative Currency Loan) so that such Committed Alternative Currency Loan shall be in the same amount as it would have been if the provisions of this Section had never applied thereto. Section 8.06. Substitution of Lenders. If (i) the obligation of any Lender to make Euro-Currency Loans has been suspended pursuant to Section 8.02 or (ii) any Lender has demanded compensation under Section 8.03 or 8.04, the 63
Company shall have the right, with the assistance of the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender, to seek a substitute lender or lenders (which may be one or more of the Lenders), satisfactory to the Company, the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender, to purchase the Loans and assume the Commitments and Letter of Credit Liabilities of such Lender, for a purchase price equal to the aggregate outstanding principal of such Loans (together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon and breakage costs, if any) or such other purchase price as such Lender and substitute lender or lenders shall agree upon.

Each such notice, request or other communication shall be effective (i) if given by facsimile transmission, when transmitted to the facsimile number specified in this Section and confirmation of receipt is received, (ii) if given by mail, 72 hours after such communication is deposited in the mails with first class postage prepaid, addressed as aforesaid or (iii) if given by any other means, when delivered at the address specified in this Section; provided that notices to the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Lender under Article 2 or Article 8 shall not be effective until received. Section 10.02. No Waivers. No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any Note shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law. Section 10.03. Expenses; Indemnification. (a) The Company shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent and the Arranger, including reasonable fees and disbursements of special counsel for the Administrative Agent, in connection with the preparation and administration of this Agreement, any waiver or consent hereunder or any amendment hereof or any Default or alleged Default hereunder and (ii) if an Event of Default occurs, all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and each Lender, including (without duplication) the fees and disbursements of outside counsel and the allocated cost of inside counsel, in connection with such Event of Default and collection, bankruptcy, insolvency and other enforcement proceedings resulting therefrom. 65
(b) The Company agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender, the Arranger and each Lender, their respective affiliates and the respective directors, officers, agents and employees of the foregoing (each an "INDEMNITEE") and hold each Indemnitee harmless from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses of any kind, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel, which may be incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with any investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding (whether or not such Indemnitee shall be designated a party thereto) brought or overtly threatened relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any actual or proposed use of proceeds of Loans hereunder; provided that no Indemnitee shall have the right to be indemnified hereunder for such Indemnitee's own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. Each Indemnitee agrees to notify the Company promptly of any proceeding in respect of which it will seek indemnification hereunder; provided, however, that the failure of any Indemnitee so to notify the Company shall not affect the rights of such Indemnitee hereunder; but provided, further, that the Company shall be entitled to assert by separate action against such Indemnitee any claim for actual damages incurred by the Company as a consequence of such failure by such Indemnitee to give such notice. In the event any action, suit or proceeding is brought against any Indemnitee by any Person other than a Lender, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or any of their respective affiliates (a "THIRD PARTY ACTION"), (i) the Company shall be entitled, upon written notice to such Indemnitee, to assume the investigation and defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnitee unless (x) the employment by such Indemnitee of separate counsel has been specifically approved by the Company in writing or (y) the designated parties to the proceeding in which such claim, demand, action or cause of action has been asserted include (or are reasonably likely to include) both such Indemnitee and any of the Obligor, or any Affiliate (each, a "DESIGNATED RELATED PARTY") and in the opinion of counsel for such Indemnitee there exist one or more defenses that may be available to such Indemnitee which are in conflict with those available to any designated related party, (ii) such Indemnitee shall be entitled to employ separate counsel and to participate in the investigation and defense of any such third party action (whether or not the Company has elected to assume such investigation and defense as contemplated by clause (i) above) and (iii) the fees and expenses of any separate counsel employed by any Indemnitee in connection with any such third party action shall be borne by such Indemnitee except (x) under the circumstances contemplated by subclauses (x) and (y) of clause (i) above or (y) if such Indemnitee has reasonably concluded that the Company is failing actively and diligently to defend such third party action (whether or not the Company has elected to assume such investigation and defense as contemplated by clause (i) above). The Company shall not settle or compromise any action or claim without the relevant Indemnitee's consent if the settlement or compromise involves any performance by, or adverse admission of, such Indemnitee. 66
Section 10.04. Sharing of Set-Offs. Each Lender agrees that if it shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, receive payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of principal and interest due with respect to any Loan and Letter of Credit Liabilities held by it which is greater than the proportion received by any other Lender in respect of the aggregate amount of principal and interest due with respect to any Loan and Letter of Credit Liability held by such other Lender, the Lender receiving such proportionately greater payment shall purchase such participations in the Loans and Letter of Credit Liabilities held by the other Lenders, and such other adjustments shall be made, as may be required so that all such payments of principal and interest with respect to the Loans and Letter of Credit Liabilities held by the Lenders shall be shared by the Lenders pro rata; provided that nothing in this Section shall impair the right of any Lender to exercise any right of set-off or counterclaim it may have and to apply the amount subject to such exercise to the payment of indebtedness of the Obligors other than its indebtedness hereunder. Each Obligor agrees, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any holder of a participation in a Loan and Letter of Credit Liability, whether or not acquired pursuant to the foregoing arrangements, may exercise rights of set-off or counterclaim and other rights with respect to such participation as fully as if such holder of a participation were a direct creditor of such Obligor in the amount of such participation. Section 10.05. Amendments and Waivers. Except as explicitly set forth in Section 2.12(b), any provision of this Agreement or the Notes (if any) may be amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed by each Obligor and the Required Lenders (and, if the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Lender are affected thereby, by the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender, respectively); provided that, except as explicitly set forth in Section 2.12(b), no such amendment or waiver shall, (x) (i) increase or decrease the Commitment of any Lender (except for a ratable decrease in the Commitments of all Lenders) or subject any Lender to any additional obligation unless signed by such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal of or rate of interest on any Loan or the amount to be reimbursed in respect of any Letter of Credit or any interest thereon or any fees hereunder unless signed by each Lender directly affected thereby or (iii) postpone the date fixed for any payment of principal of or interest on any Loan or for reimbursement in respect of any Letter of Credit or any fees hereunder or for any scheduled reduction or termination of any Commitment unless signed by each Lender directly affected thereby or (y) unless signed by all the Lenders (i) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under Article 11, (ii) change the percentage of the Commitments or of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans or the aggregate amount of the Letter of Credit Liabilities, or the number of Lenders, which shall be required for the Lenders or any of them to take any action under this Section or any other provision of this Agreement or (iii) amend or waive 67
the provisions of Section 10.04, this Section 10.05, Section 10.06(a) or the definition of Required Lenders. Increases in Commitments and related modifications pursuant to Section 2.20 are not amendments subject to the provisions of this Section. Section 10.06. Successors and Assigns. The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except that none of the Obligors may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights under this Agreement without the prior written consent of all Lenders. (b) Any Lender may at any time grant to one or more banks or other institutions (each a "PARTICIPANT") participating interests in its Commitments or any or all of its Loans and Letter of Credit Liabilities. In the event of any such grant by a Lender of a participating interest to a Participant, whether or not upon notice to each Obligor and the Administrative Agent, such Lender shall remain responsible for the performance of its obligations hereunder, and each Obligor and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement pursuant to which any Lender may grant such a participating interest shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right and responsibility to enforce the obligations of the Borrowers hereunder including, without limitation, the right to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such participation agreement may provide that such Lender will not agree to any modification, amendment or waiver of this Agreement described in Section 10.05 without the consent of the Participant. Each Obligor agrees that each Participant shall, to the extent provided in its participation agreement, be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.18 and Article 8 with respect to its participating interest. An assignment or other transfer which is not permitted by subsection (c) or (d) below shall be given effect for purposes of this Agreement only to the extent of and as a participating interest granted in accordance with this subsection (b). (c) With the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld (provided that if an Assignee is an affiliate of such transferor Lender or was a Lender immediately prior to such assignment or an Approved Fund, no such consent from the Company shall be required), any Lender may at any time assign to one or more banks or other institutions (each an "ASSIGNEE") all, or a proportionate part (equivalent to an initial Commitment in an amount of not less than $10,000,000) of all, of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and the Notes (if any), and such Assignee shall assume such rights and obligations, pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption Agreement in substantially the form of 68
Exhibit G hereto; provided that such assignment may, but need not, include rights of the transferor Lender in respect of outstanding Competitive Bid Loans. Upon execution and delivery of such instrument and payment by such Assignee to such transferor Lender of an amount equal to the purchase price agreed between such transferor Lender and such Assignee, such Assignee shall be a Lender party to this Agreement and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Lender with Commitments as set forth in such instrument of assumption, and the transferor Lender shall be released from its obligations hereunder to a corresponding extent, and no further consent or action by any party shall be required. Upon the consummation of any assignment pursuant to this subsection (c), the transferor Lender, the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers shall make appropriate arrangements so that, if required, a new Note is issued to the Assignee. In connection with any such assignment, the transferor Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent an administrative fee for processing such assignment in the amount of $3,500. If the Assignee is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof, it shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent certification as to exemption from deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes in accordance with Section 8.04. (d) Any Lender may at any time assign all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and its Note (if any) to a Federal Reserve Bank. No such assignment shall release the transferor Lender from its obligations hereunder. (e) No Assignee, Participant or other transferee of any Lender's rights shall be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 8.03 or 8.04 than such Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the rights transferred, unless such transfer is made with the Company's prior written consent or by reason of the provisions of Section 8.02, 8.03 or 8.04 requiring such Lender to designate a different Applicable Lending Office under certain circumstances or at a time when the circumstances giving rise to such greater payment did not exist. (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a "GRANTING LENDER") may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an "SPC") sponsored by a Granting Lender and identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Company, the option to provide to the Company all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to make any Loan and (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof. The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitments of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such 69
Granting Lender. Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement (all liability for which shall remain with the Granting Lender). In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPC, it will not institute against, or join any other Person in instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State thereof. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 10.06, any SPC may (i) with notice to, but without the prior written consent of, the Company and the Administrative Agent and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any Loans to the Granting Lender or to any financial institution providing liquidity and/or credit support to or for the account of such SPC to support the funding or maintenance of Loans; provided that any such assignment to a financial institution other than to the Granting Lender shall require the consent of the Company and the Administrative Agent, which consent shall be provided in the sole and absolute discretion of the Company or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, and (ii) disclose any non-public information relating to its Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC; provided that any such Person (other than a rating agency) signs a confidentiality agreement which contains substantially the same provisions as set forth in Section 10.11. As this Section 10.06(f) applies to any particular SPC, this Section 10.06(f) may not be amended without the written consent of such SPC. Additionally, the Company shall not be subject to any increased costs pursuant to Section 8.03, indemnity claims pursuant to Section 10.03(b) or increased taxes pursuant to Section 8.04 (collectively, "INCREASED COSTS") with respect to an SPC if the Company would not have been subjected to such Increased Costs had the Loan not been funded (directly or indirectly) by the SPC and any payment for any such Increased Costs shall be limited to the amounts that the Company would have been required to pay to the Granting Lender if such Loan had not been so funded by the SPC. Section 10.07. Collateral. Each of the Lenders represents to the Administrative Agent and each of the other Lenders that it in good faith is not relying upon any "margin stock" (as defined in Regulation U) as collateral in the extension or maintenance of the credit provided for in this Agreement. Section 10.08. Governing Law, Submission to Jurisdiction . This Agreement and each Note (if any) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. Each Obligor hereby submits to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and of any New York State court sitting in New 70
York City for purposes of all legal proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Each Obligor irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such proceeding brought in such a court and any claim that any such proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Section 10.09. Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding among the parties hereto and supersedes any and all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall become effective upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of counterparts hereof signed by each of the parties hereto (or, in the case of any party as to which an executed counterpart shall not have been received, receipt by the Administrative Agent in form satisfactory to it of telegraphic, telex, facsimile or other written confirmation from such party of execution of a counterpart hereof by such party). Section 10.10. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OBLIGOR, THE AGENTS AND THE LENDERS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. Section 10.11. Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent and each Lender agrees to keep any information delivered or made available by any Obligor pursuant to this Agreement confidential from anyone other than persons employed or retained by the Administrative Agent or such Lender who are engaged in evaluating, approving, structuring or administering the credit facility contemplated hereby; provided that nothing herein shall prevent the Administrative Agent or any Lender from disclosing such information (a) to any persons employed or retained by the Administrative Agent or any other Lender who are engaged in evaluating, approving, structuring or administering the credit facility contemplated hereby, (b) to any other Person if reasonably incidental to the administration of the credit facility contemplated hereby so long as such Person agrees to keep such information confidential in accordance with the provisions of this Section 10.11, (c) upon the order of any court or administrative agency, (d) upon the request or demand of any regulatory agency or authority, (e) which had been publicly disclosed other than as a result of a disclosure by the Administrative Agent or any Lender prohibited by this Agreement or, to the knowledge of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, by any other Person as a result of a disclosure by such Person in violation of an obligation of confidentiality, (f) to the extent necessary, in connection with any litigation to which the Administrative Agent, any Lender or its subsidiaries 71
or Parent may be a party, (g) to the extent necessary in connection with the exercise of any remedy hereunder, (h) to such Lender's or the Administrative Agent's legal counsel and independent auditors or (i) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially similar to those contained in this Section, to (i) any actual or proposed Participant or Assignee or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to any Borrower and its obligations. Each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall give the Company prompt notice of any disclosure made by such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, as permitted pursuant to clauses (c), (d) (other than any such disclosure made by any Lender to bank examiners during any examination of such Lender conducted in the ordinary course by such examiners) or (f) of this Section, but solely to the extent permitted by law and, in the case of any disclosure permitted pursuant to clause (f), solely to the extent that the interests of such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, and the applicable Obligor in the relevant litigation are not adverse in any material respect. Section 10.12. Conversion of Currencies. (a) If, for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum owing hereunder in one currency into another currency, each party hereto (including any Eligible Subsidiary) agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction the first currency could be purchased with such other currency on the Euro-Currency Business Day immediately preceding the day on which final judgment is given. (b) The obligations of each Borrower in respect of any sum due to any party hereto or any holder of the obligations owing hereunder (the "APPLICABLE CREDITOR") shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the "JUDGMENT CURRENCY") other than the currency in which such sum is stated to be due hereunder (the "AGREEMENT CURRENCY"), be discharged only to the extent that, on the Euro-Currency Business Day following receipt by the Applicable Creditor of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Applicable Creditor may in accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency; if the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Applicable Creditor in the Agreement Currency, such Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Applicable Creditor against such loss. The obligations of the Borrowers contained in this Section 10.12 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of all other amounts owing hereunder. Section 10.13. European Economic and Monetary Union. (a) Definitions. In this Section 10.13 and in each other provision of this Agreement to which 72
reference is made in this Section 10.13 expressly or impliedly, the following terms have the meanings given to them in this Section 10.13: "EURO UNIT" means the currency unit of the Euro; "NATIONAL CURRENCY UNIT" means the unit of currency (other than a Euro Unit) of a Participating Member State; (b) Redenomination and Eligible Currencies. On the date on which any state that is not a Participating Member State on the date hereof becomes a Participating Member State, each obligation under this Agreement of a party to this Agreement which has been denominated in the National Currency Unit of such Participating Member State shall be redenominated into the Euro Unit in accordance with EMU Legislation. (c) Loans. Any Loan in the currency of a state that becomes a Participating Member State after the date hereof shall be made in the Euro Unit after the date on which such state becomes a Participating Member State. (d) Payments by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders. Any amount payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders under this Agreement in the currency of a state that becomes a Participating Member State after the date hereof shall be paid in the Euro Unit after the date on which such state becomes a Participating Member State. Section 10.14. USA Patriot Act. Each Lender subject to the Act hereby notifies the Borrowers that pursuant to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the "ACT"), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each Borrower, which information includes the names and addresses of each Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender to identify each Borrower in accordance with the Act. ARTICLE 11 GUARANTY Section 11.01. The Guaranty. Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally guarantees the full and punctual payment (whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise) of the principal of and interest on each Loan made to each Borrower pursuant to this Agreement, and the full and punctual payment of all other amounts payable by each Borrower under this Agreement (including any interest, fees, costs, expenses and other obligations that accrue after the commencement of any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar case or proceeding, or which would have accrued but for such case, proceeding or other action and whether or not such interest, fees, costs, expenses or other 73
obligations are allowed or allowable as a claim in such case, proceeding or other action). Upon failure by any Borrower to pay punctually any such amount, each Guarantor (in case of the obligations of the Company, only the Company Guarantor) shall forthwith on demand pay the amount not so paid at the place and in the manner and currency specified in this Agreement. Section 11.02. Guaranty Unconditional. The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall be unconditional and absolute and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, shall not be released, discharged or otherwise affected by: (i) any extension, renewal, settlement, compromise, waiver or release in respect of any obligation of any Borrower under this Agreement or any Note, by operation of law or otherwise; (ii) any modification or amendment of or supplement to this Agreement or any Note; (iii) any release, impairment, non-perfection or invalidity of any direct or indirect security for any obligation of any Borrower under this Agreement or any Note; (iv) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of any Borrower, or any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting any Borrower or its assets or any resulting release or discharge of any obligation of any Borrower contained in this Agreement or any Note; (v) the existence of any claim, set-off or other rights which either Guarantor may have at any time against any Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender, any Lender or any other Person, whether in connection herewith or any unrelated transactions, provided that nothing herein shall prevent the assertion of any such claim by separate suit or compulsory counterclaim; (vi) any invalidity or unenforceability relating to or against any Borrower for any reason of this Agreement or any Note, or any provision of applicable law or regulation purporting to prohibit the payment by any Borrower of the principal of or interest on any Note or any other amount payable by any Borrower under this Agreement; or (vii) any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by any Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender, any Lender or any other Person or any other circumstance whatsoever 74
which might, but for the provisions of this paragraph, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of or defense to the Guarantor's obligations hereunder. Section 11.03. Discharge Only upon Payment in Full; Reinstatement in Certain Circumstances. Each Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall remain in full force and effect until the Commitments shall have terminated, the principal of and interest on the Loans and all other amounts payable by the Borrowers under this Agreement shall have been paid in full and no Letter of Credit Liabilities remain outstanding. If at any time any payment of the principal of or interest on any Loan, any reimbursement obligation or any other amount payable by any Borrower under this Agreement is rescinded or must be otherwise restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of such Borrower or otherwise, each Guarantor's obligations hereunder with respect to such payment shall be reinstated as though such payment had been due but not made at such time. Section 11.04. Waiver by the Guarantor. Each Guarantor irrevocably waives acceptance hereof, presentment, demand, protest and any notice not provided for herein, as well as any requirement that at any time any action be taken by any Person against any Borrower or any other Person. Section 11.05. Subrogation. Upon making any payment with respect to any Borrower hereunder, each applicable Guarantor shall be subrogated to the rights of the payee against such Borrower with respect to such payment; provided that such Guarantor shall not enforce any payment by way of subrogation until all amounts of principal of and interest on the Loans and all other amounts payable by such Borrower under this Agreement have been paid in full and no Letter of Credit Liabilities remain outstanding. Section 11.06. Stay of Acceleration. If acceleration of the time for payment of any amount payable by any Borrower under this Agreement or the Notes (if any) is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of such Borrower, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of this Agreement shall nonetheless be payable by each applicable Guarantor hereunder forthwith on demand by the Agent made at the request of the requisite proportion of the Lenders specified in Section 6.01 of this Agreement. Section 11.07. Limitation of Liability. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article 11, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render its obligations hereunder subject to avoidance under Section 548 of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provisions of applicable law of any State of the United States of America. 75
Section 11.08. Notice of Commitment Termination. The Company hereby gives notice that the Company wishes to terminate the commitments under the Existing Credit Agreement, effective as of the Effective Date. Each Lender that is a party to the Existing Credit Agreement, by its execution hereof, waives any requirement of prior notice set forth therein as a condition to the right of the Company to terminate the commitments thereunder. 76

COMMITMENT SCHEDULE

SCHEDULE 4.05 On March 30, 2005, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California entered a Final Judgment approving the settlement agreement we entered into in July 2003 with the plaintiffs, the other Manufacturer Defendants (as defined below) and the Department Store Defendants (as defined below) in a consolidated class action lawsuit that had been pending in the Superior Court of the State of California in Marin County since 1998. On April 29, 2005, a notice of appeal was filed. If the appeal is resolved satisfactorily, the Final Judgment will result in the plaintiffs' claims being dismissed, with prejudice, in their entirety in both the Federal and California actions. There was no finding or admission of any wrongdoing by the Company or any other defendant in this lawsuit. We entered into the settlement agreement solely to avoid protracted and costly litigation. In connection with the settlement agreement, the defendants, including the Company, will provide consumers with certain free products and pay the plaintiffs' attorneys' fees. To meet its obligations under the settlement, the Company took a special pre-tax charge of $22.0 million, or $13.5 million after tax, equal to $.06 per diluted common share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. At April 30, 2005, the remaining accrual balance was $17.2 million. The charge did not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial condition. In the Federal action, the plaintiffs, purporting to represent a class of all U.S. residents who purchased prestige cosmetics products at retail for personal use from eight department stores groups that sold such products in the United States (the "Department Store Defendants"), alleged that the Department Store Defendants, the Company and eight other manufacturers of cosmetics (the "Manufacturer Defendants") conspired to fix and maintain retail prices and to limit the supply of prestige cosmetics products sold by the Department Store Defendants in violation of state and Federal laws. The plaintiffs sought, among other things, treble damages, equitable relief, attorneys' fees, interest and costs. In 1998, the Office of the Attorney General of the State of New York (the "State") notified the Company and ten other entities that they are potentially responsible parties ("PRPs") with respect to the Blydenburgh landfill in Islip, New York. Each PRP may be jointly and severally liable for the costs of investigation and cleanup, which the State estimates to be $16 million for all the PRPs. In 2001, the State sued other PRPs (including Hickey's Carting, Inc., Dennis C. Hickey and Maria Hickey, collectively the "Hickey Parties"), in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York to recover such costs in connection with the site, and in September 2002, the Hickey Parties brought contribution actions against the Company and other Blydenburgh PRPs. These contribution actions seek to recover, among other things, any damages for which the Hickey Parties are found liable in the State's lawsuit against them, and related costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees. In June 2004, the State added the Company and other PRPs as defendants in its pending case against the Hickey Parties. The Company and certain other PRPs have
engaged in settlement discussions which to date have been unsuccessful. The Company has accrued an amount which it believes would be necessary to resolve its share of this matter. If settlement discussions are not successful, then the Company intends to vigorously defend the pending claims. While no assurance can be given as to the ultimate outcome, management believes that the resolution of the Blydenburgh matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial condition. In January 2004, the Portuguese Tax Administration issued a report alleging that our subsidiary had income subject to tax in Portugal for the three calendar years ended December 31, 2002. Our subsidiary has been operating in the Madeira Free Trade Zone since 1989 under license from the Madeira Development Corporation and, in accordance with such license and the laws of Portugal, the Company believes that its income is not subject to Portuguese income tax. In February 2004, the subsidiary filed an appeal of the finding in the report to the Portuguese Secretary of State for Fiscal Matters. The appeal is still pending. On December 20, 2004, the subsidiary received a notice of assessment from the Portuguese Tax Administration solely in respect of the calendar year ended December 31, 2000. The assessment, which includes interest, amounted to approximately 26 million Euros. At the end of March 2005, the subsidiary filed an opposition to the assessment. Despite filing the opposition, the Portuguese Tax Administration could seek to collect on the assessment, in which case it may be necessary for us to provide a form of financial guarantee. On May 17 and 18, 2005, the subsidiary received notices of assessment from the Portuguese Tax Administration in respect of the calendar years ended December 31, 2001 and 2002. The assessments are for Euro 21.6 million and Euro 22.4 million. The Company intends to oppose these assessments. While no assurance can be given as to the ultimate outcome in respect of the foregoing assessments or any additional assessments that may be issued for subsequent periods, management believes that the likelihood that the assessment or any future assessments ultimately will be upheld is remote In December 2004, a plaintiff purporting to represent a nationwide class brought an action in the Superior Court of California for the County of San Diego. The complaint, as amended, names two of our subsidiaries and approximately 25 other defendants, including manufacturers and retailers. The plaintiff is seeking injunctive relief, restitution, and general, special and punitive damages for alleged violations of the California Unfair Competition Law, the California False Advertising Law, and for negligent and intentional misrepresentation. The purported class includes individuals "who have purchased skin care products from defendants that have been falsely advertised to have an `anti-aging or youth inducing benefit or effect." We intend to defend ourselves vigorously. While no assurance can be given as to the ultimate outcome,
management believes that the resolution of this lawsuit will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial condition.
