ITEM 8.01
  
.
In September 2005, The Este Lauder Companies Inc. (the "Company") committed to a plan to sell the assets and operations of its reporting unit that markets and sells Stila brand products, causing such assets and operations to be treated as discontinued operations for financial statement reporting purposes (the "Discontinued Operations").
At the annual meeting in November 2005, the stockholders of the Company approved the Company's Amended and Restated Fiscal 2002 Share Incentive Plan (the "Plan").
Under ordinary circumstances, the Company would file a Registration Statement on Form S-8 with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") to register the shares of common stock that could be listed under the Plan. Under applicable rules, the S-8 incorporates by reference the Company's latest Annual Report on Form 10-K (i.e. the one for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 that was filed with the SEC on September 2, 2005). However, as a result of the Discontinued Operations and in accordance with applicable rules, it became necessary for the Company to restate its audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003 and certain of the notes thereto to reflect the effect on those statements of the results of the Discontinued Operations, including the restatement of the makeup product category and each of the geographic regions presented in Note 17 of the Annual Report prior to filing the S-8. In addition, the Company is restating the Selected Financial Data comprising Item 6 and the Results of Operations section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (the "MD&A") contained in Item 7 of the Annual Report to reflect the results of the Discontinued Operations. If not for the filing of the S-8, these restatements relating to the Discontinued Operations would have been made in the ordinary course in the Company's upcoming Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2006. A copy of the "Selected Financial Data", the "Results of Operations" section of the MD&A and the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the three years ended June 30, 2005, in each case as referred to above, are attached hereto as Exhibits 99.1, 99.2 and 99.3, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.

Item 6.  
Selected Financial Data.
The table below summarizes selected financial information. For further information, refer to the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto beginning on page F-1 of this report.
1
(a)
          
Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 01-9, "Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer." Upon adoption of this Issue, we reclassified revenues generated from our purchase with purchase activities as sales and the costs of our purchase with purchase and gift with purchase activities as cost of sales, which were previously reported net as operating expenses. Operating income has remained unchanged by this adoption. For purposes of comparability, these reclassifications have been reflected retroactively for all periods presented.
(b)
          
During fiscal 2004, there was an increase of approximately $17.4 million in interest expense, net and a corresponding decrease in preferred stock dividends as a result of the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity." Additionally, in connection with this pronouncement, redeemable preferred stock has been reclassified as a component of total debt subsequent to June 30, 2003. The provisions of SFAS No. 150 did not provide for retroactive restatement of historical financial data.
(c)
           
Pursuant to SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," financial results for periods subsequent to July 1, 2001 exclude goodwill amortization. Goodwill amortization included in fiscal 2001 was $20.9 million ($13.4 million after tax). Excluding the effect of goodwill amortization in fiscal 2001, diluted earnings per common share would have been higher by $.06.
(d)
         
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 we announced plans to repatriate approximately $690 million of foreign earnings in fiscal year 2006, which includes $500 million of extraordinary intercompany dividends under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "AJCA"). This action resulted in an aggregate tax charge of approximately $35 million in our fiscal year ended June 30, 2005, which includes an incremental tax charge of approximately $28 million, equal to $.12 per diluted share. The repatriated funds will be reinvested in the U.S. under a domestic reinvestment plan in accordance with the provisions of the AJCA.
(e)
          
In September 2005, we committed to a plan to sell the assets and operations of our reporting unit that markets and sells Stila brand products and to actively seek a buyer for the brand. In December 2003, we committed to a plan to sell the assets and operations of our former reporting unit that sold brand products and we sold them in February 2004. As a result, all consolidated statements of earnings information in the consolidated financial statements and footnotes for all periods presented has been restated for comparative purposes to reflect those reporting units as discontinued operations.

(f)
            
Net earnings from continuing operations, net earnings, net earnings attributable to common stock, net earnings per common share from continuing operations and net earnings per common share for the year ended June 30, 2003 included a special charge related to the proposed settlement of a legal action of $13.5 million, after-tax, or $.06 per diluted common share.
(g)
          
Net earnings, net earnings attributable to common stock and net earnings per common share for the year ended June 30, 2002 included a restructuring charge of $76.9 million (of which $0.6 million was included in discontinued operations), after tax, or $.32 per diluted common share, and a one-time charge of $20.6 million, or $.08 per common share, attributable to the cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," which is attributable to our former reporting unit that sold brand products and is included in discontinued operations.
jane
(h)
         
Net earnings, net earnings attributable to common stock and net earnings per common share for the year ended June 30, 2001 included restructuring and other non-recurring charges of $40.3 million (of which $10.4 million was included in discontinued operations), after tax, or $.17 per diluted common share, and a one-time charge of $2.2 million, after tax, or $.01 per diluted common share, attributable to the cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities."

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
We manufacture, market and sell skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products which are distributed in over 130 countries and territories. The following table is a comparative summary of operating results from continuing operations for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 and reflects the basis of presentation described in Note 2 and Note 17 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented. Products and services that do not meet our definition of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care have been included in the "other" category.

Refer to the following discussion in for further information regarding these charges.
"Fiscal 2004 as Compared with Fiscal 2003Operating Expenses"

The following table presents certain consolidated earnings data as a percentage of net sales:
 
Fiscal 2005 as Compared with Fiscal 2004
In order to meet the demands of consumers, we continually introduce new products, support new and established products through advertising, sampling and merchandising and phase out existing products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers. The economics of developing, producing and launching these new products influence our sales and operating performance each period. The introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products, which we take into account in our business planning.
NET SALES
Net sales increased 9% or $538.5 million to $6,280.0 million reflecting growth in all major product categories, led by makeup and skin care, and growth in all geographic regions, led by Europe, the Middle East & Africa. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales increased 7%.
Product Categories
Skin Care
Net sales of skin care products increased 10% or $212.0 million to $2,352.1 million. Approximately $179 million of this sales increase was related to the introduction of Future Perfect Anti-Wrinkle Radiance Creme SPF 15 and launches in the Perfectionist and Re-Nutriv product lines by Este Lauder, launches of Superdefense Triple Action Moisturizers SPF 25 and certain Repairwear products by Clinique, the introduction of certain American Beauty and Good Skin products and the recent launch of Modern Friction by Origins. On a combined basis, strong sales of products in Clinique's 3-Step Skin Care System and The Lifting Face Serum & The Lifting Intensifier by La Mer contributed approximately $29 million to the sales increase. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease of approximately $52 million in sales
2
of Perfectionist Correcting Serum for Lines/Wrinkles, Idealist Micro-D Deep Thermal Refinisher, and the White Light and LightSource lines of products by Este Lauder. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, skin care net sales increased 7%.
Makeup
AC's Small Eye Shadow, Studio Fix, Lustreglass and Pro Longwear Lipcolour. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease of approximately $38 million in sales of the High Impact Mascara and High Impact Eye Shadow collections and the Glosswear line of products by Clinique as well as of Pure Color Lip Vinyl by Este Lauder. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, makeup net sales increased 11%.
Makeup net sales increased 13% or $267.4 million to $2,366.8 million. The growth included approximately $56 million of net sales from the launches of American Beauty and Flirt!, and higher sales of Bobbi Brown products, collectively. An increase of approximately $105 million was attributable to the recent launches of Superbalanced Compact Makeup SPF 20 and Colour Surge Eye Shadow from Clinique and Lash XL Maximum Length Mascara, Tender Blush, Pure Pops Brush-on Color and AeroMatte Ultralucent Pressed Powder by Este Lauder. Also contributing to sales growth was approximately $70 million of increased sales from M
Fragrance
Net sales of fragrance products increased 3% or $39.5 million to $1,260.6 million. The increase was due to approximately $188 million in sales generated by the fiscal 2005 launches of DKNY Be Delicious and DKNY Be Delicious Men, True Star from Tommy Hilfiger, Lauder Beyond Paradise Men from Este Lauder, Happy To Be from Clinique and Donald Trump The Fragrance. Partially offsetting the new product sales were decreases in sales of approximately $92 million of Este Lauder Beyond Paradise, Aramis Life and Clinique Simply, which were launched in the prior year, as well as decreases in sales of approximately $49 million of Tommy Jeans and Tommy from Tommy Hilfiger, certain other Aramis products and Lauder Intuition Men from Este Lauder. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, fragrance net sales increased slightly. We expect the fragrance category to remain challenging in fiscal 2006.
Hair Care
Hair care net sales increased 10% to $273.9 million. This increase amounting to $24.5 million was due to sales growth from Aveda and Bumble and bumble products. Aveda net sales increased as a result of sales of new professional color products and the introductions of Pure Abundance and Damage Remedy hair care products, while Bumble and bumble benefited from recent launches in its hair and scalp treatment line of products and the initial shipments of Crme de Coco shampoos and conditioners. Both of these brands also benefited from new points of distribution. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, hair care net sales increased 9%.
Geographic Regions
Net sales in the Americas increased 7% or $230.3 million to $3,351.1 million. This region experienced growth in all major categories which was fueled by the diversification in our product offerings as new products and brands mitigated challenges among certain core brands and successful prior year launches. In the United States, our makeup artist and hair care brands along with products from our Aramis and Designer Fragrances Division contributed approximately $145 million to the increase. In addition, higher net sales in Canada and the inclusion of BeautyBank products contributed approximately $76 million, collectively. The Americas region may be adversely impacted by the August 2005 merger of Federated Department Stores, Inc. and The May Department Stores Company.
In Europe, the Middle East & Africa, net sales increased 13% or $245.7 million to $2,109.1 million primarily due to higher net sales in the United Kingdom, our travel retail business, Spain, Portugal, South
3
Africa and Greece of approximately $179 million, collectively. The increase in net sales included benefits from the effect of the weaker U.S. dollar as compared to various European currencies. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales in Europe, the Middle East & Africa increased 7%.
Net sales in Asia/Pacific increased 8% or $62.5 million to $819.8 million. This increase reflected higher net sales of approximately $51 million in China, Hong Kong, Australia and Taiwan, partially offset by lower sales in Japan of approximately $4 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, Asia/Pacific net sales increased 4%.
We strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market, which may account for differences in regional sales growth.
COST OF SALES
Cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales was 25.5% and remained unchanged compared with the prior year. Favorable net changes in production and supply chain efforts of approximately 30 basis points, primarily driven by favorable material sourcing, were offset by the net change in the mix of our business within our geographic regions and product categories, as discussed above, which includes the impact of the BeautyBank brands. Changes in exchange rates compared with the prior year had a de minimis net impact on our cost of sales margin.
The higher price of oil is beginning to impact our cost of raw materials and componentry, however, we believe this will not have a material adverse effect on our cost of sales margin in the near future.
Since certain promotional activities are a component of sales or cost of sales and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage. In addition, future cost of sales mix may be impacted by the inclusion of new brands which have margin and product cost structures different from those of our existing brands.
OPERATING EXPENSES
Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales improved to 62.9% from 63.2% in the prior fiscal year. Our planned increase in advertising, merchandising and sampling over the prior year of approximately 50 basis points was offset in full by our ongoing cost containment efforts to maintain expenses in line with our business needs. We also realized a benefit of approximately 30 basis points from the elimination of royalty payments previously made to Mrs. Este Lauder. In fiscal 2006, we will experience an increase in operating expenses due to the recognition of costs related to employee stock-based compensation as a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment" (see "").
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
Changes in advertising, sampling and merchandising spending result from the type, timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts, as well as the markets being emphasized.
OPERATING RESULTS
Based on the growth of net sales, our constant cost of sales margin and the improvement in our operating expense margin as previously discussed, operating income increased 12% or $77.9 million to $726.8 million as compared with the prior fiscal year. Operating margins were 11.6% of net sales in the current period as compared with 11.3% in the prior fiscal year.
Product Categories
Operating income increased 15% or $38.5 million in makeup and 9% or $29.5 million in skin care reflecting overall sales growth and sales of recently launched products. Operating results also increased 44% or $11.0 million in fragrance reflecting sales growth from new and recently launched products. While
4
we experienced improved results in fiscal 2005 due to these new launches, the fragrance business continues to be challenging. Hair care operating results decreased 3% or $0.8 million reflecting an increase in operating expenses related to the growth of our business in the United States as well as the opening of new points of distribution in Korea and Japan, partially offset by increases in net sales as previously discussed. Hair care results were also adversely impacted in fiscal 2005 by the need to make alternative arrangements due to the bankruptcy of a third-party supplier. The situation was rectified during fiscal 2005.
Geographic Regions
Operating income in the Americas increased 13% or $43.0 million to $366.2 million, primarily due to higher net sales resulting from an overall improvement in the retail environment, strong product launches and growth from our newer brands. As noted above, we expect results in the Americas region to be adversely impacted by the August 2005 merger of Federated Department Stores, Inc. and The May Department Stores Company.
In Europe, the Middle East & Africa, operating income increased 10% or $28.4 million to $305.3 million primarily due to improved results from our travel retail business, Spain, the United Kingdom and Switzerland of approximately $33 million, collectively. Partially offsetting this improvement were lower results in France, which was negatively impacted by the consolidation of major retailers, and in Russia, where we converted our business from a distributor to a direct subsidiary, of approximately $6 million on a combined basis.
In Asia/Pacific, operating income increased 13% or $6.5 million to $55.3 million. This increase reflected improved results in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand and Japan of approximately $10 million, collectively, partially offset by a decrease in operating income in Korea and China of approximately $6 million, combined. As China is an emerging market for us, we have invested, and plan to continue to invest, in new brand expansion and business opportunities. In addition, the Asia/Pacific region did not realize the benefits of spending behind new whitening products, which experienced a delay in launching during fiscal 2005.
INTEREST EXPENSE, NET
Net interest expense was $13.9 million as compared with $27.1 million in the prior year. The decrease in net interest expense was due primarily to a $16.5 million decrease in preferred stock dividends as a result of the redemption of $291.6 million aggregate principal amount of the 2015 Preferred Stock on June 10, 2004 and the reduction in the dividend rate on the remaining $68.4 million of the 2015 Preferred Stock. This improvement was partially offset by an increase in interest expense as a result of higher debt balances and, to a lesser extent, higher interest rates.
PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES
The provision for income taxes represents Federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. The effective rate for income taxes for fiscal 2005 was 41.2% as compared with 37.7% in the prior year. The effective rate differs from statutory rates due to the effect of state and local taxes, tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, the effect of repatriating foreign earnings and certain nondeductible expenses.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we formulated a plan to repatriate approximately $690 million of foreign earnings in fiscal 2006, which includes $500 million of extraordinary intercompany dividends under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "AJCA"). This action resulted in an aggregate tax charge of approximately $35 million in fiscal 2005, which included an incremental tax charge of approximately $28 million.
5
The increase in the effective income tax rate was attributable to the incremental tax charge resulting from the repatriation plan of approximately 390 basis points and an increase of approximately 120 basis points resulting from our foreign operations. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in the amount of nondeductible preferred stock dividends of approximately 100 basis points, a decrease in state and local income taxes of approximately 40 basis points and an increase in tax credits of approximately 20 basis points.
NET EARNINGS
Net earnings and diluted net earnings per common share increased approximately 19% and 20%, respectively. Net earnings as compared with the prior fiscal year improved $64.0 million to $406.1 million and diluted net earnings per common share improved to $1.78 from $1.48. Net earnings from continuing operations increased by $31.4 million or 8% and diluted net earnings per common share from continuing operations increased 10% to $1.80 from $1.64 in the prior fiscal year. The planned repatriation of foreign earnings in accordance with the AJCA, as discussed above, resulted in an incremental tax charge of approximately $28 million, or $0.12 per diluted common share. As noted above, net earnings in fiscal 2006 are expected to be adversely impacted by the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment."  In addition, we expect results in the Americas region to be adversely impacted by the August 2005 merger of Federated Department Stores, Inc. and The May Department Stores Company.
Fiscal 2004 as Compared with Fiscal 2003
NET SALES
Net sales increased 14% or $691.7 million to $5,741.5 million, reflecting growth in all product categories and all geographic regions led by double-digit growth in Europe, the Middle East & Africa and Asia/Pacific and the inclusion of a full year of net sales of the Darphin line of products, which was acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Net sales results in Europe, the Middle East & Africa and Asia/Pacific benefited from the weakening of the U.S. dollar. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales increased 9%.
Product Categories
Skin Care
Net sales of skin care products increased 13% or $246.4 million to $2,140.1 million. Approximately $60 million of this increase was attributable to the new launches of Hydra Complete Multi-Level Moisture Cream and Idealist Micro-D Deep Thermal Refinisher by Este Lauder and Pore Minimizer by Clinique. Additionally, growth of approximately $134 million was due to strong sales of Clinique's 3-Step Skin Care System and the Repairwear line of products from Clinique, Re-Nutriv Intensive Lift Serum and Re-Nutriv Intensive Eye Crme by Este Lauder and the inclusion of a full year of net sales of the Darphin line of products, which are primarily skin care. Partially offsetting these increases were approximately $34 million of lower net sales of certain existing products such as Advanced Stop Signs by Clinique and White Light and LightSource product lines by Este Lauder. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, skin care net sales increased 8%.
Makeup
AC and Bobbi Brown makeup artist lines of approximately $122 million, collectively. The increase in net sales also reflected approximately $79 million from the fiscal 2004 launches of Ideal Matte Refinishing Makeup SPF 8 and Electric Intense LipCreme by Este Lauder and Perfectly Real Makeup and Colour Surge Bare Brilliance by Clinique. Also contributing to net sales growth were strong sales of approximately $53 million of High Impact Mascara, High Impact Eye Shadow and Skin Clarifying Makeup
Makeup net sales increased 14% or $257.8 million to $2,099.4 million, in part, due to net sales increases of our M
6
by Clinique, as well as Pure Color Lip Vinyl and Artist's Lip and Eye Pencils from Este Lauder. Partially offsetting these increases were approximately $30 million of lower net sales of certain existing products such as So Ingenious Multi-Dimension Liquid Makeup and Pure Color Lipstick from Este Lauder and Moisture Surge Lipstick from Clinique. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, makeup net sales increased 10%.
Fragrance
Net sales of fragrance products increased 15% or $161.5 million to $1,221.1 million, primarily attributable to the fiscal 2004 launches of Este Lauder Beyond Paradise, Aramis Life, Clinique Simply and the Tommy Jeans collection, which together contributed approximately $194 million to the growth. These product launches primarily contributed to increased fragrance net sales outside the United States and are inclusive of improved results from our travel retail business. These net sales increases were partially offset by lower net sales of Este Lauder , Intuition and Beautiful, certain Tommy Hilfiger products and Clinique Happy of approximately $90 million, collectively. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, fragrance net sales increased 10%.
pleasures
Hair Care
Hair care net sales increased 9% or $20.5 million to $249.4 million. This increase resulted from sales growth from Aveda and Bumble and bumble products due to an increase in sales at existing salons and spas, new salon and spa openings and the success of new and existing products. Aveda net sales also increased as a result of the opening of new Company-owned Aveda Experience Centers. Partially offsetting the increase were lower net sales of Clinique's Simple Hair Care System. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, hair care net sales increased 7%.
The introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products, which we take into account in our business planning.
Geographic Regions
Net sales in the Americas increased 7% or $216.7 million to $3,120.8 million, primarily reflecting growth from our newer brands, the success of newly launched products and increases from most of our freestanding retail stores, all of which reflected the strengthening retail environment.
In Europe, the Middle East & Africa, net sales increased 24% or $364.2 million to $1,863.4 million. About $271 million was due to higher net sales from our travel retail business, the United Kingdom, Spain, Greece and South Africa, as well as the inclusion of a full year of net sales of the Darphin line of products. The increase includes the favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rates to the U.S. dollar. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales in Europe, the Middle East & Africa increased 14%.
Net sales in Asia/Pacific increased 17% or $110.8 million to $757.3 million, primarily due to higher net sales of approximately $81 million in Japan, Australia, Taiwan, China and Thailand. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales in Asia/Pacific increased 9%.
We strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market, which may account for differences in regional sales growth.
COST OF SALES
Cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales improved to 25.5% from 26.0% reflecting production and supply chain efficiencies of approximately 70 basis points and lower costs from promotional activities of approximately 60 basis points. Partially offsetting these improvements were changes in exchange rates of approximately 40 basis points and costs related to inventory obsolescence and reconditioning and re-handling of goods of approximately 20 basis points. Also offsetting these improvements were costs
7
associated with higher travel retail sales, which contributed approximately 10 basis points. Travel retail has a higher cost of goods sold percentage because of its higher mix of fragrance sales coupled with its margin structure.
Since certain promotional activities are a component of sales or cost of sales and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage. In addition, future cost of sales mix may be impacted by the inclusion of new brands which have margin and product cost structures different than our existing brands.
OPERATING EXPENSES
Our fiscal 2003 results, as reported in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), included an adjustment for a special pre-tax charge of $22.0 million, or $13.5 million after tax, equal to $.06 per diluted common share, in connection with the proposed settlement of a class action lawsuit brought against us and a number of other defendants. The amount of the charge in this case is significantly larger than similar charges we have incurred individually or in the aggregate for legal proceedings in any prior year, and, at that time, we did not expect to take a charge of a similar magnitude for a single matter like it in the near future. In the following discussions, we include the results as reported and the non-GAAP results. We have presented the non-GAAP results because of the special nature of the charge, which affects comparability from period to period. We believe that such measures provide investors with a view of our ongoing business trends and results of continuing operations. This is consistent with the approach used by management in its evaluation and monitoring of such trends and results and provides investors with a base for evaluating future periods. There were no events or transactions subsequent to fiscal 2003 for which we believe such a discussion would be relevant.
In fiscal 2003, operating expenses and operating income in accordance with GAAP were $3,227.7 million or 63.9% of net sales and $508.8 million or 10.1% of net sales, respectively. Before the charge (non-GAAP results) operating expenses would have been $3,205.7 million or 63.5% of net sales and operating income would have been $530.8 million or 10.5% of net sales.
While we consider the non-GAAP financial measures useful in analyzing our results, it is not intended to replace, or act as a substitute for, any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP.
Fiscal 2004 operating expenses decreased to 63.2% of net sales as compared with 63.9% of net sales in fiscal 2003. Before considering the effect of the special charge, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points from 63.5% in fiscal 2003. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased approximately 100 basis points primarily due to the higher growth rate in net sales, particularly in the travel retail business, as well as our ongoing cost containment efforts to maintain expenses in line with our business needs, partially offset by operating expenses related to BeautyBank, the higher operating costs associated with newly acquired brands and expenses related to compliance with new regulatory requirements (such as those arising under the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002). Partially offsetting the net favorability in fiscal 2004 were higher levels of advertising, merchandising and sampling expenses incurred to support new and recently launched products of approximately 70 basis points.
Changes in advertising, sampling and merchandising spending result from the type, timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts, as well as the markets being emphasized.
Under agreements covering our purchase of trademarks for a percentage of related sales, royalty payments totaling $18.8 million and $20.3 million in fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively, have been charged to expense. Such payments were made to Mrs. Este Lauder until her death on April 24, 2004, after which time the final payments ceased to accrue and were made to a trust. This event resulted in a reduction of operating
8
expenses in fiscal 2004 of $3.7 million, or $2.2 million after tax. We realized a benefit from the elimination of these royalty payments in fiscal 2005.
OPERATING RESULTS
Operating income increased 28% or $140.1 million to $648.9 million. Operating margins were 11.3% of net sales in fiscal 2004 as compared with 10.1% in fiscal 2003. Absent the special charge, operating income increased 22% or $118.1 million and operating margins increased 80 basis points from fiscal 2003. These increases in operating income and operating margin reflect sales growth, improvements in the components of cost of sales and a reduction in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales.
Net earnings and diluted net earnings per common share increased approximately 7% and 17%, respectively. Net earnings improved $22.3 million to $342.1 million and diluted net earnings per common share increased by 17% from $1.26 to $1.48. Net earnings from continuing operations increased by $49.4 million or 15% and diluted net earnings per common share from continuing operations increased 26% to $1.64 from $1.30 in the prior year. Absent the special charge, net earnings from continuing operations increased by $35.9 million or 10% and diluted net earnings per common share from continuing operations increased 21% from $1.36.
The following discussions of Operating Results by and exclude the impact of the fiscal 2003 special charge. We believe the following analysis of operating income better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business.
Product Categories
Geographic Regions
Product Categories
Operating income increased 23% to $336.3 million in skin care, 24% to $262.6 million in makeup and 59% to $23.6 million in hair care reflecting overall sales growth and new product launches. Operating income decreased 23% to $24.8 million in fragrance reflecting the softness in that product category in the United States as well as increased support spending related to new product launch activities.
Geographic Regions
Operating income in the Americas increased 23% or $60.5 million to $323.2 million due to sales growth resulting from an improved retail environment, strong product launches and growth from newer brands. In Europe, the Middle East & Africa, operating income increased 22% or $50.2 million to $276.9 million primarily due to significantly improved results from our travel retail business, improved operating results in the United Kingdom and Spain as well as the addition of a full year of results of the Darphin line of products, all of which contributed approximately $72 million to the increase. Partially offsetting these increases were approximately $25 million of lower gains on foreign exchange transactions and lower results in Switzerland and Italy due to difficult market conditions, collectively. In Asia/Pacific, operating income increased 18% or $7.4 million to $48.8 million. This increase reflected improved results in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Thailand, partially offset by lower results in Korea, of approximately $7 million, combined.
INTEREST EXPENSE, NET
Net interest expense was $27.1 million as compared with $8.1 million in fiscal 2003. The increase in net interest expense was due to the inclusion of the dividends on redeemable preferred stock of $17.4 million as interest expense in fiscal 2004. This change in reporting resulted from a change in accounting standards which prohibited us from restating fiscal 2003 results. To a lesser extent, interest expense was also affected by higher average net borrowings and a marginally higher effective interest rate on our debt portfolio.
9
PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES
The provision for income taxes represents Federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. The effective rate for income taxes for fiscal 2004 was 37.7% as compared with 32.9% in fiscal 2003. These rates differ from statutory rates, reflecting the effect of state and local taxes, tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain nondeductible expenses. The increase in the effective income tax rate was attributable to the inclusion of the dividends on redeemable preferred stock as interest expense, which are not deductible for income tax purposes (approximately 100 basis points), the mix of global earnings (approximately 150 basis points) and, to a lesser extent, the timing of certain tax planning initiatives. The fiscal 2003 rate included benefits derived from certain favorable tax negotiations (approximately 230 basis points).

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management of The Este Lauder Companies Inc. (including its subsidiaries) (the "Company") is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Under the supervision of and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the Company's management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in , issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, the Company's management has concluded that, as of June 30, 2005, the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective.

KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audits the Company's consolidated financial statements has issued its attestation report on management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting. That attestation report follows this report.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The Board of Directors and Stockholders The Este Lauder Companies Inc.:
We have audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that The Este Lauder Companies Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Este Lauder Companies Inc.'s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, management's assessment that The Este Lauder Companies Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Also, in our opinion, The Este Lauder Companies Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of The Este Lauder Companies Inc. and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders' equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 2005, and our report dated August 23, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. Our report also refers to the adoption of the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity," effective July 1, 2003.

An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Este Lauder Companies Inc. and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of The Este Lauder Companies Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated August 23, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on management's assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control over financial reporting.

NOTE 2  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Este Lauder Companies Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company") as continuing operations, with the exception of the operating results of its reporting unit that sold brand products, which have been reflected as discontinued operations for fiscal 2004 and 2003 (see Note 4). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
jane
Subsequent to June 30, 2005, the Company committed to a plan to sell the assets and operations of its reporting unit that markets and sells Stila brand products and to actively seek a buyer for the brand (see Note 20).
Certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements of prior years have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation for comparative purposes.
Net Earnings Per Common Share
For the years ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, net earnings per common share ("basic EPS") is computed by dividing net earnings, which includes preferred stock dividends, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and contingently issuable shares (which satisfy certain conditions). For the year ended June 30, 2003, basic EPS is computed by dividing net earnings, after deducting preferred stock dividends on the Company's $6.50 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (which was outstanding during such fiscal year and exchanged for the 2015 Preferred Stock in fiscal 2004), by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and contingently issuable shares (which satisfy certain conditions). Net earnings per common share assuming dilution ("diluted EPS") is computed by reflecting potential dilution from the exercise of stock options.
A reconciliation between the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations is as follows:
 
F-
9
THE ESTE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
 
 
As of June 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, options to purchase 12.5 million, 6.6 million and 13.6 million shares, respectively, of Class A Common Stock were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because the exercise prices of those options were greater than the average market price of the common stock and their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. The options were still outstanding at the end of the applicable periods.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include $332.9 million and $187.2 million of short-term time deposits at June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable is stated net of the allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions of $28.9 million and $30.1 million as of June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Currency Translation and Transactions
All assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are translated at year-end rates of exchange, while revenue and expenses are translated at weighted average rates of exchange for the year. Unrealized translation gains or losses are reported as cumulative translation adjustments through other comprehensive income. Such adjustments amounted to $8.2 million, $36.5 million and $51.3 million of unrealized translation gains in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency options to hedge foreign currency transactions for periods consistent with its identified exposures. Accordingly, the Company categorizes these instruments as entered into for purposes other than trading.
The accompanying consolidated statements of earnings include net exchange losses of $15.8 million, $14.5 million and $15.0 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Inventory and Promotional Merchandise
Inventory and promotional merchandise only includes inventory considered saleable or usable in future periods, and is stated at the lower of cost or fair-market value, with cost being determined on the first-in, first-out method. Cost components include raw materials, componentry, direct labor and overhead (e.g., indirect labor, utilities, depreciation, purchasing, receiving, inspection and warehousing) as well as inbound freight. Promotional merchandise is charged to expense at the time the merchandise is shipped to the Company's customers.
 
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. For financial statement purposes, depreciation is provided principally on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from 3 to 40 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lives of the respective leases or the expected useful lives of those improvements.
 
Depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment was $186.3 million, $175.1 million and $155.2 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Depreciation and amortization related to the Company's manufacturing process is included in cost of sales and all other depreciation and amortization is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
The Company follows the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141, "Business Combinations" and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." These statements
F-
11
THE ESTE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
established financial accounting and reporting standards for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets. Specifically, the standards address how acquired intangible assets should be accounted for both at the time of acquisition and after they have been recognized in the financial statements. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, intangible assets, including purchased goodwill, must be evaluated for impairment. Those intangible assets that will continue to be classified as goodwill or as other intangibles with indefinite lives are no longer amortized.
In accordance with SFAS No. 142, the impairment testing is performed in two steps: (i) the Company determines impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, and (ii) if there is an impairment, the Company measures the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. To determine fair value, the Company relied on three valuation models: guideline public companies, acquisition analysis and discounted cash flow. For goodwill valuation purposes only, the revised fair value of a reporting unit would be allocated to the assets and liabilities of the business unit to arrive at an implied fair value of goodwill, based upon known facts and circumstances, as if the acquisition occurred at that time.
In February 2004, the Company sold the assets and operations of its reporting unit that sold brand products. Based on an assessment of the tangible and intangible assets of this business, the Company determined that the carrying amount of these assets as then reflected on the Company's consolidated balance sheet exceeded their estimated fair value. In accordance with the assessment, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge in the amount of $26.4 million for fiscal 2004, which is reported as a component of discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings. This write-down primarily impacted the Company's makeup product category and the Americas region.
jane
Goodwill
The Company assigns goodwill of a reporting unit to the product category in which that reporting unit predominantly operates at the time of its acquisition. The change in the carrying amount of goodwill is as follows:
 
Included in fiscal 2005 additions to goodwill was $37.7 million related to an expected payment to be made in fiscal 2006 to satisfy an earn-out provision related to the Company's acquisition of Jo Malone Limited in October 1999.
Other Intangible Assets
Other intangible assets include trademarks and patents, as well as license agreements and other intangible assets resulting from or related to businesses purchased by the Company. Indefinite lived assets (e.g., trademarks) are not subject to amortization and are evaluated annually for impairment or sooner if certain events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment. Patents are amortized on a straight-line basis over
F-
12
THE ESTE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
the shorter of the legal term or the useful life of the patent, approximately 20 years. Other intangible assets (e.g., non-compete agreements, customer lists) are amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected period of benefit, approximately 5 years to 8 years. Intangible assets related to license agreements are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on the terms of their respective agreements, currently approximately 10 years to 16 years, and are subject to periodic impairment testing.
Other intangible assets consist of the following:
 
 
The aggregate amortization expenses related to amortizable intangible assets for the years ended June 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were $4.6 million, $4.0 million and $1.9 million, respectively. The estimated aggregate amortization expense for each of the next five fiscal years is as follows:
 
Long-Lived Assets
In accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets in question may not be recoverable. An impairment would be recorded in circumstances where undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset are less than the carrying value of that asset.
F-

THE ESTE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)
The components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("OCI") included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets consist of the following:
 
Of the $12.0 million, net of tax, derivative instrument gain recorded in OCI at June 30, 2005, $9.0 million, net of tax, related to the proceeds from the settlement of the treasury lock agreements upon the issuance of the 5.75% Senior Notes which will be reclassified to earnings as an offset to interest expense over the 30-year life of the debt and $3.0 million, net of tax, related to gains from forward and option contracts which the Company will reclassify to earnings during the next twelve months.
Revenue Recognition
Revenues from merchandise sales are recognized upon transfer of ownership, including passage of title to the customer and transfer of the risk of loss related to those goods. In the Americas region, sales are generally recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer and, in the Europe, Middle East & Africa and Asia/Pacific regions, sales are generally recognized based upon the customer's receipt. In certain circumstances, transfer of title takes place at the point of sale (e.g., at the Company's retail stores).
F-
14
THE ESTE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Sales are reported on a net sales basis, which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual product returns received, discounts, incentive arrangements with retailers and an amount established for anticipated product returns. The Company's practice is to accept product returns from retailers only if properly requested, authorized and approved. In accepting returns, the Company typically provides a credit to the retailer against accounts receivable from that retailer. As a percentage of gross sales, returns were 4.6%, 4.6% and 5.0% in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Payments to Customers
The Company is subject to the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 01-9, "Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor's Products)." In accordance with this guidance, the Company has recorded the revenues generated from purchase with purchase promotions as sales and the costs of its purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions as cost of sales. Certain other incentive arrangements require the payment of a fee to customers based on their attainment of pre-established sales levels. These fees have been recorded as a reduction of net sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and were not material to the results of operations in any period presented.
The Company enters into transactions related to advertising, product promotions and demonstrations, some of which involve cooperative relationships with customers. These activities may be arranged either with unrelated third parties or in conjunction with the customer. The Company's share of the cost of these transactions (regardless of to whom they were paid) are reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and were approximately $898 million, $838 million and $786 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Advertising and Promotion
Costs associated with advertising are expensed during the year as incurred. Global advertising expenses, which primarily include television, radio and print media, and promotional expenses, such as products used as sales incentives, were $1,793.7 million, $1,595.5 million and $1,401.1 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These amounts include activities relating to purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions that are reflected in net sales and cost of sales.
Advertising and promotional expenses included in operating expenses were $1,577.1 million, $1,410.4 million and $1,202.9 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Research and Development
Research and development costs, which amounted to $72.3 million, $67.2 million and $60.8 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, are expensed as incurred.
Operating Leases
The Company recognizes rent expense from operating leases with periods of free and scheduled rent increases on a straight-line basis over the applicable lease term. The Company considers lease renewals in the useful life of its leasehold improvements when such renewals are reasonably assured. From time to time, the Company may receive capital improvement funding from its lessors. These amounts are recorded as deferred liabilities and amortized over the remaining lease term as a reduction of rent expense.
F-
15
THE ESTE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Generally, leasing is not a significant portion of the Company's business, however, in connection with a February 7, 2005 letter from the Office of the Chief Accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants expressing its views of existing accounting literature related to lease accounting, the Company has completed a review of its lease accounting policies. The Company has determined that any changes to its previous practices would not result in a material impact on its results of operations and statements of financial position and cash flows for the current period or any individual prior year. Accordingly, the Company's consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated.
Related Party Royalties and Trademarks
On April 24, 2004, Mrs. Este Lauder passed away. As a result, the royalty payments previously made to her since 1969 in connection with the Company's purchase of the "Este Lauder" trademark outside the United States ceased to accrue. Royalty payments totaling $18.8 million and $20.3 million have been charged to expense in fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively.
License Arrangements
The Company's license agreements provide the Company with worldwide rights to manufacture, market and sell beauty and beauty-related products (or particular categories thereof) using the licensors' trademarks. The licenses typically have an initial term of approximately 2 years to 11 years, and are renewable subject to the Company's compliance with the license agreement provisions. The remaining terms, including the potential renewal periods, range from approximately 3 years to 25 years. Under each license, the Company is required to pay royalties to the licensor, at least annually, based on net sales to third parties.
Most of the Company's licenses were entered into to create new business. In some cases, the Company acquired, or entered into, a license where the licensor or another licensee was operating a pre-existing beauty products business. In those cases, intangible assets are capitalized and amortized over their useful lives based on the terms of the agreement and are subject to periodic impairment testing.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company observes the provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS No. 123"), by continuing to apply the provisions of Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB No. 25").
The Company applies the intrinsic value method as outlined in APB No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for stock options and share units granted under these programs. Under the intrinsic value method, no compensation expense is recognized if the exercise price of the Company's employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized on options granted to employees. SFAS No. 123 requires that the Company provide pro forma information regarding net earnings and net earnings per common share as if compensation cost for the Company's stock option programs had been determined in accordance with the fair value method prescribed therein. The Company adopted the disclosure portion of SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure," requiring quarterly SFAS No. 123 pro forma disclosure. The pro forma charge for compensation cost related to stock options granted is recognized over the service period. The service period represents the period of time between the
F-

date of grant and the date each option becomes exercisable without consideration of acceleration provisions (e.g., retirement, change of control, etc.). The following table illustrates the effect on net earnings and earnings per common share as if the fair value method had been applied to all outstanding awards in each period presented.
Fiscal 2004 pro forma compensation cost includes the acceleration of exercisability of options held by an executive who retired on June 30, 2004 based on the original terms of the option grants.
(i)
            
The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:
 
Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company is a worldwide manufacturer, marketer and distributor of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products. Domestic and international sales are made primarily to department stores, perfumeries and specialty retailers. The Company grants credit to all qualified customers and does not believe it is exposed significantly to any undue concentration of credit risk.
For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company's three largest customers accounted for an aggregate of 22%, 22% and 24%, respectively, of net sales. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company's net sales during fiscal 2005, 2004, or 2003. The Company's two largest customers, Federated Department Stores, Inc. and The May Department Stores Company, are in the process of merging and have stated that they expect the merger to be completed in calendar 2005.
F-

THE ESTE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Additionally, as of June 30, 2005 and 2004, the Company's three largest customers accounted for an aggregate of 24% and 25%, respectively, of its outstanding accounts receivable.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company accounts for derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 also requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and that they be measured at fair value.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In June 2005, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 05-6, "Determining the Amortization Period for Leasehold Improvements." This Issue addresses the amortization period for leasehold improvements in operating leases that are either (a) placed in service significantly after and not contemplated at or near the beginning of the initial lease term or (b) acquired in a business combination. Leasehold improvements that are placed in service significantly after and not contemplated at or near the beginning of the lease term should be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are deemed to be reasonably assured at the date the leasehold improvements are purchased. Leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination should be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are deemed to be reasonably assured at the date of acquisition. This Issue shall be applied to leasehold improvements that are purchased or acquired in reporting periods after June 29, 2005 and the Company does not expect this Issue to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In June 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") FAS 143-1, "Accounting for Electronic Equipment Waste Obligations," to address the accounting for electronic equipment waste obligations associated with Directive 2002/96/EC on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (the "Directive") adopted by the European Union ("EU"). The Directive effectively obligates a commercial user to incur costs associated with the retirement of a specified asset that qualifies as historical waste equipment, as defined in the Directive. Commercial users of electronic equipment should apply the provisions of SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" ("SFAS No. 143"), and the related FASB Interpretation No. 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations," to the obligation associated with historical waste, since this type of obligation is an asset retirement obligation. The initial recognition of an asset-retirement-cost liability shall be recorded as an equal and offsetting increase in the carrying amount of the related asset. Subsequent adjustments to the initial measurement of the asset and liability shall also be made in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 143. The guidance in this FSP shall be applied the later of the first reporting period ending after June 8, 2005 or the date of the adoption of the law by the applicable EU-member country. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this FSP will have on its consolidated financial statements, if any.

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, "Accounting Changes and Error Corrections," ("SFAS No. 154") which establishes, unless impracticable, retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting principle. The statement provides guidance for determining whether retrospective application of a change in accounting principle is impracticable. The statement also addresses the reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously issued financial statements. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The Company will adopt this statement as required, and does not believe the adoption will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.
On December 21, 2004, the FASB issued FSP FAS 109-1, "Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004" ("FSP No. 109-1"), and FSP FAS 109-2, "Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004" ("FSP No. 109-2"). These staff positions provide accounting guidance on how companies should account for the effects of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "AJCA") that was signed into law on October 22, 2004.
FSP No. 109-1 states that the tax relief (special tax deduction for domestic manufacturing) from this legislation should be accounted for as a "special deduction" instead of a tax rate reduction. The special deduction for domestic manufacturing becomes effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The Company believes this legislation and the provisions of FSP No. 109-1 will not have a significant impact on its effective tax rate.
FSP No. 109-2 gives a company additional time to evaluate the effects of the legislation on any plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying FASB Statement No. 109. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company formulated a plan to repatriate approximately $690 million of foreign earnings in fiscal 2006, which includes $500 million of extraordinary intercompany dividends under the provisions of the AJCA. This action resulted in an aggregate tax charge of approximately $35 million, which included an incremental tax charge of approximately $28 million in fiscal 2005. The overall effective rate for income taxes increased from 37.7% for fiscal 2004 to 41.2% for fiscal 2005 primarily as a result of the repatriation plan.
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS No. 123(R)"). This statement replaces SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" and supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." SFAS No. 123(R) requires all stock-based compensation to be recognized as an expense in the financial statements and that such cost be measured according to the fair value of the award. SFAS No. 123(R) will be effective for the Company's first quarter of fiscal 2006. While the Company currently provides the pro forma disclosures required by SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure," on a quarterly basis (see Note 2Stock-Based Compensation), it is currently evaluating the impact this statement will have on its consolidated financial statements. In March 2005, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 ("SAB No. 107") was issued to provide guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission to simplify some of the implementation challenges of SFAS No. 123(R) as this statement relates to the valuation of share-based payment arrangements for public companies. The Company will apply the principles of SAB No. 107 in connection with its adoption of SFAS No. 123(R).
In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, "Inventory Costsan amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4" ("SFAS No. 151"). SFAS No. 151 requires all companies to recognize a current-period charge
F-
19
THE ESTE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted materials. This statement also requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS No. 151 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company believes the adoption of this statement will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
NOTE 3  PUBLIC OFFERINGS
In June 2004, three Lauder family trusts sold a total of 13,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock in a registered public offering. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sales of these shares. The cost of this offering was borne by the selling stockholders.
NOTE 4  ACQUISITION AND DIVESTITURE OF BUSINESSES AND LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS
As of June 30, 2005, the Company had a current liability with an equal and offsetting increase in goodwill of $37.7 million related to an expected payment to be made in fiscal 2006 to satisfy an earn-out provision related to the Company's acquisition of Jo Malone Limited in October 1999, which payment may be satisfied by the issuance of a note to the seller.
In July 2004, the Company acquired a majority equity interest in its former distributor in Portugal. The aggregate payments made through June 30, 2005 to acquire the distributor were funded by cash provided by operations and did not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations or financial condition. In addition, the Company assumed debt and other long-term obligations of 4.6 million Euros associated with the acquisition (approximately $5.6 million at acquisition date exchange rates). The debt is payable semi-annually through February 2008 at a variable interest rate.
In December 2003, the Company committed to a plan to sell the assets and operations of its reporting unit that sold brand products and sold them in February 2004. At the time the decision was made, circumstances warranted that the Company conduct an assessment of the tangible and intangible assets of the business. Based on this assessment, the Company determined that the carrying amount of these assets as then reflected on the Company's consolidated balance sheet exceeded its estimated fair value. In accordance with the assessment and the closing of the sale, the Company recorded an after-tax charge to discontinued operations of $33.3 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004. The charge represents the impairment of goodwill in the amount of $26.4 million; the reduction in value of other tangible assets in the amount of $2.1 million, net of tax; and the reporting unit's operating loss of $4.8 million, net of tax. Included in the operating loss of fiscal 2004 were additional costs associated with the sale and discontinuation of the business. As a result, all consolidated statements of earnings information in the consolidated financial statements and footnotes for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 have been restated for comparative purposes to reflect that reporting unit as discontinued operations, including the restatement of the makeup product category and the Americas region data presented in Note 17.

In July 2003, the Company acquired the Rodan + Fields skin care line. The initial purchase price, paid at closing, was funded by cash provided by operations, the payment of which did not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations or financial condition. The Company expects to make additional payments between fiscal 2007 and 2011 based on certain conditions.
In April 2003, the Company acquired the Paris-based Darphin group of companies that develops, manufactures and markets the "Darphin" brand of skin care and makeup products. The initial purchase price, paid at closing, was funded by cash provided by operations, the payment of which did not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations or financial condition. An additional payment is

expected to be made in fiscal 2009, the amount of which will depend on future net sales and earnings of the Darphin business.
At various times during fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company acquired businesses engaged in the wholesale distribution and retail sale of Aveda products, as well as other products, in the United States and other countries.
The aggregate purchase price for these acquisitions, which includes acquisition costs, was $7.1 million, $4.4 million, and $50.4 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and each transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, the results of operations for each of the acquired businesses are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements commencing with its date of original acquisition. Pro forma results of operations, as if each of such businesses had been acquired as of the beginning of the year of acquisition, have not been presented, as the impact on the Company's consolidated financial results would not have been material.
In fiscal 2005, the Company was developing products under license agreements for Sean John (announced in May 2004), Tom Ford (announced in April 2005) and Missoni (announced in May 2005) and an Origins license agreement to develop and sell products using the name of Dr. Andrew Weil (announced in October 2004). In May 2003, the Company entered into a license agreement for fragrances and beauty products under the "Michael Kors" trademarks with Michael Kors, L.L.C. and purchased certain related rights and inventory from American Designer Fragrances, a division of LVMH.
Certain license agreements may require minimum royalty payments, incremental royalties based on net sales levels and minimum spending on advertising and promotional activities. Royalty expenses are accrued in the period in which net sales are earned while advertising and promotional expenses are accrued at the time these costs are incurred.
Subsequent to June 30, 2005, the Company committed to a plan to sell the assets and operations of its reporting unit that markets and sells Stila brand products and to actively seek a buyer for the brand (see Note 20).
NOTE 5  RESTRUCTURING AND SPECIAL CHARGES
Fiscal 2003
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company recorded a special pre-tax charge of $22.0 million, or $13.5 million after-tax, equal to $.06 per diluted common share, in connection with the proposed settlement of a legal proceeding brought against a number of defendants including the Company (see Note 14). The amount of the charge in this case is significantly larger than similar charges the Company has incurred individually or in the aggregate for legal proceedings in any prior year. As of June 30, 2005, cumulative payments related to the special pre-tax charge were $4.8 million. The Company expects to settle a majority of the remaining obligation by the end of fiscal 2007.
Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001
As of June 30, 2005 and 2004, accruals related to fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 restructurings were $4.7 million and $10.7 million, respectively. During fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, $6.0 million, $13.8 million and $36.7 million, respectively, related to these restructurings were paid. The Company expects to settle the remaining obligations through fiscal 2007.

THE ESTE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Significant components of the Company's deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of June 30, 2005 and 2004 were as follows:
 
As of June 30, 2005 and 2004, the Company had current net deferred tax assets of $85.3 million and $145.9 million, respectively, which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the Company had noncurrent net deferred tax liabilities of $68.1 million and $26.8 million as of June 30, 2005 and June 30, 2004, respectively, which are included in other noncurrent liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company formulated a plan to repatriate approximately $690 million of foreign earnings in fiscal 2006, which includes $500 million of extraordinary intercompany dividends under the provisions of the AJCA. This action resulted in an aggregate tax charge of approximately $35 million, which includes an incremental tax charge of approximately $28 million in fiscal 2005. Federal income and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on $90.2 million of remaining undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries at June 30, 2005. The Company intends to reinvest these earnings in its foreign operations indefinitely, except where it is able to repatriate these earnings to the United States without material incremental tax provision. As of June 30, 2004 and 2003, the Company had not provided federal income and foreign withholding taxes on $560.5 million and $476.6 million, respectively, of undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries.
As of June 30, 2005 and 2004, certain international subsidiaries had tax loss carryforwards for local tax purposes of approximately $27.7 million and $24.5 million, respectively. With the exception of $12.2 million of losses with an indefinite carryforward period as of June 30, 2005, these losses expire at various dates through fiscal 2020. Deferred tax assets in the amount of $8.2 million and $5.7 million as of June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, have been recorded to reflect the tax benefits of the losses not utilized to date.

THE ESTE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
A full valuation allowance has been provided for those deferred tax assets for which, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Earnings before income taxes, minority interest and discontinued operations include amounts contributed by the Company's international operations of $582.9 million, $524.5 million and $391.4 million for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Some of these earnings are taxed in the United States.
Earnings from the Company's global operations are subject to tax in various jurisdictions both within and outside the United States. The Company is routinely audited in these jurisdictions and these reviews can involve complex issues that may require an extended period of time for resolution. The Company's U.S. Federal income tax returns have been examined and settled through fiscal 1997. The Company is currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for fiscal years 1998 through 2001. In addition, the Company has ongoing audits in various state and local jurisdictions, as well as audits in various foreign jurisdictions.
The Company provides tax reserves for Federal, state, local and international exposures relating to audit results, tax planning initiatives and compliance responsibilities. The development of these reserves requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical estimate. Although the outcome of these tax audits is uncertain, in management's opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for potential liabilities emanating from these reviews. If actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates, they could have a material impact on the Company's results of operations.
The Company has been notified of a disallowance of tax deductions claimed by its subsidiary in Spain for the fiscal years 1999 through 2002. As a result, the subsidiary was reassessed corporate income tax of approximately $3 million for this period. An appeal against this reassessment was filed with the Chief Tax Inspector. On July 18, 2005 the final assessment made by the Chief Tax Inspector was received, confirming the reassessment made by the tax auditors. An appeal against this final assessment has been filed with the Madrid Regional Economic Administrative Tribunal on July 29, 2005. While no assurance can be given as to the outcome in respect of this assessment, either during the administrative appeals process or in the Spanish courts, management believes that the subsidiary should ultimately be successful in its defense against the assessment. Accordingly, no tax reserve has been established for this potential exposure.

NOTE 8DEBT
The Company's short-term and long-term debt and available financing consist of the following:
 
As of June 30, 2005, the Company had outstanding $246.3 million of 6% Senior Notes due January 2012 ("6% Senior Notes") consisting of $250.0 million principal, an unamortized debt discount of $0.8 million, and a $2.9 million adjustment to reflect the fair value of an outstanding interest rate swap. The 6% Senior Notes, when issued in January 2002, were priced at 99.538% with a yield of 6.062%. Interest payments are required to be made semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year. In May 2003, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $250.0 million to effectively convert the fixed rate interest on its outstanding 6% Senior Notes to variable interest rates based on six-month LIBOR.
As of June 30, 2005, the Company had outstanding $197.4 million of 5.75% Senior Notes due October 2033 ("5.75% Senior Notes") consisting of $200.0 million principal and unamortized debt discount of $2.6 million. Interest payments, which commenced April 15, 2004, are required to be made semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year. In May 2003, in anticipation of the issuance of the 5.75% Senior Notes, the Company entered into a series of treasury lock agreements on a notional amount totaling $195.0 million at a weighted average all-in rate of 4.53%. The treasury lock agreements were settled upon the issuance of the new debt and the Company received a payment of $15.0 million that will be amortized against interest expense over the life of the 5.75% Senior Notes. As a result of the treasury lock agreements, the debt discount and debt issuance costs, the effective interest rate on the 5.75% Senior Notes will be 5.395% over the life of the debt.
Effective July 1, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity" ("SFAS No. 150"). In connection with this pronouncement, the Company's cumulative redeemable preferred stock was reclassified as a component of total debt and the related dividends thereon have been characterized as interest expense. On June 28,

2005, the Company received a notice of exercise of the put right from the holder of the remaining $68.4 million of the 2015 Preferred Stock, which requires the Company to purchase the preferred stock, plus any cumulative and unpaid dividends thereon, on or before October 26, 2005. The Company plans to purchase the preferred stock on that date and to pay the anticipated dividends through that date of $0.5 million at a rate based on the after-tax yield on six-month U.S. Treasuries of 2.10%, which was reset on July 1, 2005.
The Company has a $750.0 million commercial paper program under which it may issue commercial paper in the United States. The Company's commercial paper is currently rated A-1 by Standard & Poor's and P-1 by Moody's. The Company's long-term credit ratings are A+ with a stable outlook by Standard & Poor's and A1 with a stable outlook by Moody's. At June 30, 2005, the Company had $148.0 million of commercial paper outstanding at an average interest rate of 3.08%.
Effective May 27, 2005, the Company entered into a five-year $600 million senior revolving credit facility, expiring on May 27, 2010. The new facility replaced its prior, unused $400 million revolving credit facility, which was effective since June 28, 2001. The new revolving credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including financing working capital. Up to the equivalent of $250 million of the facility is available for multicurrency loans. The interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR or on the higher of prime, which is the rate of interest publicly announced by the administrative agent, or % plus the Federal funds rate. The credit facility has an annual fee of $0.4 million, payable quarterly, based on the Company's current credit ratings. The Company incurred debt issuance costs of $0.3 million which will be amortized over the term of the facility. The credit facility contains various covenants, including one financial covenant which requires the average of the debt of the Company to total capital ratio at the last day of each fiscal quarter to be less than 0.65:1. At June 30, 2005, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants in the credit facility and there were no borrowings.
The Company maintains uncommitted credit facilities in various regions throughout the world. Interest rate terms for these facilities vary by region and reflect prevailing market rates for companies with strong credit ratings. During fiscal 2005 and 2004, the monthly average amount outstanding was approximately $10.7 million and $5.1 million, respectively, and the annualized monthly weighted average interest rate incurred was approximately 4.95% and 5.7%, respectively.
The Company also had an effective shelf registration statement covering the potential issuance of up to $300.0 million in debt securities at June 30, 2005 and 2004.
The following table represents the Company's projected debt service payments over the next five fiscal years:

NOTE 9  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company addresses certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company primarily enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. The Company, if necessary, enters into interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on the Company's aggregate liability portfolio. The Company categorizes these instruments as entered into for purposes other than trading.
All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value. On the date the derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative as (i) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment ("fair-value" hedge), (ii) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability ("cash-flow" hedge), (iii) a foreign-currency fair-value or cash-flow hedge ("foreign-currency" hedge), (iv) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, or (v) other. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective as (and that is designated and qualifies as) a fair-value hedge, along with the loss or gain on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk (including losses or gains on firm commitments), are recorded in current-period earnings. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective as (and that is designated and qualifies as) a cash-flow hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income, until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows (e.g., when periodic settlements on a variable-rate asset or liability are recorded in earnings). Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are highly effective as (and that are designated and qualify as) foreign-currency hedges are recorded in either current-period earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the hedge transaction is a fair-value hedge (e.g., a hedge of a firm commitment that is to be settled in a foreign currency) or a cash-flow hedge (e.g., a foreign-currency-denominated forecasted transaction). If, however, a derivative is used as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, its changes in fair value, to the extent effective as a hedge, are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income within equity. Furthermore, changes in the fair value of other derivative instruments are reported in current-period earnings.
For each derivative contract entered into where the Company looks to obtain special hedge accounting treatment, the Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as fair-value, cash-flow, or foreign-currency hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. The Company also formally assesses, both at the hedge's inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective, or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, the Company will be required to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively.
Foreign Exchange Risk Management
The Company enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge anticipated transactions as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies for periods consistent with the Company's identified exposures. The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange
F-
27
THE ESTE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
rate movements on costs and on the cash flows that the Company receives from foreign subsidiaries. Almost all foreign currency contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries and are with large financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a major rating agency. The Company also enters into foreign currency options to hedge anticipated transactions where there is a high probability that anticipated exposures will materialize. The forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been designated as cash-flow hedges. As of June 30, 2005, these cash-flow hedges were highly effective, in all material respects.
As a matter of policy, the Company only enters into contracts with counterparties that have at least an "A" (or equivalent) credit rating. The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions. The Company does not have significant exposure to any one counterparty. Exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to only the recognized, but not realized, gains attributable to the contracts. Management believes risk of loss under these hedging contracts is remote and in any event would not be material to the Company's consolidated financial results. The contracts have varying maturities through the end of June 2006. Costs associated with entering into such contracts have not been material to the Company's consolidated financial results. The Company does not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. At June 30, 2005, the Company had foreign currency contracts in the form of forward exchange contracts and option contracts in the amount of $667.5 million and $120.9 million, respectively. The foreign currencies included in forward exchange contracts (notional value stated in U.S. dollars) are principally the Swiss franc ($128.6 million), British pound ($127.6 million), Euro ($123.3 million), Canadian dollar ($78.1 million), Australian dollar ($43.3 million), Japanese yen ($31.6 million) and South Korean won ($27.6 million). The foreign currencies included in the option contracts (notional value stated in U.S. dollars) are principally the Japanese yen ($33.6 million), South Korean won ($26.3 million), Euro ($21.5 million) and Swiss franc ($20.3 million). At June 30, 2004, the Company had foreign currency contracts in the form of forward exchange contracts and option contracts in the amount of $593.6 million and $82.0 million, respectively. The foreign currencies included in forward exchange contracts (notional value stated in U.S. dollars) are principally the Euro ($122.6 million), Swiss franc ($117.1 million), British pound ($72.8 million), Japanese yen ($66.7 million), South Korean won ($42.0 million), Canadian dollar ($41.7 million) and Australian dollar ($33.7 million). The foreign currencies included in the option contracts (notional value stated in U.S. dollars) are principally the Euro ($34.1 million), British pound ($25.4 million) and Swiss franc ($12.7 million).
Interest Rate Risk Management
The Company enters into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the exposure to fluctuations of interest rates on its funded and unfunded indebtedness for periods consistent with the identified exposures. All interest rate derivative contracts are with large financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a major rating agency.
In May 2003, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $250.0 million to effectively convert fixed interest on the existing 6% Senior Notes to a variable interest rate based on six-month LIBOR. The interest rate swap was designated as a fair-value hedge. As of June 30, 2005, the fair-value hedge was highly effective, in all material respects.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value:
Cash and cash equivalents:
The carrying amount approximates fair value, primarily because of the short maturity of cash equivalent instruments.
Short-term and long-term debt:
The fair value of the Company's debt was estimated based on the current rates offered to the Company for debt with the same remaining maturities. To a lesser extent, debt also includes capital lease obligations for which the carrying amount approximates the fair value.
Foreign exchange and interest rate contracts:
The fair value of forwards, swaps and options is the estimated amount the Company would receive or pay to terminate the agreements.
The estimated fair values of the Company's financial instruments are as follows:

NOTE 10  PENSION, DEFERRED COMPENSATION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS
The Company maintains pension plans covering substantially all of its full-time employees for its U.S. operations and a majority of its international operations. Several plans provide pension benefits based primarily on years of service and employees' earnings. In certain instances, the Company adjusts benefits in connection with international employee transfers.
Retirement Growth Account Plan (U.S.)
The Retirement Growth Account Plan is a trust-based, noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan. The Company's funding policy consists of an annual contribution at a rate that provides for future plan benefits and maintains appropriate funded percentages. Such contribution is not less than the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, ("ERISA") and subsequent pension legislation and is not more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes.
Restoration Plan (U.S.)
The Company also has an unfunded, nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension Restoration Plan to provide benefits in excess of Internal Revenue Code limitations.
International Pension Plans
The Company maintains International Pension Plans, the most significant of which are defined benefit pension plans. The Company's funding policies for these plans are determined by local laws and regulations.
Postretirement Benefits
The Company maintains a domestic postretirement benefit plan which provides certain medical and dental benefits to eligible employees. Employees hired after January 1, 2002 are not eligible for retiree medical benefits when they retire. Certain retired employees who are receiving monthly pension benefits are eligible for participation in the plan. Contributions required and benefits received by retirees and eligible family members are dependent on the age of the retiree. It is the Company's practice to fund these benefits as incurred. The cost of the Company-sponsored programs is not significant.
Certain of the Company's international subsidiaries and affiliates have postretirement plans, although most participants are covered by government-sponsored or administered programs.

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. The assumed weighted-average health care cost trend rate for the coming year is 12.20% while the ultimate trend rate of 4.50% is expected to be reached in fiscal 2015. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates for fiscal 2005 would have had the following effects:

International pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of the plans' assets had aggregate projected benefit obligations of $176.0 million and $139.4 million, aggregate accumulated benefit obligations of $156.8 million and $120.3 million and aggregate fair value of plan assets of $103.5 million and $85.0 million at June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
 
 
The target asset allocation policy was set to maximize returns with consideration to the long-term nature of the obligations and maintaining a lower level of overall volatility through the allocation to fixed income. During the year, the asset allocation is reviewed for adherence to the target policy and is rebalanced periodically towards the target weights.
401(k) Savings Plan (U.S.)
The Company's 401(k) Savings Plan ("Savings Plan") is a contributory defined contribution plan covering substantially all regular U.S. employees who have completed the hours and service requirements, as defined by the plan document. Regular full-time employees are eligible to participate in the Savings Plan on the first day of the second month following their date of hire. The Savings Plan is subject to the applicable provisions of ERISA. The Company matches a portion of the participant's contributions after
F-

one year of service under a predetermined formula based on the participant's contribution level and years of service. The Company's contributions were approximately $9.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 and $9.1 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2004 and 2003. Shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock are not an investment option in the Savings Plan and the Company does not use such shares to match participants' contributions.
Deferred Compensation
The Company accrues for deferred compensation and interest thereon, and for the increase in the value of share units pursuant to agreements with certain key executives and outside directors. The amounts included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets under these plans were $71.0 million and $135.4 million as of June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The expense for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $10.2 million, $16.6 million and $17.4 million, respectively. During 2005, the Company made deferred compensation payments to a former executive of $71.2 million.
NOTE 11  POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN TO RETIREES
The Company provides certain postemployment benefits to eligible former or inactive employees and their dependents during the period subsequent to employment but prior to retirement. These benefits include health care coverage and severance benefits. The cost of providing these benefits is accrued and any incremental benefits were not material to the Company's consolidated financial results.
NOTE 12  COMMON STOCK
As of June 30, 2005, the Company's authorized common stock consists of 650 million shares of Class A Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, and 240 million shares of Class B Common Stock, par value $.01 per share. Class B Common Stock is convertible into Class A Common Stock, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time at the option of the holder, on the basis of one share of Class A Common Stock for each share of Class B Common Stock converted. Holders of the Company's Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of the Company's Class B Common Stock are entitled to ten votes per share.

Share Incentive Plans
The Plans provide for the issuance of 30,750,000 shares to be awarded in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights and other stock awards to key employees and stock options, stock awards and stock units to non-employee directors of the Company.

material adverse effect upon the results of operations or financial condition of the Company. However, management's assessment of the Company's current litigation and other legal proceedings could change in light of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending against the Company not presently known to the Company or determinations by judges, juries or other finders of fact which are not in accord with management's evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation or proceedings.
On March 30, 2005, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California entered into a Final Judgment approving the settlement agreement the Company entered into in July 2003, with the plaintiffs, the other Manufacturer Defendants (as defined below) and the Department Store Defendants (as defined below) in a consolidated class action lawsuit that had been pending in the Superior Court of the State of California in Marin County since 1998. On April 29, 2005, notices of appeal were filed by representatives of two members of the purported class of consumers. If the appeal is resolved satisfactorily, the Final Judgment will result in the plaintiffs' claims being dismissed, with prejudice, in their entirety in both the Federal and California actions. There has been no finding or admission of any wrongdoing by the Company in this lawsuit. The Company entered into the settlement agreement solely to avoid protracted and costly litigation. In connection with the settlement agreement, the defendants, including the Company, will provide consumers with certain free products and pay the plaintiffs' attorneys' fees. To meet its obligations under the settlement, the Company took a special pre-tax charge of $22.0 million, or $13.5 million after-tax, equal to $.06 per diluted common share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. At June 30, 2005, the remaining accrual balance was $17.2 million. The charge did not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial condition. In the Federal action, the plaintiffs, purporting to represent a class of all U.S. residents who purchased prestige cosmetics products at retail for personal use from eight department stores groups that sold such products in the United States (the "Department Store Defendants"), alleged that the Department Store Defendants, the Company and eight other manufacturers of cosmetics (the "Manufacturer Defendants") conspired to fix and maintain retail prices and to limit the supply of prestige cosmetics products sold by the Department Store Defendants in violation of state and Federal laws. The plaintiffs sought, among other things, treble damages, equitable relief, attorneys' fees, interest and costs.
In 1998, the Office of the Attorney General of the State of New York (the "State") notified the Company and ten other entities that they are potentially responsible parties ("PRPs") with respect to the Blydenburgh landfill in Islip, New York. Each PRP may be jointly and severally liable for the costs of investigation and cleanup, which the State estimates to be $16 million for all PRPs. In 2001, the State sued other PRPs (including Hickey's Carting, Inc., Dennis C. Hickey and Maria Hickey, collectively the "Hickey Parties"), in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York to recover such costs in connection with the site, and in September 2002, the Hickey Parties brought contribution actions against the Company and other Blydenburgh PRPs. These contribution actions seek to recover, among other things, any damages for which the Hickey Parties are found liable in the State's lawsuit against them, and related costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees. In June 2004, the State added the Company and other PRPs as defendants in its pending case against the Hickey Parties. The Company and certain other PRPs have engaged in settlement discussions which to date have been unsuccessful. The Company has accrued an amount which it believes would be necessary to resolve its share of this matter. If settlement discussions are not successful, the Company intends to vigorously defend the pending claims. While no assurance can be given as to the ultimate outcome, management believes that the resolution of the Blydenburgh matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial condition.

In January 2004, the Portuguese Tax Administration issued a report alleging that the Company's subsidiary had income subject to tax in Portugal for the three calendar years ended December 31, 2002. The Company's subsidiary has been operating in the Madeira Free Trade Zone since 1989 under license from the Madeira Development Corporation and, in accordance with such license and the laws of Portugal, the Company believes that its income is not subject to Portuguese income tax. In February 2004, the subsidiary filed an appeal of the finding to the Portuguese Secretary of State for Fiscal Matters. The appeal is still pending. On December 20, 2004, the subsidiary received a notice of assessment from the Portuguese Tax Administration solely in respect of the calendar year ended December 31, 2000. The assessment, which includes interest, amounted to 27.7 million Euros. At the end of March 2005, the subsidiary filed an opposition to the assessment. No action has been taken by the Portuguese Tax Administration in respect of the opposition, which remains pending. In August 2005, the Portuguese Tax Administration notified the subsidiary that it is beginning executive procedures to collect on the assessment for 2000, and the Company is in the process of arranging the required financial guarantee. On May 17 and 18, 2005, the subsidiary received notices of assessment from the Portuguese Tax Administration in respect of the calendar years ended December 31, 2001 and 2002. The assessments are for 21.6 million Euros and 22.4 million Euros, respectively, to which the subsidiary has filed oppositions in July 2005. While no assurance can be given as to the ultimate outcome in respect of the foregoing assessments or any additional assessments that may be issued for subsequent periods, management believes that the likelihood that the assessment or any future assessments ultimately will be upheld is remote.
In December 2004, a plaintiff purporting to represent a nationwide class brought an action in the Superior Court of California for the County of San Diego. The complaint, as amended, names two of the Company's subsidiaries and approximately 25 other defendants, including manufacturers and retailers. The plaintiff is seeking injunctive relief, restitution, and general, special and punitive damages for alleged violations of the California Unfair Competition Law, the California False Advertising Law, and for negligent and intentional misrepresentation. The purported class includes individuals "who have purchased skin care products from defendants that have been falsely advertised to have an anti-aging' or youth inducing benefit or effect." The Company intends to defend itself vigorously. While no assurance can be given as to the ultimate outcome, management believes that the resolution of this lawsuit will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial condition.
In June 2005, an action was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida against one of its subsidiaries. Two of the Company's department store customers were added as defendants in an amended complaint filed in August 2005. The plaintiff, purporting to represent a nationwide class of individuals "who have purchased skin care products from Defendant that have been falsely advertised to have an anti-aging' or youth-inducing benefit or effect," seeks injunctive relief as well as compensatory and punitive damages for alleged breach of express and implied warranties, negligent misrepresentation, and false advertising and unfair business practices. While no assurance can be given as to the ultimate outcome, management believes that the resolution of this lawsuit will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial condition.

are treated as available-for-sale and, accordingly, the applicable investments have been adjusted to market value with a corresponding adjustment, net of tax, to net unrealized investment gains in accumulated other comprehensive income. Included in accumulated other comprehensive income was an unrealized investment gain (net of deferred taxes) of $0.4 million and $0.1 million at June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

As a result of stock option exercises, the Company recorded tax benefits of $19.7 million, $19.3 million and $7.9 million during fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which are included in additional paid-in capital in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
As of June 30, 2005, and 2004, the Company had a current liability and an equal and offsetting decrease in long-term debt of $2.9 million and $12.5 million, respectively, reflecting the fair market value of an interest rate swap which was classified as a fair value hedge of the 6% Senior Notes (see Note 8).
As of June 30, 2005, the Company had a current liability with an equal and offsetting increase in goodwill of $37.7 million related to an expected payment to be made in fiscal 2006 to satisfy an earn-out provision related to the Company's acquisition of Jo Malone Limited in October 1999, which payment may be satisfied by the issuance of a note to the seller. In addition, in fiscal 2005, the Company had acquired $10.9 million of machinery and equipment through capital lease arrangements, of which the related liability is included in short-term and long-term debt.
NOTE 17  SEGMENT DATA AND RELATED INFORMATION
Reportable operating segments, as defined by SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information," include components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (the "Chief Executive") in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. As a result of the similarities in the manufacturing, marketing and distribution processes for all of the Company's products, much of the information provided in the consolidated financial statements is similar to, or the same as, that reviewed on a regular basis by the Chief Executive. Although the Company operates in one business segment, beauty products, management also evaluates performance on a product category basis.
While the Company's results of operations are also reviewed on a consolidated basis, the Chief Executive reviews data segmented on a basis that facilitates comparison to industry statistics. Accordingly, net sales, depreciation and amortization, and operating income are available with respect to the manufacture and distribution of skin care, makeup, fragrance, hair care and other products. These product categories meet the FASB's definition of operating segments and, accordingly, additional financial data are provided below. The "other" segment includes the sales and related results of ancillary products and services that do not fit the definition of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care.
The Company evaluates segment performance based upon operating income, which represents earnings before income taxes, minority interest, net interest expense and discontinued operations. The accounting policies for each of the reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies, except for depreciation and amortization charges, which are allocated, primarily, based upon net sales. The assets and liabilities of the Company are managed centrally and are reported internally

Subsequent to June 30, 2005, the Company acquired a business engaged in the wholesale distribution and retail sale of Aveda products resulting in an increase to goodwill of $5.7 million. In addition, the Company settled its obligation, recorded as goodwill at June 30, 2005, related to an earn-out provision in the Company's fiscal 2000 acquisition of Jo Malone Limited.
Since June 30, 2005, the Company made additional commitments pursuant to employment agreements of approximately $30 million, which are expected to be paid through fiscal 2011. Furthermore, the Company committed to spend approximately $21 million to support the company-wide initiative to upgrade its information systems, which is expected to be paid through November 2006.

Subsequent to June 30, 2005 and through January 24, 2006, the Company recorded non-recurring expenses of approximately $32 million related to the implementation of this cost savings initiative. These charges represent the initial costs relating to one element of the program.
NOTE 20  SUBSEQUENT EVENT  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
In September 2005, the Company committed to a plan to sell the assets and operations of its reporting unit that markets and sells Stila brand products and to actively seek a buyer for the brand.
Following this decision, and as a result of the Company's efforts to sell the assets and operations of this reporting unit during the quarter ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded a charge of $72.0 million (net of $16.2 million tax benefit) as discontinued operations for the six months ended December 31, 2005. The charge reflects the anticipated loss on the sale of the business of $65.5 million, net of tax, and the operating loss of $6.5 million, net of tax, for the six months ended December 31, 2005. Net sales associated with the discontinued operations were $25.7 million for the six months ended December 31, 2005.
