EXHIBIT 99.1 The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. News Contact: Investor Relations: Dennis D'Andrea 767 Fifth Avenue (212) 572-4384 New York, NY 10153 Media Relations: Sally Susman (212) 572-4430 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: ESTEE LAUDER COMPANIES REPORTS $.27 EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS IN FISCAL 2007 FIRST QUARTER NET SALES INCREASE 6% BOARD DECLARES 25% DIVIDEND INCREASE New York, NY, October 25, 2006 - The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE: EL) today reported $1.59 billion in net sales for its fiscal first quarter ended September 30, 2006, a 6% increase over the $1.50 billion reported in the prior-year quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales rose 5%. The Company reported net earnings from continuing operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2006 of $58.0 million, compared with $61.8 million last year. Diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations for the quarter were $.27 compared with $.28 reported in the prior year. Net earnings and diluted earnings per share for the quarter including discontinued operations were essentially flat and increased 4%, respectively, compared with the prior-year quarter. Separately, the Board of Directors of The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. voted to increase the dividend on the Company's Class A and Class B Common Stock to $.50 per share. The dividend amount represents a 25% increase over the previous annual rate of $.40 per share that was paid in December 2005. The $.50 per share annual dividend will be payable on December 27, 2006 to stockholders of record at the close of business on December 8, 2006. William P. Lauder, President and Chief Executive Officer said, "This quarter we invested in our fast-moving businesses to accelerate momentum, while prudently controlling costs in other areas. The result was top line growth above the industry average and a better than expected bottom line performance. Beginning the fiscal year on solid footing gives us confidence in our ability to deliver our fiscal 2007 stated objective of $2.00 to $2.10 earnings per share." Page 1 of 8
Results by Product Category The skin care, makeup and fragrance categories were adversely impacted by fewer department store doors during the current-year quarter as compared to the prior-year quarter resulting from the merger of Federated Department Stores, Inc. (Federated) and The May Department Stores Company (May). Skin Care - --------- o Net sales of skin care products benefited from the recent launch of Advanced Night Repair Concentrate Recovery Boosting Treatment and the continued success of Resilience Lift Extreme Ultra Firming Cremes by Estee Lauder. Higher sales of products in the 3-Step Skin Care System and Turnaround Concentrate Visible Skin Renewer from Clinique also contributed to growth. o Lower sales of some existing products, particularly in certain of the Company's core brands, partially offset the increases. o Operating income increased due to the higher sales, which outpaced the increase in the Company's support spending in this category. Makeup - ------ o Makeup sales for the quarter increased, primarily reflecting solid growth from the Company's makeup artist brands. New product launches, such as Plushglass lip gloss, and M.A.C Viva Glam VI lip products, the proceeds of which are donated to AIDS-related charities, contributed to growth. o Challenges in certain core brands partially offset these positive results. o Makeup operating results decreased, reflecting the challenges faced by certain core brands as mentioned above, the costs associated with the Viva Glam campaigns, and a charge incurred in anticipation of the settlement of an employment matter. Fragrance - --------- o Fragrance sales decreased moderately compared to the prior year as the fragrance category continues to be challenging, particularly in the United States, reflecting lower sales of Estee Lauder Beyond Paradise and various Clinique and Tommy Hilfiger fragrances. o The recent launches of DKNY Red Delicious, Pure White Linen by Estee Lauder and Unforgivable by Sean John contributed positively to the category's sales. Page 2 of 8
o Operating results in the fragrance product category increased, reflecting the Company's effort to balance sales levels with profitability. Hair Care - --------- o Sales of hair care products and services increased, primarily due to higher sales at Aveda and Bumble and bumble. o Higher sales at Bumble and bumble were primarily due to strong like-door growth and new points of distribution. o Aveda net sales growth was due to the recent launch of Color Conserve Strengthening Treatment, gains in products, such as Pure Abundance Potion and Air Control, continued strong demand for professional color products, and the recent acquisition of a distributor. o Hair care operating income decreased due to spending in support of new distribution points, product launches and the Company's strategic modernization initiative. The Americas - ------------ o Net sales for the quarter increased, led by growth in the Company's makeup artist and hair care brands. Strong growth from the Company's online business and solid overall gains in Canada, Latin America and Mexico added to the increase. o Sales in the region were tempered by decreases in certain core brands, which continue to be challenged by competitive pressures and fewer stores resulting from the consolidation of Federated and May. o The prior-year period results were weakened by severe weather conditions, as well as rising gas prices which the Company believed adversely influenced consumer spending habits. o Operating income in the Americas declined from the prior-year quarter as a result of the above-mentioned challenges, along with the Company's strategic investments to further build its new and existing brands. During the quarter, the Company incurred a charge in anticipation of the settlement of an employment matter. Partially offsetting these decreases were higher operating results from various businesses including the Company's makeup artist brands and online, as well as cost-control efforts from certain core brands. Page 3 of 8
Europe, the Middle East & Africa - -------------------------------- o In constant currency, net sales increased throughout the region. Higher sales were led by the United Kingdom, the Company's travel retail business, Germany, Russia, South Africa and Italy. o This region was up against an easy comparison to the prior-year quarter when sales decreased 1%, due in part to certain markets that were adversely impacted by temporary disruptions caused by the transition to a new regional inventory center in Belgium. o Operating profitability declined, primarily due to lower results in France, the United Kingdom, the Company's distributor business and Switzerland, partially offset by improved results in Germany and Italy. o Although sales increased throughout the region, particularly in the United Kingdom and the Company's travel retail business, the decrease in profitability reflected the Company's continued efforts to support its brands through advertising, merchandising and sampling, as well as higher selling expenses. Asia/Pacific - ------------ o Virtually all countries in the region reported local currency sales increases, with strong double-digit growth in China, Korea and Hong Kong, and solid growth in Australia. o Operating profit in the region increased substantially, led by improved results in China, and solid growth in Korea and Australia. Cash Flows - ---------- o For the three months ended September 30, 2006, net cash flows used for operating activities from continuing operations were $70.1 million, compared with $61.6 million in the prior-year period. o The change primarily reflects increases in certain seasonal working capital components. o Operating cash flow was utilized primarily for the repurchase of shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock, capital investments and the purchase of the remaining interest in the Bumble and bumble companies. Estimate of Fiscal 2007 Second Quarter and Full Year - ---------------------------------------------------- Second Quarter - -------------- o Net sales are expected to grow between 6% and 8% in constant currency, and the foreign currency translation impact is expected to add approximately 2% on a reported basis. o Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations are projected to be between $.73 and $.78. Full Year - --------- o Net sales continue to be expected to grow between 5% and 7% in constant currency. o Foreign currency translation impact is expected to be a 1% benefit versus the prior year period. o Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations continues to be projected between $2.00 and $2.10, including eight cents per share impact related to the Federated store closures. Page 4 of 8
o On a product category basis, in constant currency, sales in hair care and makeup are expected to be the leading sales growth categories, followed by skin care and fragrance. o Geographic region net sales growth in constant currency is expected to be led by Asia/Pacific and Europe, the Middle East & Africa, followed by the Americas. o The Company expects to deliver approximately $30 million in incremental savings in the current fiscal year ending June 30, 2007, under its cost savings initiative implemented in fiscal 2006. o Full fiscal year 2007 estimate includes $50 million of net sales and six cents diluted earnings per share related to the Company's business in the Lord & Taylor retail chain, which was recently sold by Federated. If as a result of the sale, store closures within this chain take place during the fiscal year, such closures will reduce the Company's fiscal 2007 results.

(12) real estate rates and availability, which may affect the Company's ability to increase the number of retail locations at which the Company sells its products and the costs associated with the Company's other facilities; (13) changes in product mix to products which are less profitable; (14) the Company's ability to acquire, develop or implement new information and distribution technologies, on a timely basis and within the Company's cost estimates; (15) the Company's ability to capitalize on opportunities for improved efficiency, such as publicly-announced cost-savings initiatives and the success of Stila under new ownership, and to integrate acquired businesses and realize value therefrom; (16) consequences attributable to the events that are currently taking place in the Middle East, including terrorist attacks, retaliation and the threat of further attacks or retaliation; (17) the timing and impact of acquisitions and divestitures, which depend on willing sellers and buyers, respectively; and (18) additional factors as described in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006.

THE ESTEE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS (Unaudited; In millions, except per share data) (A) On September 30, 2005, the Company committed to a plan to sell certain assets and operations of its reporting unit that marketed and sold Stila brand products. On April 10, 2006, the Company completed the sale. As such, $0.3 million of income and $3.3 million of loss, both net of tax, for the three months ended September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively, are reflected as discontinued operations in the statements of earnings. The current year income resulted from the Company providing certain transitional distribution and online services as well as the manufacture and sale to the purchaser of a limited range of products. In addition, the Company provided transitional services related to certain information systems, accounting and other back office services to the purchaser in exchange for monthly service fees designed to recover the estimated costs of providing these transition services. Transitional services are expected to conclude in fiscal 2007. Page 7 of 8
