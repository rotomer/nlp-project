ITEM 5.02 DEPARTURE OF DIRECTORS OR CERTAIN OFFICERS; ELECTION OF DIRECTORS; APPOINTMENT OF CERTAIN OFFICERS; COMPENSATORY ARRANGEMENTS OF CERTAIN OFFICERS. On September 6, 2007, the Company's Compensation Committee approved the payment of cash bonuses for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 ("fiscal 2007"), to the Company's named executive officers pursuant to the Company's Executive Annual Incentive Plan in the following amounts: Named Executive Officer* Fiscal 2007 Bonus Amount -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Leonard A. Lauder $1,800,000 William P. Lauder $2,187,300 Daniel J. Brestle $2,187,300 Patrick Bousquet-Chavanne $1,910,700 Philip Shearer $1,879,500 Richard W. Kunes $ 695,800 * Due to a change in the disclosure rules since the 2006 proxy statement, Mr. Kunes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will replace Mr. L. Lauder as a named executive officer in 2007. While the Company overachieved the targets for net sales and earnings per share in fiscal 2007 that were the basis for the bonus opportunities for Leonard A. Lauder (Chairman), his bonus was capped at the aggregate target opportunity of $1,800,000. Bonuses for William P. Lauder (President and Chief Executive Officer), Daniel J. Brestle (Chief Operating Officer) and Richard W. Kunes (Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer) reflected the overachievement on the net sales and earnings per share opportunities, but were offset by failure to achieve the target opportunity for working capital relating to inventory, as measured by inventory days to sell. Mr. Kunes' bonus also reflects achievement of opportunities relating to his departments and the Company's strategic plan. The bonuses for Patrick Bousquet-Chavanne (Group President) and Philip Shearer (Group President) reflected the overachievement of the net sales and earnings per share targets by the Company in fiscal 2007 and the over and underachievement of goals for opportunities relating to their respective groups relating to net sales for the group, operating margin, working capital relating to inventory and planning accuracy. Measurement of performance was subject to certain automatic adjustments. For instance, achievement of net sales targets did not include the excess benefits provided by foreign currency exchange rates. 2
