THE ESTE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
 

 
 
ESTE LAUDER COMPANIES REPORTS $.20 EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS IN FISCAL 2008 FIRST QUARTER
 
NET SALES INCREASE 7%
 
REITERATES FULL FISCAL YEAR 2008 EXPECTATIONS
 
The Este Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE: EL) today reported $1.71 billion in net sales for its fiscal first quarter ended September 30, 2007, a 7% increase over the $1.59 billion reported in the prior-year quarter.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales rose 5%.
New York, NY, October 25, 2007 -
 
The Company reported net earnings from continuing operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2007 of $39.1 million, compared with $58.0 million last year.  Diluted net earnings per common share from continuing operations for the quarter were $.20 compared with $.27 reported in the prior year.
 
William P. Lauder, President and Chief Executive Officer said, "We have produced solid double-digit sales gains in international this quarter.  As this business remains our largest growth potential, we expect continued strong growth as we further expand our developing brands and strengthen our core brands.
 
"Our strategic investments are key drivers of our long-term plan to achieve profitable growth.  We continued that investment pattern this quarter in our fast-moving businesses as well as established and emerging markets.  At this juncture, we remain comfortable with our ability to meet our previously announced guidance of earnings per share of $2.28 to $2.40 for the full 2008 fiscal year."
 
 
 
 
Full-Year Results by Product Category
 
 
In the quarter, the skin care, makeup and fragrance categories were negatively impacted in the United States by the ordering patterns of department stores as a result of a one week shift in the retail calendar to the Company's fiscal second quarter.
 
Skin Care
      The 9% net sales growth in skin care products in the current quarter was particularly strong in view of the 8% sales gain in the category in last year's first quarter.  This growth was primarily fueled by double-digit increases in the Company's European and Asian businesses.
 - 
      Idealist Pore Minimizing Skin Refinisher by Este Lauder contributed significantly to international growth, while the recent global launch of Acne Solutions Clear Skin System and domestic introduction of Zero Gravity Repairwear Lift Firming Cream from Clinique added to the category's increase.  The continued worldwide success of the Company's fast growing La Mer brand also generated positive sales gains.
 - 
      Operating income decreased reflecting the shift in the U.S. retail calendar mentioned above, as well as additional spending behind the Company's brands to maintain momentum into the holiday season.
 - 
 
Makeup
      Makeup sales increased, reflecting solid gains in international markets, partially offset by declines in the Americas.  Sales in the Americas were negatively impacted by the shift in the U.S. retail calendar.
 - 
      Sales growth from the Company's makeup artist brands, principally in international markets during the quarter reflects the favorable consumer acceptance of new and existing products along with additional market expansion.
 - 
      Operating income decreased reflecting the lower sales in the U.S., as well as additional spending behind the Company's brands to maintain momentum into the holiday season.
 - 
 
Fragrance
      Fragrance sales increased in all geographic regions primarily driven by newer fragrance offerings.  While current year sales compared favorably to the prior year, the Company continues to face challenges in this product category, primarily in the United States.
 - 
      New launches such as Sean John Unforgivable Woman, Este Lauder , Tom Ford Black Orchid and Este Lauder Private Collection Tuberose Gardenia contributed to the sales growth.
 - 
pleasures delight
      The continued success of Sean John Unforgivable also contributed positively to the category's sales.
 - 
      Operating results in the fragrance product category decreased due to support spending behind the Company's new launches as well as its existing fragrances.
 - 
 
Hair Care
      Sales of hair care products increased, primarily due to growth from Aveda and Bumble and bumble, and the inclusion of the Ojon brand, which was acquired at the end of July 2007.
 - 
      Aveda net sales benefited from the recent launch of Aveda Men Pure-Formance products and the recent acquisition of two independent distributors.
 - 
      Higher sales at Bumble and bumble were primarily due to a new hotel amenities program.
 - 
      Hair care operating profit rose as the increase in sales outpaced increased spending in support of new distribution points and product launches, and the additional cost related to newly acquired distributors.  The inclusion of the Ojon brand contributed incremental positive results.
 - 
 
 
 
Results by Geographic Region
 
 
The Americas
      The slight net sales decrease for the quarter in the region reflected the negative impact of the shift in the U.S. retail calendar.
 - 
      Certain core brands in the United States posted lower sales, reflecting competitive pressures.
 - 
      Partially offsetting these negatives were sales from the launch of the Sean John Unforgivable Woman fragrance and increased sales of Sean John Unforgivable.
 - 
 
 
      Sales growth also was generated from the Company's internet distribution, hair care business, including the addition of the Ojon brand, as well as solid overall gains in Latin America and Canada.
 - 
      Operating income in the Americas declined versus the prior year-period, reflecting the above-mentioned sales shift and spending behind strategic initiatives intended to drive future sales growth.  Improved operating income from the Company's hair care and internet distribution businesses partially offset these results. 
 - 
 
Europe, the Middle East & Africa
      In constant currency, net sales increased in almost every country in the region.  Higher sales were led by the Company's travel retail business, the United Kingdom, France and Russia.
 - 
      Operating income decreased, primarily due to the cost of establishing an affiliate in the Middle East, and lower results in Germany and the United Kingdom.  The higher sales in most countries were more than offset by increased support spending and selling expenses behind the Company's brands.
 - 
      Improved operating results were generated primarily from the Company's travel retail and distributor businesses.
 - 
 
Asia/Pacific
      Every country in the region reported local currency sales increases.  China sales growth continued its strong double-digit pace, while sales gains in Hong Kong posted the largest percentage increase.
 - 
      Japan, the Company's largest Asian market, benefited from an improved retail environment, posting its largest quarterly increase in eight years, with sales up high-single digits.
 - 
      Operating profit in the region increased substantially, led by improved results in Australia, Japan, Hong Kong and Thailand.
 - 
 
Cash Flows
      For the three months ended September 30, 2007, net cash flows used for operating activities from continuing operations were $132.8 million, compared with $70.1 million in the prior-year period.
 - 
      The change primarily reflects increases in certain seasonal working capital components and lower net earnings from continuing operations.
 - 
      Operating cash flow was utilized primarily for the repurchase of shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock, capital investments and the acquisition of Ojon.
 - 
 
Estimate of Fiscal 2008 Second Quarter and Full Year 
 
Second Quarter
      Net sales are expected to grow between 10% and 12% in constant currency. 
 - 
      Foreign currency translation benefit is expected to be approximately 3% versus the prior-year period.
 - 
      Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations are projected to be between $1.10 and $1.17.
 - 
 
 
Full Year
      Net sales are forecasted to continue to grow between 7% and 9% in constant currency. 
 - 
      Foreign currency translation benefit is expected to be approximately 2% versus the prior-year period.
 - 
      The Company continues to project diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $2.28 and $2.40. 
 - 
      On a product category basis, in constant currency, sales in hair care and skin care are expected to be the leading sales growth categories, followed by makeup and fragrance. 
 - 
      Geographic region net sales growth in constant currency is expected to be led by Europe, the Middle East & Africa, followed by Asia/Pacific and the Americas.
