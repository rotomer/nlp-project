Exhibit 99.1
 
 
ESTE LAUDER COMPANIES REPORTS THIRD QUARTER
EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $.46
 
SALES INCREASE 11% ON STRONG INTERNATIONAL GROWTH
 
FULL YEAR EPS OUTLOOK REMAINS ON TRACK
 
The Este Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE: EL) today reported $1.88 billion in net sales for its fiscal third quarter ended March 31, 2008, an 11% increase over the $1.69 billion reported in the prior-year quarter.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales rose 7%.
New York, NY, May 6, 2008 -
 
The Company reported net earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2008 of $90.1 million compared with $93.9 million last year.  Diluted net earnings per common share for the quarter was $.46 compared with $.45 reported in the prior year.
 
William P. Lauder, Chief Executive Officer said, "One of the great strengths of our Company is our geographic and product category balance. This was clearly visible in our results this quarter, which enabled us to deliver solid sales growth despite the softness in the U.S. retail environment.  Continued strong double-digit sales gains in our international operations, marked by increases in all product categories in Europe and Asia, drove our third quarter performance.  These results underscore the validity of our investment in international businesses, including emerging markets, where we see positive trends for long-term, profitable growth.  We are continuing to capitalize on those international growth opportunities and at the same time address the challenges in the U.S. through our innovation, marketing prowess and brand building expertise.
 
"Based on our results to date we remain confident that we are on track to meet our previously announced full fiscal year sales and earnings objectives and are comfortable narrowing our earnings per share range to $2.34 and $2.40 for the 2008 fiscal year."
 
Results by Product Category
 
 
Skin Care
 - 
     
The 13% net sales growth in skin care products in the current quarter was particularly strong in view of the 9% sales gain in the category in last year's third quarter.
 - 
     
The current quarter's growth was fueled by increases in all geographic regions, particularly Asia/Pacific, where more than 50% of the Company's sales in the region is in skin care.
 - 
     
In addition to sales growth from certain existing products, the skin care category benefited from strong worldwide incremental sales of recent products, such as Idealist Pore Minimizing Skin Refinisher and Cyber White EX by Este Lauder, and Acne Solutions Clear Skin System from Clinique. The category's growth reflected double-digit gains from the Company's La Mer brand, due in part to the momentum from the recent launch of The Eye Concentrate.
 - 
     
Operating income increased, primarily reflecting improved results internationally.
 
Makeup
 - 
     
The makeup category posted solid sales growth led by double-digit gains internationally and a single-digit increase in the Americas.
 - 
     
Double-digit growth in the Company's makeup artist brands contributed more than 65% of the incremental sales. The strong gains in the makeup artist brands were generated by solid product performances, additional market expansion, and for the

, new freestanding retail stores. The increase also reflects the positive contributions of new and existing products from certain core brands.
 - 
     
Operating income increased, primarily reflecting strong international growth.
 
Fragrance
 - 
     
In absolute dollars, fragrance sales growth was strongest in the Company's European region, primarily driven by newer fragrance offerings, followed by gains in Asia/Pacific. Fragrance sales in the Americas declined, tempered by the soft retail environment in the United States.
 - 
     
While current quarter sales compared favorably to the same prior-year period, the Company continues to face challenges in this product category, primarily in the United States.
 
 - 
     
Contributing to the sales growth were recent launches, such as Dreaming Tommy Hilfiger, Este Lauder Pure White Linen Light Breeze, DKNY Delicious Night and Sean John Unforgivable Woman.
 - 
     
Operating loss in the fragrance category widened, primarily reflecting lower results from the Company's designer fragrance business due to incremental spending in support of new product launches as well as existing fragrances.
 
Hair Care
 - 
     
Sales of hair care products increased modestly, reflecting the inclusion of the Ojon brand, which was acquired in July 2007, partially offset by lower sales from Aveda and Bumble and bumble.
 - 
     
The decrease in Aveda net sales reflected the anniversary of solid product launches in the prior-year quarter. These results were partially offset in the current quarter by the recent launches of Aveda Men Pure-Formance and Smooth Infusion products.
 - 
     
Lower sales at Bumble and bumble were due to the discontinuance of its hotel amenities program.
 - 
     
Hair care operating results declined, reflecting the soft sales growth coupled with investments designed to support short- and long-term growth in this category through new points of distribution. The lower results are also due to an increase in intangible asset amortization resulting from recent strategic acquisitions.
 
Results by Geographic Region
 
 
The Americas
 - 
     
Sales growth reflected overall gains in Canada, including the addition of the Ojon brand, and Latin America. Gains were also achieved in the United States from the Company's makeup artist brands and internet distribution.
 - 
     
The Company believes the soft retail environment in the United States during the quarter, particularly in the department store channel, as well as competitive pressures, negatively impacted certain of the Company's brands. These challenges have been mitigated through sales in alternative channels, such as freestanding stores, the internet, self-select distribution and direct-response television.
 - 
     
Operating income in the Americas declined versus the prior-year period, reflecting higher costs of global information technology systems and infrastructure and increased spending on
 
advertising, merchandising and sampling activities. Operating results also reflected the investments and higher intangible asset amortization related to the Company's hair care business mentioned above.
 
Europe, the Middle East & Africa
 - 
     
In constant currency, net sales increased in most countries in the region. The higher sales were led by double-digit growth in the Company's travel retail business and strong gains in the United Kingdom, Spain and Italy.
 - 
     
Double-digit increases were also achieved in certain countries including Benelux and Russia.
 - 
     
Operating income increased, primarily due to improved results in travel retail, Italy and Spain. Partially offsetting these increases were lower results in Russia, reflecting spending to support market expansion.
 
Asia/Pacific
 - 
     
This region generated significant constant currency sales growth with virtually every country posting solid increases. Strong double-digit growth was generated in most countries with the strongest gains in China, Korea and Hong Kong. Japan, the Company's largest Asian market, continued to improve with sales rising high-single digits.
 - 
     
In China, the Company's largest emerging Asian market, most of the Company's brands recorded double-digit retail sales growth, reflecting the strength of the brands and the appeal of their products.
 - 
     
Operating income in the region increased substantially, with most countries experiencing profit growth in the quarter. Improved results were led by China, Japan, Korea and Hong Kong
.
 
Nine-Month Results
 - 
     
For the nine months ended March 31, 2008, the Company reported net sales of $5.90 billion, a 12% increase from $5.28 billion in the comparable prior-year period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales rose 8%. The Company reported net earnings of $353.6 million for the nine months, compared with $360.6 million in the same period last year. Diluted net earnings per common share for the nine months ended March 31, 2008 increased 5% to $1.80, compared with $1.71 reported in the prior-year period.
 
Cash Flows
For the nine months ended March 31, 2008, net cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased 14% to $518.5 million, compared with $456.3 million in the prior-year period.
 - 
     
The increase primarily reflects higher net earnings from continuing operations before certain non-cash items, such as depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation, as well as an improvement in certain working capital components.
 - 
     
Operating cash flow was utilized primarily for capital investments, dividends, the acquisition of Ojon and the repurchase of shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock.
 - 
     
 
Estimate of Fiscal 2008 Full Year
Net sales are forecasted to grow between 7% and 9% in constant currency.
 - 
     
Foreign currency translation benefit is expected to be approximately 4% versus the prior-year period.
 - 
     
The Company projects diluted earnings per share to be between $2.34 and $2.40.
 - 
     
On a product category basis, in constant currency, sales in skin care and hair care are expected to be the leading sales growth categories, followed by makeup and fragrance.
 - 
     
Geographic region net sales growth in constant currency is expected to be led by Asia/Pacific, followed by Europe, the Middle East & Africa, and the Americas.
 -
