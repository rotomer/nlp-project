Employment Term. The Company hereby agrees to employ the Executive, and the Executive hereby agrees to enter into employment, as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company subject to termination pursuant to Section 6 hereof. The period from July 1, 2009 through the date of such termination shall be the "Term of Employment". 2. Duties and Extent of Services. (a) During the Term of Employment, the Executive shall serve as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company reporting to the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Chairman, and, in such capacity, shall render such executive, managerial, administrative and other services as customarily are associated with and incident to such position, and as the Company may, from time to time, reasonably require of him consistent with such position. (b) The Executive shall also hold such other positions and executive offices of the Company and/or of any of the Company's subsidiaries or affiliates as may from time to time be agreed by the Executive or assigned by the Chief Executive Officer, the Executive Chairman or the Executive's direct supervisor if not the Chief Executive Officer or Executive Chairman, or the Board of Directors, provided that each such position shall be commensurate with
the Executive's standing in the business community as Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. The Executive shall not be entitled to any compensation other than the compensation provided for herein for serving during the Term of Employment in any other office or position of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, unless the Board of Directors of the Company or the appropriate committee thereof shall specifically approve such additional compensation. (c) The Executive shall be a full-time "at will" employee of the Company and shall exclusively devote all his business time and efforts faithfully and competently to the Company and shall diligently perform to the best of his ability all of the duties required of him as Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and in the other positions or offices of the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates assigned to him hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, the Executive may serve as a non-management director of such business corporations (or in a like capacity in other for-profit or not-for-profit organizations) as the Chief Executive Officer, the Executive Chairman or the Board of Directors of the Company may approve, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. (d) The Executive shall comply with the Company's stock ownership guidelines applicable to the Executive as they may be implemented and/or amended by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. 3. (a) Base Salary. As compensation for all services to be rendered pursuant to this Agreement and as payment for the rights and interests granted by Executive hereunder, the Company shall pay or cause any of its subsidiaries to pay the Executive a base salary (the "Base Salary") during the Term of Employment subject to the provisions of Section 3(c) at a rate set by the Compensation Committee from time to time. Subject to Section 6(j) of this Agreement, all amounts of Base Salary provided for hereunder shall be payable in accordance with the regular payroll policies of the Company in effect from time to time. (b) Incentive Bonus Compensation. The Executive shall be eligible to participate in the Company's Executive Annual Incentive Plan or any subsequent Bonus Plan for executives that is approved by the stockholders of the Company (the "Bonus Plan") Any target bonus opportunities granted to the Executive shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Bonus Plan, which are incorporated herein by reference; provided, however, that the bonus payout with respect to any fiscal year shall be paid to Executive no later than the 15th day of the third month following the end of such fiscal year. (c) Deferral. (i) Deferral Elections--In General. The Executive may elect to defer payment of all or any part of any incentive bonus compensation payable under Section 3(b) by making an election, in a manner prescribed by the Company, on or before December 31 of the calendar year before the fiscal year begins (or such earlier date as may be necessary to comply with the applicable tax laws and regulations). (ii) Deferral Elections--Performance-Based Compensation. For any incentive bonus compensation that qualifies as performance-based compensation under Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-1(e) and is based upon a performance period of at least twelve (12) months, the Executive may make a deferral election at any time before the date that is six (6) months before the applicable performance period ends, but only if (i) the incentive bonus 2
compensation is not readily ascertainable when the election is made and (ii) the service provider has performed services continuously from the later of the beginning of the performance period or the date the performance criteria are established. (iii) Amounts Subject to Section 162(m). If any amount of Base Salary, any amount payable under the Bonus Plan, or any other amount payable to the Executive is not currently deductible under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or like or successor provisions (a "Non-Deductible Amount"), the Company will defer payment of the Non-Deductible Amount until section 162(m) no longer applies to the Executive. Any amounts so deferred will be credited to a bookkeeping account in the name of the Executive as of the date scheduled for payment (the "Deferred Compensation Account"). The Deferred Compensation Account will be credited with interest as of each June 30 during the term of deferral, compounded annually, at an annual rate equal to the annual rate of interest announced by Citibank N.A. in New York, New York as its base rate in effect on such June 30, but limited to a maximum annual rate of 9%. (iv) Payment of Amounts Deferred and Vested On or Before December 31, 2004. Amounts credited to the Executive's Deferred Compensation Account on or before December 31, 2004, and any subsequently credited interest, will be paid in cash to the Executive (or the Executive's designated beneficiary if the Executive dies before payment,) subject to applicable withholding taxes. The Company will choose the payment date, which will be no later than 90 days after Executive's employment with the Company terminates, unless the Executive requests before terminating a later payment date or dates and the Company agrees to the request. (v) Payment of Amounts Deferred and Vested After December 31, 2004. Subject to Section 6(j), amounts credited to the Executive's Deferred Compensation Account after December 31, 2004 will be paid to the Executive (or the Executive's designated beneficiary if the Executive dies before payment), subject to applicable withholding taxes on, or as soon as practicable after, the date the Executive separates from service with the Company (as defined in Treas. Reg. section 1.409A-1(h)). The Non-Deductible Amount will be paid at the earliest date at which the Company reasonably expects that the deduction will not be limited or eliminated by Code section 162(m). The Company, in its sole discretion, may provide an investment facility for all or a portion of such deferred amounts, but is not required to do so. 4. (a) Equity-Based Compensation. The Executive shall be eligible to participate in the Amended and Restated Fiscal 2002 Share Incentive Plan or such other share incentive plan that is approved by the stockholders of the Company (the "Share Incentive Plan").

Executive acknowledges and agrees that any grant of equity-based compensation shall be effective as provided only to the extent permitted by the Share Incentive Plan, and this Agreement shall not obligate the Company to adopt any successor plan providing for the grant of equity-based compensation. If authority over the Company's equity compensation programs is changed from the Stock Plan Subcommittee to the Compensation Committee (or other committee), then after such change, references herein to the Stock Plan Subcommittee shall be to the appropriate committee. 3
5. Benefits. (a) Standard Benefits. During the Term of Employment, the Executive shall be entitled to participate in all pension and retirement savings, fringe benefit and welfare plans, including life insurance, medical, health and accident, disability, and vacation plans and programs maintained by the Company from time to time for senior executives at a level commensurate with his position. The Executive acknowledges that participation in such programs may result in the receipt by him of additional taxable income. (b) Perquisite Reimbursement; Financial Counseling.

Such reimbursement shall generally occur within seventy-five (75) days after the end of the calendar year of presentment, provided that such presentment occurs within ninety (90) days after the date the related expense were incurred. Notwithstanding the above, to the extent that the expenses were incurred in one calendar year and presentment occurs in the following calendar year, such reimbursement shall occur by the end of the calendar year in which the presentment occurs. In no event shall the gross amount of such reimbursements be greater than $15,000.00 in respect of any calendar year, nor shall amounts that are not reimbursed in one calendar year up to the $15,000.00 per year limitation be able to be used in another calendar year or otherwise be made available to the Executive. Additionally, the Company will pay directly to the service provider following presentment of invoice(s) reasonably acceptable to the Company up to $5,000.00 per year for reasonable financial counseling services for the Executive, and in no event shall amounts up to the $5,000.00 per year limitation that are not paid in one calendar year be able to be used in another calendar year or otherwise be made available to the Executive.

Any reimbursement for such travel shall require presentation of proper expense statements or vouchers or such other supporting information as 4
the Company may reasonably require of the Executive, and shall be payable within seventy-five (75) days after the end of the calendar year of presentment. The Executive acknowledges that participation in this program will result in the receipt by him of additional taxable income. (f) Executive Term Life Insurance. During the Term of Employment, the Company shall continue to pay premiums on the existing term life insurance policy with a face amount of $5,000,000.00. Such obligation to pay premiums is subject to standard underwriting conditions. The Executive acknowledges that this coverage will result in the receipt by him of additional taxable income.

In the event of the "permanent disability" (as hereinafter defined) of the Executive during the Term of Employment, the Company shall have the right, upon written notice to the Executive, to terminate the Executive's employment hereunder, effective upon the giving of such notice (or such later date as shall be specified in such notice). In the event of such termination, the Company shall have no further obligations hereunder, except that the Executive shall be entitled to receive (i) any accrued but unpaid salary and other amounts to which the Executive otherwise is entitled hereunder prior to the date of his termination of employment, in accordance with Section 3(a) and other applicable payment provisions herein; (ii) bonus compensation earned but not paid under Section 3(b) hereof that relates to any fiscal year ended prior to the date of his termination of employment, in accordance with Section 3(b) hereof; (iii) a pro-rata portion of the annual bonus payout that the Executive would have been entitled to receive had he remained in employment through the end of the fiscal year during which termination due to permanent disability occurred, based on the portion of the fiscal year that has elapsed prior to such termination, and paid in accordance with Section 3(b) hereof; (iv) reimbursement for financial counseling services under Section 5(b) hereof for a period of one (1) year from the date of termination, in accordance with Section 5(b) hereof; and (v) his Base Salary at a rate equal to the highest rate during the past twelve (12) months for a period of one (1) year from the date of termination as a result of permanent disability, in accordance with Section 3(a) hereof (the "Disability Continuation Period"), paid in accordance with Section 6(j)(i) hereof; provided, however, that the Company shall only be required to pay that amount of the Executive's Base Salary which shall not be covered by short-term disability payments or benefits or long-term disability payments or benefits, if any, to the Executive under any Company plan or arrangement. In addition, upon termination for permanent disability, the Executive shall continue to participate, to the extent permitted by applicable law and regulations and the applicable benefit plan, program or arrangement, in any and all healthcare, life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment insurance benefit plans, programs or arrangements of the Company during the Disability Continuation Period (disregarding any required delay in payments under Section 6(j)). Thereafter, the Executive's rights to participate in such programs and plans, or to receive similar coverage, if any, shall be as determined under such programs. Because continued participation in any qualified pension and qualified retirement savings plans of the Company is not permitted during the Disability Continuation Period, the Company shall provide to the Executive, subject to Section 6(j), cash payments, to be paid in 5
accordance with Section 6(j)(i), equal to the sum of (x) the maximum qualified defined contribution retirement savings plan match for pre-tax and after-tax contributions allowable by the plan and by applicable laws and regulations for each year during the Disability Continuation Period (or other period as expressly provided herein), and (v) the excess of the benefit that would have been received by the Executive had he been credited with additional years of age and service equal to the Disability Continuation Period (or other period as expressly provided herein) over the actual benefit to which the Executive is entitled, in each case, under any and all qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans and qualified defined contribution retirement savings plans in which the Executive participates as of the date of termination of employment, calculated as of and based upon the Executive's date of termination (such sum the "Pension Replacement Payment"). Notwithstanding the above, any amounts payable under this Section 6(a) that are separation pay as described under Treas. Reg. ss.1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii)(A) shall be paid no later than December 31 of the second calendar year following the year in which the Executive's termination for permanent disability occurs; any amounts payable under this Section 6(a) that are not otherwise exempt from Code section 409A are subject to, and payable in accordance with, Section 6(l) of this Agreement. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6(a), the Company will have no further obligations under Sections 3, 4 and 5 hereof or otherwise. For purposes of this Section 6(a), "permanent disability" means any disability as defined under the Company's applicable disability insurance policy or, if no such policy is available, any physical or mental disability or incapacity that renders the Executive incapable of performing the services required of him in accordance with his obligations under Section 2 hereof for a period of six (6) consecutive months or for shorter periods aggregating six (6) months during any twelve-month period. (b) Death. In the event of the death of the Executive during the Term of Employment, Executive's employment and this Agreement shall automatically terminate. In the event of such termination the Company shall have no further obligations hereunder, except to pay the Executive's beneficiary or legal representative (i) any accrued but unpaid salary and other amounts to which the Executive otherwise is entitled hereunder prior to the date of his death, in accordance with Section 3(a) and other applicable payment provisions herein; (ii) bonus compensation earned but not paid under Section 3(b) hereof that relates to any fiscal year ended prior to the date of his death, in accordance with Section 3(b) hereof; (iii) a pro-rata portion of the annual bonus payout the Executive would have been entitled to receive had he remained in the employ of the Company through the end of the fiscal year during which termination due to his death occurred, based on the portion of the fiscal year that has elapsed prior to such termination, and paid in accordance with Section 3(b) hereof; (iv) reimbursement for financial counseling services under Section 5(b) hereof for a period of one (1) year from the date of termination, in accordance with Section 5(b) hereof; and (v) for a period of one (1) year from the date of his death, the Executive's Base Salary as established under Section 3(a) hereof as of the date of his death, in accordance with Section 3(a) hereof; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in this Section 6(b), the Company will have no further obligations under Sections 3, 4 and 5 hereof or otherwise. (c) Termination Without Cause. The Company shall have the right, upon ninety (90) days' prior written notice given to the Executive, to terminate the Executive's employment for any reason whatsoever (except for Cause (as defined below) which is covered by Section 3(d)). In the event of such termination, the Company shall have no further obligations hereunder, except that the Executive shall be entitled to (i) receive any accrued but unpaid salary and other amounts to which the Executive otherwise is entitled hereunder prior to the date of his termination without Cause, in accordance with Section 3(a) and other applicable payment provisions herein; (ii) receive bonus compensation earned but not paid under Section 3(b) hereof that relates to any 6
fiscal year ended prior to the date of his termination without Cause, in accordance with Section 3(b) hereof; (iii) receive a pro-rata portion of the annual bonus payout that the Executive would have been entitled to receive had he remained in employment through the end of the fiscal year during which the termination without Cause occurred, based on the portion of the fiscal year that has elapsed prior to such termination, and paid in accordance with Section 3(b) hereof; (iv) receive as damages (A) for a period ending on a date two (2) years from the date of termination without Cause, in accordance with the regular payroll policies of the Company in effect from time to time, his Base Salary as established under and in accordance with Section 3(a) hereof and (B) bonus compensation equal to fifty percent (50%) of the average of the actual annual bonuses paid or payable to the Executive under the Bonus Plan during the past two (2) completed fiscal years; (v) receive reimbursement for financial counseling services under Section 5(b) hereof for a period of two (2) years from the date of termination, in accordance with Section 5(b) hereof; and (vi) participate for a period ending on a date two (2) years from the date of termination without Cause (the "Without Cause Continuation Period"), to the extent permitted by applicable law and regulations and the applicable benefit plan, program or arrangement, in any and all qualified and non-qualified pension and qualified retirement savings, healthcare, life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment insurance benefit plans, programs or arrangements, on terms identical to those applicable to full-term senior officers of the Company. Because continued participation in any qualified pension and qualified retirement savings plans of the Company is not permitted during the Without Cause Continuation Period, the Company shall provide to the Executive, subject to Section 6(j), cash payments, to be paid in accordance with Section 6(j)(i), equal to the Pension Replacement Payment (as defined in Section 6(a)) with respect to the Without Cause Continuation Period. Notwithstanding the above, any amounts payable under this Section 6(c) that are separation pay as described under Treas. Reg. ss.1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii)(A) shall be paid no later than December 31 of the second calendar year following the year in which the Executive's termination pursuant to this section 6(c) occurs; any amounts payable under this Section 6(c) that are not otherwise exempt from Code section 409A are subject to, and payable in accordance with, Section 6(j) of this Agreement.

For purposes of this Agreement, "Cause" means: (i) a material breach of, or the willful failure or refusal by the Executive to perform and discharge duties or obligations he has agreed to perform or assume under this Agreement (other than by reason of disability or death) that, if capable of correction, is not corrected within ten (10) business days following notice thereof to the Executive by the Company, such notice to state with specificity the nature of the breach, failure or refusal; 7
(ii) willful misconduct by the Executive, unrelated to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, that could reasonably be anticipated to have a material adverse effect on the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates (the determination of Cause to be made by the Chief Executive Officer or Executive Chairman in his or her reasonable judgment or the Company's Board of Directors in its reasonable judgment); (iii) the Executive's gross negligence, whether related or unrelated to the business of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates which could reasonably be anticipated to have a material adverse effect on the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates that, if capable of correction, is not corrected within ten (10) business days following notice thereof to the Executive by the Company, such notice to state with specificity the nature of the conduct complained of (the determination of Cause to be made by the Chief Executive Officer or Executive Chairman in his or her reasonable judgment or the Company's Board of Directors in its reasonable judgment); (iv) the Executive's failure to follow a lawful directive of the Chief Executive Officer, Executive Chairman or the Board of Directors of the Company that is within the scope of the Executive's duties for a period of ten (10) business days after notice from the Chief Executive Officer, Executive Chairman or the Board of Directors of the Company specifying the performance required; (v) any violation by the Executive of a policy contained in the Code of Conduct of the Company (the determination of Cause to be made by the Chief Executive Officer or Executive Chairman in his or her reasonable judgment or the Company's Board of Directors in its reasonable judgment); (vi) drug or alcohol abuse by the Executive that materially affects the Executive's performance of his duties under this Agreement; or (vii) conviction of, or the entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere by the Executive for, any felony.

Upon such termination, the Company shall have no further obligations hereunder other than to (i) pay the Executive his accrued but unpaid salary, in accordance with Section 3(a) hereof; (ii) provide bonus compensation, if any, earned but not paid under Section 3(b) hereof that relates to any fiscal year ended prior to the date of such a termination by the Executive, in accordance with Section 3(b) hereof; and (iii) provide the Executive with any benefit under the employee benefit programs and plans of the Company as determined under such programs and plans upon and as of such a termination by the Executive. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6(e), the Company will have no further obligations under Sections 3, 4 and 5 hereof or otherwise. (f) Termination by Executive for Material Breach.

Such termination shall be deemed to be a termination without Cause and shall be controlled by the provisions of Section 6(c) hereof.

(1) (a) the assignment to the Executive of any duties inconsistent in any material adverse respect with the Executive's position, authority or responsibilities as contemplated by Section 2 hereof, or (b) any other material adverse change in such position, including title, authority or responsibilities; (2) any failure by the Company to comply with any provisions of Sections 3, 4 or 5 hereof or a material reduction of the overall amounts set by the Compensation Committee or the Stock Plan Subcommittee and in effect within twelve (12) months prior to the Change in Control, other than an insubstantial or inadvertent failure remedied by the Company promptly after receipt of notice thereof given by the Executive; (3) the Company's requiring the Executive to be based at any office or location more than fifty (50) miles from that location at which he performed his services specified under the provisions of Section 2 immediately prior to the Change in Control, except for travel reasonably required in the performance of the Executive's responsibilities; or (4) any failure by the Company to obtain the assumption and agreement to perform this Agreement by a successor as contemplated by Section 14, unless such assumption occurs by operation of law. (ii) Termination for Good Reason. Within two (2) years after the occurrence of a Change of Control, the Executive may terminate his employment for Good Reason. Such termination shall be deemed to be a termination without Cause and shall be controlled by the provisions of Section 6(c) hereof. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6(g)(ii), the Company will have no further obligations under Sections 3, 4 and 5 hereof or otherwise. (h) Certain Limitations. (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event that any amount or benefit paid or distributed to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement, taken together with any amounts or benefits otherwise paid or distributed to the Executive by the Company or any affiliated company (collectively, the "Covered Payments"), are or become subject to the tax (the "Excise Tax") imposed under Section 4999 of the Code, or any similar tax that may hereafter be imposed, the Covered Payments shall be reduced (but not below zero) until no portion of such payments would be subject to Excise Tax. (ii) For purposes of determining whether any of the Covered Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax and the amount of such Excise Tax, (A) such Covered Payments will be treated as "parachute payments" to the extent they exceed the "2.99 base amount threshold" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, and all "parachute payments" in excess of the "base amount" (as defined under Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax, unless, and except to the extent that, in the good faith judgment of the Company's independent certified public accountants appointed prior to the date of the change in ownership or control or tax counsel selected by such accountants (the "Accountants"), the Company has a reasonable basis to conclude that such Covered Payments (in whole or in part) either do not constitute "parachute payments" or are otherwise not subject to such Excise Tax, and 10
(B) the value of any non-cash benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be determined by the Accountants in accordance with the principles of Section 280G of the Code. (i) Effect of Termination. Upon the termination of the Executive's employment hereunder for any reason, the Company shall have no further obligations hereunder, except as otherwise provided herein. The Executive, however, shall continue to have the obligations provided for in Sections 7 and 8 hereof. Furthermore, upon any such termination, the Executive shall be deemed to have resigned immediately from all offices and directorships held by him in the Company or any of its subsidiaries. (j) Section 409A of the Code. It is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that no payment or entitlement pursuant to this Agreement will give rise to any adverse tax consequences to the Executive under Section 409A of the Code and Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder, including that issued after the date hereof (collectively, "Section 409A"). The Agreement shall be interpreted to that end and, consistent with that objective and notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the Company may unilaterally take any action it deems necessary or desirable to amend any provision herein to avoid the application of or excise tax under Section 409A. Further, no effect shall be given to any provision herein in a manner that reasonably could be expected to give rise to adverse tax consequences under that provision. The Company shall from time to time compile a list of "specified employees" as defined in, and pursuant to, Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-1(i). Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if the Executive is a specified employee on the date of termination, no payment of compensation under this Agreement shall be made to the Executive during the period lasting six (6) months from the date of termination unless the Company determines that there is no reasonable basis for believing that making such payment would cause the Executive to suffer any adverse tax consequences pursuant to Section 409A of the Code. If any payment to the Executive is delayed pursuant to the foregoing sentence, such payment instead shall be made on the first business day following the expiration of the six-month period referred to in the prior sentence, unless specified otherwise in Section 6(j)(i) hereof. Although the Company shall consult with Executive in good faith regarding implementation of this Section 6(j), neither the Company nor its employees or representatives shall have liability to the Executive with respect to any additional taxes that the Executive may be subject to in the event that any amounts under this Agreement are determined to violate Code section 409A. (i) Notwithstanding the above, amounts described as being subject to payment in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6(l)(i) shall be subject to a delay in payment for a six-month period following the date of termination and shall be paid as follows: For any Base Salary under Section 6(a)(v) or Section 6(c)(iv)(A) to be continued beyond the date of termination and for any Pension Replacement Payment, all payments that would have been made during the six-month period immediately following the date of termination shall be made in a single cash payment on the first business day following the expiration of such six-month period, and as of the first business day following the expiration of such six-month period all such payments shall resume in accordance with the regular payroll practices of the Company until the end of the specified period; any bonus payments under Section 6(c)(iv)(B) shall be paid in a single lump sum payment on the first business day following the expiration of such six-month period. 11
(k) Release of Claims. As a condition precedent to the receipt of payments and benefits pursuant to this Section, the Executive, or, in the case of his death or Disability that prevents the Executive from performing his obligation under this Section 6(k), his personal representative, and his beneficiary, if applicable, will execute an effective general release of claims against the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, attorneys and agents; provided, however, that such effective release will not affect any right that the Executive, or in the event of his death, his personal representative or beneficiary, otherwise has to any payment or benefit provided for in this Agreement or to any vested benefits the Executive may have in any employee benefit plan of Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, or any right the Executive has under any other agreement between the Executive and the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates that expressly states that the right survives the termination of the Executive's employment. Such release shall be substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A or such form that is used from time to time by the Company for other senior employees based in the United States. (l) Modification of Severance Payments and Benefits. Nothwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein except as provided in this Section 6(l), the Company rerseves the right with repsect to any severance payments or benefits set forth in this Section 6 to modify such payments or benefits or not to provide such payments or benefits. Changes in any severance payment or benefit provided to the Executive may only be made by the Compensation Committee (or the Stock Plan Subcommittee, if there is one, and the change relates to matters subject to the authority of such Subcommittee). Unless agreed to by the Executive, no change to any severance payments or benefits set forth in this Section 6 will be effective until two years after such change is approved by the Compensation Committee (or Stock Plan Subcommittee). No changes may be made in severance payments or benefits set forth in this Section 6 either (i) at such time the Company is contemplating one or more transactions that will result in a Change of Control or (ii) after a Change of Control. 7. Confidentiality; Ownership. (a) The Executive agrees that he shall forever keep secret and retain in strictest confidence and not divulge, disclose, discuss, copy or otherwise use or suffer to be used in any manner, except in connection with the Business of the Company, its subsidiaries or affiliates and any other business or proposed business of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, any "Protected Information" in any "Unauthorized" manner or for any "Unauthorized" purpose (as such terms are hereinafter defined). (i) "Protected Information" means trade secrets, confidential or proprietary information and all other knowledge, know-how, information, documents or materials owned, developed or possessed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, whether in tangible or intangible form, pertaining to the Business or any other business or proposed business of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, including, but not limited to, research and development, operations, systems, data bases, computer programs and software, designs, models, operating procedures, knowledge of the organization, products (including prices, costs, sales or content), processes, formulas, techniques, machinery, contracts, financial information or measures, business methods, business plans, details of consultant contracts, new personnel hiring plans, business acquisition plans, customer lists, business relationships and other information owned, developed or possessed by the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates; provided that Protected Information shall not include information that becomes generally known to the public or the trade without violation of this Section 7. 12
(ii) "Unauthorized" means: (A) in contravention of the policies or procedures of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates; (B) otherwise inconsistent with the measures taken by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates to protect their interests in any Protected Information; (C) in contravention of any lawful instruction or directive, either written or oral, of an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates empowered to issue such instruction or directive; or (D) in contravention of any duty existing under law or contract. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 7, the Executive may disclose any Protected Information to the extent required by court order or decree or by the rules and regulations of a governmental agency or as otherwise required by law or to his legal counsel and, in connection with a determination under Section 6(h), to accounting experts; provided that the Executive shall provide the Company with prompt notice of such required disclosure in advance thereof so that the Company may seek an appropriate protective order in respect of such required disclosure. (b) The Executive acknowledges that all developments, including, without limitation, inventions (patentable or otherwise), discoveries, formulas, improvements, patents, trade secrets, designs, reports, computer software, flow charts and diagrams, procedures, data, documentation, ideas and writings and applications thereof relating to the Business or any business or planned business of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates that, alone or jointly with others, the Executive may conceive, create, make, develop, reduce to practice or acquire during the Executive's employment with the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates (collectively, the "Developments") are works made for hire and shall remain the sole and exclusive property of the Company. The Executive hereby assigns to the Company, in consideration of the payments set forth in Section 3(a) hereof, all of his right, title and interest in and to all such Developments. The Executive shall promptly and fully disclose all future material Developments to the Board of Directors of the Company and, at any time upon request and at the expense of the Company, shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company all instruments that the Company shall prepare, give evidence and take all other actions that are necessary or desirable in the reasonable opinion of the Company to enable the Company to file and prosecute applications for and to acquire, maintain and enforce all letters patent and trademark registrations or copyrights covering the Developments in all countries in which the same are deemed necessary by the Company. All memoranda, notes, lists, drawings, records, files, computer tapes, programs, software, source and programming narratives and other documentation (and all copies thereof) made or compiled by the Executive or made available to the Executive concerning the Developments or otherwise concerning the Business or planned business of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates shall be the property of the Company or such subsidiaries or affiliates and shall be delivered to the Company or such subsidiaries or affiliates promptly upon the expiration or termination of the Term of Employment. (c) During the Term of Employment, the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates shall have the exclusive right to use the Executive's name and image throughout the world in its advertising and promotional materials in connection with the advertising and promotion of the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates, and their products. After the expiration of the Term of Employment, the Company, it subsidiaries and affiliates shall have the non-exclusive right in perpetuity to use the Executive's name and image throughout the world solely in connection with promotional materials related to the history of the Company, it subsidiaries and affiliates, and their products. The consideration for such rights is the payments set forth in Section 3(a) hereof. The rights conveyed hereby may be assigned by the Company, its subsidiaries or affiliates to a successor in the interest of the Company or the relevant subsidiary or affiliate or their businesses or product lines. 13
(d) The provisions of this Section 7 shall, without any limitation as to time, survive the expiration or termination of the Executive's employment hereunder, irrespective of the reason for any termination. 8. Covenant Not to Compete. The Executive agrees that during the Executive's employment with the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates and for a period of two (2) years commencing upon the expiration or termination of the Executive's employment for any reason whatsoever (the "Non-Compete Period"), the Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of the Company: (a) solicit, entice, persuade or induce any employee, consultant, agent or independent contractor of the Company or of any of its subsidiaries or affiliates to terminate his, her or its employment with the Company or such subsidiary or affiliate, to become employed by any person, firm or corporation other than the Company or such subsidiary or affiliate or approach any such employee, consultant, agent or independent contractor for any of the foregoing purposes, or authorize or assist in the taking of any such actions by any third party (for purposes of this Section 8 (a), the terms "employee," "consultant," "agent" and "independent contractor" shall include any persons with such status at any time during the six (6) months preceding any solicitation in question); or (b) directly or indirectly engage, participate, or make any financial investment in, or become employed by or render consulting, advisory or other services to or for any person, firm, corporation or other business enterprise, wherever located, which is engaged, directly or indirectly, in competition with the Business or any business of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates as conducted or any business proposed to be conducted at the time of the expiration or termination of the Executive's employment with the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 8(b) shall be construed to preclude the Executive from making any investments in the securities of any business enterprise whether or not engaged in competition with the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, to the extent that such securities are actively traded on a national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter market in the United States or on any foreign securities exchange and represent, at the time of acquisition, not more than 3% of the aggregate voting power of such business enterprise. To ensure that the Company is able to enforce these provisions in Sections 8(a) and (b) above, the Executive and the Company further agree that if such noncompetition and nonsolicitation requirements should be violated during this additional two-year period after the Executive's termination of employment, the remedy (determined at the Company's option) shall be either equitable relief (in the form of an injunction to stop the violation), or liquidated damages payable by the Executive to the Company in an amount equal to (a) (i) (A) twenty-four (24) minus (B) the number of full months between the date of Executive's termination and the date of breach ("Months Complied") divided by (ii) 12, times (b) one year's Base Salary in effect at the time of termination. In other words: Twenty-four (24) - Months Complied ---------------------------------- x One Year's Base Salary 12 If equitable relief is elected by the Company as an alternative to liquidated damages, any equitable relief shall not include any forfeiture or cash refund of monies or benefits. If liquidated damages is elected by the Company, the Company 14
may elect not to pay amounts that would otherwise be payable but for the breach; provided that, the Executive would remain liable to the Company to the extent that the liquidated damages exceeded the amounts not paid by the Company. The foregoing shall have no impact on the operation of the provisions of any other compensation program of the Company or its subsidiaries, including without limitation the Amended and Restated Fiscal 2002 Share Incentive Plan. 9. Specific Performance. The Executive acknowledges that the services to be rendered by the Executive are of a special, unique and extraordinary character and, in connection with such services, the Executive will have access to confidential information vital to the Company's Business and the other current or planned businesses of it and its subsidiaries and affiliates. By reason of this, the Executive consents and agrees that if the Executive violates any of the provisions of Sections 7 or 8 hereof, the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates would sustain irreparable injury and that monetary damages would not provide adequate remedy to the Company and that the Company shall be entitled to have Section 7 or 8 hereof specifically enforced by any court having equity jurisdiction. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as prohibiting the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates from pursuing any other remedies available to it or them for such breach or threatened breach, including the recovery of damages from the Executive. This provision shall, without any limitation as to time, survive the expiration or termination of the Executive's employment hereunder, irrespective of the reason for any termination. 10. Deductions and Withholding. The Executive agrees that the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates, as applicable, shall withhold from any and all compensation paid to and required to be paid to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement, all Federal, state, local and/or other taxes which the Company determines are required to be withheld in accordance with applicable statutes or regulations from time to time in effect and all amounts required to be deducted in respect of the Executive's coverage under applicable employee benefit plans. For purposes of this Agreement and calculations hereunder, all such deductions and withholdings shall be deemed to have been paid to and received by the Executive. 11. Entire Agreement. Except for the Amended and Restated Fiscal 2002 Share Incentive Plan, the Executive's outstanding stock option and other equity-compensation agreements, the Executive Annual Incentive Plan, the Executive Perquisites Program, the Executive Automobile Program, the term life insurance arrangement between the Company and the Executive, the Company's qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans, the Company's qualified defined contribution retirement savings plan and applicable successor plans or agreements, this Agreement embodies the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the Executive's employment, compensation, perquisites and related items and supersedes any other prior oral or written agreements, arrangements or understandings between the Executive and the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, and any such prior agreements, arrangements or understandings are hereby terminated and of no further effect. This Agreement may not be changed or terminated orally but only by an agreement in writing signed by the parties hereto. 12. Waiver. The waiver by the Company of a breach of any provision of this Agreement by the Executive shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach by him. The waiver by the Executive of a breach of any provision of this Agreement by the Company shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach by the Company. 15
13. Governing Law; Jurisdiction. (a) This Agreement shall be subject to, and governed by, the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts made and to be performed therein, without regard to conflict of laws principles. (b) Any action to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be brought in a court of the State of New York located in the Borough of Manhattan of the City of New York or in a Federal court located within the Southern District of New York. The parties consent to the jurisdiction of such courts and to the service of process in any manner provided by New York law. Each party irrevocably waives any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such court and any claim that such suit, action or proceeding brought in such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum and agrees that service of process in accordance with the foregoing sentences shall be deemed in every respect effective and valid personal service of process upon such party. 14. Assignability. The obligations of the Executive may not be delegated and, except with respect to the designation of beneficiaries in connection with any of the benefits payable to the Executive hereunder, the Executive may not, without the Company's written consent thereto, assign, transfer, convey, pledge, encumber, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of this Agreement or any interest herein. Any such attempted delegation or disposition shall be null and void and without effect. The Company and the Executive agree that this Agreement and all of the Company's rights and obligations hereunder may be assigned or transferred by the Company to and shall be assumed by and be binding upon any successor to the Company. Unless assumption occurs by operation of law, the Company shall require any successor by an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Executive, expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent as the Company would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place. The term "successor" means, with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, any corporation or other business entity which, by merger, consolidation, purchase of the assets or otherwise acquires all or a majority of the operating assets or business of the Company. 15. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or any part thereof, including, without limitation, Sections 7 and 8 hereof, as applied to either party or to any circumstances shall be adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction to be void or unenforceable, the same shall in no way affect any other provision of this Agreement or remaining part thereof, or the validity or enforceability of this Agreement, which shall be given full effect without regard to the invalid or unenforceable part thereof. If any court construes any of the provisions of Section 7 or 8 hereof, or any part thereof, to be unreasonable because of the duration of such provision or the geographic scope thereof, such court may reduce the duration or restrict or redefine the geographic scope of such provision and enforce such provision as so reduced, restricted or redefined. 16. Notices. All notices to the Company or the Executive permitted or required hereunder shall be in writing and shall be delivered personally, by telecopier or by courier service providing for next-day or two-day delivery or sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the following addresses: 16
