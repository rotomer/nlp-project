The terms and conditions of the tender offer are set forth in the Companys Offer to Purchase dated April 27, 2010 (the Offer to Purchase), as amended, and the related Letter of Transmittal.
 
According to information provided by Global Bondholder Services Corporation, the depositary and information agent for the tender offer, $140,232,000 aggregate principal amount of 2012 Notes and $69,854,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2013 Notes were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn on or before the Expiration Date.

The amount of each series of the Notes purchased in the tender offer will be determined in accordance with the priorities and maximum tender amounts identified in the columns Acceptance Priority Level and Maximum Tender Amount, subject to the Tender Cap.

Notes that have been tendered but not accepted will be promptly returned to the tendering parties.
