(f)             The Executive shall have the right, exercisable by notice to the Company, to terminate her employment effective ninety (90) days after the giving of such notice, if, at any time during the Term of Employment, the Company shall be in material breach of its obligations hereunder; , that such notice must be provided to the Company within thirty (30) days of the date on which the Executive obtains knowledge or reasonably should obtain knowledge of such material breach; and , that such termination will not become effective if within thirty (30) days after receiving the notice the Company shall have cured all such material breaches of its obligations hereunder.

Certain Limitations
(i)          For purposes of this Section 6(h), (A) a Payment means any payment or distribution in the nature of compensation to or for the benefit of the Executive, whether paid or payable pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise; (B) Net After-Tax Receipt shall mean the Present Value of a Payment net of all taxes imposed on the Executive with respect thereto under Sections 1 and 4999 of the Code and under applicable state and local laws, determined by applying the highest marginal rate under Section 1 of the Code and under state and local laws which applied to the Executives taxable income for the immediately preceding taxable year, or such other rate(s) as the Executive shall certify, in the Executives sole discretion, as likely to apply to the Executive in the relevant tax year(s); (C) Present Value shall mean such value determined in accordance with Sections 280G(b)(2)(A)(ii) and 280G(d)(4) of Code; (D) Reduced Amount shall mean the amount that (1) has a Present Value that is less than the Present Value of all Payments (without application of this Section 6(h)) and (2) results in aggregate Net After-Tax Receipts for all such Payments (after application of this Section 6(h)) that are greater than the Net After-Tax Receipts for all such Payments would have been made if this Section 6(h) were not applied; and (E) Code shall mean the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
(ii)          Anything in the Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that a nationally recognized certified public accounting firm (other than the firm serving as the Companys independent auditor) as may be designated by the Executive (the Accountants) determine that receipt of all Payments would subject the Executive to tax under Section 4999 of the Code, the Accountants shall determine whether some amount of Payments meets the definition of Reduced Amount.  If the Accountants determine that there is a Reduced Amount, then the aggregate Payments shall be reduced to such Reduced Amount.
(iiii)          If the Accountants determine that aggregate Payments should be reduced to the Reduced Amount, the Company shall promptly give the Executive notice to that effect and a copy of the detailed calculation thereof, and the Executive may then elect, in his sole discretion, which and how much of the Payments shall be eliminated or reduced (as long as after such election the Present Value of the aggregate Payments equals the Reduced Amount), and shall advise the Company in writing of his election within ten (10) days of his receipt of notice; provided, that the Executive shall not be permitted to elect to reduce any Payment that constitutes nonqualified deferred
 
 
 
 
12
 
 
 
 
compensation for purposes of Section 409A of the Code.  If no such election is made by the Executive within such ten-day period, the Company shall reduce the Payments in the following order: (1) by reducing amounts payable pursuant to Section 6(c)(iv) of the Agreement, then (2) by reducing amounts payable pursuant to Section 6(c)(vi) of the Agreement, then (3) by reducing amounts payable pursuant to Section 6(c)(v) of the Agreement, then (4) by reducing the amount payable pursuant to Section 6(c)(iii) of the Agreement, and then (5) by reducing amounts payable to the Executive pursuant to the Companys Amended and Restated Fiscal 2002 Share Incentive Plan, and any award agreement thereunder by and between the Executive and the Company. All determinations made by the Accountants under this Section shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive and shall be made within sixty (60) days of a termination of employment of the Executive.  As promptly as practicable following such determination, the Company shall pay to or distribute for the benefit of the Executive such Payments as are then due to the Executive and shall promptly pay to or distribute for the benefit of the Executive in the future such Payments as become due to the Executive.
(iv)          As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accountants hereunder, it is possible that amounts will have been paid or distributed by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive pursuant to this Agreement which should not have been so paid or distributed (Overpayment) or that additional amounts which will have not been paid or distributed by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive pursuant to this Agreement could have been so paid or distributed (Underpayment), in each case, consistent with the calculation of the Reduced Amount hereunder.  In the event that the Accountants, based upon the assertion of a deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service against either the Company or the Executive which the Accountants believe has a high probability of success determine that an Overpayment has been made, any such Overpayment paid or distributed by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive shall be treated for all purposes as a loan to the Executive which the Executive shall repay to the Company together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code; provided, however, that no such loan shall be deemed to have been made and no amount shall be payable by the Executive to the Company if and to the extent such deemed loan and payment would (A) violate Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or (B) not either reduce the amount on which the Executive is subject to tax under Section 1 and Section 4999 of the Code or generate a refund of such taxes.  In the event that the Accountants, based upon controlling precedent or substantial authority, determine that an Underpayment has occurred, any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code.
(v)          All fees and expenses of the Accountants in implementing the provisions of this Section 6(h) shall be borne by the Company.
(vi)      Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Subsection 6(h), in the event that any Payments are to be reduced pursuant to this Section 6(h), such Payments shall be reduced such that the reduction of compensation to be provided to the Executive as a result of this Section 6(h) is minimized.  In applying this principle, the reduction shall be made in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.

(i)             In addition to the foregoing, in the event that this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to the provisions of subparagraphs 6(a), 6(b) and 6(c) above, and the Executive is not considered to be retirement eligible under the terms and conditions of the Companys qualified defined benefit pension plan, if any, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Companys Share Incentive Plan or other similar equity plan, (i) all stock options granted to the Executive during the Term of Employment shall become immediately exercisable and shall be exercisable until the earlier to occur of (A) the end of the stock option term as set forth in the applicable option agreement(s); or (B) the first anniversary of the date that Base Salary continuation payments end, after which all such option awards shall expire and be of no further force or effect and (ii) all restricted stock units and performance share units granted to the Executive shall continue to vest through the last date that Base Salary continuation payments, if any, are made hereunder.  The vesting and exercisability provided for in the previous sentence shall be subject to all provisions relating to post-employment exercises set forth in the applicable Share Incentive Plan and option agreement(s).  Subject to the preceding sentences, upon the termination of the Executives employment hereunder for any reason, the Company shall have no further obligations hereunder, except as otherwise provided herein.  The Executive, however, shall continue to have the obligations provided for in Sections 7 and 8 hereof. Furthermore, upon any such termination, the Executive shall be deemed to have resigned immediately from all offices and directorships held by her in the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
Effect of Termination.
(j)           .  It is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that no payment or entitlement pursuant to this Agreement will give rise to any adverse tax consequences to the Executive under Section 409A of the Code and Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder, including that issued after the date hereof (collectively, Section 409A).  The Agreement shall be interpreted to that end and, consistent with that objective and notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the Company may unilaterally take any action it deems necessary or desirable to amend any provision herein to avoid the application of an excise tax under Section 409A.  Further, no effect shall be given to any provision herein in a manner that reasonably could be expected to give rise to adverse tax consequences under that provision.  The Company shall from time to time compile a list of "specified employees" as defined in, and pursuant to, Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-1(i).  Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if the Executive is a specified employee on the date of termination, no payment of compensation under this Agreement shall be made to the Executive during the period lasting six (6) months from the date of termination unless the Company determines that there is no reasonable basis for believing that making such payment would cause the Executive to suffer any adverse tax consequences pursuant to Section 409A of the Code.  If any payment to the Executive is delayed pursuant to the foregoing sentence, such payment instead shall be made on the first business day following the expiration of the six-month period referred to in the prior sentence, unless specified otherwise in Section 6(j)(i) hereof. Although the Company shall consult with Executive in good faith regarding implementation of this Section 6(j), neither the Company nor its employees or representatives shall have liability to the Executive with respect to any additional taxes that the Executive may be subject to in the event that any amounts under this Agreement are determined to violate Code section 409A.

Nothwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein except as provided in Section 6(h) and this Section 6(m), the Company reserves the right with respect to any severance payments or benefits set forth in this Section 6 to modify such payments or benefits or not to provide such payments or benefits.  Changes in any severance payment or benefit provided to the Executive may only be made by the Compensation Committee (or the Stock Plan Subcommittee, if there is one, and the change relates to matters subject to the authority of such Subcommittee).   Unless agreed to by the Executive or as provided in Section 6(h) herein, no change to any severance payments or benefits set forth in this Section 6 will be effective until two years after such change is approved by the Compensation Committee (or Stock Plan Subcommittee).    No changes may be made in severance payments or benefits set forth in this Section 6 either (i) at such time the Company is contemplating one or more transactions that will result in a Change of Control or (ii) after a Change of Control.

The Executive hereby assigns to the Company, in consideration of the payments set forth in Section 3(a) hereof, all of her right, title and interest in and to all such Developments. The Executive shall promptly and fully disclose all future material Developments to the Board of Directors of the Company and, at any time upon request and at

the expense of the Company, shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company all instruments that the Company shall prepare, give evidence and take all other actions that are necessary or desirable in the reasonable opinion of the Company to enable the Company to file and prosecute applications for and to acquire, maintain and enforce all letters patent and trademark registrations or copyrights covering the Developments in all countries in which the same are deemed necessary by the Company.  All memoranda, notes, lists, drawings, records, files, computer tapes, programs, software, source and programming narratives and other documentation (and all copies thereof) made or compiled by the Executive or made available to the Executive concerning the Developments or otherwise concerning the Business or planned business of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates shall be the property of the Company or such subsidiaries or affiliates and shall be delivered to the Company or such subsidiaries or affiliates promptly upon the expiration or termination of the Term of Employment.
(c)           During the Term of Employment, the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates shall have the exclusive right to use the Executives name and image throughout the world in its advertising and promotional materials in connection with the advertising and promotion of the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates, and their products.  After the expiration of the Term of Employment, the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates shall have the non-exclusive right in perpetuity to use the Executives name and image throughout the world solely in connection with promotional materials related to the history of the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates, and their products.  The consideration for such rights is the payments set forth in Section 3(a) hereof.  The rights conveyed hereby may be assigned by the Company, its subsidiaries or affiliates to a successor in the interest of the Company or the relevant subsidiary or affiliate or their businesses or product lines.
(d)           The provisions of this Section 7 shall, without any limitation as to time, survive the expiration or termination of the Executives employment hereunder, irrespective of the reason for any termination.
8.           
Covenant Not to Compete.
The Executive agrees that during the Executives employment with the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates and for a period of two (2) years commencing upon the expiration or termination of the Executives employment for any reason whatsoever (the Non-Compete Period), the Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of the Company:
(a)           solicit, entice, persuade or induce any employee, consultant, agent or independent contractor of the Company or of any of its subsidiaries or affiliates to terminate his, her or its employment with the Company or such subsidiary or affiliate, to become employed by any person, firm or corporation other than the Company or such subsidiary or affiliate or approach any such employee, consultant, agent or independent contractor for any of the foregoing purposes, or authorize or assist in the taking of any such actions by any third party (for purposes of this Section 8 (a), the terms employee, consultant, agent and independent contractor shall include any persons with such status at any time during the six (6) months preceding any solicitation in question); or
(b)           directly or indirectly engage, participate, or make any financial investment in, or become employed by or render consulting, advisory or other services to or for any person, firm, corporation or other business enterprise, wherever located, which is engaged, directly or indirectly, in competition with the Business or any business of the Company or any of its
 
 
 
17
 
 
 
subsidiaries or affiliates as conducted or any business proposed to be conducted at the time of the expiration or termination of the Executives employment with the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates; , , that nothing in this Section 8(b) shall be construed to preclude the Executive from making any investments in the securities of any business enterprise whether or not engaged in competition with the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, to the extent that such securities are actively traded on a national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter market in the United States or on any foreign securities exchange and represent, at the time of acquisition, not more than 3% of the aggregate voting power of such business enterprise.
provided
however
To ensure that the Company is able to enforce these provisions in Sections 8(a) and (b) above, the Executive and the Company further agree that if such noncompetition and nonsolicitation requirements should be violated during this additional two-year period after the Executive's termination of employment, the remedy (determined at the Company's option) shall be either equitable relief (in the form of an injunction to stop the violation), or liquidated damages payable by the Executive to the Company in an amount equal to (a) (i) (A) twenty-four (24) minus (B) the number of full months between the date of Executives termination and the date of breach (Months Complied) divided by (ii) 12, times (b) oneyears Base Salary in effect at the time of termination.  In other words:
 
 
 
 
If equitable relief is elected by the Company as an alternative to liquidated damages, any equitable relief shall not include any forfeiture or cash refund of monies or benefits.  If liquidated damages is elected by the Company, the Company may elect not to pay amounts that would otherwise be payable but for the breach; provided that, the Executive would remain liable to the Company to the extent that the liquidated damages exceeded the amounts not paid by the Company. The foregoing shall have no impact on the operation of the provisions of any other compensation program of the Company or its subsidiaries, including without limitation the Amended and Restated Fiscal 2002 Share Incentive Plan.
9.           
Specific Performance.
The Executive acknowledges that the services to be rendered by the Executive are of a special, unique and extraordinary character and, in connection with such services, the Executive will have access to confidential information vital to the Companys Business and the other current or planned businesses of it and its subsidiaries and affiliates.  By reason of this, the Executive consents and agrees that if the Executive violates any of the provisions of Sections 7 or 8 hereof, the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates would sustain irreparable injury and that monetary damages would not provide adequate remedy to the Company and that the Company shall be entitled to have Section 7 or 8 hereof specifically enforced by any court having equity jurisdiction.  Nothing contained herein shall be construed as prohibiting the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates from pursuing any other remedies available to it or them for such breach or threatened breach, including the recovery of damages from the Executive.  This provision shall, without any limitation as to time, survive the expiration or termination of the Executives employment hereunder, irrespective of the reason for any termination.

10.           
Deductions and Withholding.
The Executive agrees that the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates, as applicable, shall withhold from any and all compensation paid to and required to be paid to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement, all Federal, state, local and/or other taxes which the Company determines are required to be withheld in accordance with applicable statutes or regulations from time to time in effect and all amounts required to be deducted in respect of the Executives coverage under applicable employee benefit plans.  For purposes of this Agreement and calculations hereunder, all such deductions and withholdings shall be deemed to have been paid to and received by the Executive.
11.

This Agreement may not be changed or terminated orally but only by an agreement in writing signed by the parties hereto.

Governing Law; Jurisdiction.

(b)           Any action to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be brought in a court of the State of New York located in the Borough of Manhattan of the City of New York or in a Federal court located within the Southern District of New York.  The parties consent to the jurisdiction of such courts and to the service of process in any manner provided by New York law.  Each party irrevocably waives any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such court and any claim that such suit, action or proceeding brought in such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum and agrees that service of process in accordance with the foregoing sentences shall be deemed in every respect effective and valid personal service of process upon such party.

Assignability.
The obligations of the Executive may not be delegated and, except with respect to the designation of beneficiaries in connection with any of the benefits payable to the Executive hereunder, the Executive may not, without the Companys written consent thereto, assign, transfer, convey, pledge, encumber, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of this Agreement or any interest herein.  Any such attempted delegation or disposition shall be null and void and without effect.  The Company and the Executive agree that this Agreement and all of the Companys rights and obligations hereunder may be assigned or transferred by the Company to and shall be assumed by and be binding upon any successor to the Company.  Unless assumption occurs by operation of law, the Company shall require any successor by an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Executive, expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent as the Company would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place.  The term successor means, with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, any corporation or other business entity which, by merger, consolidation, purchase of the assets or otherwise acquires all or a majority of the operating assets or business of the Company.
15.           
Severability.
If any provision of this Agreement or any part thereof, including, without limitation, Sections 7 and 8 hereof, as applied to either party or to any circumstances shall be adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction to be void or unenforceable, the same shall in no way affect any other provision of this Agreement or remaining part thereof, or the validity or enforceability of this Agreement, which shall be given full effect without regard to the invalid or unenforceable part thereof.
If any court construes any of the provisions of Section 7 or 8 hereof, or any part thereof, to be unreasonable because of the duration of such provision or the geographic scope thereof, such court may reduce the duration or restrict or redefine the geographic scope of such provision and enforce such provision as so reduced, restricted or redefined.
