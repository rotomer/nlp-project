This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
provided
however
 
(b)
                                
Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity.  This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have.
 
(c)
                                 
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above.  The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel
 
of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party.  Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party.  An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.

(d)
                                
In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending the same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder.  If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total
provided
however
 
underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus.  Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission.  The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).

Default by an Underwriter
.  If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company.  In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.

Morgan Securities LLC (or their respective affiliates which are Primary Treasury Dealers) and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer; and (B) any other Primary Treasury Dealer selected by the Company.

date of judgment; or liens incurred by the Company or any Consolidated Subsidiary for the purpose of obtaining a stay or discharge in the course of any litigation or other proceeding to which the Company or such Consolidated Subsidiary is a party; (k) liens for taxes or assessments or governmental charges or levies not yet due or delinquent, or which can thereafter be paid without penalty, or which are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings; landlord's liens on property held under lease; and any other liens or charges incidental to the conduct of the business of the Company or any Consolidated Subsidiary or the ownership of the assets of any of them which were not incurred in connection with the borrowing of money or the obtaining of advances or credit and which do not, in the opinion of the Company, materially impair the use of such assets in the operation of the business of the Company or such Consolidated Subsidiary or the value of such assets for the purposes thereof; or (l) liens relating to accounts receivable of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which have been sold, assigned or otherwise transferred to another Person in a transaction classified as a sale of accounts receivable in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (to the extent the sale by the Company or the applicable Subsidiary is deemed to give rise to a lien in favor of the purchaser thereof in such accounts receivable or the proceeds thereof).

The foregoing limitation shall not apply, if at the time the Company or any Consolidated Subsidiary enters into such sale and lease-back transaction, and after giving effect thereto, Exempted Debt does not exceed 15% of the total assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, determined in accordance with generally accepted
 
accounting principles as reflected on the Company's most recent publicly available consolidated balance sheet.

The term "Consolidated Subsidiary" shall mean any Subsidiary substantially all the property of which is located, and substantially all the operations of which are conducted, in the United States of America whose financial statements are consolidated with those of the Company in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, excluding any Subsidiary substantially all the assets of which consist of stock or other securities of any Subsidiary substantially all the property of which and substantially all the operations of which are conducted outside the United States.
 
The term "Exempted Debt" shall mean the sum of the following as of the date of determination: (i) Indebtedness of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries incurred after the date of issuance of the Notes and secured by liens not permitted to be created or assumed pursuant to the covenant with respect to "Limitation on Liens" above, and (ii) Attributable Debt of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries in respect of every sale and lease-back transaction entered into after the date of issuance of the Notes, other than leases expressly permitted by the covenant with respect to "Limitation on Sale and Lease-Back Transactions" above.
 
The term "Indebtedness" shall mean all items classified as indebtedness on the most recent publicly available consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
 
The term "net rental payments" under any lease of any period shall mean the sum of the rental and other payments required to be paid in such period by the lessee thereunder, not including, however, any amounts required to be paid by such lessee (whether or not designated as rental or additional rental) on account of maintenance and repairs, reconstruction, insurance, taxes, assessments, water rates or similar charges required to be paid by such lessee thereunder or any amounts required to be paid by such lessee thereunder contingent upon the amount of sales, maintenance and repairs, reconstruction, insurance, taxes, assessments, water rates or similar charges.

Purchase of Notes Upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event

Within 30 days following any Change of Control Repurchase Event or, at the option of the Company, prior to any Change of Control (defined below), but after the public announcement of the Change of Control, the Company shall mail a notice to each holder stating:

(ii)
                                 
the circumstances and relevant facts regarding such Change of Control Repurchase Event or, if the Change of Control is about to occur, the circumstances and relevant facts regarding such Change of Control;

The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a
 
Change of Control Repurchase Event.  To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the Notes, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached any obligations under the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the Notes by virtue of such conflict.
 
On the Change of Control Repurchase Event payment date, the Company shall, to the extent lawful:

The paying agent will promptly pay, from funds deposited by the Company for such purpose, to each holder of Notes properly tendered the purchase price for the Notes, and the trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each holder a new note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of any Notes surrendered.
 
The Company shall not be required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event if a third party makes an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Company and such third party purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer.
 
"Change of Control" means the occurrence of any of the following:
 
(1)
                                 
the direct or indirect sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of properties or assets of the Company and those of the subsidiaries of the Company, taken as a whole, to any "person" (individually and as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) and Section 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act), other than the Company or a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company;

(5)

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction effected to create a holding company for the Company that is subject to the provisions of Article 8 (Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets) of the Indenture will not be deemed to involve a Change of Control if (a) pursuant to such transaction the Company becomes a wholly owned subsidiary of such holding company and (b) the holders of the Voting Stock of such holding company immediately following such transaction are the same as the holders of the Voting Stock of the Company immediately prior to such transaction.
 
"Below Investment Grade Rating Event" means the Notes are rated below Investment Grade by both Rating Agencies on any date from the date of the public notice of an arrangement that could result in a Change of Control until the end of the 60-day period following public notice of the occurrence of a Change of Control (which period shall be extended so long as the rating of the Notes is under publicly announced consideration for possible downgrade by either of the Rating Agencies); provided that a Below Investment Grade Rating Event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating shall not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular Change of Control (and thus shall not be deemed a Below Investment Grade Rating Event for purposes of the definition of Change of Control Repurchase Event hereunder) if the Rating Agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the trustee in writing at its request
 
that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable Change of Control (whether or not the applicable Change of Control shall have occurred at the time of the Below Investment Grade Rating Event).
 
"Change of Control Repurchase Event" means the occurrence of both a Change of Control and a Below Investment Grade Rating Event.

"Investment Grade" means a rating of Baa3 or better by Moody's (or its equivalent under any successor rating categories of Moody's) and BBB- or better by S&P (or its equivalent under any successor rating categories of S&P) (or, in each case, if such Rating Agency ceases to rate the Notes for reasons outside of the control of the Company, the equivalent investment grade credit rating from any Rating Agency selected by the Company as a replacement Rating Agency).
 
"Lauder Family Members" includes only the following persons:  (i) the estate of Mrs. Estee Lauder; (ii) each descendant of Mrs. Lauder (a "Lauder Descendant") and their respective estates, guardians, conservators or committees; (iii) each "Family Controlled Entity" (as defined below); and (iv) the trustees, in their respective capacities as such, of each "Family Controlled Trust" (as defined below).

There shall be the following additions to the covenants of the Company set forth in Article 10 of the Indenture with respect to the Notes:
 
Limitation on Liens
.  The Company covenants that, so long as any of the Notes remain outstanding, it shall not, nor shall it permit any Consolidated Subsidiary to, create or assume any Indebtedness for money borrowed which is secured by a pledge, mortgage, lien, charge, encumbrance or security interest ("liens") of or upon any assets, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, of the Company or any such Consolidated Subsidiary without equally and ratably securing the Notes by a lien ranking ratably with and equal to (or at the option of the Company, senior to) such secured Indebtedness for as long as such Indebtedness remains outstanding and is so secured, except that the foregoing restriction shall not apply to (a) liens on any assets of any corporation or other business entity existing at the time such Person becomes a Consolidated Subsidiary; (b) liens on any assets (including, without limitation, property, shares of stock or indebtedness) existing at the time of acquisition of such assets by the Company or a Consolidated Subsidiary, or liens to secure the payment of all or any part of the purchase price of such assets upon the acquisition of such assets by the Company or a Consolidated Subsidiary or to secure any indebtedness incurred or guaranteed by the Company or a Consolidated Subsidiary prior to, at the time of, or within 360 days after such acquisition (or in the case of real property, the completion of construction (including any improvements on an existing asset) or commencement of full operation of such, property, whichever is later), which indebtedness is incurred or guaranteed for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price thereof or, in the case of real property, construction or improvements thereon; provided, however, that in the case of
 
any such acquisition, construction or improvement, the lien shall not apply to any assets theretofore owned by the Company or a Consolidated Subsidiary, other than, in the case of any such construction or improvement, any real property on which the property so constructed, or the improvement, is located; (c) liens on any assets securing indebtedness owed by any Consolidated Subsidiary to the Company or another wholly owned Subsidiary; (d) liens existing on the date of initial issuance of the Notes; (e) liens on any assets of a corporation or other business entity existing at the time such Person is merged into or consolidated with the Company or a Subsidiary or at the time of a purchase, lease or other acquisition of the assets of such Person as an entirety or substantially as an entirety by the Company or a Subsidiary; (f) liens on any assets of the Company or a Consolidated Subsidiary in favor of the United States of America or any state thereof, or any department, agency or instrumentality or political subdivision of the United States of America or any state thereof, or in favor of any other country, or any political subdivision thereof, to secure partial, progress, advance or other payments pursuant to any contract or statute or to secure any indebtedness incurred or guaranteed for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price (or, in the case of real property, the cost of construction) of the assets subject to such liens (including, but not limited to, liens incurred in connection with pollution control, industrial revenue or similar financing); (g) any extension, renewal or replacement or successive extensions, renewals or replacements, in whole or in part, of any lien referred to in the foregoing clauses (a) to (f), inclusive, including the refinancing thereof without increase of the principal of the indebtedness secured by such lien (except to the extent of any fees or costs associated with any such extension, renewal or replacement); (h) liens imposed by law, such as mechanics', workmen's, repairmen's, materialmen's, carriers', warehousemen's, vendors' or other similar liens arising in the ordinary course of business, or governmental (federal, state or municipal) liens arising out of contracts for the sale of products or services by the Company or any Consolidated Subsidiary, or deposits or pledges to obtain the release of any of the foregoing liens; (i) pledges, liens or deposits under worker's compensation laws or similar legislation and liens or judgments thereunder which are not currently dischargeable, or in connection with bids, tenders, contracts (other than for the payment of money) or leases to which the Company or any Consolidated Subsidiary is a party, or to secure public or statutory obligations of the Company or any Consolidated Subsidiary, or in connection with obtaining or maintaining self-insurance or to obtain the benefits of any law, regulation or arrangement pertaining to unemployment insurance, old age pensions, social security or similar matters, or to secure surety, performance, appeal or customs bonds to which the Company or any Consolidated Subsidiary is a party, or in litigation or other proceedings such as, but not limited to, interpleader proceedings, and other similar pledges, liens or deposits made or incurred in the ordinary course of business; (j) liens created by or resulting from any litigation or other proceeding which is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings, including liens arising out of judgments or awards against the Company or any Consolidated Subsidiary with respect to which the Company or such Consolidated Subsidiary is in good faith prosecuting an appeal or proceedings for review or for which the time to make an appeal has not yet expired; or final unappealable judgment liens which are satisfied within 15 days of the
 
date of judgment; or liens incurred by the Company or any Consolidated Subsidiary for the purpose of obtaining a stay or discharge in the course of any litigation or other proceeding to which the Company or such Consolidated Subsidiary is a party; (k) liens for taxes or assessments or governmental charges or levies not yet due or delinquent, or which can thereafter be paid without penalty, or which are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings; landlord's liens on property held under lease; and any other liens or charges incidental to the conduct of the business of the Company or any Consolidated Subsidiary or the ownership of the assets of any of them which were not incurred in connection with the borrowing of money or the obtaining of advances or credit and which do not, in the opinion of the Company, materially impair the use of such assets in the operation of the business of the Company or such Consolidated Subsidiary or the value of such assets for the purposes thereof; or (l) liens relating to accounts receivable of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which have been sold, assigned or otherwise transferred to another Person in a transaction classified as a sale of accounts receivable in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (to the extent the sale by the Company or the applicable Subsidiary is deemed to give rise to a lien in favor of the purchaser thereof in such accounts receivable or the proceeds thereof). Notwithstanding the above, the Company or any Consolidated Subsidiary may, without securing the Notes, create or assume any Indebtedness which is secured by a lien which would otherwise be subject to the foregoing restrictions, provided that at the time of such creation or assumption, after giving effect thereto, Exempted Debt does not exceed 15% of the total assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as reflected on the Company's most recent publicly available consolidated balance sheet.
 
Limitation on Sale and Lease-Back Transactions
.  The Company covenants that, so long as any of the Notes remain outstanding, the Company shall not, nor shall the Company permit any Consolidated Subsidiary to, enter into any sale and lease-back transaction with respect to any assets, other than any sale lease-back transaction (involving a lease for a term of not more than three years), unless either (a) the Company or such Consolidated Subsidiary would be entitled to incur Indebtedness secured by a lien on the assets to be leased in an amount at least equal to the Attributable Debt in respect of such transaction without equally and ratably securing the Notes pursuant to clauses (a) through (l) inclusive of the covenant with respect to "Limitation on Liens" above, or (b) the proceeds of the sale of the assets to be leased are at least equal to their fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company) and the proceeds are applied to the purchase or acquisition (or, in the case of real property, the construction) of assets or to the retirement (other than at maturity or pursuant to a mandatory sinking fund or mandatory redemption provision) of Indebtedness. The foregoing limitation shall not apply, if at the time the Company or any Consolidated Subsidiary enters into such sale and lease-back transaction, and after giving effect thereto, Exempted Debt does not exceed 15% of the total assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, determined in accordance with generally accepted
 
accounting principles as reflected on the Company's most recent publicly available consolidated balance sheet.
 
The term "Attributable Debt" in connection with a sale and lease-back transaction shall mean, as of the date of determination, the lesser of (a) the fair value of the assets subject to such transaction, as determined by the Company's Board of Directors, or (b) the present value of the obligations of the lessee for net rental payments during the term of any lease discounted at the rate of interest set forth or implicit in the terms of such lease or, if not practicable to determine such rate, the weighted average interest rate per annum borne by the debt securities of each series outstanding pursuant to the Indenture and subject to limitations on sale and lease-back transaction covenants, compounded semi-annually in either case as determined by the Company's principal accounting or financial officer.
 
The term "Consolidated Subsidiary" shall mean any Subsidiary substantially all the property of which is located, and substantially all the operations of which are conducted, in the United States of America whose financial statements are consolidated with those of the Company in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, excluding any Subsidiary substantially all the assets of which consist of stock or other securities of any Subsidiary substantially all the property of which and substantially all the operations of which are conducted outside the United States.
 
The term "Exempted Debt" shall mean the sum of the following as of the date of determination: (i) Indebtedness of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries incurred after the date of issuance of the Notes and secured by liens not permitted to be created or assumed pursuant to the covenant with respect to "Limitation on Liens" above, and (ii) Attributable Debt of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries in respect of every sale and lease-back transaction entered into after the date of issuance of the Notes, other than leases expressly permitted by the covenant with respect to "Limitation on Sale and Lease-Back Transactions" above.
 
The term "Indebtedness" shall mean all items classified as indebtedness on the most recent publicly available consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
 
The term "net rental payments" under any lease of any period shall mean the sum of the rental and other payments required to be paid in such period by the lessee thereunder, not including, however, any amounts required to be paid by such lessee (whether or not designated as rental or additional rental) on account of maintenance and repairs, reconstruction, insurance, taxes, assessments, water rates or similar charges required to be paid by such lessee thereunder or any amounts required to be paid by such lessee thereunder contingent upon the amount of sales, maintenance and repairs, reconstruction, insurance, taxes, assessments, water rates or similar charges.
 
The term "Subsidiary" shall mean any corporation, association, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company or other business entity of which at least a majority of the total voting power of the equity interest under ordinary circumstances for the election of the board of directors, managers or trustees thereof shall at the time be owned by the Company or by the Company and one or more Subsidiaries or by one or more Subsidiaries.
 
Purchase of Notes Upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event
.  If a Change of Control Repurchase Event (defined below) occurs, unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem the Notes as described in paragraph 6 above, the Company shall make an offer to each holder of Notes to repurchase all or any part (in multiples of $2,000 principal amount) of that holder's Notes at a repurchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes repurchased to the date of repurchase. Within 30 days following any Change of Control Repurchase Event or, at the option of the Company, prior to any Change of Control (defined below), but after the public announcement of the Change of Control, the Company shall mail a notice to each holder stating:
 
(i)
           
that a Change of Control has occurred or is about to occur and that such holder has the right to require the Company to purchase such holder's Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of purchase, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of purchase;
 
(ii)
          
the circumstances and relevant facts regarding such Change of Control Repurchase Event or, if the Change of Control is about to occur, the circumstances and relevant facts regarding such Change of Control;
 
(iii)
         
the purchase date (which shall be no earlier than 30 calendar days nor later than 60 calendar days from the date such notice is mailed);
 
(iv)
         
the instructions, as determined by the Company, that a holder must follow in order to have its Notes purchased; and
 
(v)
          
that the offer to purchase is conditioned on the Change of Control Repurchase Event occurring on or prior to the specified purchase date, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control.
 
The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a
 
Change of Control Repurchase Event.  To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the Notes, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached any obligations under the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the Notes by virtue of such conflict.
 
On the Change of Control Repurchase Event payment date, the Company shall, to the extent lawful:
 
(i)
           
accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Company's offer;
 
(ii)
          
deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate purchase price in respect of all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered; and
 
(iii)
         
deliver or cause to be delivered to the trustee the Notes properly accepted, together with an officers' certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes being purchased by the Company.
 
The paying agent will promptly pay, from funds deposited by the Company for such purpose, to each holder of Notes properly tendered the purchase price for the Notes, and the trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each holder a new note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of any Notes surrendered.
 
The Company shall not be required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event if a third party makes an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Company and such third party purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer.
 
"Change of Control" means the occurrence of any of the following:
 
(1)
          
the direct or indirect sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of properties or assets of the Company and those of the subsidiaries of the Company, taken as a whole, to any "person" (individually and as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) and Section 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act), other than the Company or a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company;
 
(2)
          
the adoption of a plan relating to the liquidation or dissolution of the Company;
 
(3)

(5)

that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable Change of Control (whether or not the applicable Change of Control shall have occurred at the time of the Below Investment Grade Rating Event).

As provided in the Indenture, Securities may be issued in one or more series, which different series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions, if any, may be subject to different repayment provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided or permitted.  This Note is one of a series of the Securities designated as 2.350% Senior Notes due 2022 (the "Notes").  The Notes are unsecured and rank pari passu with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company.  The Notes are not subject to a sinking fund.

Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the date of redemption to each registered holder of the Notes to be redeemed.  Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the date of redemption, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portion thereof called for redemption.

"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker that (1) has the maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed and (2) would be used, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, to price new issues of corporate debt securities with a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed.
 
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption date, (A) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, (B) if the trustee obtains fewer than three such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such Reference Treasury Quotations, or (C) if only one Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation is received, such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation.

Morgan Securities LLC (or their respective affiliates which are Primary Treasury Dealers) and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Company will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer; and (B) any other Primary Treasury Dealer selected by the Company.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the third business day preceding such redemption date.
 
If any Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes may declare the principal of all the Notes due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in aggregate principal amount of the
 
Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of each series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences.  Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
 
Holders of Securities may not enforce their rights pursuant to the Indenture or the Securities except as provided in the Indenture.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as counsel to The Este Lauder Companies Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with (i) the preparation and filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission of the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-182918) filed on July 30, 2012 (the "Registration Statement"), under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"); and (ii) the issuance and sale by the Company of $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 2.350% Senior Notes due 2022 (the "2022 Notes") and $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.700% Senior Notes due 2042 (the "2042 Notes" and together with the 2022 Notes, the "Notes").  The Notes were issued under an Indenture, dated as of November 5, 1999, between the Company and U.S. Bank Trust National Association, as successor in interest to State Street Bank and Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Indenture").
 
In so acting, we have examined originals or copies (certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction) of (i) the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended; (ii) the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company; (iii) the Registration Statement; (iv) the prospectus, dated July 30, 2012, contained within the Registration Statement; (v) the preliminary prospectus supplement, dated July 30, 2012, contained within the Registration Statement; (vi) the free writing prospectus, filed on July 30, 2012, contained within the Registration Statement; (vii) the prospectus supplement, dated July  30, 2012, contained within the Registration Statement; (viii) the Indenture; (ix) the Notes; (x) the Underwriting Agreement, dated July  30, 2012, among the Company and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters named in Schedule II thereto; and (xi) such corporate records, agreements, documents and other instruments, and such certificates or comparable documents of public officials and of officers and representatives of the Company, and have made such inquiries of such officers and representatives, as we have deemed relevant and necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter set forth.
 
In such examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of all natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the
 
conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified, conformed or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. As to all questions of fact material to this opinion that have not been independently established, we have relied upon certificates or comparable documents of officers and representatives of the Company.
 
Based on the foregoing and subject to the qualifications stated herein, we are of the opinion that the Notes (assuming due authentication and delivery of the Notes by the trustee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture) have been duly executed and authenticated in accordance with the Indenture and constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally, and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity, including principles of commercial reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity).
 
The opinions expressed herein are limited to the corporate laws of the State of Delaware and the laws of the State of New York, and we express no opinion as to the effect on the matters covered by this letter of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
 
We hereby consent to the filing of this letter as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and to the reference to our firm under the caption "Legal Matters" in the prospectus which is a part of the Registration Statement. This opinion and consent may be incorporated by reference in a subsequent registration statement on Form S-3 filed pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Act.
