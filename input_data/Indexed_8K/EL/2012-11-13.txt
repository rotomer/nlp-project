On November 9, 2012, The Este Lauder Companies Inc. (the Company) amended its Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Class A and Class B Common Stock.  The Certificate of Incorporation was amended by deleting Section 4.1 thereof in its entirety and inserting the following in lieu thereof:
           
4.1.
Authorized Capital Stock.
  The total number of shares of stock that the Corporation shall have authority to issue is one billion six hundred twenty four million (1,624,000,000)  shares consisting of (a) one billion three hundred million (1,300,000,000) shares of Class A Common Stock, par value $.01 per share (the "Class A Common Stock"); (b) three hundred four million (304,000,000) shares of Class B Common Stock, par value $.01 per share (the "Class B Common Stock"); and (c) twenty million (20,000,000) shares of preferred stock, par value $.01 per share (the "Preferred Stock"), issuable in one or more series as hereinafter provided.  The Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock shall hereinafter collectively be called "Common Stock," and the Preferred Stock shall also be referred to herein as "Preference Stock."  The number of authorized shares of any class or classes of capital stock of the Corporation may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL or any corresponding provision hereinafter enacted.
