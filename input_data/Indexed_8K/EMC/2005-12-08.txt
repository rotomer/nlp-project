Item 8.01. Other Events
 
In July 2005, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the board of directors of EMC Corporation ("EMC") approved in principle a long term incentive program for certain senior executives of EMC (the "Executive LTIP"). The program is comprised of equity awards intended to drive performance and promote retention, while also being cost efficient.
 
On December 5, 2005, the Committee awarded an aggregate of 5,875,000 performance shares under EMC's 2003 Stock Plan (the "Plan") to certain senior executives. 4,700,000 of these performance shares are referred to as Target Shares, and 1,175,000 of these performance shares are referred to as Overachievement Shares.
 
The performance shares awarded in December will vest in the event that a three-year cumulative earnings per share target (the "EPS Goal") approved by the Committee has been met. The Committee expects to determine whether the EPS Goal has been met or exceeded, in full or in part, in January 2009. If earnings per share equal or exceed (i) 90.9% of the EPS Goal, 50% of the Target Shares will vest, (ii) 94.2% of the EPS Goal, 75% of the Target Shares will vest or (iii) 100% of the EPS Goal, 100% of the Target Shares will vest. If earnings per share equal or exceed 106% of the EPS Goal and the holder is continuously employed by EMC through a specified date in January 2010, the Overachievement Shares will also vest. If the targets and conditions set forth above are not achieved, the performance shares awarded in December will be forfeited.
 
EMC intends for compensation realized upon the vesting of the performance shares to qualify as performance-based compensation for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
 
On December 5, 2005, the Committee also awarded an aggregate of 1,200,000 shares of restricted stock to certain executive officers. These shares will vest on the fifth anniversary of the date of grant, but may vest on an accelerated basis if certain earnings per share targets are met at specified times prior to such date.
