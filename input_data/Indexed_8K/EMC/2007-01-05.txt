Item 2.05. Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
On October 17, 2006, EMC announced plans to implement consolidation efforts designed to deliver a more unified experience to customers through the further integration of EMC and most of the 21 acquisitions made over the past three years by improving efficiencies across the company's business. As of such date, the actions were expected to result in the departure of approximately 1,250 employees worldwide by the end of 2007. The plan was expected to result in a pre-tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2006 of between $150 million and $175 million or $0.06 per diluted share to cover the cost of the consolidation efforts.
On December 29, 2006, EMC management approved a final consolidation plan as follows:
 
 
 
The total pre-tax charge is approximately $175 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, which will be recognized in the fourth quarter of 2006.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
