Item 8.01. Other Events.
On May 3, 2007, the shareholders of EMC Corporation ("EMC") approved a company proposal to exempt EMC from the requirements of the provisions of the Massachusetts Business Corporation Act which provide that the terms of directors of a public corporation incorporated in Massachusetts, such as EMC, shall be staggered. Beginning with EMC's 2008 annual meeting of shareholders, all directors will be elected for one-year terms. The full company proposal, along with the board's recommendation to shareholders that they approve the proposal, was included in EMC's definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 27, 2007.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
