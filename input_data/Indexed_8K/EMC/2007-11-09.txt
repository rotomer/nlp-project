Under the terms of the plan, Mr. Tucci may sell up to 281,549 shares of EMC common stock during the remainder of the current quarter and may sell up to 889,316 shares during the first half of fiscal year 2008. Mr. Tucci adopted the plan as part of a long-term strategy to gradually diversify his investments in a disciplined manner.
Certain other executive officers of the Corporation have also entered or will soon be entering into trading plans established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 and EMC's policies regarding stock transactions.
