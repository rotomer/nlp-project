EMC Reports Third-Quarter 2012 Financial Results
HOPKINTON, Mass. - October 24, 2012 - EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC) today reported financial results for the third quarter of 2012, highlighted by record third-quarter consolidated revenue, net income and EPS.
Third-quarter consolidated revenue was $5.28 billion, an increase of 6% compared with the year-ago quarter. Third-quarter GAAP net income attributable to EMC increased 3% year over year to $626 million. Third-quarter GAAP earnings per weighted average diluted share increased 4% year over year to $0.28. Non-GAAP
1
net income attributable to EMC for the third quarter was $881 million, an increase of 7% compared with the year-ago quarter. Third-quarter non-GAAP
1
earnings per weighted average diluted share were $0.40, an increase of 8% year over year.
During the third quarter, EMC generated operating cash flow of $1.44 billion and free cash flow
2
of $1.14 billion, a year-over-year increase of 12% and 16%, respectively. Additionally, the company ended the quarter with $10.6 billion in cash and investments.
Joe Tucci, EMC Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, EMC's third-quarter revenue and profit growth reflect the resiliency of our business in a more uncertain global economic environment. We remain very well positioned to capitalize on - and drive - the transformative trends of cloud computing, Big Data and trusted IT.  These major waves of change in IT become increasingly more important to customers and partners as they navigate through a cyclical slowdown, look to gain maximum value from their investments, and focus on their longer-term IT and business transformations. 
David Goulden, EMC President and Chief Operating Officer, said, For the third quarter, EMC's business continued to grow faster than overall IT spending growth and we gained market share in what turned out to be a more cautionary environment than we expected heading into the quarter. We remain extremely confident in our strategy, best-of-breed product portfolio and solid operational and financial model. Going forward, we fully believe that EMC will continue to grow faster than our addressable markets and take share, reinvest for the future, and deliver earnings leverage for shareholders.
Third-Quarter Highlights
In the third quarter, revenue from EMC's networked storage platforms portfolio
3
, which includes EMC's high-end and mid-tier storage platform products, grew 2% year over year. Revenue from EMC's high-end Symmetrix storage product portfolio, which includes the company's VMAX systems family, increased 5% compared with the year-ago quarter. Revenue from the company's portfolio of mid-tier storage products
4
was flat year over year.
 
Other third-quarter highlights included continued customer demand for EMC's Isilon scale-out NAS products and the company's Backup Recovery Systems (BRS) portfolio. Adoption of EMC's VSPEX reference architecture solutions also gained momentum and popularity among customers and with partners who have sold more than 300 VSPEX solutions since their launch in April 2012. Customers also continued to increasingly turn to EMC's Greenplum product portfolio to gain insight and value from Big Data. Revenue from EMC's RSA Information Security business increased 6% year over year, driven by continued customer requirements for trusted IT solutions. VMware (NYSE: VMW), the global leader in virtualization and cloud infrastructure, grew revenue 20% year over year. Additionally, EMC continued to experience solid demand for its broad portfolio of services to help customers accelerate their transition to cloud architectures and transform IT. Finally, VCE, formed by Cisco and EMC with investments from VMware and Intel, continued to gain traction in enterprise data centers and cloud service providers globally as demand for Vblock systems showed strong growth in the third quarter.
EMC's consolidated third-quarter revenue from the United States increased 8% year over year to $2.9 billion, representing 55% of consolidated third-quarter revenue. Revenue from EMC's business operations outside of the United States increased 4% year over year to $2.4 billion and represented 45% of consolidated third-quarter revenue.

This release contains forward-looking statements as defined under the Federal Securities Laws. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain risk factors, including but not limited to: (i) adverse changes in general economic or market conditions; (ii) delays or reductions in information technology spending; (iii) the relative and varying rates of product price and component cost declines and the volume and mixture of product and services revenues; (iv) competitive factors, including but not limited to pricing pressures and new product introductions; (v) component and product quality and availability; (vi) fluctuations in VMware, Inc.'s operating results and risks associated with trading of VMware stock; (vii) the transition to new products, the uncertainty of customer acceptance of new product offerings and rapid technological and market change; (viii) risks associated with managing the growth of our business, including risks associated with acquisitions and investments and the challenges and costs of integration, restructuring and achieving anticipated synergies; (ix) the ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees; (x) insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory; (xi) fluctuating currency exchange rates; (xii) threats and other disruptions to our secure data centers or networks; (xiii) our ability to protect our proprietary technology; (xiv) war or acts of terrorism; and (xv) other one-time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in EMC's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This release, the accompanying schedules and the additional content that is available on EMC's website contain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures, which are used as measures of EMC's performance or liquidity, should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of EMC's financial performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. EMC's non-GAAP financial measures may be defined differently from time to time and may be defined differently than similar terms used by other companies, and accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how EMC defines its non-GAAP financial measures in this release.
Where specified in the accompanying schedules for various periods entitled "Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP," certain items noted on each such specific schedule (including, where noted, amounts relating to stock-based compensation expense, intangible asset amortization, restructuring and acquisition-related charges and the amortization of VMware's capitalized software from prior periods) are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures.
EMC's management uses the non-GAAP financial measures in the accompanying schedules to gain an understanding of EMC's comparative operating performance (when comparing such results with previous periods or forecasts) and future prospects and excludes the above-listed items from its internal financial statements for purposes of its internal budgets and each reporting segment's financial goals. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by EMC's management in their financial and operating decision-making because management believes they reflect EMC's ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. EMC's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others (a) in understanding and evaluating EMC's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose, and (b) in comparing in a consistent manner the Company's current financial results with the Company's past financial results.
This release also includes disclosures regarding free cash flow which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less additions to property, plant and equipment and capitalized software development costs. EMC uses free cash flow, among other measures, to evaluate the ability of its operations to generate cash that is available for purposes other than capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. Management believes that information regarding free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to make strategic acquisitions and investments, repurchase shares, service debt and fund ongoing operations. As free cash flow is not a measure of liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of cash flows.
All of the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures have limitations. Specifically, the non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the items noted above do not include all items of income and expense that affect EMC's operations. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and do not reflect any benefit that such items may confer on EMC. Management compensates for these limitations by also considering EMC's financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP.
