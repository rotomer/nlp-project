Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On January 29, 2004, the registrant publicly released its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2003. The full text of the release is furnished as Exhibit 99.01 to this Form 8-K, and is incorporated here by reference. This information shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
The release uses the non-GAAP financial measure "earnings (loss) per diluted share excluding certain items." The "certain items" are asset impairments and restructuring charges, goodwill impairments, other operating income from the sale of certain assets, and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. The registrant's management believes that the "certain items" included in fourth-quarter and full-year 2003 results, while indicative of the performance of certain businesses and product lines and continuous efforts to reduce costs, do not reflect ongoing business results. Management believes that investors can better evaluate and analyze historical and future business trends if they also consider results of operations without the "certain items." Management utilizes earnings exclud ing these certain items in the measures it uses to evaluate corporate and segment performance and in determining certain performance-based compensation. This measure is not recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance. The reconciliation table (Table 6), in the fourth quarter and full year 2003 financial tables which accompany the release, reconciles earnings per share on a GAAP basis, as reflected in the registrant's Consolidated Statements of Earnings (Loss), to earnings per share excluding certain items.
SIGNATURES
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.

Eastman Announces Fourth-Quarter, Year-End 2003 Financial Results
 
KINGSPORT, Tenn., Jan. 29, 2004  Eastman Chemical Company (NYSE:EMN) today announced earnings of $0.13 per diluted share for fourth quarter 2003 versus a loss of $0.16 per diluted share for fourth quarter 2002.
 
Included in the results for fourth quarter 2003 is a gain of $13 million ($8 million net of tax) from the previously announced sale of the colorant product lines and related assets in the company's coatings, adhesives, specialty polymers and inks (CASPI) segment. Also included in fourth-quarter 2003 results are asset impairments and restructuring charges of $9 million ($8 million net of tax). Fourth-quarter 2002 results included asset impairments and restructuring charges of $6 million ($4 million net of tax). Excluding these items for both periods, fourth-quarter 2003 earnings per diluted share were $0.13, while the fourth-quarter 2002 loss per diluted share was $0.12. For reconciliation to reported earnings (loss) per diluted share, see Table 6 in the accompanying fourth-quarter and ful l-year 2003 financial tables.
 
"While encouraged by the year-over-year improvement in our bottom line results, we remain focused on executing the plans we have in place to further improve our profitability in 2004," said Brian Ferguson, chairman and CEO. "We expect to benefit both from the actions we are taking internally and from an improving economic environment."
 
    
   
   
   
   
   
*Certain items are asset impairments and restructuring charges, goodwill impairments, other operating income from the sale of certain assets and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle. For reconciliation to reported earnings (loss) per diluted share, see Table 6 in the accompanying fourth-quarter and full-year 2003 financial tables.
 
Operating earnings for fourth quarter 2003 were $39 million compared with an operating loss of $11 million for fourth quarter 2002. Fourth-quarter 2003 results included asset impairments and restructuring charges and a gain from the sale of the colorant product lines and related assets, while fourth-quarter 2002 results included asset impairments and restructuring charges. Operating results increased year-over-year due primarily to higher selling prices, the continuing impact of the company's 2003 cost reduction measures and the favorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates, particularly for the euro, that were partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs.
 
Sales revenue for fourth quarter 2003 was $1.43 billion, an increase of 9 percent compared with fourth quarter 2002. The increase was primarily the result of higher selling prices, favorable foreign currency exchange rates and increased sales volume.
Division and Segment Results 4Q 2003 versus 4Q 2002
Eastman Division's
fourth-quarter 2003 external sales revenue increased 5 percent compared with fourth quarter 2002, primarily due to favorable foreign currency exchange rates and slightly higher selling prices. The division's fourth-quarter 2003 operating earnings were $16 million compared with an operating loss of $8 million in fourth quarter 2002. Fourth- quarter 2003 division operating earnings included a $13 million gain from the sale of the colorant product lines and related assets as well as $7 million of asset impairments and restructuring charges. Fourth-quarter 2002 operating results included $5 million of asset impairments and restructuring charges. Excluding these items in both periods, Eastman Division's operating earnings for fourth quarter 2003 increased due to higher selling prices, continued cost reduction efforts and favorable foreign currency exchange rates that were partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs. Segments within Eastman Division had the following results:
 
Coatings, Adhesives, Specialty Polymers and Inks
 External sales revenue increased 7 percent compared with the year-ago period due primarily to favorable foreign currency exchange rates and slightly higher selling prices. Operating results increased as higher selling prices, continued cost reduction efforts and favorable foreign currency exchange rates were partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs. Fourth-quarter 2003 operating earnings included a gain of $13 million from the sale of the Accurate Dispersions colorant product lines and related assets as well as asset impairments and restructuring charges of $6 million. Fourth-quarter 2002 segment operating results included asset impairments and restructuring charges of $6 million. In addition, the segment benefited from lower depreciation expense in fourth quarter 2003 due to the asset impairments completed in third quarter 2003. 
Performance Chemicals and Intermediates
 External sales revenue for the segment increased 3 percent due primarily to favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Operating results declined primarily due to higher raw material and energy costs and increased research and development expenditures related to fulfilling a customer request. Fourth-quarter 2003 operating earnings included a $1 million asset impairments and restructuring charge, while fourth-quarter 2002 operating earnings included a $1 million credit related to previously recognized restructuring costs.
Specialty Plastics
 External sales revenue increased 5 percent as favorable foreign currency exchange rates and improved product mix were partially offset by lower sales volume that was primarily due to the previously announced sale of the polyethylene color concentrates assets. Operating results increased as cost reduction measures and favorable foreign currency exchange rates were partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs.
 
Voridian Division's
fourth-quarter 2003 external sales revenue increased 12 percent compared with the year-ago period as higher selling prices, higher sales volume and favorable foreign currency exchange rates were partially offset by an unfavorable shift in product mix. The division's fourth-quarter 2003 operating earnings were $36 million compared with operating earnings of $10 million in fourth quarter 2002. Operating results for the division increased as higher selling prices, increased sales volume, lower operating costs and favorable foreign currency exchange rates were partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs. Fourth-quarter 2003 operating earnings incl uded asset impairments and restructuring charges of $2 million, while fourth-quarter 2002 operating earnings included asset impairments and restructuring charges of $1 million. Segments within Voridian Division had the following results:
Polymers
 External sales revenue increased 16 percent due to higher selling prices, favorable foreign currency exchange rates and slightly higher sales volume. Operating results improved primarily due to higher selling prices; higher sales volume, particularly for polyethylene; and cost reduction measures that were partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs. Both fourth-quarter 2003 and fourth-quarter 2002 operating results included $1 million of asset impairments and restructuring charges. In addition, fourth-quarter 2002 operating results included approximately $11 million in costs related to previously disclosed 2002 operational disruptions.
Fibers
 External sales revenue increased 2 percent as higher sales volume and favorable foreign currency exchange rates more than offset an unfavorable shift in product mix that was due to increased sales volume for lower unit-priced acetyl chemicals. Operating earnings increased due to higher sales volume, including increased sales volume for acetate tow in the Asia Pacific region, and the impact of cost reduction efforts. Fourth-quarter 2003 operating earnings included $1 million of asset impairments and restructuring charges.
 
Developing Businesses Division's
fourth-quarter 2003 external sales revenue was $19 million compared with $8 million for the year-ago period. The increase was due primarily to continued implementation of customer contracts by Cendian Corporation. Division operating results improved primarily due to Cendian's performance, partially offset by higher costs associated with other growth initiatives.
Corporate FY 2003 versus FY 2002
For the year 2003, Eastman reported a loss of $3.50 per diluted share compared with earnings of $0.79 per diluted share for full-year 2002. Included in the results for full-year 2003 were asset impairments and restructuring charges of $489 million ($343 million net of tax), goodwill impairments of $34 million ($34 million net of tax), a benefit from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $3 million ($3 million net of tax) and other operating income from the sale of assets of $33 million ($20 million net of tax). Full-year 2002 results included asset impairments and restructuring charges of $5 million ($3 million net of tax) and a charge related to the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle of $18 million ($18 mil lion net of tax). Excluding these items for both periods, earnings per diluted share for full-year 2003 were $1.08, while full-year 2002 earnings per diluted share were $1.05. For reconciliation to reported earnings (loss) per diluted share, see Table 6 in the accompanying fourth-quarter and full-year 2003 financial tables.
 
The company reported an operating loss of $267 million for full-year 2003 compared with operating earnings of $208 million during full-year 2002. Full-year 2003 operating results included asset impairments and restructuring charges of $489 million, goodwill impairments of $34 million and other operating income from the sale of certain assets of $33 million. 2002 operating earnings included $5 million of asset impairments and restructuring charges. Excluding these items in both periods, operating earnings increased slightly for 2003 as higher selling prices, cost reduction efforts and favorable foreign currency rates were partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs.
Operating results in 2003 were impacted by margin compression of approximately $100 million due to higher raw material and energy costs that were partially offset by higher selling prices. Cost reduction efforts in 2003 included a change in vacation policy that favorably impacted results by approximately $40 million for the year. Operating results in 2003 also included a $14 million gain from an insurance settlement related to the 2002 polymers segment's operational disruptions. Operating results in 2002 were negatively impacted by approximately $39 million due to the same operational disruptions.
Eastman's full-year 2003 sales revenue was $5.8 billion, a 9 percent increase compared with full-year 2002. The higher sales revenue was due primarily to increased selling prices, particularly for the polymers and the performance chemicals and intermediates segments, and favorable foreign currency exchange rates.
Division and Segment Results FY 2003 versus FY 2002
Eastman Division's
2003 external sales revenue increased 6 percent compared with 2002, as favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher selling prices more than offset lower sales volume.

Results for 2003 included asset impairments and restructuring charges of $486 million, goodwill impairments of $34 million and other operating income from asset sales of $33 million. Results for 2002 included asset impairments and restructuring charges of $4 million. Excluding these items in both periods, operating results declined slightly for 2003 as higher raw material and energy costs were mostly offset by higher selling prices, cost reduction efforts and favorable foreign currency exchange rates.
Coatings, Adhesives, Specialty Polymers and Inks
 External sales revenue increased 4 percent for 2003 compared with 2002 as favorable foreign currency exchange rates, improved product mix and slightly higher selling prices more than offset lower sales volume.
The lower sales volume was due primarily to restructuring and divestiture actions that were taken during the year and forgoing sales of certain low-margin products
.
Operating results for the segment were a loss of $358 million for 2003 compared with earnings of $58 million in 2002. In 2003, operating results included $386 million in asset impairments and restructuring charges, $34 million of goodwill impairments and $13 million of other operating income resulting from the sale of the Accurate Dispersions colorant product lines and related assets. Results in 2002 included asset impairments and restructuring charges of $5 million. Excluding these items in both periods, operating results for 2003 declined as higher raw material and energy costs and lower sales volume were partially offset by cost reduction efforts, higher selling prices and favorable foreign currency exchange rates.
 
Performance Chemicals and Intermediates
 2003 external sales revenue increased 9 percent due primarily to higher selling prices and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. 2003 operating results were a loss of $89 million compared with operating earnings of $14 million in 2002. The segment's 2003 operating results included asset impairments and restructuring charges of $99 million, while 2002 operating results included a credit of $1 million related to previously recognized restructuring costs. Excluding these items for both periods, operating results for 2003 declined slightly as higher raw material and energy costs were mostly offset by higher selling prices and cost re duction efforts.
Specialty Plastics
 External sales revenue increased 6 percent primarily due to favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Sales volume was impacted by the previously announced sale of the polyethylene color concentrates assets. The segment's operating earnings increased in 2003 compared with 2002 as cost reduction efforts and favorable foreign currency exchange rates were partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs. 2003 operating results also included a $20 million gain from the previously announced sale of certain assets and a $1 million asset impairments and restructuring charge.
Voridian Division's
full-year 2003 external sales revenue increased 11 percent compared with 2002, due primarily to higher selling prices, particularly for the polymers segment, and favorable foreign currency exchange rates that were partially offset by an unfavorable shift in product mix. Operating earnings increased to $187 million in 2003 compared with $168 million in 2002, due primarily to higher selling prices, cost reduction efforts and favorable foreign currency exchange rates that were partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs. The 2003 operating earnings included asset impairments and restructuring charges of $3 million and a $14 million gain from an insurance settlement related to the previously announced 2002 operational disruptions. The 2002 earnings from operations were negatively impacted by approximately $39 million in costs related to the operational disruptions and an asset impairments and restructuring charge of $1 million.
Polymers Segment
 Full-year 2003 versus full-year 2002 external sales revenue increased 16 percent due primarily to higher selling prices and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Operating earnings for 2003 were $62 million compared with $35 million for 2002. Results for 2003 included a $14 million gain from an insurance settlement related to the operational disruptions and $2 million of asset impairments and restructuring charges, while 2002 results included $39 million of charges related to the operational disruptions and a $1 million asset impairments and restructuring charge. Full-year 2003 versus full-year 2002, the segment's operating earnings benefited from impr oved conditions in the polyethylene market and overall cost reduction efforts, while being negatively impacted by higher raw material and energy costs and significant new capacity addition of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in North America.
 
Fibers
 External sales revenue for 2003 declined slightly compared with 2002 as a negative shift in product mix was mostly offset by higher sales volume and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. The negative shift in product mix was mainly due to increased sales volume for lower unit-priced acetyl chemicals products. Operating earnings were $125 million, below 2002 operating earnings of $133 million, but in line with the company's previously reported expectations. The decline was due primarily to lower demand for acetate tow, principally in North America, partially offset by higher sales volume outside of North America. 2003 operating earnings included $1 million of ass et impairments and restructuring charges.
Developing Businesses Division's
external sales revenue for full-year 2003 was $69 million compared with $16 million for 2002, due primarily to continued implementation of customer contracts by Cendian Corporation. Operating results for full-year 2003 were improved to a loss of $65 million compared with a loss of $70 million in 2002. The change in the division's results was due primarily to improved operating performance at Cendian Corporation, offset by higher costs associated with other growth initiatives.
Cash Flow
Eastman generated $244 million in cash from operating activities in 2003. The company also contributed $238 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans during the year. The company expects to contribute between $0 and $40 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans in 2004, with the amount dependent on action by the U.S. Congress to establish a pension discount interest rate for 2004 and 2005. Net debt, defined as total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents, at the end of 2003 was $2.04 billion, $55 million above net debt at the end of 2002, which is in line with previously reported expectations.
Outlook
 
"As we begin 2004, we have seen economic conditions begin to improve," Ferguson said. "However, with raw material and energy costs remaining at historically high levels, pricing will be a key driver of our profitability in 2004. We also expect the actions we are taking internally to improve profitability will have a positive impact throughout the year. As a result, we expect earnings in first quarter 2004 to be in line with the current first-quarter 2004 analysts' mean estimate on First Call, which is $0.22 per share."
 
Cumulative Effect of Changes in Accounting Principle
As required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," at Jan.1, 2003, the company recognized existing asset retirement obligations adjusted for cumulative accretion to the date of adoption, asset retirement costs capitalized as an increase to the carrying amount of the associated long-lived asset and accumulated depreciation on those capitalized costs. As a result of the adoption of this standard, the company recognized an after-tax credit to earnings of $3 million in first quarter 2003, primarily related to a reduction in certain environmental liabilities.
SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," which became effective Jan.1, 2002, requires the company to complete an impairment assessment at least annually and that goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles be written down only in periods in which it is determined that the fair value is less than the recorded value. In connection with the company's 2002 impairment assessment, it was determined that the fair value of certain trademarks related to the CASPI segment was less than the recorded value. Accordingly, the company recognized an after-tax charge of approximately $18 million in first quarter 2002.
