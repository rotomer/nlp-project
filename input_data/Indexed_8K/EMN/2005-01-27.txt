Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
 
 
On January 27, 2005, the registrant publicly released its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2004. The full text of the release is furnished as Exhibit 99.01 to this Form 8-K, and is incorporated herein by reference. This information shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
 
 
This Form 8-K includes the following non-GAAP financial measures:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Eastman's management believes that the asset impairments and restructuring charges, other operating income, net deferred tax benefit, and corporate and Eastman Division sales revenue including restructured, divested, and consolidated product lines sales revenue from the CASPI segment do not reflect ongoing business results. However, management believes that these items are indicative of the performance of certain businesses and product lines, results of continuous efforts to reduce costs, and results of other actions to improve the profitability of the company. Management believes that investors can better evaluate and analyze historical and future business trends if they also consider the reported corporate, division and segment results, respectively, without the identified items. Management utilizes corporat e earnings and division and segment sales revenue and operating results excluding the identified items in the measures it uses to evaluate corporate, division and segment performance and in determining certain performance-based compensation. These measures are not recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and should not be viewed as alternatives to the GAAP measures of performance. Table 8 in the accompanying fourth-quarter and full-year 2004 financial tables reconciles operating earnings, net earnings and earnings per share on a GAAP basis, as reflected in Eastman's Consolidated Statements of Earnings to operating earnings, net earnings and earnings per share excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges, other operating income, and the net deferred tax benefit. Tables 4a and 4b in the accompanying fourth-quarter and full-year 2004 financial tables reconcile corporate and Eastman Division sales revenue on a GAAP basis to sales revenue excluding restructured, divested, and consolidated product lines sales revenue from the CASPI segment.
In addition, the Company has chosen to present CASPI sales revenue, operating results, and asset impairments and restructuring charges attributable to restructured, divested, and consolidated product lines. Table 5 in the accompanying fourth-quarter and full-year 2004 financial tables provides this information on a GAAP basis.

Eastman Announces Fourth-Quarter, Year-End 2004 Financial Results
KINGSPORT, Tenn., Jan. 27, 2005 - Eastman Chemical Company (NYSE:EMN) today announced earnings of $0.68 per diluted share for fourth quarter 2004 versus earnings of $0.13 per diluted share for fourth quarter 2003. Included in the results for fourth quarter 2004 was an income tax benefit of $26 million resulting primarily from the favorable resolution of a prior year's capital loss carryback refund claim. Excluding the items described in the following paragraph for both periods, fourth-quarter 2004 earnings per diluted share were $0.69, while fourth-quarter 2003 earnings were $0.13 per diluted share. For reconciliation to reported earnings, see Table 8 in the accompanying fourth-quarter and full-year 2004 financial tables.
Included in the results for fourth quarter 2004 were asset impairments and restructuring charges of $18 million and other operating income of $7 million from the previously announced sale of Ariel Research Corporation. Fourth-quarter 2003 results included asset impairments and restructuring charges of $9 million and other operating income of $13 million. For additional information, see "Asset Impairments and Restructuring Charges and Net Deferred Tax Benefits" below.
 
*For reconciliation to reported sales revenue and earnings per diluted share, see Tables 4a and 8 respectively in the accompanying fourth-quarter and full-year 2004 financial tables.  Also see "Asset Impairments and Restructuring Charges and Net Deferred Tax Benefits" for additional information.
"Our full-year 2004 results clearly demonstrate the significant progress we have made improving the company's profitability," said Brian Ferguson, chairman and CEO. "However, the continuous escalation of raw material and energy costs throughout 2004, with particular volatility in the fourth quarter, reconfirms pricing as a key determinant of our ability to improve margins."
Operating earnings in fourth quarter 2004 were $46 million compared with operating earnings in fourth quarter 2003 of $39 million. Excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges and other operating income in both periods, operating earnings were $57 million in fourth quarter 2004 compared with $35 million in fourth quarter 2003. The year-over-year improvement was attributed primarily to a continued focus on more profitable businesses and product lines, cost reduction efforts, higher selling prices and higher sales volume. In fourth quarter 2004, raw material and energy costs increased by approximately $250 million compared with fourth quarter 2003 raw material and energy costs.
Sales revenue for fourth quarter 2004 was $1.66 billion, a 16 percent increase over fourth quarter 2003. The increase in sales revenue was attributed primarily to higher selling prices, especially in the polymers and the performance chemicals and intermediates segments. Fourth-quarter 2003 sales revenue included sales revenue from restructured, divested and consolidated product lines in the coatings, adhesives, specialty polymers and inks (CASPI) segment. Excluding sales from those product lines for fourth quarter 2003, year-over-year sales revenue increased by 31 percent and sales volume increased by 12 percent.
Division and Segment Results 4
th
Quarter 2004 versus 4
th
Quarter 2003
Eastman Division's
fourth-quarter 2004 external sales revenue increased by 2 percent compared with fourth quarter 2003 as a result of higher selling prices that offset lower sales volume. Fourth-quarter 2003 results included sales revenue from restructured, divested and consolidated product lines in the CASPI segment. Excluding sales from those product lines for fourth quarter 2003, the division's sales revenue increased by 30 percent and sales volume increased by 20 percent. For reconciliation to reported sales revenue, see Table 4b in the accompanying fourth-quarter and full-year 2004 financial tables.
Fourth-quarter 2004 operating earnings for Eastman Division were $28 million compared with operating earnings of $16 million in fourth quarter 2003. Fourth-quarter 2004 operating earnings included asset impairments and restructuring charges of $3 million. Fourth-quarter 2003 operating earnings included asset impairments and restructuring charges of $7 million and other operating income of $13 million. Excluding those items for both periods, operating earnings increased as a continued focus on more profitable businesses and product lines, increased sales volume, higher selling prices and cost reduction efforts more than offset higher raw material and energy costs.
Coatings, Adhesives, Specialty Polymers and Inks
- The segment's fourth-quarter external sales revenue declined by 31 percent, primarily the result of the divestiture of certain businesses and product lines in third quarter 2004. Sales revenue for continuing product lines in the segment increased by 18 percent, primarily attributed to an increase in sales volume of 10 percent and higher selling prices. The increase in sales volume resulted primarily from strong demand in end-markets, including the building and construction, and nonwoven markets.
Fourth-quarter 2004 CASPI segment operating earnings included asset impairments and restructuring charges of $2 million, while fourth-quarter 2003 operating earnings included asset impairments and restructuring charges of $7 million and other operating income of $13 million. Excluding those items for both periods, operating earnings increased as a continued focus on more profitable businesses and product lines, increased sales volume and higher selling prices more than offset higher raw material and energy costs.
Performance Chemicals and Intermediates
- External sales revenue increased by 47 percent as a result of increased sales volume and higher selling prices. The increased sales volume, primarily in the intermediates businesses and product lines, was attributed to long-term supply arrangements with key customers, improved end-market demand attributable to strong economic growth and increased production capacity. Operating earnings improved substantially as increased sales volume, higher selling prices and continued cost reduction efforts more than offset higher raw material and energy costs.
Specialty Plastics
- External sales revenue increased by 19 percent, attributed primarily to higher sales volume. The higher sales volume resulted mainly from continued strong demand for products in new applications, including packaging, opthamalics and housewares. Operating earnings declined substantially, primarily attributed to selling prices not rising as quickly as rapidly increasing raw material and energy costs, particularly for paraxylene, and costs associated with a planned maintenance shutdown at the Kingsport, Tenn., site's specialty polymers facilities.
Voridian Division's
fourth-quarter 2004 external sales revenue increased by 32 percent due to higher selling prices and increased sales volume. Operating earnings increased year-over-year due primarily to increased sales volume, higher selling prices and cost reduction efforts that more than offset higher raw material and energy costs.
Polymers
- External sales revenue increased by 36 percent primarily due to higher selling prices. The increased selling prices were mainly the result of efforts to offset rapidly increasing raw material and energy costs, particularly paraxylene and ethylene glycol. Operating earnings increased as higher selling prices, cost reduction efforts and improved conditions in the polyethylene market more than offset higher raw material and energy costs.
Fibers
- External sales revenue increased by 21 percent as a result of improved product mix and increased sales volume. The improved product mix resulted primarily from increased sales volume for acetyl chemicals in the U.S. and for acetate tow in Asia. Operating earnings increased as higher sales volume and improved product mix more than offset higher raw material and energy costs.
Developing Businesses Division's
external sales revenue for fourth quarter 2004 was $29 million compared with $19 million for fourth quarter 2003. Included in fourth-quarter operating results were asset impairments and restructuring charges of $15 million primarily due to the previously announced restructuring of Cendian Corporation and a gain of $7 million from the previously announced sale of Ariel Research Corporation. Excluding those items, operating results declined year-over-year as a result of increased spending for growth initiatives.
Corporate Full-Year 2004 versus Full-Year 2003
Eastman reported earnings of $2.18 per diluted share for full-year 2004 compared with a loss of $3.50 per diluted share for full-year 2003. Included in the results for 2004 was an income tax benefit of $26 million resulting primarily from the favorable resolution of a prior year's capital loss carryback refund claim. Excluding the items described in the following paragraph for both periods, earnings per diluted share for full year 2004 were $2.82, while full-year 2003 earnings per diluted share were $1.08. For reconciliation to reported results, see Table 8 in the accompanying fourth-quarter and full-year 2004 financial tables.
Included in the results for full-year 2004 were asset impairments and restructuring changes of $206 million ($151 million, net of tax), a net deferred tax benefit of $90 million and other operating income of $7 million ($11 million, net of tax). Full-year 2003 results included asset impairments and restructuring charges of $489 million ($342 million, net of tax), goodwill impairments of $34 million ($34 million, net of tax), other operating income of $33 million ($20 million, net of tax) and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $3 million ($3 million, net of tax).
Operating earnings for full-year 2004 were $175 million compared with an operating loss of $267 million for full-year 2003. Full-year 2004 operating earnings included asset impairments and restructuring charges of $206 million and other operating income of $7 million. Operating results for full-year 2003 included asset impairments and restructuring charges of $489 million, goodwill impairments of $34 million and other operating income of $33 million. Excluding those items for both periods, operating earnings increased as a continued focus on more profitable businesses and product lines, increased sales volume, cost reduction efforts and higher selling prices more than offset higher raw material and energy costs. In 2004, raw material and energy costs increased by approximately $600 million compared with full-year 2003 raw material and energy costs.
Eastman's full-year 2004 sales revenue was $6.6 billion, a 13 percent increase compared with full-year 2003. The increase was attributed primarily to higher selling prices and increased sales volume. Excluding sales from the restructured, divested and consolidated product lines in the CASPI segment for both periods, sales revenue and sales volume increased by 21 percent and 11 percent respectively in 2004 compared with 2003.
Division and Segment Results Full-Year 2004 versus Full-Year 2003
Eastman Division's
2004 external sales revenue increased by 6 percent compared with 2003, primarily the result of increased selling prices and a favorable foreign currency exchange rate. Excluding sales from restructured, divested and consolidated product lines in the CASPI segment for both 2004 and 2003, sales revenue and sales volume increased by 18 percent and 12 percent respectively. For reconciliation to reported sales revenue, see Table 4b in the accompanying fourth-quarter and full-year 2004 financial tables. The division's 2004 operating earnings were $96 million compared with an operating loss of $384 million in 2003. Operating earnings in 2004 included asset impairments and restructuring charges of $172 million. Operating results for 2003 included asset impairments and restructuring charges of $486 million, goodwill impairments of $34 million and other operating income of $33 million. Excluding those items for both periods, operating earnings improved as an increased focus on more profitable businesses and product lines, increased sales volume, higher selling prices and cost reduction efforts more than offset higher raw material and energy costs.
Coatings, Adhesives, Specialty Polymers and Inks
- External sales revenue declined by 8 percent primarily due to lower sales volume. Excluding sales from the restructured, divested and consolidated product lines for both periods, sales revenue and sales volume increased by 15 percent and 11 percent respectively in 2004 compared with 2003. The increased sales volume for continuing products was due primarily to improved end-market demand attributable to strong economic growth and the marketing of new applications for existing products. Operating earnings for the segment were $67 million in 2004 compared with an operating loss of $402 million in 2003. In 2004, operating earnings included asset impairments and r estructuring charges of $81 million, while 2003 results included asset impairments and restructuring charges of $428 million, goodwill impairments of $34 million and other operating income of $13 million. Excluding those items for both periods, operating results improved in 2004 compared with 2003, attributed primarily to a continued focus on more profitable businesses and product lines, increased sales volume and cost reduction efforts that more than offset higher raw material and energy costs. For reconciliation to reported sales revenue and operating earnings, see Table 5 in the accompanying fourth-quarter and full-year 2004 financial tables.
Performance Chemicals and Intermediates
- External sales revenue increased by 23 percent, primarily the result of increased sales volume and higher selling prices. The increased sales volume was attributed to improved end-market demand due to strong economic growth and the implementation of long-term supply arrangements with key customers. Operating earnings for 2004 included asset impairments and restructuring charges of $38 million, while 2003 operating earnings included asset impairments and restructuring charges of $57 million. Excluding those items for both periods, operating earnings increased as higher sales volume, higher selling prices and cost reduction efforts more than offset higher raw material and energy costs.
Specialty Plastics
- External sales revenue increased 15 percent, mainly resulting from higher sales volume. The higher sales volume was attributed primarily to strong demand for products in both new and existing applications. Operating earnings in 2004 included asset impairments and restructuring charges of $53 million, while 2003 operating earnings included asset impairments and restructuring charges of $1 million and other operating income of $20 million. Excluding those items for both periods, operating earnings increased as higher sales volume, continued focus on more profitable businesses and product lines, and cost reduction efforts offset higher raw material and energy costs.
Voridian Division's
full-year 2004 external sales revenue increased by 22 percent, attributed to increased sales volume and higher selling prices. Operating earnings in 2004 were $171 million compared with $187 million in 2003. Included in 2004 operating earnings were asset impairments and restructuring charges of $13 million, while 2003 operating earnings included $3 million of asset impairments and restructuring charges. Excluding those items for both periods, operating earnings declined slightly as increased sales volume, higher selling prices and cost reduction efforts were offset by higher raw material and energy costs. In addition, 2003 operating earnings included a $14 million gain from an insura nce settlement related to operational disruptions in 2002.
Polymers
- External sales revenue increased by 24 percent primarily due to higher selling prices and increased sales volume. The increased sales volume was mainly the result of continued strong end-market demand attributable in part to increased substitution of PET polymers for other materials. Operating earnings for 2004 were $25 million compared with $62 million for 2003. The 2004 operating earnings included asset impairments and restructuring charges of $13 million, while 2003 operating earnings included asset impairments and restructuring charges of $2 million. Excluding those charges for both periods, operating earnings declined as increased sales volume and higher selling prices were m ore than offset by higher raw material and energy costs. In addition, 2003 operating earnings included a $14 million gain from an insurance settlement related to previously announced operational disruptions.
Fibers
- External sales revenue increased by 15 percent due mainly to increased sales volume, particularly for acetyl chemicals in the U.S. and acetate tow in Asia. Operating earnings increased primarily as a result of the increased sales volume.
Developing Businesses Division's
external sales revenue for 2004 was $121 million compared with $69 million for 2003. Operating results for 2004 included asset impairments and restructuring charges of $21 million primarily due to the previously announced restructuring of Cendian Corporation and other operating income of $7 million from the previously announced sale of Ariel Research Corporation. Excluding those items, operating results declined as a result of increased spending for growth initiatives, partially offset by reduced operating losses associated with the restructuring of Cendian Corporation.
Asset Impairments and Restructuring Charges and Net Deferred Tax Benefits
 
During fourth quarter 2004, Eastman recognized pretax asset impairments and restructuring charges of $18 million. Included in those charges were non-cash asset impairments of $9 million and restructuring charges of $9 million. The non-cash asset impairments related to the adjustment to fair value of assets at Cendian Corporation, impacting the Developing Businesses segment
,
as a result of a recent decision to shut down Cendian logistics activities. In addition, the company recognized restructuring charges of $9 million primarily related to expected severance.
 
During fourth quarter 2004, Eastman also completed the previously announced sale of Ariel Corporation that resulted in a pretax gain of $7 million.
Cash Flow
Eastman generated $494 million in cash from operations in 2004 versus $244 million in 2003. Contributions to the company's U.S. defined benefit plans were $3 million in 2004 and $238 million in 2003. Net debt, defined as total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents, declined $298 million in 2004.
Outlook
Commenting on the outlook for first quarter 2005, Ferguson said: "We expect sales volume to remain strong throughout the company, but we also anticipate that key raw material and energy costs will escalate during the quarter. In addition, we expect to implement selling price increases in order to recover our margin over raw material and energy costs. As a result, we expect first-quarter 2005 earnings per share to be similar to the current First Call mean estimate of $0.83 per share. However, volatile raw material and energy costs limit the precision of our estimate."
