ITEM 8.01. OTHER EVENTS
Eastman Chemical Companys products and operations have been managed and reported in six reportable operating segments, consisting of the Coatings, Adhesives, Specialty Polymers and Inks ("CASPI") segment, the Fibers segment, the Performance Chemicals and Intermediates ("PCI") segment, the Polymers segment, the Specialty Plastics ("SP") segment and the Developing Businesses ("DB") segment. The Company's segments were previously aligned in a divisional structure that provided for goods and services to be transferred between divisions at predetermined prices that may have been in excess of cost, which resulted in the recognition of intersegment sales revenue and operating earnings between divisions. Such interdivisional transactions were eliminated in the Company's consolidated financial statements. In first quarter 2006, the Company realigned its organizational structure to support its growth strategy and to better reflect the integrated nature of the Company's assets. A result of the realigned organizational structure is that goods and services are transferred among the segments at cost. As part of this change, the Company's segment results for 2002 through 2005 have been restated to eliminate the impact of interdivisional sales revenue and operating earnings, as shown in the tables below.
