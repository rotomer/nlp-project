Item 2.06 - Material Impairments 
On January 25, 2007, Eastman Chemical Company decided to initiate the closure of its non-integrated PET polymers site in San Roque, Spain. As previously disclosed, the Company has been evaluating various strategic options that include restructuring, divestiture or consolidation of its non-integrated PET manufacturing assets outside the United States. After evaluating the various alternatives, the Company decided to initiate the actions required to permanently shut down the San Roque site due to an untenable labor situation. This decision will impact approximately $45 million of net assets associated with this site and could lead to non-cash impairment charges in the first quarter of 2007. In addition, this decision could result in restructuring charges, primarily severance, which would result in future cash expenditures. The restructuring charges are not expected to exceed $10 million, but are subject to negotiation with third parties. Management expects the underlying costs of and charges related to this decision to be reported as asset impairment and restructuring charges during the first quarter of 2007.
