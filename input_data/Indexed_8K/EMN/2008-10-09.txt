EASTMAN CHEMICAL COMPANY - EMN
 
 
KINGSPORT, Tenn., October 8, 2008  Eastman Chemical Company (NYSE:EMN) today announced that third-quarter 2008 earnings per share excluding costs related to strategic actions are expected to be above the high end of the current range of analysts estimates on First Call, which is $1.30 per share.
