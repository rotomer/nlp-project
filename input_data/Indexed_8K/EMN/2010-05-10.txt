The amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation, and a related amendment to the Companys Bylaws, became effective on May 6, 2010 upon filing of a certificate of amendment with the Secretary of State of Delaware. The proposal for and text of the amendments to the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws were disclosed in the definitive proxy statement filed by the Company on March 25, 2010. Complete copies of the Certificate of Incorporation and of the Bylaws as amended will be filed as exhibits to the Companys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2010.
The results of the voting on the stockholder proposal requesting that the Board of Directors take steps necessary to elect each director annually for a one year term were as follows:
Accordingly, a majority of votes was cast in favor of this stockholder proposal and the proposal was adopted.
