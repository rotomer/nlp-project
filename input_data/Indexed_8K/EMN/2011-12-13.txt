Items 1.01, 1.02, and 2.03  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement, Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement, and Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation
On December 7, 2011, Eastman Chemical Company (the Company) entered into a $750 million revolving credit agreement (the "New Credit Facility") expiring December 7, 2016. The New Credit Facility replaces, and has terms substantially similar to, the $700 million revolving credit agreement (the Prior Credit Facility) which, by its terms, was scheduled to expire in April 2012 and April 2013 and was terminated concurrently with the entry into the New Credit Facility. (The Prior Credit Facility is filed as Exhibit 4.11 to the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 and Exhibit 4.10 to the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2008 and is described in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Liquidity, Capital Resources, and Other Financial Information  Liquidity in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2011.) At December 7, 2011 the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Prior Credit Facility, and at December 13, 2011 the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the New Credit Facility.
Borrowings under the New Credit Facility are subject to interest at varying spreads above quoted market rates, and a commitment fee is paid on the total unused commitment and letter of credit fees are paid on the amount of any issued letters of credit based upon the Companys long-term senior unsecured non-credit-enhanced debt rating. The New Credit Facility contains a number of customary covenants and events of default, including the maintenance of a ratio of Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the New Credit Facility) for any four consecutive quarters of not greater than 3.5 to 1. Borrowings under the New Credit Facility may be made in multiple currencies in up to U.S. $750 million for general corporate purposes, as liquidity support for commercial paper borrowings, and for funding draws upon letters of credit issued under the New Credit Facility. The New Credit Facility provides for issuance of letters of credit in the amount of up to U.S. $250 million.
Certain of the lenders, agents, and other parties to the New Credit Facility and their affiliates have in the past provided lending, commercial banking, underwriting, investment banking, or other advisory services to the Company for which they have received customary compensation.
This description of the New Credit Facility is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the entire New Credit Facility, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.01 and incorporated herein by this reference.

(d)           Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the time of any Revolving Credit Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Agent such Lender's ratable portion of such Revolving Credit Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available to the Agent on the date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 2.02 and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower requesting such Revolving Credit Borrowing on such date a corresponding amount.  If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have so made such ratable portion available to the Agent, such Lender and such Borrower severally agree to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to such Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Agent, at (i) in the case of such Borrower, the higher of (A) the interest rate applicable at the time to the Revolving Credit Advances comprising such Borrowing and (B) the cost of funds incurred by the Agent in respect of such amount and (ii) in the case of such Lender, (A) the Federal Funds Rate in the case of Advances denominated in Dollars or (B) the cost of funds incurred by the Agent in respect of such amount in the case of Advances denominated in Committed Currencies.

If the form provided by a Lender at the time such Lender first becomes a party to this Agreement indicates a United States interest withholding tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be considered excluded from Taxes unless and until such Lender provides the appropriate forms certifying that a lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding tax at such lesser rate only shall be considered excluded from Taxes for periods governed by such form; , , that, if at the date of the Assignment and Assumption pursuant to which a Lender assignee becomes a party to this Agreement, the Lender assignor was entitled to payments under subsection (a) in respect of United States withholding tax with respect to interest paid at such date, then, to such extent, the term Taxes shall include (in addition to withholding taxes that may be imposed in the future or other amounts otherwise includable in Taxes) United States withholding tax, if any, applicable with respect to the Lender assignee on such date.  If any form or document referred to in this subsection (e) requires the disclosure of information, other than information necessary to compute the tax payable and information required on the date hereof by Internal Revenue Service form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, that the Lender reasonably considers to be confidential, the Lender shall give notice thereof to the Company and shall not be obligated to include in such form or document such confidential information.

The Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.  In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of an Advance, or the issuance, extension, renewal or increase of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or an Issuing Bank, the Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or Issuing Bank unless the Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or Issuing Bank prior to the making of such Advance or the issuance of such Letter of Credit.

In the case of any investigation, litigation or proceeding giving rise to any Indemnified Costs, this Section 8.05 applies whether any such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by the Agent, any Lender or a third party.

 EXHIBIT D - FORM OF
OPINION OF COUNSEL
FOR THE BORROWER
[Effective Date]
 
To each of the Lenders parties
  to the Five-Year Credit
  Agreement dated as of December 7, 2011
  among Eastman Chemical Company,
  said Lenders and Citibank, N.A.,
  as Agent for said Lenders, and
  to Citibank, N.A., as Agent
 
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to Section 3.01(h)(iv) of the Five-Year Credit Agreement, dated as of December 7, 2011 (the ), among Eastman Chemical Company (the Borrower), the Lenders parties thereto and Citibank, N.A., as Agent for said Lenders.  Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein as therein defined.
Credit Agreement
 
I am Assistant General Counsel and Assistant Secretary of the Borrower, and offer these opinions in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement.  Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein have the meaning given to them in the Credit Agreement.
 
In connection with this opinion, I or people under my direct supervision  have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to my or their satisfaction, of the following:
 
(1)           The Credit Agreement.
 
(2)           The documents furnished by the Borrower pursuant to Article III of the Credit Agreement.
 
(3)           The Certificate of Incorporation of the Borrower and all amendments thereto (the ).
Charter
 
(4)           The by-laws of the Borrower and all amendments thereto (the ).
By-laws
 
I have also examined the originals, or copies certified to  my satisfaction, of the documents listed in a certificate of the chief financial officer of the Borrower, dated the date hereof (the ), certifying that the documents listed in such certificate are all of the indentures, loan or credit agreements, leases, guarantees, mortgages, security agreements, bonds, notes and other agreements or instruments, and all of the orders, writs, judgments, awards, injunctions and decrees, that affect or purport to affect the Borrower's right to borrow money or the Borrower's obligations under the Credit Agreement or the Notes.  In addition, I have examined the originals, or copies certified to my satisfaction, of such other corporate records of the Borrower, certificates of public officials and of officers of the Borrower, and agreements, instruments and other documents, as I have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions expressed below.  As to questions of fact material to such opinions, I have, when relevant facts were not independently established by me, relied upon certificates of the Borrower or its officers or of public officials.  I have assumed the due execution and delivery, pursuant to due authorization, of the Credit Agreement by the Initial Lenders and the Agent.
Certificate
 
 
 
 
For purposes of this opinion, I have assumed, with your consent, that the Credit Agreement constitutes the valid and binding obligation of each party thereto, other than the Borrower, enforceable in accordance with its terms.  I express no opinion as to the effect on the opinions herein stated of the compliance or noncompliance of any party to the Credit Agreement, other than the Borrower, with any state, federal or other laws or regulations applicable to such party.
 
I am a member of the Bar of the State of Tennessee and the opinions expressed herein are specifically limited to the law of the State of Tennessee, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the Federal law of the United States.
 
Based upon the foregoing and upon such investigation as I have deemed necessary, I am of the following opinion:
 
1.           The Borrower is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
 
2.           The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement and the Notes, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, are within the Borrower's corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and do not contravene (i) the Charter or the By-laws or (ii) any law, rule or regulation applicable to the Borrower (including, without limitation, Regulation X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) or (iii) any contractual or legal restriction contained in any document listed in the Certificate or, to the best of my knowledge, contained in any other similar document.  The Credit Agreement and the Notes have been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Borrower.
 
3.           No authorization, approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body or any other third party is required for the due execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement and the Notes.
 
4.           In any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to the Credit Agreement or the Notes in any court of the State of Tennessee or in any Federal court sitting in the State of Tennessee, such court would recognize and give effect to the provisions of Section 9.10 of the Credit Agreement wherein the parties thereto agree that the Credit Agreement and the Notes shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.  However, if a court of the State of Tennessee or a Federal court sitting in the State of Tennessee were to hold that the Credit Agreement and the Notes are governed by, and to be construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Tennessee, the Credit Agreement and the Notes would be, under the laws of the State of Tennessee, legal, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with their respective terms.
 
5.           To the best of my knowledge, there are no pending or overtly threatened actions or proceedings against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries before any court, governmental agency or arbitrator that purport to affect the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of the Credit Agreement or any of the Notes or the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby or, except as described in Exhibit 4.01(d) to the Credit Agreement, that are likely to have a materially adverse effect upon the financial condition or operations of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.
 
 
 
 
The opinions set forth above are subject to the following qualifications:
 
(a)           My opinion in the last sentence of paragraph 4 above as to enforceability is subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency (including, without limitation, all laws relating to fraudulent transfers), reorganization, moratorium or similar law affecting creditors' rights generally.
 
(b)           My opinion in the last sentence of paragraph 4 above as to enforceability is subject to the effect of general principles of equity, including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
 
(c)           I express no opinion as to (i) Section 2.16 of the Credit Agreement insofar as it provides that any Lender purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant thereto may exercise set-off or similar rights with respect to such participation and (ii) the effect of the law of any jurisdiction other than the State of Tennessee wherein any Lender may be located or wherein enforcement of the Credit Agreement or the Notes may be sought that limits the rates of interest legally chargeable or collectible.
 
 Very truly yours
