Any reference in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Securities Act, as of the effective date of the Registration Statement or the date of such Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be, and any reference to "amend", "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed after such date under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (collectively, the "Exchange Act") that are deemed to be incorporated by reference therein.

Indemnification of the Underwriters.
(b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (including, without limitation, legal fees and other expenses incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted, promptly after such fees and expenses are incurred) that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the
Indemnification of the Company.
 
Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, it being understood and agreed that the only such information consists of the following: the third paragraph of text under the caption "Underwriting" in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus relating to the terms of offering, including the concession and reallowance to certain dealers, by the Underwriters; the third and fourth sentences of the seventh paragraph of text under the caption "Underwriting" in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus relating to market making by the Underwriters; the ninth paragraph of text under the caption "Underwriting" in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus relating to over-allotment, stabilization and syndicate covering transactions by the Underwriters, and the fourth sentence of the tenth paragraph of text, under the caption "Underwriting" in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus relating to the fact that the underwriters may, now or in the future, on behalf of themselves or their customers, hold long or short positions in the Company's debt or equity securities or loans.
(c) If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "Indemnifying Person") in writing; that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this Section 7 except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under this Section 7. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (who shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 7 that the Indemnifying Party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel related to such proceeding, promptly after incurred.

It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any
Notice and Procedures.

proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed promptly after they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by the Representatives and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Securities and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in
Contribution.
 
connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
(e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
Limitation on Liability.

provided further
The terms of any Notes of any series issued under this Indenture shall be incorporated by reference and deemed a part of this Indenture insofar as it relates to such series of Notes, and shall be subject to the terms and provisions of this Indenture, including but not limited to those relating to modification, amendment, waiver and consent.
 
At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Notes of any series executed by the Company together with a Company Order for authentication and the Trustee shall thereupon authenticate and deliver said Notes upon receipt of such Company Order. In authenticating such Notes, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Notes, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive and (subject to Section 7.01) shall be fully protected in relying upon:
Section 2.03.
.
Authentication
(1) the Board Resolution, supplemental indenture or Officers' Certificate establishing the form of the Notes of that series and the terms of the Notes of that series;
(2) an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel complying with Section 11.04; and
(3) an Opinion of Counsel stating substantially to the effect that: (a) that the form of such Notes has been established by or pursuant to a Board Resolution, Officers' Certificate or in one or more indentures supplemental hereto, in each case, in accordance with Sections 2.01 and 2.02 and in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and (b) that such Notes, when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent transfer and fraudulent conveyance, voidable preference, moratorium or other similar laws, and related regulations and judicial doctrines from time to time in effect, relating to or affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally and any additional customary limitations, qualifications and assumptions.
The Trustee shall have the right to decline to authenticate and deliver any Notes of such series if the Trustee (a) being advised by counsel, determines that such action may not lawfully be taken or (b) in good faith by its board of directors or trustees, executive committee or a trust committee of directors and/or vice-presidents shall determine that such action would expose the Trustee to personal liability.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.02 and of the preceding paragraph of this Section 2.03, if all Notes of a series are not to be originally issued at one time, including in the event that the aggregate principal amount of a series of Outstanding Notes is increased as contemplated by Section 2.02, it shall not be necessary to deliver the Officers' Certificate otherwise required pursuant to Section 2.02 or the Company Order and Opinion of Counsel otherwise required pursuant to this Section 2.03 at or prior to the authentication of each Note of such series if such documents are delivered at or prior to the authentication upon original issuance of the first Note of such series to be issued.
No Note shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Note a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee by manual signature, and such certificate upon any Note shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Note has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Note shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such Note to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 2.09, for all purposes of this Indenture such Note shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
 
The Notes of each series shall be issued in registered form without coupons in such denominations as shall be specified as contemplated by Section 2.02. In the absence of any such specification with respect to the Notes of any series, the Notes of such series shall be issuable in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. Notes of each series shall be numbered, lettered or otherwise distinguished in such manner or in accordance with such plan as the Officers of the Company executing the same may determine with the approval of the Trustee.
Section 2.04.
.
Date and Denomination of Notes
Every Note shall be dated the date of its authentication.
The Person in whose name any Note of a particular series is registered at the close of business on any Record Date with respect to any Interest Payment Date for such series shall be entitled to receive the interest payable on such Interest Payment Date notwithstanding the cancellation of such Note upon any registration of transfer or exchange subsequent to the Record Date and prior to such Interest Payment Date; , , that if and to the extent that the Company shall default in the payment of the interest due on such Interest Payment Date, such defaulted interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names Outstanding Notes of such series are registered on a subsequent record date established by notice given by mail by or on behalf of the Company to the Holders of such Notes not less than 15 days preceding such subsequent record date, such subsequent record date to be not less than five days preceding the date of payment of such defaulted interest. Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.02 for Notes of a particular series, the term "Record Date" as used in this Section 2.04 with respect to any regular Interest Payment Date, shall mean, the last day of the calendar month preceding such Interest Payment Date if such Interest Payment Date is the fifteenth day of such calendar month, and shall mean the fifteenth day of the calendar month preceding such Interest Payment Date if such Interest Payment Date is the first day of a calendar month, whether or not such day shall be a Business Day.
provided
however
Interest on the Notes may at the option of the Company be paid by check mailed to the Persons entitled thereto at their respective addresses as such appear on the registry books of the Company.
The Notes shall be signed in the name and on behalf of the Company by the manual or facsimile signature of the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer or the Treasurer. Only such Notes as shall bear thereon a certificate of authentication substantially in the form herein set forth, executed by the Trustee by the manual signature of an authorized officer, shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose. Such certificate by the Trustee upon any Note executed by the Company shall be conclusive evidence that the Note so authenticated has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and that the Holder is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
Section 2.05.
.
Execution of Notes
In case any officer of the Company who shall have signed any of the Notes shall cease to be such officer before the Notes so signed shall have been authenticated and delivered by the
 
Trustee, or disposed of by the Company, such Notes nevertheless may be authenticated and delivered or disposed of as though the Person who signed such Notes had not ceased to be such officer of the Company; and any Note may be signed on behalf of the Company by such Persons as, at the actual date of the execution of such Note, shall be the proper officers of the Company, although at the date of the execution of this Indenture any such Person was not such an officer.
Notes of any series may be exchanged for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of the same series of other authorized denominations. Notes to be exchanged shall be surrendered, at the option of the Holders thereof, either at the office or agency designated and maintained by the Company for such purpose for such series in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.02 or at any of such other offices or agencies as may be designated and maintained by the Company for such purpose for such series in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.02, and the Company shall execute and register and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor the Note or Notes which the Noteholder making the exchange shall be entitled to receive. Each Person designated by the Company pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.02 as a Person authorized to register and register transfer of the Notes is sometimes herein referred to as a "Registrar." The Trustee is hereby initially appointed as Registrar for each series of Notes.
Section 2.06.
.
Exchange and Registration of Transfer of Notes
The Company shall keep, at one of its offices or agencies maintained pursuant to Section 4.02, a register for each series of Notes issued hereunder (the registers of all Registrars being herein sometimes collectively referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall register Notes and shall register the transfer of Notes as provided in this Article 2. The Security Register shall be in written form or in any other form capable of being converted into written form within a reasonable time. At all reasonable times the Security Register shall be open for inspection by the Trustee and any Registrar other than the Trustee. Upon due presentment for registration or registration of transfer of any Note of any series at any designated office or agency, the Company shall execute and register and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in the name of the transferee or transferees a new Note or Notes of the same series for an equal aggregate principal amount. Registration or registration of transfer of any Note by any Registrar in the registry books of the Company maintained by such Registrar, and delivery of such Note, duly authenticated, shall be deemed to complete the registration or registration of transfer of such Note.
No Person shall at any time be designated as or act as a Registrar unless such Person is at such time empowered under applicable law to act as such under and to the extent required by applicable law and regulations.
All Notes presented for registration of transfer or for exchange, redemption or payment shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be duly endorsed by, or be accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer or exchange in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
No service charge shall be made for any exchange or registration of transfer of Notes, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection therewith.
 
The Company shall not be required to issue, exchange or register a transfer of (a) any Notes of any series for a period of 15 days next preceding the selection of Notes of that series to be redeemed and thereafter until the date of the mailing of a notice of redemption of Notes of that series selected for redemption, , , that the Trustee shall have no duty or responsibility with respect to issuing, exchanging or registering a transfer during such period unless and until it shall have received written notice setting forth the date which starts such 15 day period; or (b) any Notes selected, called or being called for redemption in whole or in part except, in the case of any Note to be redeemed in part, the portion thereof not so to be redeemed.
provided
however
The provisions of clauses (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7) below shall apply only to Global Notes:
(1) Each Global Note of any series authenticated under this Indenture shall be registered in the name of the Depositary designated for such Global Note or a nominee thereof and delivered to such Depositary or nominee thereof or custodian therefor, and each such Global Note shall constitute a single Note for all purposes under this Indenture.
(2) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, no Global Note of any series may be exchanged in whole or in part for Notes of such series issued in definitive form, and no transfer of a Global Note of any series in whole or in part may be registered in the name of any Person other than the Depositary for such Global Note or a nominee thereof unless (A) such Depositary (i) has notified the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue its services as Depositary for such Global Note and no successor Depositary has been appointed within 90 days after such notice or (ii) ceases to be a "clearing agency" registered under Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 when the Depositary is required to be so registered to act as the Depositary and so notifies the Company, and no successor Depositary has been appointed within 90 days after such notice, (B) the Company determines at any time that the Notes of such series shall no longer be represented by Global Notes and shall inform such Depositary for such Global Note of such determination and participants in such Depositary elect to withdraw their beneficial interests in the Notes from such Depositary, following notification by the Depositary of their right to do so, or (C) such exchange is made upon request by or on behalf of the Depositary for such Global Note in accordance with customary procedures, following the request of a Beneficial Owner seeking to exercise or enforce its rights under the Notes.
(3) Subject to clause (2) above, any exchange of a Global Note of any series for other Notes of such series may be made in whole or in part, and all such Notes issued in exchange for a Global Note or any portion thereof shall be registered in such names as the Depositary for such Global Note shall direct.
(4) Every Note of a series authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for or in lieu of, a Global Note of such series or any portion thereof shall be authenticated and delivered in the form of, and shall be, a Global Note, unless such Note is registered in the name of a Person other than the Depositary for such Global Note or a nominee thereof.
(5) Subject to the provisions of clause (7) below, the registered Holder of Notes of any series may grant proxies and otherwise authorize any Person, including Agent Members (as defined below in clause (7)) and Persons that may hold interests through Agent Members, to take any action which such Holder is entitled to take under this Indenture or such Notes.
 
(6) In the event of the occurrence of any of the events specified in clause (2) above, the Company will promptly make available to the Trustee a reasonable supply of certificated Notes of such series in definitive, fully registered form, without interest coupons.
(7) Neither any members of, or participants in, the Depositary of any series (collectively, the "Agent Members") nor any other Persons on whose behalf Agent Members may act shall have any rights under this Indenture with respect to any Global Note of such series registered in the name of the Depositary or any nominee thereof, or under any such Global Note, and the Depositary or such nominee, as the case may be, may be treated by the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee as the absolute owner and Holder of such Global Note for all purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the Company or the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by such Depositary or such nominee, as the case may be, or impair, as between such Depositary, its Agent Members and any other Person on whose behalf an Agent Member may act, the operation of customary practices of such Persons governing the exercise of the rights of a Holder of any Note.
(8) The Trustee shall have no obligation or duty to monitor, determine or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on transfer imposed under this Indenture or under applicable law with respect to any transfer of any interest in any Note (including any transfers between or among Depositary participants or beneficial owners of interests in any Global Notes) other than to require delivery of such certificates and other documentation or evidence as are expressly required by, and to do so if and when expressly required by the terms of, this Indenture, and to examine the same to determine substantial compliance as to form with the express requirements hereof.
Neither the Trustee nor any agent of the Trustee shall have any responsibility for any actions taken or not taken by the Depositary.
In case any temporary or definitive Note shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company in the case of a mutilated Note shall, and in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed Note may in its discretion, execute and, upon the written request or authorization of any Officer of the Company, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, a new Note of the same series, bearing a number not contemporaneously Outstanding, in exchange and substitution for the mutilated Note, or in lieu of and in substitution for the Note so destroyed, lost or stolen. In every case the applicant for a substituted Note shall furnish to the Company and to the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless, and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, the applicant shall also furnish to the Company and the Trustee evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of such Note and the ownership thereof.
Section 2.07.
.
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Notes
Upon the issuance of any substituted Note, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected
 
therewith. In case any Note which has matured or is about to mature shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company may, instead of issuing a substituted Note, pay or authorize the payment of the same (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated Note) if the applicant for such payment shall furnish to the Company and to the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless and, in case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee of the destruction, loss or theft of such Note and the ownership thereof.
Every replacement Note of any series issued in accordance with this Section 2.07 shall be the valid obligation of the Company, evidencing the same indebtedness as the destroyed, lost or stolen Note, and shall be entitled to all of the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with all other Notes of the same series duly issued hereunder. All Notes shall be held and owned upon the express condition that the foregoing provisions are exclusive with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) any and all other rights or remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of negotiable instruments or other securities without their surrender.
Pending the preparation of definitive Notes of any series the Company may execute and, upon receipt of a Company Order, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver temporary Notes of such series (printed, lithographed or typewritten). Temporary Notes of any series shall be issuable in any authorized denomination and substantially in the form of the definitive Notes in lieu of which they are issued, but with such omissions, insertions and variations as may be appropriate for temporary Notes, all as may be determined by the Company, as evidenced by its execution of such Notes. Every such temporary Note shall be authenticated by the Trustee upon the same conditions and in substantially the same manner, and with the same effect, as the definitive Notes in lieu of which they are issued. Without unreasonable delay the Company will execute and deliver to the Trustee definitive Notes of such series and thereupon any or all temporary Notes of such series may be surrendered in exchange therefor, at the option of the holders thereof, either at the office or agency to be designated and maintained by the Company for such purpose for that series in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.02 or at any of such other offices or agencies as may be designated and maintained by the Company for such purpose for that series in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.02, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange for such temporary Notes of such series an equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Notes of the same series. Such exchange shall be made by the Company at its own expense and without any charge therefor. Until so exchanged, the temporary Notes of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Notes of the same series authenticated and delivered hereunder.
Section 2.08.
.
Temporary Notes
All Notes surrendered for the purpose of payment, redemption, repayment, exchange or registration of transfer or for credit against any sinking fund shall, if surrendered to the Company, any Registrar, any Paying Agent or any other agent of the Company or of the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and promptly cancelled by it, or, if surrendered to the Trustee, shall be promptly cancelled by it, in accordance with its customary procedures, and no Notes shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly permitted by any of the provisions of this Indenture. The Trustee may dispose of cancelled Notes in accordance with its customary procedures and, at the written request of the Company, deliver a
Section 2.09.
.
Cancellation of Notes Paid, etc
 
certificate of such disposition to the Company or, at the written request of the Company, shall deliver cancelled Notes to the Company. If the Company shall acquire any of the Notes, however, such acquisition shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented by such Notes unless and until the same are delivered to the Trustee for cancellation. Where the Notes are held in global form, and to the extent less than all of the Notes are to be cancelled, the Registrar's notation of such cancellation on its books and records shall be deemed to satisfy any cancellation obligation.
Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.02 for Notes of any series, interest on the Notes of each series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
Section 2.10.

Computation of Interest
Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.02 for the Notes of any series evidenced thereby, every Global Note authenticated and delivered hereunder shall bear a legend in substantially the following form (or such other form as a securities exchange or Depositary may request or require):

Section 3.02.

Notice of Redemption; Partial Redemptions
Notice of redemption to the Holders of Notes of any series to be redeemed as a whole or in part at the option of the Company shall be given by mailing notice of such redemption by first class mail, postage prepaid, at least 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption to such Holders of Notes of such series at their last addresses as they shall appear in the Security Register, with a copy thereof provided by the Company to the Trustee. Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives the notice. Failure to give notice by mail, or any defect in the notice to the Holder of any Notes of such series designated for redemption as a whole or in part shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Note. The notice of redemption to each such Holder shall specify (i) the principal amount of each Note held by such Holder to be redeemed, (ii) the Redemption Date, (iii) the Redemption Price, (iv) the Place of Payment, (v) the CUSIP number relating to the Notes, (vi) that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of the Notes, (vii) whether interest, if any, accrued to the date fixed for redemption will be paid as specified in such notice and (viii) whether on and after said date interest, if any, thereon or on the portions thereof to be redeemed will cease to accrue. In case any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed and shall state that on and after the Redemption Date, upon surrender of such Note, a new Note or Notes in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued.
The notice of redemption of Notes to be redeemed at the option of the Company shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company.
On or before the Redemption Date specified in the notice of redemption given as provided in this Section 3.02, the Company will deposit with the Trustee or with one or more Paying Agents (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, set aside, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 4.05(b)) an amount of money sufficient to redeem on the Redemption Date all the Notes of such series so called for redemption at the appropriate
 
Redemption Price, together with accrued interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption. If the Company shall at any time elect to redeem all or any portion of the Notes of a series, it shall at least 5 calendar days (or such shorter period acceptable to the Trustee) prior to the date the notice of redemption is to mailed, notify the Trustee of such Redemption Date and of the principal amount of Notes to be redeemed. In case of a redemption at the election of the Company prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee, prior to the giving of any notice of redemption to Holders pursuant to this Section 3.02, an Officers' Certificate stating that such restriction has been complied with.
If less than all of the Notes of such series are to be redeemed, selection of the Notes for redemption shall be made by the Trustee as follows:
(a) if such Notes are listed on any principal national securities exchange, in compliance with the requirements of such principal national securities exchange; or
(b) if such Notes are not so listed, on a pro rata basis (subject to the procedures of DTC) or, to the extent a pro rata basis is not permitted, in such manner as the Trustee shall deem to be fair and appropriate (subject to the procedures of the Depositary).
However, no Note of $2,000 in principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part. A new Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion shall be issued upon cancellation of the original Note. Notice of the redemption shall be given only after such selection has been made. Notes may be redeemed in part in multiples equal to the minimum authorized denomination for Notes or any multiple thereof. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Notes selected for redemption and, in the case of any Notes selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Notes shall relate, in the case of any Note redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Note which has been or is to be redeemed.
Section 3.03.
.

Change of Control Offer
Within 30 days following the date upon which the Change of Control Triggering Event occurred with respect to the Notes, or at the Company's option, prior to any Change of Control but after the public announcement of the pending Change of Control, the Company will be required to send, by first class mail, a notice to each Holder of any Notes, with a copy to the Trustee, which notice will govern the terms of the Change of Control Offer. Such notice will state, among other things, the purchase date, which must be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed, other than as may be required by law (the "Change of Control Payment Date"). The notice, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, will state that the Change of Control Offer is conditioned on the Change of Control being consummated on or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date.
On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company will, to the extent lawful:
(a) accept or cause a third party to accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;
(b) deposit or cause a third party to deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered; and
(c) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted together with an Officers' Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes
 
being repurchased and that all conditions precedent to the Change of Control Offer and to the repurchase by the Company of Notes pursuant to the Change of Control Offer have been complied with.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer with respect to the Notes (i) if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for such an offer otherwise required to be made by the Company and such third party purchases all the Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer or (ii) a notice of redemption has been given to the Holders of all of the Notes in accordance with the terms of this Indenture, unless and until there is a default in payment of the Redemption Price. A Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place of the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer.
The Company will comply in all material respects with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any such securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Offer provisions of the Notes, the Company will comply with those securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control Offer provisions of the Notes by virtue of any such conflict.
The Company will not itself, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, incur, issue, assume or guarantee any notes, bonds, debentures or other similar evidences of indebtedness for money borrowed ("Debt"), secured by pledge of, or mortgage or lien on, any Principal Property of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, or any shares of stock of or Debt of any Restricted Subsidiary (such pledges, mortgages and liens being hereinafter in this Section 4.09 called "Mortgage" or "Mortgages" and such debt secured by such Mortgages being hereinafter in this Section 4.09 called "Secured Debt"), without effectively providing that the Notes of each series (together with, if the Company shall so determine, any other indebtedness of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary then existing or thereafter created which is not subordinate to the Notes) shall be secured equally and ratably with (or prior to) such Secured Debt, so long as such Secured Debt shall be so secured, unless after giving effect thereto, the aggregate amount of all such Secured Debt plus all Attributable Debt of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of any Sale and Leaseback Transaction (as defined in Section 4.10 below) would not exceed 10% of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets; , , that this Section 4.09 shall not apply to, and there shall be excluded from Secured Debt in any computation under this Section 4.09, indebtedness secured by:
