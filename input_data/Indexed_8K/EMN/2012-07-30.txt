KINGSPORT, Tenn., July 30, 2012  Eastman Chemical Company (NYSE:EMN) today announced earnings from continuing operations of $1.40 per diluted share for second quarter 2012 versus $1.44 per diluted share for second quarter 2011, excluding $33 million of financing, transaction and integration costs in second quarter 2012 related to the acquisition of Solutia and a $15 million gain in second quarter 2011 from the sale of a previously impaired asset. Reported earnings from continuing operations were $1.26 per diluted share in second quarter 2012 and $1.51 per diluted share in second quarter 2011. For reconciliation to reported company and segment earnings, see Tables 3 and 4 in the accompanying second-quarter 2012 financial tables.
"This is an exciting time for Eastman with continued strong earnings performance throughout the company and the recent completion of the Solutia acquisition," said Jim Rogers, Chairman and CEO. "The integration of Solutia is well underway and our capture of cost synergies is on plan such that we are poised to deliver earnings growth and generate significant cash for years to come."
 
 
Sales revenue for second quarter 2012 was $1.9 billion, a 2 percent decline compared with second quarter 2011.
Operating earnings in second quarter 2012 were $317 million compared to $333 million in second quarter 2011. Excluding transaction and integration costs related to the Solutia acquisition in second quarter 2012 and a gain from the sale of a previously impaired asset in second quarter 2011, operating earnings were $323 million and $318 million, respectively.
 
 
 
 
Segment Results 2Q 2012 versus 2Q 2011
 Sales revenue declined slightly in second quarter 2012 compared with second quarter 2011. Operating earnings in second quarter 2012 increased to $114 million compared with operating earnings of $104 million in second quarter 2011. The increase was primarily due to lower raw material and energy costs more than offsetting slightly lower selling prices.
Coatings, Adhesives, Specialty Polymers and Inks
Sales revenue declined by 4 percent due to an unfavorable shift in product mix that was partially offset by higher selling prices. The unfavorable shift in product mix was primarily due to lower acetate tow volume in Asia Pacific attributed to customer buying patterns. The higher selling prices were in response to higher raw material and energy costs, particularly for wood pulp. Operating earnings in second quarter 2012 were $96 million compared with $97 million in second quarter 2011, with the slight decline due to the unfavorable shift in product mix mostly offset by higher selling prices. 
Fibers
 
 Sales revenue was unchanged in second quarter 2012 compared with second quarter 2011 as higher sales volume and a favorable shift in product mix were offset by lower selling prices. The higher sales volume and favorable shift in product mix were primarily due to increased sales volume for acetyl product lines in the U.S. and the favorable impact of the acquired Sterling and Scandiflex businesses. The lower selling prices, primarily in olefin derivative product lines, were in response to lower raw material and energy costs. Operating earnings in second quarter 2012 increased to $104 million compared to $94 million in second quarter 2011. The increase was due primarily to lower raw material and energy costs and the benefit of producing versus purchasing olefins, partially offset by lower selling prices.
Performance Chemicals and Intermediates
Sales revenue declined by 6 percent in second quarter 2012 compared to second quarter 2011 primarily due to lower sales volume partially offset by a favorable shift in product mix and higher selling prices. The decrease in sales volume, mainly in the U.S. and Europe, was attributed to weakened demand for copolyester product lines primarily in the consumer and durable goods markets. The favorable shift in product mix was due to higher sales volume into the LCD market for cellulosic product lines. Second-quarter 2012 operating earnings were $38 million compared to $42 million in second quarter 2011. The decline was primarily due to lower sales volume and resulting lower capacity utilization, which was partially offset by the favorable shift in product mix and higher selling prices.

Cash Flow and Financing
 
Eastman generated $316 million in cash from operating activities during second quarter 2012, primarily due to strong net earnings.
 
As part of the financing of the July 2, 2012 acquisition of Solutia Inc. and of repayment of certain Solutia borrowings, on June 5, 2012 Eastman received $2.3 billion net proceeds from the public offering of notes due 2017, 2022, and 2042 and on July 2, 2012 borrowed $1.2 billion under a five-year term loan agreement.
Solutia Acquisition and 2Q12 Results
On July 2, 2012 Eastman completed the acquisition of Solutia Inc. With the acquisition, the company made structural and reporting changes resulting in five reporting segments: Additives and Functional Products, Adhesives and Plasticizers, Advanced Materials, Fibers, and Specialty Fluids and Intermediates. The company will report third quarter 2012 financial results under the new reporting structure.
Sales revenue for Solutia in second quarter 2012 was $520 million, a 4 percent decline compared with second quarter 2011, due primarily to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the euro. In addition, slightly higher sales volume in the Technical Specialties and Performance Films segments was more than offset by lower sales volume in the Advanced Interlayers segment. Net income was $31 million in second quarter 2012 including $15 million of acquisition related expenses, and $68 million in second quarter 2011 including $1 million of other charges. Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in Appendix A) declined to $115 million in second quarter 2012 compared with $141 million in second quarter 2011. The decline in adjusted EBTIDA, primarily in the Advanced Interlayers segment, was mainly due to lower sales volume in Europe for Saflex product lines, lower sales volume for photovoltaic encapsulants product lines, and costs of growth initiatives. For reconciliation of adjusted EBTIDA, see Appendix A in the accompanying second-quarter 2012 financial tables.
Outlook
 
Commenting on the outlook for full year 2012, Rogers said: "Despite persistent global economic uncertainty, we continue to expect double-digit year-over-year earnings growth resulting from the solid performance of heritage Eastman businesses and second half earnings from the acquired Solutia businesses. As a result, our expectations for 2012 EPS of $5.30 remain unchanged." Costs and charges related to the Solutia acquisition, including financing, transaction, and integration costs, asset impairments and restructuring charges, net, and mark-to-market pension and OPEB adjustments are excluded from the earnings per share projection.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION
July 30, 2012
For use in the Eastman Chemical Company Conference Call
at 8:00 AM (EDT), July 31, 2012
.
 
The Company completed the sale of the polyethylene terephthalate ("PET") business, related assets at the Columbia, South Carolina, site, and technology of its Performance Polymers segment on January 31, 2011.  The PET business, assets, and technology sold were substantially all of the Performance Polymers segment.  Performance Polymers segment operating results are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented and are therefore not included in results from continuing operations under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP").
On July 2, 2012, the Company completed its acquisition of Solutia Inc. ("Solutia"), a global leader in performance materials and specialty chemicals.  In the acquisition, each outstanding share of Solutia common stock was cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive $22.00 in cash and 0.12 shares of Eastman common stock.  The total purchase price was $4.8 billion, including the assumption of Solutia's debt and net of cash.  The funding of the $2.6 billion cash portion of the purchase price was provided primarily from borrowings.  Beginning with third quarter 2012, the Company's consolidated results of operations will include results of Solutia.
 
As previously disclosed in the Form 8-K filed on March 7, 2012, Eastman elected to change its method of accounting for actuarial gains and losses for its pension and other postretirement benefit ("OPEB") plans to a more preferable method permitted under GAAP.  The new method recognizes actuarial gains and losses in the Company's operating results in the year in which the gains and losses occur rather than amortizing them over future periods.  Eastman management believes that this change in accounting improves transparency of reporting of its operating results by recognizing the effects of economic and interest rate trends on pension and OPEB plan investments and assumptions in the year these actuarial gains and losses are incurred.  Under the new method of accounting, these gains and losses are measured annually at the plan's December 31 measurement date and recorded as a mark-to-market ("MTM") adjustment during the fourth quarter of each year.  Any interim remeasurements triggered by a curtailment, settlement, or significant plan changes will be recognized as an MTM adjustment in the quarter in which such remeasurement event occurs.  This methodology is preferable under GAAP since it aligns more closely with fair value principles and does not delay the recognition of gains and losses into future periods.  The new method has been retrospectively applied to financial results of all periods presented.  In first quarter 2011, the Company recognized a $15 million gain under the new accounting method due to the interim remeasurement of the OPEB plan obligation.  The exit of employees associated with the sale of the PET business triggered the interim MTM remeasurement.
In third quarter 2011, the Company's Board of Directors declared a two-for-one split of the Company's common stock in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend.  Stockholders of record as of September 15, 2011 were issued one additional share of common stock on October 3, 2011 for each share held.  Treasury shares were treated as shares outstanding in the stock split.  All shares and per share amounts have been adjusted for all periods presented for the stock split.
