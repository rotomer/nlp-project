Eastman Announces Third-Quarter 2012 Financial Results
KINGSPORT, Tenn., Oct. 25, 2012 - Eastman Chemical Company (NYSE:EMN) today announced earnings from continuing operations, excluding the items described in Table 4 of the accompanying third-quarter 2012 financial tables, of $1.57 per diluted share for third quarter 2012 versus $1.26 per diluted share for third quarter 2011. Reported earnings from continuing operations were $0.99 per diluted share in third quarter 2012 and $1.22 per diluted share in third quarter 2011.
Our record performance after the Solutia acquisition reaffirms our confidence that we will continue to deliver year-over-year earnings growth, said Jim Rogers, chairman and CEO. Results were solid throughout the company, demonstrating the strength and diversity of our businesses in what remains a challenging global economic environment. Cash generation was also strong in the quarter, and we are on track to generate strong free cash flow for years to come.
*
See Solutia Acquisition paragraph below and Table 2 in the accompanying third-quarter 2012 financial tables.
**
For reconciliation to reported company and segment earnings, see Tables 3 and 4 in the accompanying third-quarter 2012 financial tables.
Sales revenue for third quarter 2012 was $2.3 billion, a 25 percent increase compared with third quarter 2011. Third-quarter 2012 included sales revenue from the acquired Solutia businesses. Pro forma combined sales revenue declined 3 percent due to lower selling prices partially offset by higher sales volume. The lower selling prices were primarily due to lower raw material and energy costs.
Operating earnings in third quarter 2012 were $263 million compared to $271 million in third quarter 2011.  Excluding costs related to the Solutia acquisition and asset impairments and restructuring charges, third-quarter 2012 operating earnings were $397 million compared to $278 million in third quarter 2011. Third-quarter 2012 included operating earnings from the acquired Solutia businesses. Pro forma combined operating earnings, excluding costs related to the Solutia acquisition and asset impairments and restructuring charges, were $397 million in third quarter 2012 compared with $359 million in third quarter 2011. Pro forma combined operating earnings increased due to lower raw material and energy costs and higher sales volume, partially offset by lower selling prices.
Segment Results 3Q 2012 versus 3Q 2011
Additives & Functional Products
- Third-quarter 2012 included sales revenue and operating earnings from the acquired Solutia rubber materials product lines. Pro forma combined sales revenue declined slightly as higher sales volume was offset by lower selling prices. The higher sales volume was primarily in the solvents product lines and attributed to strengthened coatings demand in the U.S. and competitor manufacturing outages. The lower selling prices were in response to lower raw material and energy costs primarily in the solvents product lines. Third-quarter 2012 operating earnings included $19 million of additional costs of acquired Solutia inventories. Excluding these costs, pro forma combined operating earnings in third quarter 2012 increased to $105 million compared with operating earnings of $84 million in third quarter 2011 primarily due to higher sales volume and lower raw material and energy costs, which more than offset lower selling prices.
Adhesives & Plasticizers
-
Sales revenue was unchanged in third quarter 2012 compared to third quarter 2011 as higher sales volume was offset by lower selling prices. The higher sales volume was attributed to the continued substitution of phthalate plasticizers with non-phthalate plasticizers. Lower selling prices were primarily in response to lower raw material and energy costs. Operating earnings in third quarter 2012 increased to $73 million compared to $61 million in third quarter 2011 primarily due to higher sales volume and lower raw material and energy costs, which more than offset lower selling prices.
Advanced Materials
- Third-quarter 2012 included sales revenue and operating earnings from the acquired Solutia advanced interlayers and performance films product lines. Pro forma combined sales revenue was unchanged. Operating earnings in third quarter 2012 included $39 million of additional costs of acquired Solutia inventories. Excluding these costs, pro forma combined operating earnings decreased to $57 million in third quarter 2012 from $63 million in third quarter 2011 due to lower sales volume in Europe for advanced interlayers product lines and lower capacity utilization.
Fibers -
Sales revenue increased primarily due to higher selling prices in response to higher raw material and energy costs, particularly for wood pulp. Operating earnings were $98 million in both periods as higher selling prices were mostly offset by higher raw material and energy costs.
Specialty Fluids & Intermediates
- Third-quarter 2012 included sales revenue and operating earnings from the acquired Solutia specialty fluids product lines. Pro forma combined sales revenue declined as lower selling prices were partially offset by higher sales volume. The lower selling prices, primarily for olefin derivative products, were in response to lower raw material and energy costs, particularly for propane and ethane. Operating earnings in third quarter 2012 included $17 million of additional costs of acquired Solutia inventories. Excluding these costs and $7 million in restructuring charges, primarily for severance associated with the acquisition and integration of Sterling, pro forma combined operating earnings in third quarter 2012 increased to $96 million compared to $76 million in third quarter 2011. The increase was primarily due to lower raw material and energy costs and the benefit of producing versus purchasing olefins, partially offset by lower selling prices.
Cash Flow
Eastman generated $353 million in cash from operating activities during third-quarter 2012, primarily due to strong net earnings.
Outlook
Commenting on the outlook for full year 2012, Rogers said: The global economic environment remains challenging as we enter the seasonally slower fourth-quarter. We also anticipate higher raw material and energy costs toward the end of the year. However, given our current outlook of a stable economy we expect our business will continue to demonstrate strength as it has throughout the year. We are therefore raising our full year 2012 expectation slightly to earnings per share of between $5.30 and $5.40. Solutia and other acquisition costs and charges, including financing, transaction, integration, and inventory costs, asset impairments and restructuring charges, net, and mark-to-market pension and OPEB adjustments are excluded from the earnings per share projection.
Solutia Acquisition
On July 2, 2012, the company completed the acquisition of Solutia Inc. Beginning third-quarter 2012, the company changed its reportable segments due to changes in the company's organization resulting from the Solutia acquisition. This news release includes a comparison of third-quarter 2012 and third-quarter 2011 results on a pro forma combined basis. The pro forma combined information assumes the acquisition of Solutia on January 1, 2011. For selected pro forma combined segment information, see the company's Current Report on Form 8-K furnished with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 15, 2012.
As required by purchase accounting, the acquired Solutia inventories were marked to fair value. These inventories were sold in third quarter 2012 resulting in a one-time $75 million increase in cost of sales, net of the LIFO impact of these inventories.
Third-quarter 2012 results of operations also included $22 million of Solutia acquisition and integration costs and $28 million of severance charges associated with the acquisition and integration of Solutia.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION

For use in the Eastman Chemical Company Conference Call

Table of Contents
The Company completed the sale of the polyethylene terephthalate ("PET") business, related assets at the Columbia, South Carolina, site, and technology of its Performance Polymers segment on January 31, 2011.  The PET business, assets, and technology sold were substantially all of the Performance Polymers segment.  Performance Polymers segment operating results are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented and are therefore not included in results from continuing operations under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP").
On July 2, 2012, the Company completed its acquisition of Solutia Inc. ("Solutia"), a global leader in performance materials and specialty chemicals.  In the acquisition, each outstanding share of Solutia common stock was cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive $22.00 in cash and 0.12 shares of Eastman common stock.  In total, 14.7 million shares of Eastman common stock were issued in the transaction.  The fair value of total consideration transferred was approximately $4.8 billion, consisting of cash of $2.6 billion, net of cash acquired; equity in the form of Eastman stock of approximately $700 million; and the assumption and subsequent repayment of Solutia's debt at fair value of approximately $1.5 billion. Beginning with third quarter 2012, the Company's consolidated results of operations include results of Solutia. For selected pro forma combined segment information, see the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K furnished with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 15, 2012.
 
As previously disclosed in the Form 8-K furnished on March 7, 2012, Eastman elected to change its method of accounting for actuarial gains and losses for its pension and other postretirement benefit ("OPEB") plans to a more preferable method permitted under GAAP.  The new method recognizes actuarial gains and losses in the Company's operating results in the year in which the gains and losses occur rather than amortizing them over future periods.  Under the new method of accounting, these gains and losses are measured annually at the plan's December 31 measurement date and recorded as a mark-to-market ("MTM") adjustment during the fourth quarter of each year.  Any interim remeasurements triggered by a curtailment, settlement, or significant plan changes will be recognized as an MTM adjustment in the quarter in which such remeasurement event occurs.  The new method has been retrospectively applied to financial results of all periods presented.  In first quarter 2011, the Company recognized a $15 million gain under the new accounting method due to the interim remeasurement of the OPEB plan obligation.  The exit of employees associated with the sale of the PET business triggered the interim MTM remeasurement.
