Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure. The following information is furnished pursuant to Regulation FD. EMERSON GAAP UNDERLYING ORDERS - 13 MONTH SUMMARY (PERCENT CHANGE. TRAILING 3-MONTH AVERAGE VERSUS PRIOR YEAR.) April`02 Order Comments: April order patterns indicate a modest recovery is underway. Industrial Automation orders reflect restrained but stable spending in the North American and European industrial goods markets. The improvement from prior months is helped by easier year-over-year comparisons. HVAC orders reflect the recent upturn in U.S. residential air conditioning orders. Inventory levels at both OEMs and distributors remain at historically low levels. Electronics and Telecom orders reflect the broad weakness in the computing and telecom equipment markets with some improvement in the OEM business. Year-over-year comparisons have also become easier. Appliance and Tools orders reflect strength in appliance components and storage solutions offset by soft demand in tools. Process orders continue to reflect lower short-cycle maintenance and repair activity due to a slowdown in capital spending. Large oil and gas projects remain strong, and new project award activity, yet to be included in orders, has also been strong.
SIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized. EMERSON ELECTRIC CO. (Registrant) Date: May 28, 2002 By: /s/ H. M. Smith __________________________ H. M. Smith Assistant Secretary
