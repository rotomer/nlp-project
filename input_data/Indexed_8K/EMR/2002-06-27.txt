Emerson GAAP Underlying Orders - 13 Month Summary
May orders continue to recover which should support sequential improvement in quarterly results. The pace of the recovery continues to be gradual.
Industrial Automation orders reflect restrained but stable spending in the North American and European industrial goods markets.
HVAC orders reflect the recent upturn in U.S. residential air conditioning orders.
Electronics and Telecom orders reflect the broad weakness in the computing and telecom equipment markets with some improvement in the OEM business. Yearoveryear comparisons have also become easier.
Appliance and Tools orders reflect strength in storage solutions offset by soft demand in tools.
Process orders continue to reflect lower shortcycle maintenance and repair activity due to a slowdown in capital spending. Orders for systems continue to increase, and new project award activity, yet to be included in orders, has been strong.
        Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
