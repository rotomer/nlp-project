(Percent change. Trailing 3-month average versus prior year.)
Emerson GAAP Underlying Orders - 13 Month Summary
July'02 Order Comments:
In line with expectations, July orders continue to recover with the help of easier prior year comparisons.
Industrial Automation orders reflect restrained but stable spending in the North American and European industrial goods markets.
HVAC orders reflect the recent upturn in U.S. residential air conditioning orders and easier prior year comparisons.     Last year HVAC orders fell in July as OEM's began to reduce inventory levels.
Electronics and Telecom orders reflect the broad weakness in the computing and telecom equipment markets with some improvement in the OEM business.
Appliance and Tools orders reflect strength in storage solutions and motors offset by soft demand in tools.
Process orders continue to reflect lower short-cycle maintenance and repair activity due to a slowdown in capital spending. Orders for systems continue to increase, and new project award activity, yet to be included in orders, has been strong.
        Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
