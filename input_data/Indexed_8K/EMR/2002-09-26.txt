Emerson GAAP Underlying Orders  13 Month Summary
August`02 Order Comments:
In line with expectations, August orders reflect recent stable demand trends.
Industrial Automation orders continue to be impacted by restrained spending in the North American and European industrial goods markets.
HVAC orders are benefiting from the upturn in U.S. residential air conditioning orders and easier prior year comparisons.
Electronics and Telecom orders reflect continued weakness in the computing and telecom equipment markets.
Appliance and Tools orders reflect strength in consumer storage and motors offset by soft demand in tools.
Process orders reflect lower short-cycle maintenance and repair activity due to the slowdown in capital spending. Long-cycle large project activity continues to be strong.
