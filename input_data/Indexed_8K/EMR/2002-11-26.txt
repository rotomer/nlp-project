Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure
     The following information is furnished pursuant to Regulation FD.
Emerson GAAP Underlying Orders  13 Month Summary
(Percent change. Trailing 3-month average versus prior year.)
October02 Order Comments:
October orders were driven by continued strength in the consumer businesses, offset by weaknesses in the industrial and telecommunications markets -- there is no recovery in capital spending as our customers remain cautious.
Industrial Automation orders continue to be impacted by restrained spending in the North American and European industrial goods markets.
HVAC orders are benefiting from the low customer inventory levels.
In electronics and telecommunications, order activity in the OEM businesses continues to remain positive, offset by weakness in the telecommunications market.
Appliance and Tools orders were impacted primarily by continued increases in the consumer housing-related businesses.
Process orders continue to reflect lower short-cycle maintenance and repair activity due to the slowdown in capital spending.
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
