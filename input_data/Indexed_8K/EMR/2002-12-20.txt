HVAC orders are benefiting from the low customer inventory levels and a continued good North America housing market.
In Electronics and Telecommunications, order activity in the OEM businesses continues to remain positive, offset by weakness in the telecommunications market.
Appliance and Tools orders were impacted by increases in the consumer housing-related businesses.
Process orders were driven by strength in the systems business offset by reductions in short cycle orders.
