Emerson GAAP Underlying Orders - 3 Month Summary
January'03 Order Comments:
January orders were impacted by favorable currency and reflect strength in the consumer businesses, offset by weaknesses in the telecommunications and industrial capital markets. Underlying trends are still in the +2% to -2% range. North America and Europe continue to be weak from the impact of the potential war uncertainty and lower capital spending levels. The currency impact is approximately 3% to 5% on most segments and in total, but approximately 8% in process.
Process orders were driven by strength in the systems and solutions businesses. Short-cycle orders continue to be sluggish.
Industrial Automation orders reflect stability in the industrial goods markets.
Electronics and Telecommunications order activity in the OEM businesses continues to remain positive, offset by weakness in the telecommunications market.
HVAC orders are benefiting from the good North America housing market and order strength in Asia.
Appliance and Tools orders were impacted by increases in the consumer housing and commercial storage related businesses. The industrial businesses remain weak.
        Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
