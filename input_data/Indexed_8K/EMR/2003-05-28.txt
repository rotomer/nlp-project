Process orders reflect strength in the systems business worldwide, offset by broad weaknesses in North America.
Industrial Automation orders reflect steady demand in most industrial goods markets offset by softness in North America.
Electronics and Telecommunications orders continue to weaken due to more cautious computer and telecommunications markets.
HVAC orders indicate stable demand in the U.S., Europe and Asia.
Appliance and Tools orders weakened, reflecting softness in the industrial and appliance markets in North America.
