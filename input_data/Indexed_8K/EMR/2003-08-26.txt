Emerson GAAP Underlying Orders  3 Month Summary

Favorable currency exchange rates positively affected July orders approximately 3 to 4 percent. Underlying trends (excluding currency, acquisitions, and divestitures) continued to improve and were flat for the three-month period.
Process orders were impacted by softness in North American and short-cycle orders.
Industrial Automation orders reflect steady international demand in most industrial goods markets offset by weakness in North America. While orders at GAAP have slowed, the underlying trend during the quarter continued to improve.
Electronics and Telecommunications orders turned positive with favorable trends in the OEM business and strength in the systems business.
HVAC orders reflect increases in North America and continued strength in China and the rest of Asia.
Appliance and Tools orders reflect softness in the commercial businesses and mixed results in the consumer related businesses.
