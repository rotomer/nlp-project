January 04 Order Comments
Favorable currency exchange rates positively affected January orders approximately 5.5 percent. Underlying orders excluding currency increased slightly compared to the prior month's average in part due to the United States.
Process orders reflect continued growth in Asia and Europe as well as strong growth in systems and solutions, which are longer lead time items.
Industrial Automation orders reflect positive trends in industrial equipment, motors and controls, and power generation (alternators).
Strength in the Electronics and Telecommunications segment was driven by improvements in the OEM business and the systems business.
HVAC orders reflect strength in the U.S. market as well as in Asia.
While orders in the Appliance and Tools segment slowed, the underlying trend excluding currency improved with growth in motors and appliances, tools, and residential storage.
