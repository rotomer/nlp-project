Emerson GAAP Underlying Orders  3 Month Summary
April 04 Order Comments:
Underlying orders accelerated driven by solid demand across the company, particularly in the HVAC, Industrial Automation, and Electronics and Telecommunications markets. Favorable currency exchange rates contributed approximately 3.5 percentage points, and the impact from currency should continue to be less going forward.
Process orders reflect increases in measurement products, valves and regulators and solid growth in Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Middle East.
Orders in Industrial Automation accelerated with increased demand in the United States and continued strength in industrial motors and power generation (alternators).
The Electronics and Telecommunications segment was driven by strength in the OEM and systems businesses and in Asia, as well as solid demand in the U.S. market.
HVAC orders reflect continued gains worldwide and strength in the U.S. market.
The Appliance and Tools segment showed strength across nearly every business in the consumer and professional markets.
        Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
