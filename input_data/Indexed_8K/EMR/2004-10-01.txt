            WITNESSETH THAT:
            WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company ("Board of Directors") has adopted the Emerson Electric Co. 1998 Stock Option Plan (the "Plan") pursuant to which options covering an aggregate of 8,000,000 shares of the Common Stock of the Company may be granted to key employees of the Company and its subsidiaries; and
            WHEREAS, the person to whom this option is granted ("Optionee") is a key employee of the Company or a subsidiary; and
            WHEREAS, the Company desires to grant to Optionee the option to purchase certain shares of its stock under the terms of the Plan, which option is intended to qualify as an incentive stock option within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (hereinafter referred to as an "Incentive Stock Option"); and
            WHEREAS, Optionee agrees and acknowledges that the grant of said option is valuable consideration; and
            WHEREAS, Optionee has executed the attached Notice of Grant of Stock Options and Option Agreement (the "Notice Agreement") verifying Optionee's agreement to and acceptance of all of the terms and conditions set forth herein;
            NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the mutual agreements hereinafter set forth, it is covenanted and agreed as follows:
            1.        . This option is granted under and is expressly subject to, all the terms and provisions of the Plan, which terms are incorporated herein by reference. The Compensation and Human Resources Committee ("Committee") of the Board of Directors has been appointed by the Board of Directors, and designated by it, as the Committee to make grants of options.
Grant Subject to Plan
            2.        . Pursuant to action of the Committee, the Company hereby grants to Optionee the option to purchase all or any part of the number of shares of the Common Stock of the Company, par value of $.50 per share ("Common Stock") set forth in the Notice Agreement for a period of ten (10) years from the date hereof, at the purchase price designated in the Notice Agreement; provided, however, the right to exercise such option shall be, and is hereby, restricted so that the shares to which this option relates may not be purchased prior to the Vesting Date assigned to each of the shares as set forth in the Notice Agreement. The foregoing right to exercise is subject to the provisions of Section 6 hereof. Notwithstanding the
Grant and Terms of Option
foregoing, in the event of a Change of Control (as hereinafter defined) Optionee may purchase 100% of the total number of shares to which this option relates. In no event may this option or any part thereof be exercised after the expiration of ten (10) years from the date hereof. The purchase price of the shares subject to the option may be paid for (a) in cash, (b) in the discretion of the Committee, by tender, either actually or by attestation, to the Company of shares of Common Stock already owned by Optionee and registered in his name or held for his benefit by a registered holder, having a fair market value equal to the cash exercise price of the option being exercised, or (c) in the discretion of the Committee, by a combination of methods of payment specified in clauses (a) and (b), all in accordance with Paragraph 7 of the Plan. No shares of Common Stock may be tendered in exercise of this option if such shares were acquired by Optionee through the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option or an employee stock purchase plan described in Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, unless (a) such shares have been held by Optionee for at least one (1) year, and (b) at least two (2) years have elapsed since such Incentive Stock Option was granted. For the purposes of this Agreement, a Change of Control means:
            3.        . In the event that, during the term of this Agreement, there is any change in the number of shares of outstanding Common Stock by reason of stock dividends, recapitalizations, mergers, consolidations, split-offs, split-ups, combinations or exchanges of shares and the like, the number of shares covered by this option agreement and the price thereof shall be adjusted, to the same proportionate number of shares and price as in this original agreement.
Anti-Dilution Provisions
            4.        . If the shares subject to the Plan are not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, Optionee acknowledges that a restrictive legend, in substantially the following form, will be printed on the certificates representing the shares acquired by Optionee on exercise of all or any part of this option:
Investment Purpose
            5.        . Neither the option hereby granted nor any rights thereunder or under this Agreement may be assigned, transferred or in any manner encumbered except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and any attempted assignment, transfer, mortgage, pledge or encumbrance except as herein authorized, shall be void and of no effect. The option may be exercised during Optionee's lifetime only by Optionee.
Non-Transferability
            6.        . In the event that notice of employment termination is provided by Optionee, which notice shall be deemed termination of employment of Optionee, or in the event of the termination of employment of Optionee for any reason, other than by death which is subject to Section 7 herein, the Plan shall govern whether and the extent to which the option granted may be exercised; provided, that if Optionee exercises this option while employed by a joint venture of the Company or of a subsidiary and after more than three (3) months after transfer of employment from the Company or a subsidy to such joint venture, this option shall not be an Incentive Stock Option under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. For purposes of this Section, a divestiture by the Company of 100% of its interest in Optionee's employer shall constitute a termination of employment of Optionee.
Termination of Employment
            7.        . In the event of the death of Optionee while Optionee is employed by the Company (or a subsidiary, affiliate or joint venture) or after termination of employment to the extent an option is still exercisable under Section 6 of this Agreement, the
Death of Optionee
option theretofore granted may be exercised, to the extent exercisable at the date of death, by a legatee or legatees under the option holder's last will, or by personal representatives or distributees, at any time within a period of one (1) year after death, but not after ten (10) years from the date of granting thereof.
            8.        . It is the intention of the Company that on any exercise of this option it will transfer to Optionee shares of its authorized but unissued stock or transfer Treasury shares, or utilize any combination of Treasury shares and authorized but unissued shares, to satisfy its obligations to deliver shares on any exercise hereof.
Shares Issued on Exercise of Option
            9.        . This option has been granted pursuant to a determination made by the Committee, and such Committee or any successor or substitute committee authorized by the Board of Directors or the Board of Directors itself, subject to the express terms of this option, shall have plenary authority to interpret any provision of this option and to make any determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of this option and the exercise of the rights herein granted, and may waive or amend any provisions hereof in any manner not adversely affecting the rights granted to Optionee by the express terms hereof.
Committee Administration
            10.        . The option granted hereunder is intended to be, and will be treated as, an Incentive Stock Option.

            11.        . Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be considered or construed as creating a contract of employment for any specified period of time. The employment relationship shall continue to be at the will of both parties, either of which may terminate the employment relationship at any time for any reason.

All Company records, documents and information obtained by or provided to Optionee, or to which Optionee has or had access, or otherwise made, produced or compiled by Optionee during Optionee's employment with the Company, which contain any Confidential Information, regardless of the medium in which it is preserved, are the sole and exclusive property of the Company and shall be given to the Company at the Company's request or upon Optionee's departure from the Company.
                         (b)        All ideas, inventions, discoveries, patents, patent applications, continuation-in-part patent applications, divisional patent applications, technology, copyrights, derivative works, trademarks, service marks, improvements, developments, trade secrets, other intellectual property and the like, which are developed, conceived, created, discovered, learned, produced and/or otherwise generated by Optionee, whether individually or otherwise, during Optionee's employment with the Company, whether or not during working hours, that relate to

Optionee shall prepare, keep and maintain detailed and current dated and witnessed records of all of Optionee's inventions, and shall disclose the details of such inventions to the Company.

                         (d)        Optionee agrees that the restrictions in this Section 12 are reasonable and should be fully enforceable in light of (among other things) Optionee's duties and responsibilities with the Company.
            13.        . Any word, phrase, clause, sentence or other provision hereof which violates or is prohibited by any applicable law, court decree or public policy shall be modified as necessary to avoid the violation or prohibition and so as to make this Agreement enforceable as fully as possible under applicable law, and if such cannot be so modified the same shall be ineffective to the extent of such violation or prohibition without invalidating or affecting the remaining provisions hereof.

Investment Purpose
            5.        . Neither the option hereby granted nor any rights thereunder or under this Agreement may be assigned, transferred or in any manner encumbered except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and any attempted assignment, transfer, mortgage, pledge or encumbrance except as herein authorized, shall be void and of no effect.

By your signature and the Company's signature below, you and the Company agree that these options are granted under and governed by the terms and conditions of the Company's Stock Option Plan as amended and the Option Agreement, all of which are attached and made a part of this document.
            WITNESSETH THAT:
            WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company ("Board of Directors") has adopted the Emerson Electric Co. 2001 Stock Option Plan (the "Plan") pursuant to which options covering an aggregate of ten million (10,000,000) shares of the Common Stock of the Company may be granted to key employees of the Company and its subsidiaries; and
            WHEREAS, the person to whom this option is granted ("Optionee") is a key employee of the Company or a subsidiary; and
            WHEREAS, the Company desires to grant to Optionee the option to purchase certain shares of its stock under the terms of the Plan, which option is not intended to qualify as an incentive stock option within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (hereinafter referred to as an "Incentive Stock Option"); and
            WHEREAS, Optionee agrees and acknowledges that the grant of said option is valuable consideration; and
            WHEREAS, Optionee has executed the attached Notice of Grant of Stock Options and Option Agreement (the "Notice Agreement") verifying Optionee's agreement to and acceptance of all of the terms and conditions set forth herein;
            NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the mutual agreements hereinafter set forth, it is covenanted and agreed as follows:
            1.        . This option is granted under and is expressly subject to, all the terms and provisions of the Plan, which terms are incorporated herein by reference. The Compensation and Human Resources Committee ("Committee") of the Board of Directors has been appointed by the Board of Directors, and designated by it, as the Committee to make grants of options.
Grant Subject to Plan
            2.        . Pursuant to action of the Committee, the Company hereby grants to Optionee the option to purchase all or any part of the number of shares of the Common Stock of the Company, par value of $.50 per share ("Common Stock") set forth in the Notice Agreement for a period of ten (10) years from the date hereof, at the purchase price designated in the Notice Agreement; provided, however, the right to exercise such option shall be, and is hereby, restricted so that the shares to which this option relates may not be purchased prior to the Vesting Date assigned to each of the shares as set forth in the Notice Agreement. The foregoing right to exercise is subject to the provisions of Section 6 hereof. Notwithstanding the
Grant and Terms of Option
foregoing, in the event of a Change of Control (as hereinafter defined) Optionee may purchase 100% of the total number of shares to which this option relates. In no event may this option or any part thereof be exercised after the expiration of ten (10) years from the date hereof. The purchase price of the shares subject to the option may be paid for (a) in cash, (b) in the discretion of the Committee, by tender, either actually or by attestation, to the Company of shares of Common Stock already owned by Optionee and registered in his name or held for his benefit by a registered holder, having a fair market value equal to the cash exercise price of the option being exercised, or (c) in the discretion of the Committee, by a combination of methods of payment specified in clauses (a) and (b), all in accordance with Paragraph 7 of the Plan. No shares of Common Stock may be tendered in exercise of this option if such shares were acquired by Optionee through the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option or an employee stock purchase plan described in Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, unless (a) such shares have been held by Optionee for at least one (1) year, and (b) at least two (2) years have elapsed since such Incentive Stock Option was granted. For the purposes of this Agreement, a Change of Control means:
            3.        . In the event that, during the term of this Agreement, there is any change in the number of shares of outstanding Common Stock by reason of stock dividends, recapitalizations, mergers, consolidations, split-offs, split-ups, combinations or exchanges of shares and the like, the number of shares covered by this option agreement and the price thereof shall be adjusted, to the same proportionate number of shares and price as in this original agreement.
Anti-Dilution Provisions
            4.        . If the shares subject to the Plan are not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, Optionee acknowledges that a restrictive legend, in substantially the following form, will be printed on the certificates representing the shares acquired by Optionee on exercise of all or any part of this option:

The option may be exercised during Optionee's lifetime only by Optionee.
Non-Transferability
            6.        . In the event that notice of employment termination is provided by Optionee, which notice shall be deemed termination of employment of Optionee, or in the event of the termination of employment of Optionee for any reason, other than by death which is subject to Section 7 herein, the Plan shall govern whether and the extent to which the option granted may be exercised. For purposes of this Section, a divestiture by the Company of 100% of its interest in Optionee's employer shall constitute a termination of employment of Optionee.
Termination of Employment
            7.        . In the event of the death of Optionee while Optionee is employed by the Company (or a subsidiary, affiliate or joint venture) or after termination of employment to the extent an option is still exercisable under Section 6 of this Agreement, the option theretofore granted may be exercised, to the extent exercisable at the date of death, by a legatee or legatees under the option holder's last will, or by personal representatives or distributees, at any time within a period of one (1) year after death, but not after ten (10) years from the date of granting thereof.
Death of Optionee
            8.        . It is the intention of the Company that on any exercise of this option it will transfer to Optionee shares of its authorized but unissued stock or transfer Treasury shares, or utilize any combination of Treasury shares and authorized but unissued shares, to satisfy its obligations to deliver shares on any exercise hereof.

Exhibit 10.6
                    The Committee has awarded to you ______ (_____) Restricted Shares under the terms of the Plan. This award is subject to all the terms of the Plan, a copy of which has been delivered to you. The Restriction Period applicable to these Shares is             years from the date hereof.
                    The following are additional terms, conditions and provisions applicable to this award:
                     1.        Your rights in regard to these Shares are not vested, and you understand and agree, by your signature to this agreement, that your entire interest in these Shares may be forfeited if you fail to remain in the employ of the Company (or one of its subsidiaries) for the full term of the Restriction Period or in the event of any failure of any of the terms or conditions attached to this award and set out in the Plan or in this Agreement.
                     2.        Specifically, the Shares shall not vest in you until the expiration of the Restriction Period and shall be wholly forfeited in the event of your resignation or discharge prior to such time; provided, however, in the event of any termination on account of death or any disability which in the determination of the Committee prevents
your continued employment by the Company (or a subsidiary), the award of shares will be prorated for your period of service during the Restriction Period and, provided you are not otherwise in default hereunder, you or your estate will receive such prorated number of Shares free of any restriction; provided further, however, in the event of a termination of your employment prior to the expiration of the Restriction Period, other than on account of your death or disability, the Committee, in its absolute discretion, may make such pro rata or other payment (or no payment) as it may determine.
                     3.        During the Restriction Period the Restricted Shares will be evidenced by a certificate issued in your name but such certificate will not be delivered to you and shall be held by the Company until the expiration of the Restriction Period or until earlier forfeiture. During the Restriction Period (and prior to any forfeiture) your rights in respect of the Shares shall be as follows.
                               (i)        You will be entitled to receive cash dividends when paid on the Shares and you will be entitled to vote the Shares.
                               (ii)        During the Restriction Period you shall not be entitled to delivery of any stock certificate evidencing the Shares.
                               (iii)        The certificates for the Share may have imprinted thereon such restrictive legends, and such stop-transfer orders, dividend payment orders and such other orders as may be given in respect thereof by the Committee as it may determine in its sole discretion.
                               (iv)        During the Restriction Period you may not sell, transfer, pledge, exchange, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of any of the Shares.
                               (v)        Stock dividends paid on the Restricted Shares shall not be paid to you but shall be held by the Company on the same terms as the Restricted Shares on which they were paid; provided, however, the Committee in its discretion may direct the payment of any such stock dividends directly to you, free of the restriction imposed by this Agreement.
                     4.        You understand that this award is confidential and that the dissemination of any information concerning the fact of this award or of any information relating to this award to any person or persons within or without the Company (including its officers and any of your superiors or subordinates) would be, or might be, injurious to the interests of the Company. Accordingly, you agree that you will maintain in confidence and will reveal to no one the fact that you have received this award nor any information concerning this award, except as you may be required by law to make any such disclosure. You further agree that any breach of this agreement of confidentiality (before or after the Restriction Period) will constitute good cause for the termination of your employment by the Company (or a subsidiary, as the case my be). You further understand that if such breach occurs during the Restriction Period applicable to your Restricted Shares your right to such Shares may be forfeited by the Company forthwith.
                     5.        By your acceptance of this award you agree that should your employment by Emerson Electric Co. or a subsidiary thereof terminate for any reason (either before or after the Restriction Period) you will not engage in any business activity competitive to any business activity of Emerson or its subsidiaries in which you were engaged while you were employed by Emerson or a subsidiary thereof, or solicit or hire
any Emerson employees. This restriction is applicable only in those geographic areas in which Emerson is then engaged in such business activity, and shall continue for a period of two (2) years after termination of your employment.
                     6.        At the end of the Restriction Period, the Restricted Shares which have not been forfeited, together with any cash held on account of dividends on such Restricted Shares, shall be delivered to you, except that the Company shall withhold sufficient Shares and cash to enable it to satisfy its federal, state and local tax withholding obligations on account of such delinquency.
                     7.        This Agreement shall be executed and delivered by you in the City or County of St. Louis, Missouri and shall be governed by Missouri law.
                     Counsel for the Company has advised that in the opinion of such counsel,
                               (i)        The receipt of this award does not constitute taxable income to you. Any cash dividends which are paid to you on the Restricted Shares will constitute taxable income to you when received. At such time as the restrictions on the Shares are released or satisfied and your right to the Shares becomes non-forfeitable you will have taxable income in an amount equal to the then fair market value of the Shares.
                               (ii)        If you are a director or officer of the Company subject to the requirement of filing reports under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 upon changes in your beneficial ownership of shares of the Company's Common Stock, you may report the award of Restricted Shares on Form 5, Annual Statement of Changes in Beneficial Ownership, after the end of the Company's fiscal year or on Form 4, Statement of Changes in Beneficial Ownership, for the month in which the award was received.
