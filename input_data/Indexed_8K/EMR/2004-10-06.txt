        [   ]  Soliciting material pursuant to Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14a-12)

Item 5.02.    Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers.
        W. J. Galvin resigned from the Board of Directors class of 2005 of Emerson effective October 5, 2004. On the same date, immediately following the resignation, Mr. Galvin was elected by the Board as a Director in the class of 2007.
         The reason is that under Missouri law, a Missouri corporation must keep the number of Directors in each class of Directors as nearly equal as possible. C. F. Knight's resignation from the Board on September 17, 2004 left the classes unbalanced. Mr. Galvin's resignation from the 2005 class and election to the 2007 class makes each of the three classes equal with five (5) directors each.
         Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
