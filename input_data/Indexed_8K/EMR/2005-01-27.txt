Emerson GAAP Underlying Orders  3 Month Summary
December 2004 Order Comments:
Underlying orders accelerated for the month driven by strong growth in Process Management and Industrial Automation. Orders reflect strong demand in emerging markets, particularly Asia and Latin America, and solid demand in the United States, while Europe was slightly positive. Favorable currency exchange rates contributed approximately 3 percentage points of the total +5% to +10% increase.
Process Management experienced strong orders in measurement and analytical instruments, valves, and power & water solutions, with strength in emerging markets.
Overall orders in Industrial Automation were strong led by continued capital spending and industrial demand in North America.
Orders in Network Power were led by strength in the systems business and strength in North America along with solid demand in Asia. Orders in the OEM embedded power business decreased due to seasonal order patterns.
Orders in Climate Technologies improved despite the continued impact of inventory reductions in the U.S. residential air conditioning market and tougher prior year comparisons.
Appliance and Tools segment orders increased, led by strength in the storage business and mixed results in the motors, appliance, and tools businesses.

(c)   Exhibits

EXHIBIT 99.1
        ST. LOUIS, January 27, 2005  Emerson (NYSE:EMR) said at its Annual Investment Community Update meeting today in New York that management expects earnings per share of $0.70, an increase of 21 percent, for the first quarter ended December 31, 2004. The company earned $0.58 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. As expected, first-quarter 2005 earnings will include a $0.03 per share gain from several items.
        Emerson also indicated it expects earnings per share for its 2005 fiscal year, ending September 30, to increase in the range of 10 percent to 15 percent over the $2.98 earned in fiscal 2004. The 2005 earnings guidance excludes the tax impact of potentially repatriating foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act. The company said it expects the double-digit earnings gain for fiscal 2005 will be driven by 8 percent to 11 percent growth in reported sales and by an overall improvement in operating margins.
        For the first quarter, reported sales are expected to be up approximately 10 percent, with underlying sales up 5 percent, excluding the impact of exchange rates (3 percent) and acquisitions (2 percent). The company said it expects the first-quarter operating margin will be down slightly, with productivity improvements and cost reductions mostly offsetting the dilution from the Marconi acquisition and the impact of higher raw materials prices, primarily in the Appliance and Tools businesses.
Add One
        The company said the pace of customer orders and overall business activity remains favorable. Underlying orders in December accelerated, driven by strong growth in Process Management and Industrial Automation. Orders reflect strong demand in emerging markets, particularly Asia and Latin America, and solid demand in the United States, while Europe was slightly positive.
