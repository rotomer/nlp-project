Emerson GAAP Underlying Orders  3 Month Summary
April 2005 Order Comments:
Orders remained strong with growth led by Process Management, Network Power, and Industrial Automation. Favorable currency exchange rates contributed 3.5 percentage points of the total +5 to +10% increase.
Process Management experienced strong orders globally with significant project activity and a continued upturn in MRO activity. The power and oil and gas markets continue to drive growth for this segment.
Overall orders in Industrial Automation were strong, led by continued capital spending and industrial demand in North America, Europe, and Asia.
Network Power orders remained strong across the majority of the product lines, with particular strength in the United States and Asia.
Orders for Climate Technologies were impacted by tougher comparisons to a strong 2004, as well as slower orders in air conditioning, continued weak European market demand, and excess customer inventory in China.
Appliance and Tools segment orders were led by strength in the storage business and mixed results in the motors, appliance, and tools businesses.
