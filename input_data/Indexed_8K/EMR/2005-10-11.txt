Section 3.
Determination of Right to Indemnification in Certain Instances
          
(a)
Any indemnification under Section 1 of this Article VII (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation unless a determination is reasonably and promptly made that indemnification of the director, officer or employee is not proper in the circumstances because he or she has not satisfied the conditions to indemnification set forth in such Section 1. Such determination shall be made (1) by the Board by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (2) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested Directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (3) by the shareholders; provided, that no such determination shall preclude an action brought in an appropriate court to challenge such determination.
          
(b)
Any indemnification under Section 2 of this Article VII (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the agent is proper in the circumstances. Such determination shall be made (1) by the Board by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (2) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested Directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (3) by the shareholders.
           
Section 4.

Expenses incurred by an employee or agent in defending any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article may be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the employee or agent to repay such amounts unless it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article. Expenses incurred by a director or officer in defending any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Section 1 of this Article shall be paid by the Corporation as incurred; provided, however, that the Corporation shall have first received an undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer to repay such amounts unless it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article.

Section 5.
Successful Defense
          
(a)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article VII (but except as set forth in subsection (b) of this Section), to the extent that a director, officer or employee of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise (including the dismissal of an action without prejudice) in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Section 1 of this Article VII, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he or she shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred in connection therewith. This Section 5 shall not apply to the defense of any action suit or proceeding against, or to related expenses incurred by, an agent of the Corporation; the eligibility of an agent of the Corporation for indemnification by the Corporation shall be determined solely pursuant to the provisions of Section 2 of this Article VII.
          
(b)
Indemnification shall not be provided under this Section or under Section 1 of this Article VII in defense of an action, suit or proceeding brought by the Corporation against an officer or employee; provided that such indemnification shall be provided as to such action, suit or proceeding brought in the right of the Corporation, or as to such action, suit or proceeding which arises as a result of or is related to the acquisition of the Corporation in a transaction not approved by a majority of its continuing Directors. "Continuing Directors", for the purpose of this Article VII, shall be those Directors holding office as Directors prior to the time of such acquisition, or any successors thereof approved as successors by Directors in office prior to the time of such acquisition.
           
Section 6.
. The indemnification provided by this Article VII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification may be entitled under any statute, bylaw, agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in an official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event of conflict between the provisions of this Article VII and the provisions of any agreement adopted by the shareholders between the Corporation on the one hand, and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation on the other, providing for indemnification, the terms of such agreement shall prevail. Any indemnification, whether required under this Bylaw or permitted by statute or otherwise, shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer or employee and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such person.
Not Exclusive Right

Subsidiaries of Corporation
 
-14-
 
 
subsidiary corporation, venture, trust or other enterprise wholly owned by the Corporation, shall be deemed to be serving as such director, officer, employee or agent at the request of the Corporation, unless the Board shall determine otherwise. In all instances where any person shall serve as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, joint venture, trust or other enterprise of which the Corporation is or was a stockholder or creditor, or in which it is or was otherwise interested, if it is not otherwise established that such person is or was serving as such director, officer, employee or agent at the request of the Corporation, the Board may determine whether such service is or was at the request of the Corporation, and it shall not be necessary to show any actual or prior request for such service.
           
Section 9.
. The spouse of a person entitled to indemnification under Section 1 hereof or who is granted indemnification under Section 2 hereof, shall be entitled to be so indemnified; provided, that the spouse was or is a party (other than a party plaintiff suing on his or her own behalf or in the right of the Corporation), or was or is threatened to be made a party, to any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative (including, but not limited to, an action by or in the right of the Corporation), solely by reason of the spousal relationship to the person who is entitled to indemnification under Section 1 hereof or who is granted indemnification under Section 2 hereof.

referred to in Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article
may be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the

by a director or officer in defending any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Section 1 of this Article shall be paid by the Corporation as incurred

the Corporation shall have first received an undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer to repay such amounts unless it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article.
Section 5.
Successful Defense
.
(a)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article VII
(but except as set forth in subsection (b) of this Section)
, to the extent that a director, officer
,
or
employee
or agent
of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise (including the dismissal of an action without prejudice
or the settlement of an action without admission of liability
) in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in
Sections 1 or 2
Section 1
of this Article VII, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he or she shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred in connection therewith.
This Section 5 shall not apply to the defense of any action suit or proceeding against, or to related expenses incurred by, an agent of the Corporation; the eligibility of an agent of the Corporation for indemnification by the Corporation shall be determined solely pursuant to the provisions of Section 2 of this Article VII.
(b) Indemnification shall not be provided under this Section or under Section 1 of this Article VII in defense of an action, suit or proceeding brought by the Corporation against an officer or employee; provided that such indemnification shall be provided as to such action, suit or proceeding brought in the right of the Corporation, or as to such action, suit or proceeding which arises as a result of or is related to the acquisition of the Corporation in a transaction not approved by a majority of its continuing Directors. "Continuing Directors", for the purpose of this Article VII, shall be those Directors holding office as Directors prior to the time of such acquisition, or any successors thereof approved as successors by Directors in office prior to the time of such acquisition.
Section 6.
Not Exclusive Right
. The indemnification provided by this Article VII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification may be entitled under any statute, bylaw, agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in an official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event of conflict between the provisions of this Article VII and the provisions of any agreement adopted by the shareholders between the Corporation on the one hand, and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation on the other, providing for indemnification, the terms of such agreement shall prevail. Any indemnification, whether required under this Bylaw or permitted by statute or otherwise, shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer
or employee and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such person.
Section 7.
Insurance
. The Board shall have the power to cause the Corporation to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a Director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer,
 
- 15 -
 
 
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity, arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Article.
Section 8.
Subsidiaries of Corporation
. For the purposes of this Article VII, (a) any officer, Director, or employee of the Corporation who shall serve as an officer, director, employee or agent of any other corporation, joint venture, trust or other enterprise of which the Corporation, directly or indirectly, is or was a stockholder or creditor, or in which the Corporation is or was in any way interested, or (b) any officer, director, or employee of any subsidiary corporation, venture, trust or other enterprise wholly owned by the Corporation, shall be deemed to be serving as such director, officer, employee or agent at the request of the Corporation, unless the Board shall determine otherwise. In all instances where any person shall serve as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, joint venture, trust or other enterprise of which the Corporation is or was a stockholder or creditor, or in which it is or was otherwise interested, if it is not otherwise established that such person is or was serving as such director, officer, employee or agent at the request of the Corporation, the Board may determine whether such service is or was at the request of the Corporation, and it shall not be necessary to show any actual or prior request for such service.

Exhibit 10.1
Summary of
Compensation Arrangements
with Non-Management Directors
Effective Fiscal Year 2006(October 1, 2005)
Directors who are employees of the Company do not receive any compensation for service as Directors. For fiscal 2006, each non-management Director is paid an annual retainer of $140,000, of which $50,000 will be paid in cash and $90,000 will be paid on the date of the Company's annual meeting in the form of Emerson restricted stock issued under the Company's Restricted Stock Plan for Non-Management Directors to those non-management Directors who are elected or re-elected by the stockholders of the Company at, or who continue in office after, such annual meeting. The percentage of the annual retainer paid in restricted stock each year is determined by or upon the recommendation of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. Each non-management Director is paid a fee of $1,500 plus expenses for attendance at each Board meeting. Each non-management Chairman of a Board committee is paid an annual cash retainer of $8,000, except the Chairman of the Audit Committee, who is paid an annual cash retainer of $12,000. Each non-management member of a committee of the Board is paid $1,250 plus expenses for attendance at each committee meeting.
Directors may elect to defer all or any part of their cash compensation; such deferred amounts are credited with interest quarterly at the prime rate charged by Bank of America, N.A. In the alternative, Directors may elect to have such deferred amounts converted into units equivalent to shares of Company common stock and their accounts credited with additional units representing dividend equivalents. All deferred cash compensation is ultimately paid out only in cash.
The Company has eliminated its Continuing Compensation Plan for Non-Management Directors; provided, however, that a non-management Director who assumed office prior to June 4, 2002, and who serves as a Director for at least five years, will, after the later of termination of service as a Director or age 72, receive for life a percentage of the annual $30,000 cash retainer for Directors in effect on June 4, 2002. Such percentage is 50% for five years' service and increases by 10% for each additional year of service to 100% for ten years' or more service. In the event that service as a covered Director terminates because of death, the compensation under this Plan will be paid to the Director's surviving spouse for five years.
