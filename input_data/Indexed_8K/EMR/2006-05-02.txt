On May 2, 2006, a press release was issued regarding the second quarter results of Emerson Electric Co. (the "Company"). A copy of this press release is furnished with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1.
The press release contains non-GAAP financial measures as such term is defined in Regulation G under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. While the Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly titled measures presented by other companies. The reasons why management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information are set forth in the Company's most recent Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
Item 2.03.
     
Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
On April 28, 2006, the Company entered into a $2.8 billion five-year revolving credit facility (the "2006 Facility"). The 2006 Facility replaces a $1 billion five-year revolving credit facility dated March 11, 2005 and a $1.83 billion revolving credit facility dated March 12, 2004. The 2006 Facility expires in April 2011. There are no outstanding loans or letters of credit under the 2006 Facility. The Company has not previously incurred any borrowings under this or prior similar facilities, and has no current intention to do so now or in the foreseeable future. The 2006 Facility, and similar past facilities, are kept in place by the Company to support general corporate purposes, including commercial paper borrowings.
The 2006 Facility is unsecured and may be advanced as syndicate, swingline or competitive bid loans, or as letters of credit, subject to certain limitations. Various interest rate alternatives are available, at the Company's option, under the 2006 Facility. Loans and letters of credit may be denominated in U.S. dollars or certain other currencies at the option of the Company. The Company must pay facility fees on the aggregate amounts available under the 2006 Facility, as specified in the credit agreement. The 2006 Facility contains customary representations, warranties, and covenants, breaches of which may be grounds for termination. Other events of default include the Company's failure to pay material debt, certain insolvency, bankruptcy or ERISA events, material unpaid judgments, or a change in control of 50% or more of the Company's outstanding common stock.
The foregoing summary of the 2006 Facility is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual credit agreement, which is attached as Exhibit 10.1, hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.

The following information is furnished pursuant to Regulation FD.
 
 
 
Emerson GAAP Underlying Orders  3 Month Summary
(Percent change. Trailing 3-month average versus prior year.)
 
 
March 2006 Order Comments:
 
Order growth maintained a double-digit pace during the quarter led by Network Power, Process Management and Industrial Automation. Unfavorable currency exchange rates reduced orders by approximately 1 percentage point.
 
Process Management orders remained strong, with particular strength in the United States, Asia and Latin America. This segment continued to have balanced growth across the valves, measurement, and systems businesses.
 
Orders for Industrial Automation were led by continued broad strength in the industrial economy of the United States and strengthening demand from Europe. The growth for this segment was led by the power generating alternator and the mechanical power transmission businesses.
 
Network Power orders continued at high levels due to strong growth in the key computing and telecommunications end-markets in the United States and China. The growth continued to be driven by the power systems and the embedded power businesses.
 
Orders growth for Climate Technologies slowed down as the United States residential air-conditioning industry continued the conversion to higher efficiency units. This segment continued to benefit from growth in Europe, domestic refrigeration and the solutions business.
 
Appliance and Tools had solid growth from the tools and storage business driven by activity in the non-residential construction markets. The motors and appliance components business experienced a modest order decline during the quarter.
 
Upcoming Investor Events
 
Emerson senior management will discuss the Company's second quarter 2006 results during an investor conference call that will be held on Tuesday, May 2, 2006. The call will begin at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time (1:00 p.m. Central Daylight Time).

Section 2.05.5
;
provided
,
however
, that the failure by the Borrower to give such notice to the Agent shall be deemed to be a rejection of all such offers. In the case of acceptance, such notice (a "
Competitive Bid Borrowing Notice
") shall specify the aggregate principal amount of offers for each Interest Period that are accepted. The Borrower may accept any Competitive Bid Quote in whole or in part;
provided
that:
(i)
     
the aggregate principal amount of each Competitive Bid Advance may not exceed the applicable amount set forth in the related Competitive Bid Quote Request,

Allocation by Agent
. If offers are made by two or more Lenders with the same Eurocurrency Bid Rates or Absolute Rates, as the case may be, for a greater aggregate principal amount than the amount in respect of which offers are accepted for the related Interest Period, the principal amount of Competitive Bid Loans in respect of which such offers are accepted shall be allocated by the Agent among such Lenders as nearly as possible (in such multiples, not greater than $1,000,000, as the Agent may deem appropriate) in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of such offers.

Section 2.06.
Facility Fee; Reductions in Aggregate Commitment
. The Borrower agrees to pay to each Lender directly a facility fee (the "
Facility Fee
") at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Facility Fee Rate on such Lender's Commitment (whether used or unused) from the Effective Date to and including the Facility Termination Date, payable on each Payment Date hereafter and on the Facility Termination Date and, if the proviso at the end of this sentence applies, on the date on which the Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure is reduced to
 
22
 
 
zero;
provided
, that if any Lender continues to have Outstanding Credit Exposure hereunder after the termination of its Commitment, then such Facility Fee shall continue to accrue on the Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure until the Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure is reduced to zero. The Borrower may permanently reduce the Aggregate Commitment in whole, or in part ratably among the Lenders, in the amount of $25,000,000 or a multiple of $5,000,000 in excess thereof, upon at least three Business Days' written notice to the Agent, which notice shall specify the amount of any such reduction;
provided

Section 8.01
) upon notice to the Agent not later than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on the date of such prepayment. The Borrower may at any time prepay, without penalty or premium, all outstanding Swing Line Loans, or, in a minimum amount of $100,000 and increments of $50,000 in excess thereof, any portion of the outstanding Swing Line Loans, with notice to the Agent and the Swing Line Lender by 11:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on the date of prepayment. The Borrower may from time to time prepay, subject to the payment of any funding indemnification amounts required by
Section 2.22
but without penalty or premium, all outstanding Eurocurrency Ratable Advances, or, in a minimum aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or the Approximate Equivalent Amount if denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars), any portion of the outstanding Eurocurrency Ratable Advances upon three Business Days' prior notice to the Agent. Except as provided in the first sentence of this
Section 2.08

Each Base Rate Advance shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from and including the date such Advance is made or is automatically converted from a Eurocurrency Ratable Advance into a Base Rate Advance pursuant to
Section 2.02.4
, to but excluding the date it is paid or is converted into a Eurocurrency Ratable Advance pursuant to
Section 2.02.4
hereof, at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate for such day. Changes in the rate of interest on that portion of any Advance maintained as a Base Rate Advance will take effect simultaneously with each change in the Alternate Base Rate. Each Eurocurrency Ratable Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day during each Interest Period applicable thereto,
 
23
 
 
at a rate per annum equal to the Eurocurrency Rate for such day. Each Eurocurrency Bid Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the Eurocurrency Bid Rate quoted by the Lender making such Loan in accordance with
Section 2.05
. Each Absolute Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the Absolute Rate quoted by the Lender making such Loan in accordance with

.
Section 2.10.
Rates Applicable After Default
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
Section 2.02.3
or
2.02.4
, the Required Lenders may, at their option, by notice to the Borrower (which notice may be revoked at the option of the Required Lenders notwithstanding any provision of
Section 9.05
requiring unanimous consent of the Lenders to changes in interest rates), during the continuance of an Event of Default declare that no Ratable Advance may be made as, converted into or continued as a Eurocurrency Ratable Advance. The Required Lenders may, at their option, by notice to the Borrower (which notice may be revoked at the option of the Required Lenders notwithstanding any provision of
Section 9.05
requiring unanimous consent of the Lenders to changes in interest rates), declare that (a) overdue principal of and interest on each Fixed Rate Advance shall bear interest for the remainder of the applicable Interest Period at the rate otherwise applicable to such Interest Period plus 1% per annum and (b) overdue principal of and interest on each Base Rate Advance, each Swing Line Loan and each Reimbursement Obligation shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate in effect from time to time plus 1% per annum.
Section 2.11.
Method of Payment
. (a) Except for Loans that have been converted into Loans of another Agreed Currency as provided in the definition of "Eligible Currency," each Advance shall be repaid and each payment of interest thereon shall be paid in the currency in which such Advance was made, and any such amount in respect of a Loan that has been converted as described above shall be paid in the currency into which such Loan has been converted. All payments to be made by the Borrower hereunder in Dollars shall be made, without setoff, deduction, or counterclaim, in immediately available funds to the Agent at the Agent's address specified pursuant to
Section 9.01
or at any other Domestic Lending Office of the Agent specified in writing by the Agent to the Borrower, by 11:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on the date when due. All payments to be made by the Borrower hereunder in any currency other than Dollars shall be made in such currency on the date due in such funds as may then be customary for the settlement of international transactions in such currency for the account of the Agent, at its Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency. All payments of Obligations hereunder shall (except (x) repayments of Swing Line Loans and Competitive Bid Loans, (y) Reimbursement Obligations for which the LC Issuers have not been fully indemnified by the Lenders or (z) as otherwise specifically required hereunder) be applied ratably by the Agent among the Lenders. Each payment delivered to the Agent for the account of any Lender shall be delivered promptly by the Agent to such Lender in the same type of funds that the Agent received at (i) with respect to Base Rate Loans and Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Dollars, its address specified pursuant to
Section 9.01
and (b) with respect to Eurocurrency Loans denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars, in the funds received from the Borrower at the address of the Agent's Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency. Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, Base Rate Loans or Absolute Rate Loans or of fees shall be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding
 
24
 
 
Business Day. Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, Eurocurrency Loans shall be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless such Business Day falls in another calendar month, in which case the date for payment thereof shall be the next preceding Business Day. If the date for any payment of principal is extended by operation of law or otherwise, interest thereon shall be payable for such extended time. Each reference to the Agent in this
Section 2.11
shall also be deemed to refer, and shall apply equally, to the LC Issuers, in the case of payments required to be made by the Borrower directly to the LC Issuers pursuant to
Section 2.19.6
.
(b)
    
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, if, after the making of any Loan in any currency other than Dollars, currency control or exchange regulations are imposed in the country which issues such currency with the result that the type of currency in which the Loan was made (the "
Original Currency
") no longer exists or the Borrower is not able to make payment to the Agent for the account of the Lenders in such Original Currency, then all payments to be made by the Borrower hereunder in such currency shall instead be made when due in Dollars in an amount equal to the Dollar Amount (as of the date of repayment) of such payment due, it being the intention of the parties hereto that the Borrower take all risks of the imposition of any such currency control or exchange regulations.
Section 2.13.
Noteless Agreement; Evidence of Indebtedness
. (a) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.
(b)
    
The Agent shall also maintain accounts in which it will record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Borrowing Date, the Agreed Currency and the Type thereof and any Interest Period with respect thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder, (iii) the original stated amount of each Facility LC and the amount of LC Obligations outstanding at any time, (iv) the amount of any sum received by the Agent hereunder from the Borrower and each Lender's share thereof and (v) the amount of any increase or decrease in the Aggregate Commitment pursuant to
Section 2.01.2
or
2.06
.
(c)
    
The entries maintained in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) above shall be
prima
facie
evidence of the existence and amounts of the Obligations therein recorded;
provided
,
however
,
that the failure of the Agent or any Lender to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Obligations in accordance with their terms or the rights of the Borrower to borrow in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
(d)
    
Any Lender may request that its Ratable Loans, Competitive Bid Loans or Swing Line Loans be evidenced by Ratable Notes, Competitive Bid Notes or Swing Line Notes, respectively. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender such Note or Notes payable to the order of such Lender. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such
 
25
 
 
Note or Notes and interest thereon shall at all times (prior to any assignment pursuant to
Section 9.06(c)
) be represented by one or more Notes payable to the order of the payee named therein or any Assignee pursuant to
Section 9.06(c)
, except to the extent that any such Lender or Assignee subsequently returns any such Note for cancellation and requests that such Loans once again be evidenced as described in paragraphs (a) and (b) above. Each reference in this Agreement to the "Note" of such Lender shall be deemed to refer to and include any or all of such Notes, as the context may require.
Section 2.14.
Telephonic Notices
. The Borrower hereby authorizes the Lenders and the Agent to extend, convert or continue Advances, effect selections of Agreed Currencies and Types of Advances, submit Competitive Bid Quotes and to transfer funds based on telephonic notices made by any person or persons the Agent or any Lender in good faith believes to be acting on behalf of the Borrower, it being understood that the foregoing authorization is specifically intended to allow Borrowing Notices, Conversion/Continuation Notices and Competitive Bid Quote Requests to be given telephonically. The Borrower agrees to deliver promptly to the Agent a written confirmation signed by an Authorized Officer, if such confirmation is requested by the Agent or any Lender, of each telephonic notice. If the written confirmation differs in any material respect from the action taken by the Agent and the Lenders, the records of the Agent and the Lenders shall govern absent manifest error.
Section 2.15.
Interest Payment Dates; Interest and Fee Basis
. Interest accrued on each Base Rate Advance shall be payable in arrears on each Payment Date, commencing with the first such date to occur after the date hereof, and at maturity. Interest accrued on each Fixed Rate Advance shall be payable on the last day of its applicable Interest Period, on any date on which the Fixed Rate Advance is prepaid, whether by acceleration or otherwise, and at maturity. Interest accrued on each Fixed Rate Advance having an Interest Period longer than three months shall also be payable on the last day of each three-month interval during such Interest Period. Interest accrued on each Base Rate Advance or any Fixed Rate Advance that is bearing interest at the Alternate Base Rate pursuant to
Article 8
shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 365-day or 366-day year, as the case may be. Interest on all Advances other than Base Rate Advances and Fixed Rate Advances that bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate pursuant to
Article 8
and fees (including, without limitation, Facility Fees and LC Fees) shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year, except for interest on Eurocurrency Ratable Advances denominated in British Pounds Sterling which shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 365-day year. Interest shall be payable for the day an Advance is made but not for the day of any payment on the amount paid if payment is received at the place of payment prior to noon (local time) or at such other time as shall be specified for such payment under this Agreement.
Section 2.16.
Notification of Advances, Interest Rates, Prepayments and Commitment Reductions
. Promptly after receipt thereof, the Agent will notify each Lender of the contents of each Aggregate Commitment reduction notice, Ratable Borrowing Notice, Swing Line Borrowing Notice, Competitive Bid Borrowing Notice, Conversion/Continuation Notice, and repayment notice received by it hereunder. Promptly after notice from an LC Issuer, the Agent will notify each applicable Lender of the contents of each request for issuance of a Facility LC hereunder. The Agent will notify each Lender of the interest rate applicable to each Fixed Rate
 
26
 
 
Advance promptly upon determination of such interest rate and will give each Lender prompt notice of each change in the Alternate Base Rate.
Section 2.17.
Regulation D Compensation
. If and so long as a reserve requirement of the type described in the definition of "Reserve Requirement" is prescribed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (or any successor), each Lender subject to such requirement may require the Borrower to pay, contemporaneously with each payment of interest on each of such Lender's Eurocurrency Loans, additional interest on such Eurocurrency Loan at a rate per annum determined by such Lender that reflects the cost to such Lender of such reserve requirement in respect of such Eurocurrency Loan but does not exceed the excess of (a)(i) the applicable Eurocurrency Reference Rate divided by (ii) one
minus
the Reserve Requirement over (b) the applicable Eurocurrency Reference Rate. Any Lender wishing to require payment of such additional interest (x) shall so notify the Borrower and the Agent, in which case such additional interest on the Eurocurrency Loans of such Lender shall be payable to such Lender at the place indicated in such notice with respect to each Interest Period commencing at least three Business Days after such Lender gives such notice and (y) shall notify the Borrower at least five Business Days before each date on which interest is payable on the Eurocurrency Loans of the amount then due it under this Section.
Section 2.18.
Non-Receipt of Funds by the Agent
. Unless the Borrower or a Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Agent prior to the time on which it is scheduled to make payment to the Agent of (a) in the case of a Lender, the proceeds of a Loan or (b) in the case of the Borrower, a payment of principal, interest or fees to the Agent for the account of the Lenders, that it does not intend to make such payment, the Agent may assume that such payment has been made. The Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the amount of such payment available to the intended recipient in reliance upon such assumption. If such Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, has not in fact made such payment to the Agent, the recipient of such payment shall, on demand by the Agent, repay to the Agent the amount so made available together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such amount was so made available by the Agent until the date the Agent recovers such amount at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of payment by a Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day for the first three days and, thereafter, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan or (ii) in the case of payment by the Borrower, a rate per annum equal to the higher of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan. Nothing in this
Section 2.18
shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or to prejudice any rights which the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.
2.19.1.
Issuance
. Each LC Issuer hereby agrees, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, to issue standby and commercial letters of credit denominated in any Agreed Currency (each, a "

") and to renew, extend, increase, decrease or otherwise modify any Facility LC issued by it ("
Modify
," and each such action a "
Modification
"), from time to time (including on the Effective Date) prior to the Facility Termination Date, upon the request of the Borrower;
provided
that immediately after each such Facility LC is issued or Modified, (a) the aggregate amount of the outstanding LC Obligations shall not exceed

2.19.2.

Section 2.19
, such LC Issuer shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to have unconditionally and irrevocably sold to each Lender, and each Lender shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to have unconditionally and irrevocably purchased from such LC Issuer, a participation in such Facility LC (and each Modification thereof) and the related LC Obligations in proportion to its Pro Rata Share.
2.19.3.

The issuance or Modification by an LC Issuer of any Facility LC shall, in addition to the conditions precedent set forth in
Section 3.02
(and, in the case of any Facility LC issued on the Effective Date,
Section 3.01
) (the satisfaction of which no LC Issuer shall have any duty to ascertain), be subject to the condition precedent that the Borrower shall have executed and delivered such application agreement and/or such other instruments and agreements relating to such Facility LC as such LC Issuer shall have reasonably requested in accordance with its standard practice (each, a "
Facility LC Application
"). In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of any Facility LC Application, the terms of this Agreement shall control.
2.19.4.
LC Fees
. The Borrower shall pay to the Agent, for the account of the Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares, (a) with respect to each standby Facility LC, a letter of credit fee at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable LC Fee Rate in effect from time to time on the average daily undrawn stated amount under such Facility LC, such fee to be payable in arrears on each Payment Date and (b) with respect to each commercial Facility LC, on the date of issuance or any increase in the stated amount thereof, a fee in an amount equal to the Applicable LC Fee Rate in effect at such time

LC Payment Date
"). Each LC Issuer shall endeavor to exercise the same care in the issuance and administration of the Facility LCs as it does with respect to letters of credit in which no participations are granted, it being understood that in the absence of any gross negligence or willful misconduct by an LC Issuer, each Lender shall be unconditionally and irrevocably liable without regard to the occurrence of any Default or any condition precedent whatsoever, to reimburse the applicable LC Issuer on demand for (a) such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the amount of each payment made by such LC Issuer under each Facility LC to the extent such amount is not reimbursed by the Borrower pursuant to
Section 2.19.6
, plus (b) interest on the foregoing amount to be reimbursed by such Lender, for each day from the date of such LC Issuer's demand for such reimbursement (or, if such demand is made after 11:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on such date, from the next succeeding Business Day) to the date on which such Lender pays the amount to be reimbursed by it, at a rate of interest per annum equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate for the first three days and, thereafter, at a rate of interest equal to the rate applicable to Base Rate Advances.
2.19.6.
Reimbursement by Borrower
. The Borrower shall be irrevocably and unconditionally obligated to reimburse each LC Issuer on or before the applicable LC Payment Date for any amounts to be paid by such LC Issuer upon any drawing under any Facility LC, without presentment, demand, protest or other formalities of any kind;
provided
, that the Borrower shall not be obligated to reimburse any LC Issuer for any amounts so paid by it, and the LC Payment Date in respect of any such reimbursement shall not be, earlier than the later of (i) the date on which such LC Issuer is required to pay the beneficiary of such Facility LC and (ii) (A) 12:00 noon (Chicago time) on the day that the Agent delivers notice of a drawing under a Facility LC pursuant to

provided
,
further
, that neither the Borrower nor any Lender shall hereby be precluded from asserting any claim for direct (but not consequential) damages suffered by the Borrower or such Lender to the extent, but only to the extent, caused by (a) the willful misconduct or gross negligence of any LC Issuer in determining whether a request presented under any Facility LC issued by it complied with the terms of such Facility LC or (b) any LC Issuer's failure to pay under any Facility LC issued by it after the presentation to it of a request strictly complying with the terms and conditions of such Facility LC.

The Borrower further agrees with the LC Issuers and the Lenders that the LC Issuers and the Lenders shall not be responsible for, and the Borrower's Reimbursement Obligation in respect of any Facility LC shall not be affected by, among other things, the validity or genuineness of documents or of any endorsements thereon, even if such documents should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, fraudulent or forged, or any dispute between or among the Borrower, any of its affiliates, the beneficiary of any Facility LC or any financing institution or other party to whom any Facility LC may be transferred or any claims or defenses whatsoever of the Borrower or of any of its affiliates against the beneficiary of any Facility LC or any such transferee. The responsibility of an LC Issuer to the Borrower and each Lender shall be only to determine that the documents (including each demand for payment) delivered under each Facility LC in connection with such presentment shall be in conformity in all material respects with such Facility LC. No LC Issuer shall be liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Facility LC. The Borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted by any LC Issuer or any Lender under or in connection with each Facility LC and the related drafts and documents, if done without gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall be binding upon the Borrower and shall not put any LC Issuer or any Lender under any liability to the Borrower. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
Section 2.19.7
is intended to limit the right of the Borrower to make a claim against any LC Issuer for damages as contemplated by the proviso to the first sentence of
Section 2.19.6
.
2.19.8.
Actions of LC Issuers
. Subject to
Section 2.19.7

Each Lender agrees that each LC Issuer shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement unless it shall first have received such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it reasonably deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Section 2.19
, each Lender agrees that each LC Issuer shall in all cases be fully protected from liability to the Lenders in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement in accordance with a request of the Required Lenders, and such
 
30
 
 
request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon the Lenders and any future holders of a participation in any Facility LC.
2.19.9.
Indemnification
. The Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Lender, each LC Issuer and the Agent, and their respective directors, officers, agents and employees from and against any and all claims and damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses which such Lender, such LC Issuer or the Agent may incur (or which may be claimed against such Lender, such LC Issuer or the Agent by any Person whatsoever) by reason of or in connection with the issuance, execution and delivery or transfer of or payment or failure to pay under any Facility LC or any actual or proposed use of any Facility LC, including, without limitation, any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses which such LC Issuer may incur by reason of or in connection with (a) the failure of any other Lender to fulfill or comply with its obligations to such LC Issuer hereunder (but nothing herein contained shall affect any rights the Borrower may have against any defaulting Lender) or (b) by reason of or on account of such LC Issuer issuing any Facility LC which specifies that the term "Beneficiary" included therein includes any successor by operation of law of the named Beneficiary, but which Facility LC does not require that any drawing by any such successor Beneficiary be accompanied by a copy of a legal document, satisfactory to such LC Issuer, evidencing the appointment of such successor Beneficiary;
provided
that the Borrower shall not be required to indemnify any Lender, any LC Issuer or the Agent for any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses to the extent, but only to the extent, caused by (i) the willful misconduct or gross negligence of any LC Issuer in determining whether a request presented under any Facility LC complied with the terms of such Facility LC or (ii) any LC Issuer's failure to pay under any Facility LC after the presentation to it of a request strictly complying with the terms and conditions of such Facility LC. Nothing in this
Section 2.19.9
is intended to limit the obligations of the Borrower under any other provision of this Agreement.
2.19.10.
Lenders' Indemnification
Each Lender shall, ratably in accordance with its Pro Rata Share, indemnify each LC Issuer, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, agents and employees (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower) against any cost, expense (including reasonable counsel fees and disbursements), claim, demand, action, loss or liability (except such as result from such indemnitees' gross negligence or willful misconduct or such LC Issuer's failure to pay under any Facility LC after the presentation to it of a request strictly complying with the terms and conditions of the Facility LC) that such indemnitees may suffer or incur in connection with this
Section 2.19
or any action taken or omitted by such indemnitees hereunder.

Facility LC Collateral Account
") at the Agent's office at the address specified pursuant to
Section 9.01
, in the name of such Borrower but under the sole dominion and control of the Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders and in which such Borrower shall have no interest other than as set forth in

31
 
 
of the Borrower's right, title and interest in and to all funds which may from time to time be on deposit in the Facility LC Collateral Account (if any) to secure the prompt and complete payment and performance of the Obligations. The Agent will invest any funds on deposit from time to time in the Facility LC Collateral Account (if any) in certificates of deposit of JPMCB having a maturity not exceeding 30 days. Nothing in this
Section 2.19.11
shall either obligate the Agent to require the Borrower to deposit any funds in the Facility LC Collateral Account (if any) or limit the right of the Agent to release any funds held in the Facility LC Collateral Account (if any) in each case other than as required by
Section 6.03
.
2.19.12.
Rights as a Lender
. In its capacity as a Lender, each LC Issuer shall have the same rights and obligations as any other Lender.
Section 2.20.
Market Disruption

Articles 2
and
3
with respect to any Advance in any Agreed Currency other than Dollars, if there shall occur on or prior to the date of such Advance any change in national or international financial, political or economic conditions or currency exchange rates or exchange controls which would in the reasonable opinion of the Agent or the Required Lenders make it impracticable for the Eurocurrency Loans comprising such Advance to be denominated in the Agreed Currency specified by the Borrower, then the Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders, and such Loans shall not be denominated in such Agreed Currency but shall be made on such Borrowing Date in Dollars, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Dollar Amount of the aggregate principal amount specified in the related Borrowing Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice, as the case may be, as Base Rate Loans, unless (a) the Borrower notifies the Agent at least one Business Day before such Borrowing Date that (i) it elects not to borrow on such date or (ii) it elects to borrow on such Borrowing Date in a different Agreed Currency, as the case may be, in which the denomination of such Loans would in the opinion of the Agent and the Required Lenders be practicable and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Dollar Amount of the aggregate principal amount specified in the related Borrowing Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice, as the case may be, or (b) the Borrower notifies the Agent at least three Business Days before such Borrowing Date that it elects to borrow Eurocurrency Loans in a different Agreed Currency on such Borrowing Date.
Section 2.21.
Judgment Currency
. If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due from the Borrower hereunder in the currency expressed to be payable herein (the "
specified currency
") into another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Agent could purchase the specified currency with such other currency at the Agent's main Chicago office on the Business Day preceding that on which final, non-appealable judgment is given. The obligations of the Borrower in respect of any sum due to any Lender or the Agent hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than the specified currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) may in accordance with normal, reasonable banking procedures purchase the specified currency with such other currency. If the amount of the specified currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to such Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, in the specified currency, the Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, as a separate
 
32
 
 
obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, against such loss, and if the amount of the specified currency so purchased exceeds the sum originally due to any Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, in the specified currency, such Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, agrees to remit such excess to the Borrower.
Section 2.22.
Funding Indemnification
. If the Borrower makes any payment of principal with respect to any Eurocurrency Advance on a date which is not the last day of the applicable Interest Period, whether because of acceleration, prepayment, conversion or otherwise, or a Eurocurrency Advance is not made on the date specified by the Borrower for any reason other than default by the Lenders, the Borrower will indemnify each Lender within fifteen (15) days of demand for any loss or cost incurred by it (or by an existing or prospective Participant in the related Loan) resulting therefrom, including, without limitation, any loss or cost (excluding lost profits) in liquidating or employing deposits from third parties, but excluding loss of margin for the period after such payment or conversion or failure to borrow, prepay, convert or continue;

CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES
Section 8.01.
Basis for Determining Interest Rate Inadequate or Unfair
. If on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period for any Eurocurrency Loan in any Agreed Currency:
(a)
    
the Agent is advised by Lenders having 50% or more of the aggregate amount of the Commitments that deposits in such Agreed Currency (in the applicable amounts) are not being offered to such Lenders in the relevant market for such Interest Period, or
(b)
    
Lenders having 50% or more of the aggregate amount of the Commitments advise the Agent that the Eurocurrency Rate for such Agreed Currency, as determined by the Agent will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding their Eurocurrency Loans in such Agreed Currency for such Interest Period,
the Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders, whereupon until the Agent notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, (i) the obligations of the Lenders to make Eurocurrency Loans in such Agreed Currency or to continue or convert outstanding Loans as or into Eurocurrency Loans in such Agreed Currency shall be suspended and (ii) each outstanding Eurocurrency Loan in such Agreed Currency shall be converted into a Base Rate Loan on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto. Unless the Borrower notifies the Agent at least two Business Days before the date of any Eurocurrency Advance in the applicable Agreed Currency for which a Borrowing Notice has previously been given that it elects not to borrow on such date (x) if such Eurocurrency Advance in such Agreed Currency is a Ratable Advance, such Advance shall
 
45
 
 
instead be made as a Base Rate Advance and (y) if such Eurocurrency Advance in such Agreed Currency is a Eurocurrency Bid Rate Advance, the Eurocurrency Bid Rate Loans comprising such Advance shall bear interest for each day from and including the first day to but excluding the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto at the Alternate Base Rate for such day.
Section 8.02.
Illegality

Before giving any notice to the Agent pursuant to this Section, such Lender shall designate a different Eurocurrency Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice and will not, in the judgment of such Lender, be otherwise significantly disadvantageous to such Lender. If such notice is given, each Eurocurrency Loan of such Lender in the applicable Agreed Currency then outstanding shall be converted to a Base Rate Loan either (i) on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable to such Eurocurrency Loan in such Agreed Currency if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain and fund such Loan as a Eurocurrency Loan in such Agreed Currency to such day or (ii) immediately if such Lender shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain and fund such Loan as a Eurocurrency Loan in such Agreed Currency to such day. Interest and principal on any such Base Rate Loan shall be payable on the same dates as, and on a pro rata basis with, the interest and principal payable on the related Eurocurrency Loans in the applicable Agreed Currency of the other Lenders.

Section 2.17
), special deposit, insurance assessment or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) or any LC Issuer or shall impose on any Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) or any
 
46
 
 
LC Issuer or on the United States market for certificates of deposit or the London interbank market any other condition affecting its Eurocurrency Loans, its Note, the Facility LCs or its obligation to make Eurocurrency Loans or to issue or participate in Facility LCs and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) or such LC Issuer of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loan or issuing or participating in Facility LCs, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) or such LC Issuer under this Agreement or under its Note with respect thereto, by an amount deemed by such Lender or such LC Issuer to be material, then, within 15 days after demand by such Lender or such LC Issuer (with a copy to the Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender or such LC Issuer such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such LC Issuer for such increased cost or reduction.
(b)
    
If any Lender or any LC Issuer shall have determined that, after (i) the date hereof, in the case of any Ratable Loan or any obligation to make Ratable Loans or (ii) the date of the related Competitive Bid Quote, in the case of any Competitive Bid Loan, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change in any such law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on capital of such Lender or such LC Issuer (or its Parent) as a consequence of such Lender's or such LC Issuer's obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender (or its Parent) or such LC Issuer could have achieved but for such adoption, change, request or directive (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender or such LC Issuer to be material, then from time to time, within 15 days after demand by such Lender or such LC Issuer (with a copy to the Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender or such LC Issuer such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such LC Issuer (or its Parent) for such reduction.
(c)
    
Each Lender and each LC Issuer will promptly notify the Borrower and the Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle such Lender or such LC Issuer to compensation pursuant to this Section and will designate a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the judgment of such Lender or such LC Issuer, be otherwise significantly disadvantageous to such Lender or such LC Issuer. A certificate of any Lender or any LC Issuer claiming compensation under this Section and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining such amount, such Lender or such LC Issuer may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.

provided
that, if the Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes or Other Taxes from any such payments, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions, (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law and (iv) the Borrower shall furnish to the Agent, at its address referred to in

Section 8.04(f)
requires the disclosure of information, other than information necessary to compute the tax payable and information required on the date of the Agreement by Internal Revenue Service form W-8ECI or W-8BEN, that a Lender or an LC Issuer reasonably considers to be confidential, such Lender or such LC Issuer shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and shall not be obligated to include in such form or document such confidential information.

(a) All notices, requests and other communications to any party hereunder shall be in writing (including bank wire, facsimile transmission or similar writing) and shall be given to such party: (i) in the case of the Borrower or the Agent, at its address or facsimile number set forth on the signature pages hereof, (ii) in the case of any Lender, at its address or facsimile number set forth in its Administrative Questionnaire or (iii) in the case of any party, such other address or facsimile number as such party may hereafter specify for the purpose by notice to the Agent and the Borrower. Each such notice, request or other communication shall be effective (A) if given by facsimile transmission, when transmitted to the facsimile number specified in this Section and confirmation of receipt is received, (B) if given by mail, 72 hours after such communication is deposited in the mails with first class postage prepaid, addressed as aforesaid or (C) if given by any other means, when delivered at the address specified in this Section;
provided

or
Article 8
shall not be effective until received.
(b)
    
In addition to the foregoing, notices and other communications to the Lenders and the LC Issuers hereunder may be delivered or furnished by electronic communication (including e-mail and internet or intranet websites) pursuant to procedures approved by the Agent or as otherwise determined by the Agent,
provided
that the foregoing shall not apply to notices to any Lender or any LC Issuer pursuant to
Article 2
(in which case such Lender shall be entitled to receive hard copies of such notices or communications) if such Lender or such LC Issuer, as applicable, has notified the Agent that it is incapable of receiving notices under such Article by electronic communication. The Agent or the Borrower may, in its respective discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by it or as it otherwise determines,
provided
that such determination or approval may be limited to particular notices or communications. Unless the Agent otherwise prescribes, (i) notices and other communications
 
50
 
 
sent to an e-mail address shall be deemed received upon the sender's receipt of an acknowledgement from the intended recipient (such as by the "return receipt requested" function, as available, return e-mail or other written acknowledgement),
provided
that if such notice or other communication is not given during the normal business hours of the recipient, such notice or communication shall be deemed to have been given at the opening of business on the next Business Day for the recipient, and (ii) notices or communications posted to an Internet or intranet website shall be deemed received upon the deemed receipt by the intended recipient at its e-mail address as described in the foregoing clause (i) of notification that such notice or communication is available and identifying the website address therefor;
provided
,
further
, that the Agent, the Borrower or any Lender party hereto may specify multiple e-mail addresses for receipt of any notices or communications by such means, and receipt by any one of such multiple e-mail addressees as set forth above shall be deemed to have been received by the Agent, the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be.
(c)
    
Any party hereto may change its address or facsimile number for notices and other communications hereunder by notice to the other parties hereto or, in the case of any Lender, by notice to the Agent and the Borrower.
Section 9.02.
No Waivers
. No failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.
Section 9.03.
Expenses; Indemnification
. (a) The Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Agent, including reasonable fees and disbursements of special counsel for the Agent, in connection with the preparation and administration of this Agreement, any waiver or consent hereunder or any amendment hereof or any Default or alleged Default hereunder and (ii) if an Event of Default occurs, all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Agent, each LC Issuer and each Lender, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel, in connection with such Event of Default and collection, bankruptcy, insolvency and other enforcement proceedings resulting therefrom.
(b)
    
The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Agent, each LC Issuer and each Lender, their respective affiliates and the respective directors, officers, agents and employees of the foregoing (each an "
Indemnitee
") and hold each Indemnitee harmless from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses of any kind, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel, which may be incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with any investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding (whether or not such Indemnitee shall be designated a party thereto) brought or threatened relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any Commitment hereunder or any actual or proposed use of proceeds of Credit Extensions hereunder;
provided
that no Indemnitee shall have the right to be indemnified hereunder for such Indemnitee's own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.
Section 9.04.
Sharing of Set-Offs
. Each Lender agrees that if it shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, receive payment of a proportion of the aggregate
 
51
 
 
amount of principal and interest then due and payable with respect to any Credit Extension (other than payments of principal or interest on Competitive Bid Loans at a time when no Event of Default is continuing) held by it which is greater than the proportion received by any other Lender in respect of the aggregate amount of principal and interest then due and payable with respect to any Credit Extension (other than payments of principal or interest on Competitive Bid Loans at a time when no Event of Default is continuing) held by such other Lender, the Lender receiving such proportionately greater payment shall purchase such participations in the Credit Extensions (other than payments of principal or interest on Competitive Bid Loans at a time when no Event of Default is continuing) held by the other Lenders, and such other adjustments shall be made, as may be required so that all such payments of principal and interest then due and payable with respect to the Credit Extensions (other than payments of principal or interest on Competitive Bid Loans at a time when no Event of Default is continuing) held by the Lenders shall be shared by the Lenders pro rata;
provided
that nothing in this Section shall impair the right of any Lender to exercise any right of set-off or counterclaim it may have and to apply the amount subject to such exercise to the payment of indebtedness of the Borrower other than its indebtedness hereunder. The Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any holder of a participation in a Credit Extension, whether or not acquired pursuant to the foregoing arrangements, may exercise rights of set-off or counterclaim and other rights with respect to such participation as fully as if such holder of a participation were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
Section 9.05.
Amendments and Waivers
. Any provision of this Agreement or the Loan Documents may be amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed by the Borrower and the Required Lenders (or the Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders);
provided
that no such amendment or waiver shall:
(a)
    
(x) unless signed by all the Lenders directly affected thereby, (i) increase or decrease the Commitment of any Lender (except for a ratable decrease in the Commitments of all the Lenders and except for an increase in the Commitments in accordance with
Section 2.01.2
) or subject any Lender to any additional obligation, (ii) reduce the principal of or, except as set forth in
Section 2.10
, rate of interest on any Loan or any Reimbursement Obligation or any fees hereunder or (iii) postpone the date fixed for any payment of principal of or interest on any Loan or Reimbursement Obligation or any fees hereunder or for the termination of any Commitment or extend the expiry date of any Facility LC to a date after the Facility Termination Date or (y) unless signed by each Lender, (i) change the percentage of the Commitments or the Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure which shall be required for the Lenders or any of them to take any action under this Section or any other provision of this Agreement or (ii) change
Section 9.04
in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby; or
(b)
    
unless signed by a Designated Lender or its Designating Lender, subject such Designated Lender to any additional obligation or affect its rights hereunder (unless the rights of all the Lenders hereunder are similarly affected).
No amendment of any provision of this Agreement affecting the rights or duties of the Agent shall be effective without the written consent of the Agent, no amendment of any provision relating to any LC Issuer shall be effective without the written consent of such LC Issuer, and no amendment of any provision of this Agreement relating to any Swing Line Lender
 
52
 
 
or any Swing Line Loans shall be effective without the written consent of the applicable Swing Line Lenders.
Section 9.06.
Successors and Assigns
. (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns, except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights under this Agreement without the prior written consent of all Lenders.
(b)
    
Any Lender may at any time grant to one or more banks or other institutions (each a "
Participant
") participating interests in its Commitment or any or all of its Outstanding Credit Exposure. In the event of any such grant by a Lender of a participating interest to a Participant, whether or not upon notice to the Borrower and the Agent, such Lender shall remain responsible for the performance of its obligations hereunder, and the Borrower and the Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement pursuant to which any Lender may grant such a participating interest shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right and responsibility to enforce the obligations of the Borrower hereunder including, without limitation, the right to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;
provided
that such participation agreement may provide that such Lender will not agree to any modification, amendment or waiver of this Agreement described in
Section 9.05(a)(x)(i), (ii), or (iii)
without the consent of the Participant. The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall, to the extent provided in its participation agreement, be entitled to the benefits of
Article 8
with respect to its participating interest. An assignment or other transfer which is not permitted by subsection (c) or (d) below shall be given effect for purposes of this Agreement only to the extent of a participating interest granted in accordance with this subsection (b).
(c)
    
Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more banks or other institutions (each an "
Assignee
") all, or a proportionate part (equivalent to an initial Commitment of not less than $10,000,000) of all, of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and any Loan Document, and such Assignee shall assume such rights and obligations, pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption Agreement in substantially the form of
Exhibit D
hereto executed by such Assignee and such transferor Lender, with (and subject to) the subscribed consent of the Borrower and the Agent;
provided
that (i) if an Assignee is an affiliate of such transferor Lender or was a Lender immediately prior to such assignment, such consents may not be unreasonably withheld and (ii) the Borrower's consent shall not be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; and
provided
,
further
, that such assignment may, but need not, include rights of the transferor Lender in respect of outstanding Competitive Bid Loans. Upon execution and delivery of such instrument and payment by such Assignee to such transferor Lender of an amount equal to the purchase price agreed between such transferor Lender and such Assignee, such Assignee shall be a Lender party to this Agreement with respect to the interest assigned and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Lender with a Commitment as set forth in such instrument of assumption, and the transferor Lender shall be released from its obligations hereunder to a corresponding extent, and no further consent or action by any party shall be required. Upon the consummation of any assignment pursuant to this subsection (c), the transferor Lender, the Agent and the Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements so that, if required, a new Note is issued to the Assignee. In connection with any such assignment (other
 
53
 
 
than an assignment to an affiliate of the transferor Lender), the transferor Lender shall pay to the Agent an administrative fee for processing such assignment in the amount of $3,500. If the Assignee is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof, it shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent certification as to exemption from deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes in accordance with
Section 8.04
.
(d)
    
Any Lender may at any time assign all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and its Note, if any, to a Federal Reserve Bank. No such assignment shall release the transferor Lender from its obligations hereunder.
(e)
    
No Assignee, Participant or other transferee of any Lender's rights shall be entitled to receive any greater payment under
Section 8.03
or
8.04
than such Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the rights transferred, unless such transfer is made with the Borrower's prior written consent or by reason of the provisions of
Section 8.02
,
8.03
or
8.04
requiring such Lender to designate a different Applicable Lending Office under certain circumstances or at a time when the circumstances giving rise to such greater payment did not exist.
Section 9.07.
Designated Lenders
. (a) Subject to the provisions of this
Section 9.07(a)
, any Lender may from time to time elect to designate an Eligible Designee to provide all or a portion of the Ratable Loans and/or Competitive Bid Loans to be made by such Lender pursuant to this Agreement;
provided
that such designation shall not be effective unless the Borrower and the Agent consent thereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. When a Lender and its Eligible Designee shall have signed an agreement substantially in the form of
Exhibit E
hereto (a "
Designation Agreement
") and the Borrower and the Agent shall have signed their respective consents thereto, such Eligible Designee shall become a Designated Lender for purposes of this Agreement. The Designating Lender shall thereafter have the right to permit such Designated Lender to provide all or a portion of the Ratable Loans and/or Competitive Bid Loans to be made by such Designating Lender pursuant to
Section 2.01
or
2.03
, and the making of such Ratable Loans and/or Competitive Bid Loans or portions thereof shall satisfy the obligation of the Designating Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Ratable Loans and/or Competitive Bid Loans or portion thereof were made by the Designating Lender. As to any Ratable Loans and/or Competitive Bid Loans or portion thereof made by it, each Designated Lender shall have all the rights that a Lender making such Ratable Loans and/or Competitive Bid Loans or portion thereof would have had under this Agreement and otherwise;
provided
that (x) its voting rights under this Agreement shall be exercised solely by its Designating Lender and (y) its Designating Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including its obligations in respect of the Ratable Loans and/or Competitive Bid Loans or portion thereof made by it. No additional Note shall be required to evidence Ratable Loans and/or Competitive Bid Loans or portions thereof made by a Designated Lender; and the Designating Lender shall be deemed to hold its Note, if any, as agent for its Designated Lender to the extent of the Ratable Loans and/or Competitive Bid Loans or portion thereof funded by such Designated Lender. Each Designating Lender shall act as administrative agent for its Designated Lender and give and receive notices and other communications on its behalf. Any payments for the account of any Designated Lender shall be paid to its Designating Lender as administrative agent for such Designated Lender and neither the Borrower nor the Agent shall be responsible for any Designating Lender's application of
 
54
 
 
such payments. In addition, any Designated Lender may (i) with notice to, but without the prior written consent of the Borrower or the Agent, assign all or portions of its interest in any Ratable Loans and/or Competitive Bid Loans to its Designating Lender or to any financial institutions consented to by the Borrower and the Agent providing liquidity and/or credit facilities to or for the account of such Designated Lender to support the funding of Ratable Loans and/or Competitive Bid Loans or portions thereof made by such Designated Lender and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its Ratable Loans and/or Competitive Bid Loans or portions thereof to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any guarantee, surety, credit or liquidity enhancement to such Designated Lender to the extent permitted by
Section 9.09
.
(b)
    
Each party to this Agreement agrees that it will not institute against, or join any other Person in instituting against, any Designated Lender any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceeding or other proceeding under any federal or state bankruptcy or similar law, for one year and a day after all outstanding senior indebtedness of such Designated Lender is paid in full. The Designating Lender for each Designated Lender agrees to indemnify, save, and hold harmless each other party hereto for any loss, cost, damage and expense arising out of its inability to institute any such proceeding against such Designated Lender. This
Section 9.07(b)
shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
Section 9.08.
Collateral
. Each of the Lenders represents to the Agent and each of the other Lenders that it in good faith is not relying upon any "margin stock" (as defined in Regulation U) as collateral in the extension or maintenance of the credit provided for in this Agreement.
Section 9.09.
Confidentiality
. The Agent, the LC Issuers and the Lenders each agree to hold any confidential information which it may receive from the Borrower in connection with this Agreement in confidence, except for disclosure (a) to its affiliates and to the Agent and any other Lender and their respective affiliates, (b) to legal counsel, accountants, and other professional advisors to such Lender or to a Participant or Assignee to which disclosure would be permitted under clause (f)(ii) below (it being understood that, to the extent such Persons do not have fiduciary duties of confidentiality to the Agent, the LC Issuer or the Lender making such disclosure, such Persons will be informed of the confidential nature of such information and instructed to keep such information confidential), (c) to regulatory officials, (d) to any Person as requested pursuant to or as required by law, regulation, or legal process, (e) in connection with any legal proceeding relating hereto or to the exercise of remedies or the enforcement or rights hereunder, (f)(i) to its actual or prospective contractual counterparties in swap agreements relating to the Borrower and its obligations or to legal counsel, accountants and other professional advisors to such counterparties or (ii) to prospective Participants and Assignees, in each case that agree in writing to be bound by this
Section 9.09
or similar confidentiality provisions, and (g) to rating agencies if requested or required by such agencies in connection with a rating relating to the Advances hereunder. The Borrower agrees that from and after the date hereof the terms of this
Section 9.09
shall set forth the entire agreement between the Borrower and each Lender (including the Agent) and each LC Issuer with respect to any confidential information previously or hereafter received by such Lender or such LC Issuer in connection with this Agreement, and this
Section 9.09
shall supersede any and all prior
 
55
 
 
confidentiality agreements entered into by such Lender or such LC Issuer with respect to such confidential information.
Section 9.10.
USA PATRIOT ACT NOTIFICATION
. The following notification is provided to Borrower pursuant to Section 326 of the USA Patriot Act of 2001, 31 U.S.C. Section 5318:
IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT. To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person or entity that opens an account, including any deposit account, treasury management account, loan, other extension of credit, or other financial services product. What this means for the Borrower: When the Borrower opens an account, the Agent, the LC Issuers and the Lenders will ask for the Borrower's name, tax identification number, business address, and other information that will allow the Agent, the LC Issuers and the Lenders to identify the Borrower. The Agent, the LC Issuers and the Lenders may also ask to see the Borrower's legal organizational documents or other identifying documents.
Section 9.11.

THE BORROWER IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY OBJECTION WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A COURT AND ANY CLAIM THAT ANY SUCH PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.
Section 9.12.
Waiver of Jury Trial
. THE BORROWER, THE AGENT, EACH LC ISSUER AND EACH LENDER HEREBY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER (WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR CONNECTED WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED HEREUNDER.
Section 9.13.
Counterparts; Integration
. This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.

EMERSON REPORTS STRONG SECOND-QUARTER 2006 RESULTS
 
ST. LOUIS, May 2, 2006  Emerson (NYSE: EMR) announced net sales for the second quarter ended March 31, 2006 were $4.9 billion, an increase of 15 percent over the $4.2 billion reported in the prior year. Net earnings for the second quarter increased 25 percent to $434 million, or $1.05 per share. This represents a 27 percent increase in earnings per share from the $0.83 earned in the same period last year. For the six months ended March 31, 2006 sales were $9.4 billion, a 15 percent increase from the same period last year. This helped to generate earnings per share of $2.01 for the first six months of 2006, a 31 percent increase from the prior year.
The Company achieved underlying sales growth of 14 percent in the quarter, excluding the impact of unfavorable exchange rates (2 percent) and growth from acquisitions (3 percent). This exceptional sales growth demonstrates the superior growth profile of Emerson's businesses, with sales growth in all five business segments and double-digit increases from four of the five segments, as shown below:

"Emerson's second quarter performance is a continuation of the very strong results achieved over the last year and is due to our continued focus on the eight strategic initiatives that are driving exceptional organic growth," said David N. Farr, chairman, chief executive officer and president. "Global economic conditions continue to provide a favorable background for Emerson's businesses. Our solid strategic position across the markets we serve and the dedication of thousands of employees all over the world helped make these great results possible," Farr said.
"Our second quarter operating profit margin improved to 15.0 percent from 14.4 percent in the prior period. Margins improved in four of the five business segments, largely as a result of leverage on the volume increases and benefits from prior restructuring activities, which were partially offset by higher pension costs. Pretax margins improved to 12.9 percent from 11.8 percent in the prior period. Emerson's procurement organization is sharply focused on containing the inflationary pressures on key commodities, namely steel, copper, and aluminum. This continues to be a challenge and requires that we initiate selective price increases in order to help offset material increases."

States and Europe. Robust activity in the oil, gas, mining, and metals markets drove growth in the alternator, electrical distribution, and mechanical power transmission businesses.
Balance Sheet / Cash Flow
Operating cash flow was $549 million in the second quarter of 2006, an increase of 24 percent from the second quarter of 2005. The increase was driven by the earnings growth in the quarter and continued execution on working capital improvement programs. Emerson continues to manage the demands for working capital during this period of strong sales growth. The success of these programs is evidenced by the ratio of trade working capital to sales, which dropped to 18.6 percent in the current quarter compared to 20.2 percent in the same period last year.

2006 Outlook
The strong order growth and financial performance for the first half of the year has strengthened the outlook for the full year. Emerson now expects consolidated sales growth in the range of 12 percent to 15 percent, driven by strong underlying sales growth (excluding foreign currency translation and acquisitions), which is now expected to be in the range of 10 percent to 12 percent. Based on this higher level of sales we now expect earnings per share in the range of $4.25 to $4.35, an increase over our prior EPS guidance range of $4.10 to $4.30. This updated outlook includes the sales and earnings per share impact of acquiring Artesyn Technologies, which is expected to add sales of approximately $200 million and be dilutive to earnings per share by $0.02 to $0.03 as we integrate Artesyn with our existing embedded power business. Additionally, we expect operating cash flow for the full year of approximately $2.5 billion.
