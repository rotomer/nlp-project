(Percent change. Trailing 3-month average versus prior year.)
 
 
 
September 2006 Order Comments:
 
As expected and as previously forecasted, order growth moderated to the range of 5 to 10 percent for the three months ended in September as the Climate Technologies business softened. Favorable currency exchange rates contributed approximately 1 percentage point to the increase.
 
Process Management orders remained strong across the segment. The broad capabilities of this segment and strong end market conditions continued to drive above-market growth rates.
 
Orders for Industrial Automation remained strong driven by a favorable global capital spending environment. The growth for this segment was broad based with particular strength from the power generating alternator and electronic drives businesses.

Network Power growth moderated for the three months ended in September with steady order growth led by the power systems and inbound power businesses. The North American telecom business has been affected by capital spending delays due to consolidations in the customer base.
 
Climate Technologies order trends moderated compared to August as the domestic residential air-conditioning business continued to move into a period of more difficult comparisons. The European market continued to have solid growth.
 
Appliance and Tools order growth moderated slightly. Growth was led by the tools and storage business.

EMERSON SALES TOP $20 BILLION IN 2006;
EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $4.48
Quarterly dividend increased 18 percent to $0.525 per share,
2-for-1 stock split declared
 
ST. LOUIS, November 7, 2006  Emerson (NYSE: EMR) today announced record net sales for fiscal 2006 of $20.1 billion, an increase of 16 percent from the prior year. Sales for the fourth quarter ended September 30, 2006 were $5.5 billion, an increase of 19 percent over the $4.6 billion reported in the same period last year. The Company achieved underlying sales growth in the quarter of 11 percent, which excludes increases of 6 percent for acquisitions and 2 percent for favorable exchange rates.
"The sales performance for both the year and the fourth quarter was exceptional," said Emerson Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President David N. Farr. "Customer adoption of our technologies has been strong all year, and our global platforms enabled Emerson to capture accelerating growth outside the United States during the fourth quarter."
Earnings per share in the fourth quarter of $1.29 represented an increase of 28 percent over the $1.01 achieved in the fourth quarter of 2005. The

earnings increase was driven primarily by leverage on higher sales volumes and benefits from prior cost reduction activities. Results in the fourth quarter of 2006 included a pretax gain of $31 million, or $0.05 per share, related to the sale during the quarter of the Buehler materials testing business. This business had been part of the Industrial Automation segment.
For fiscal 2006 earnings per share rose 32 percent to $4.48 from the $3.40 reported in 2005. In 2005, the Company recognized a tax expense of $63 million, or $0.15 per share, related to repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act. Excluding this expense, 2006 earnings per share increased 26 percent over 2005.
"Emerson had a great year in 2006 and achieved some significant milestones," Farr said. "Our long-term focus on growth platforms has paid off as revenue exceeded the $20 billion mark for the first time. This year also marked the 50 consecutive year of dividend increases for the Company. We are proud of these accomplishments and the value creation they have generated for our shareholders over many years."
th
Balance Sheet / Cash Flow
Operating cash flow was $2.5 billion in 2006, a 15 percent increase from 2005. Of this record operating cash flow, 63 percent was returned to shareholders during the year in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Managing increasing working capital needs as our business expands is an important element of cash management. Emerson saw continued improvement in working capital efficiency as the average days-in-the-cash-cycle improved from 71 days in fiscal 2005 to 65 days in fiscal 2006. Return on total capital, a key measure of earnings and balance sheet performance, increased by 290 basis points to 18.4 percent in 2006.
"Emerson maintains a sharp focus on having a strong and flexible balance sheet. Generating significant amounts of cash and putting that cash to the proper use is at the heart of how we create value for our shareholders," Farr said.

Fiscal 2006 Operating Highlights
Process Management's strong performance continued in 2006 as sales increased 16 percent to $4.9 billion. Underlying sales growth was 13 percent, led by 15 percent growth in the United States and Asia and 20 percent growth in Latin America. Reported sales included a 3 percent positive impact from acquisitions. Emerson Process Management continued to be recognized as the industry technology leader in 2006 as it was again named the best supplier of process management technologies in the CONTROL magazine's Readers' Choice Awards and was recognized by Frost & Sullivan as the Industrial Automation and Process Control Company of the Year. Margins for this business expanded by 200 basis points to 18.0 percent, driven primarily by leverage on sales volume increases.
Industrial Automation experienced another strong year as global capital spending remained favorable for these businesses. Total sales were $3.8 billion, an increase of 16 percent versus the prior year. Underlying sales growth was 11 percent, with balanced growth from the United States (12 percent), Europe (10 percent) and Asia (13 percent). Reported sales growth included a positive acquisition impact of 6 percent and an unfavorable currency impact of 1 percent. The margin for this segment was 15.1 percent, an increase of 80 basis points from 2005. The margin improvement reflects primarily leverage on higher sales and benefits from prior cost reduction activities.
Network Power sales were $4.4 billion in 2006, an increase of 31 percent versus the prior year. Underlying sales growth was 21 percent with the strongest growth coming from Asia (37 percent) and the United States (22 percent). Reported sales growth included a positive acquisition impact of 10 percent. End markets were strong across this segment with particular strength in the computing and data-center markets, which led to strong growth in the AC power system and precision cooling businesses. The margin for this segment was 11.1 percent, a 10 basis point decline versus the prior year. The margin decrease was primarily the result of dilution from acquisitions.
Climate Technologies sales for the year increased 13 percent to $3.4 billion. Underlying sales growth was 13 percent with the strongest growth

coming from the United States (14 percent) and Europe (20 percent). The Copeland Scroll compressor was a main driver of growth for this segment as it continued to provide energy efficiency benefits to customers in heating, ventilation and air-conditioning applications around the world. The 2006 margin for this segment was 15.3 percent, a 40 basis point improvement from 2005. Sales volume leverage and cost reduction activity were able to offset the unfavorable impact of commodity and other inflation.
Appliance and Tools achieved sales of $4.3 billion, an increase of 8 percent which included underlying sales growth of 6 percent. The growth was led by strength in the tools and storage businesses and modest growth from the motors and appliance component businesses. Reported sales included a favorable impact of 2 percent from acquisitions. The margin for this segment was 12.8 percent, a decrease of 50 basis points as significant material costs and other inflation could not be offset by price increases and cost reductions.
Dividend Increase and 2-for-1 Stock Split
The Board of Directors has voted to increase the quarterly cash dividend from forty-four and one-half cents ($0.445) to fifty-two and one-half cents ($0.525) per share of common stock, payable December 11, 2006 to shareholders of record on November 17, 2006. This represents an increase of 18 percent.
The Board of Directors also approved a 2-for-1 stock split in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend. The stock dividend will be payable December 11, 2006 to shareholders of record on November 17, 2006. The cash dividend will be paid on a pre-split basis.
"Emerson is committed to delivering value to our shareholders," Farr said. "By increasing our cash returns to shareholders and paying a stock dividend, we make ownership of Emerson shares more attractive to a broader base of investors."

Fiscal 2007 Outlook
 
The outlook for Emerson remains positive moving into fiscal 2007. Many of Emerson's end markets remain strong, but a moderation in growth rates is expected when compared to 2006. Underlying sales growth for fiscal 2007 is expected to be in the range of 5 to 7 percent. Reported sales growth is expected to be in the range of 7 to 11 percent. Based on this level of sales growth, the Company expects to generate 2007 earnings per share growth in the range of 12 to 15 percent above the $4.48 per share earned in 2006.
First-quarter 2007 comparisons with prior year results will be affected by two key factors that were disclosed during the first quarter of 2006. Restructuring expense was unusually low during the first quarter of 2006, which benefited earnings in that period by approximately $0.03 per share. Also, the Climate Technologies business experienced unusually strong demand as a result of customer order patterns before the implementation of new energy efficiency standards, which also benefited earnings by approximately $0.03 per share.
