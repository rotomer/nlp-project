Emerson GAAP Underlying Orders  3 Month Summary
(Percent change. Trailing 3-month average versus prior year.)
 
 
 
January 2007 Order Comments:
 
Order growth remained solid led by strength from the capital goods businesses. Favorable currency exchange rates contributed nearly 3 percentage points to the increase.
 
Process Management orders remained strong as robust capital spending by the global energy markets continued to drive order growth in the valve, measurement and systems businesses.
 
Order growth for Industrial Automation remained at high levels. Growth for this segment was strong in Europe and continued to be led by the power generating alternator and electronic drives businesses. Orders also benefited from the weaker dollar.
 
Network Power order growth moderated to the 5 to 10 percent growth range. Growth remained strong in the uninterruptible power supply (UPS), precision cooling and China power systems businesses.
 
Climate Technologies order trends remained negative but improved modestly from the prior month. Order growth remained soft in the United States and was strong in Europe and Asia.
 
Appliance and Tools order growth remained in the 0 to 5 percent range. Strong growth in the tools business offset softness in the storage, motors and appliance businesses.
