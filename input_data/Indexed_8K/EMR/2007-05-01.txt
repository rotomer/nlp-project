Emerson GAAP Underlying Orders  3 Month Summary
(Percent change. Trailing 3-month average versus prior year.)
 
 
 
March 2007 Order Comments:
 
Order growth remained in the positive 5 to 10 percent range as order trends continued to match expectations. Favorable currency exchange rates contributed over 2 percentage points to the increase.
 
Process Management maintained double-digit order growth and continued to see balance across the portfolio with strength from the valve, measurement and systems businesses.
 
Order growth for Industrial Automation remained at high levels and was led by the power generating alternator and electrical distribution businesses. Orders also benefited from the weaker dollar.
 
Order growth increased for Network Power and continued to be led by the uninterruptible power supply (UPS), precision cooling and China power systems businesses.
 
Climate Technologies orders continued to trend positively as strength in Europe and Asia drove solid growth.
 
Appliance and Tools order growth remained in the 0 to 5 percent range. Strong growth in the tools business offset softness in the storage, motors and appliance businesses.

EMERSON REPORTS STRONG SECOND-QUARTER 2007 RESULTS
 
ST. LOUIS, May 1, 2007  Emerson (NYSE: EMR) announced net sales for the second quarter ended March 31, 2007 were $5.5 billion, an increase of 14 percent over the $4.9 billion reported in the prior year period. Net earnings for the second quarter increased 14 percent to $494 million, or $0.61 per share. This represents a 17 percent increase in earnings per share from the $0.52 earned in the same period last year.
The Company achieved underlying sales growth of more than 7 percent in the quarter, which excludes the impact of favorable exchange rates (over 2 percent) and growth from acquisitions, net of divestitures (4 percent). The growth was led by strong international results, where sales increased by 12 percent on an underlying basis.
"Emerson's second-quarter performance, on top of the excellent results achieved in the prior year quarter, demonstrates continued momentum for the Company. The top-line growth achieved in the quarter illustrates the broad geographic capabilities we have established through many years of investing to globalize Emerson," said Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, David N. Farr. "The global reach of Emerson, along with the diverse end-market exposures across the Company, allows us to achieve high levels of growth in spite of softness that may be experienced in certain regions or customer segments," Farr said.
Second-quarter operating profit margin improved to 15.2 percent from 15.0 percent in the prior year period. Segment margins improved in four of the five business

segments, largely as a result of leverage on the volume increases and benefits from prior cost reduction activities. Pretax margins improved to 13.3 percent from 12.9 percent in the prior year period. Commodity inflation remains persistent and has continued to put pressure on gross and operating profit margins.
Segment Highlights
Process Management delivered a strong quarter of sales and earnings performance. Reported sales grew by 18 percent which included an underlying sales increase of 11 percent and the favorable impact of currency translation (3 percent) and acquisitions (4 percent). Sales growth was balanced geographically, with underlying growth in the United States of 13 percent and 9 percent internationally. Orders rose at a double-digit rate in the quarter as strong capital spending in global energy markets continued to drive the growth. The margin for this segment expanded by 110 basis points to 17.7 percent. Margins for this segment have improved for more than two years due to leverage on sales volume increases as well as its technology leadership, global footprint, and cost reduction and productivity programs.
Industrial Automation reported its fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in reported and underlying sales. In the quarter, reported sales increased by 13 percent with 10 percent underlying growth, favorable currency translation of 4 percent and a 1 percent unfavorable impact from divestitures. Underlying international growth was 15 percent in the quarter, while the United States experienced 4 percent growth. The profit margin for this segment was 14.3 percent, an increase of 20 basis points from the prior year quarter.
Network Power sales grew 19 percent in the quarter, which included underlying sales growth of 6 percent, a favorable impact of 11 percent from acquisitions, net of divestitures, and 2 percent from currency translation. Growth remained strong in the core uninterruptible power supply (UPS), precision cooling and China power systems businesses, all of which experienced double-digit growth during the quarter. The margin for this segment was 12.3 percent versus 11.9 percent in the prior year quarter. Compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2007, the margin for this segment improved by 250 basis points as the segment is realizing the benefits of prior cost reduction efforts.

Climate Technologies sales increased 11 percent in the second quarter. Underlying sales increased more than 6 percent, acquisitions added 3 percent and currency translation added over 1 percent. Underlying sales in the United States were down nearly 3 percent reflecting slower residential construction rates and tough comparisons to the prior year period due to the 13-SEER transition. International growth for this segment was 23 percent as Europe and Asia both provided exceptional growth. Adoption of heat pump technologies in Europe continued to fuel strong compressor sales growth in this segment. The margin for this segment expanded 40 basis points driven primarily by benefits from prior cost reduction activities and lower restructuring spending.
Appliance and Tools sales grew 6 percent in the quarter which included more than 3 percent growth in underlying sales, reflecting higher sales prices and lower volume. Reported sales also included 1 percent favorable currency translation and 1 percent from acquisitions. Profitability for this segment declined by 210 basis points to 12.0 percent driven by deleverage on volume declines and the negative impact of store reset costs at the big-box retailers. These reset costs will drive sales growth in late 2007 and early 2008.
Balance Sheet / Cash Flow
Operating cash flow was $548 million in the second quarter of 2007, essentially flat compared to the prior year quarter. Improvements were made during the quarter on working capital programs. This is evidenced by the ratio of trade working capital as a percent of sales, which declined to 18.8 percent from 19.8 percent in the first quarter of 2007.
"Our progress during the second quarter on improving working capital performance is encouraging. We are executing on the plans put in place to drive a more efficient balance sheet. This allows Emerson to generate significant cash flows which fund internal growth programs, while also funding share repurchases and dividends for shareholders," Farr said. "Based on the second quarter results we still expect to generate 2007 operating cash flow of $2.7 billion, free cash flow of $2.0 billion and a return on total capital (ROTC) of approximately 19 percent."

2007 Outlook
The first half of fiscal 2007 has provided a strong foundation for the full year, with global economic conditions generally matching expectations. Order trends across the business have also remained supportive of our fiscal 2007 sales and earnings growth objectives. Based on these factors Emerson still expects full year underlying sales in the range of 5 to 7 percent, reported sales growth in the range of 9 to 11 percent and earnings per share in the range of $2.50 to $2.60.
