Emerson GAAP Underlying Orders  3 Month Summary
(Percent change. Trailing 3-month average versus prior year.)
 
 
 
April 2007 Order Comments:
 
Order growth increased to positive 10 percent for the three months ended in April. Orders continued to benefit from the weaker dollar as favorable currency exchange rates contributed nearly 4 percentage points to the increase.
 
Process Management maintained double-digit order growth led by spending from the global energy markets. Order growth was driven by strength from Europe, Asia and the Middle East.
 
Order growth for Industrial Automation remained at high levels and was led by the power generating alternator, electrical distribution and electronic drives businesses.
 
Order growth increased for Network Power and continued to be led by the uninterruptible power supply (UPS), precision cooling and China power systems businesses.
 
Climate Technologies orders continued to trend positively with moderate improvement in the United States and continued strength in Europe and Asia.
 
Appliance and Tools order growth remained in the 0 to 5 percent range driven by activity in the non-residential construction markets. Strong growth in the tools business offset softness in the storage and appliance businesses.
