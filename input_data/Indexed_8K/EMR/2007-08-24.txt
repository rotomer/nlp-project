Emerson GAAP Underlying Orders  3 Month Summary
(Percent change. Trailing 3-month average versus prior year.)
 
 
 
July 2007 Order Comments:
 
Order growth remained positive 5 to 10 percent for the three months ended in July as order rates remained strong in the capital goods and technology focused businesses, with softness in the consumer related businesses. Favorable currency exchange rates contributed approximately 3 percentage points to the order growth.
 
Process Management order growth increased to 15 percent and remained balanced across the valve, systems and measurement businesses.
 
Industrial Automation maintained 10 percent order growth driven by solid capital spending trends on a global basis. Orders also benefited from the weaker dollar.
 
Order growth for Network Power increased to 20 percent with continued strong growth across the power systems businesses and strength from the embedded power business.
 
Climate Technologies orders declined with continued softness in the North American housing markets and tough comparisons to the prior year. This softness was partially offset by expansion in the water heater controls industry, where Emerson won new business with a major OEM.
 
Appliance and Tools trends were consistent with the prior month, with softness from the consumer and residential related businesses partially offset by strength from the businesses exposed to non-residential construction.
