Emerson GAAP Underlying Orders  3 Month Summary
(Percent change. Trailing 3-month average versus prior year.)
 
 
September 2007 Order Comments:
 
Order trends remained solid for the three months ended in September. Orders moved up to the range of +10 to +15 percent and the favorable impact from currency exchange rates was 5 percent.
 
Process Management order growth remained strong. Growth was balanced across the segment with strength from the systems, measurement and valve businesses. Orders also benefited from the weaker dollar.
 
Industrial Automation maintained double digit growth, with particular strength from the electrical distribution and fluid automation businesses.
 
Order growth for Network Power remained strong and was led by the power systems, inbound power and embedded power businesses.
 
Climate Technologies orders improved compared to August with easier comparisons to the prior year. Market conditions in the United States remain soft, driven by continued weak demand from the residential housing market.
 
Appliance and Tools orders were negative in the quarter. Strength from the professional tools business was more than offset by weakness in the residential storage, motors and appliance component businesses.

EMERSON ACHIEVES RECORD 2007 RESULTS
 
Sales of $22.6 Billion, Earnings Per Share of $2.66 and
Return on Total Capital of 20.1 Percent
 
ST. LOUIS, November 6, 2007  Emerson (NYSE: EMR) today announced record net sales for fiscal 2007 of $22.6 billion, an increase of 12 percent from the prior year. Sales for the fourth quarter ended September 30, 2007 were $6.1 billion, an increase of 11 percent over the $5.5 billion reported in the same period last year. The Company achieved underlying sales growth in the quarter of 7 percent which excludes increases of 3 percent due to favorable currency exchange rates and 1 percent from acquisitions, net of divestitures.
Earnings per share for the fourth quarter of $0.78 represented an increase of 20 percent over the $0.65 achieved in the fourth quarter of 2006. The Company translated strong sales performance during the quarter into expanded operating profit margin, which was a key component of the 20 percent increase in earnings per share. Operating profit margin during the quarter was 16.6 percent, an improvement of 70 basis points from the prior year period. This improvement was driven by a continued focus on cost reduction programs and leverage on sales increases. Pretax earnings margin was 14.8 percent compared to 14.1 percent in the prior year period.

"Emerson had a great finish to 2007 and enters 2008 with solid momentum," said Emerson Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President David N. Farr. "End market conditions tracked expectations and the Company's ability to execute in this environment led to performance in sales, earnings and cash generation that exceeded our expectations."
For the year ended September 30, 2007, sales increased 12 percent to $22.6 billion. This strong performance was a result of 7 percent underlying sales growth, which is in line with Emerson's long-term objective of achieving underlying sales growth in the range of 5 to 7 percent. Currency translation added more than 2 percent and acquisitions, net of divestitures, added nearly 3 percent to reported sales growth. For fiscal 2007, earnings per share rose 19 percent to $2.66 from the $2.24 reported in 2006.
"Emerson's performance has been outstanding over the last five years," Farr said. "We have focused on the correct strategies to grow across the business platforms while also enhancing shareholder returns. This is a proven formula that Emerson will continue to follow as it pursues future opportunities."
Balance Sheet / Cash Flow
Operating cash flow was a record $3.0 billion in 2007, representing a 20 percent increase from 2006. Capital expenditures were $681 million in 2007, an increase of 13 percent from 2006 due primarily to capacity expansions at Climate Technologies and Process Management. Free cash flow (operating cash flow less capital expenditures) for the year was $2.3 billion, also a record amount and an increase of 22 percent from the prior year.
Continued focus on efficient use of working capital, especially in the face of strong underlying sales growth, helped to drive the strong cash flow performance. The ratio of trade working capital as a percent of sales improved to 16.2 percent from 16.5 percent in the prior year quarter. Return on total capital (ROTC), a key measure of earnings and balance sheet performance, increased by 170 basis points to 20.1 percent in fiscal 2007.

Based on the Company's continued strong cash generation and positive outlook for the future, the Board of Directors has voted to increase the quarterly cash dividend by 14 percent from twenty-six and one-quarter cents ($0.2625) to thirty cents ($0.30) per share of common stock. The dividend will be payable December 10, 2007 to shareholders of record on November 16, 2007.
"Emerson continued to execute well in 2007, despite weakness from certain parts of the economy during the year. The cash flow and return on total capital performance, as well as the ability to increase the dividend, demonstrate this execution clearly. Achieving these levels of returns and cash generation is significant and indicative of the value creation that continues to occur inside Emerson," Farr said.
Fiscal 2007 Operating Highlights
Process Management had a great year in 2007 with reported sales increasing 17 percent to $5.7 billion. Underlying sales growth for the year was 11 percent, which excludes favorable impacts from currency translation (4 percent) and acquisitions (2 percent). The margin for Process Management expanded by 70 basis points to 18.7 percent as it continued to deliver market-leading technology and achieve strong sales and earnings performance.
Industrial Automation had strong performance in 2007 with reported sales of $4.3 billion, an increase of 13 percent from the prior year. Underlying sales increased by 10 percent, led by strength in Europe. Reported sales included a 4 percent favorable impact from currency translation and a 1 percent unfavorable impact from divestitures. The margin for this segment was 15.6 percent compared to 15.1 percent in the prior year.
Network Power sales were $5.2 billion in 2007, an increase of 18 percent versus the prior year. Underlying sales growth was 9 percent led by strength in Asia. Reported sales growth included a positive impact from acquisitions of 7 percent and favorable currency translation of 2 percent. The margin for this segment was 12.5 percent, a 140 basis point improvement versus the prior year driven by sales volume leverage and benefits from cost reduction activities.
