October 2007 Order Comments:
 
Order trends remained solid for the three months ended in October, led by the capital goods and technology sector businesses. Favorable currency exchange rates contributed approximately 5 percentage points to the order growth.
 
Process Management order growth continued to benefit from global expansion of the energy sector. Growth was led by strength from the United States and Asia.
 
Industrial Automation remained strong, with particular strength from the power generating alternator and fluid automation businesses.
 
Order growth for Network Power was strong with growth led by the data center computing and telecommunications end markets.
 
Climate Technologies orders improved compared to the three months ended in September with growth led by strength in Asia.
 
Appliance and Tools orders were consistent with the prior month with strength from the professional tools business more than offset by weakness in the residential storage, motors and appliance component businesses.
