Emerson GAAP Underlying Orders  3 Month Summary
(Percent change. Trailing 3-month average versus prior year.)
 
 
January 2008 Order Comments:
 
Orders growth remained solid led by strength in Network Power for the three months ended in January. Favorable currency exchange rates contributed approximately 3 to 4 percentage points to the increase.
 
Process Management maintained high levels of order growth across the valve, systems and measurement businesses as the global energy markets continued to be strong.
 
Strength in the power transmission and fluid automation businesses contributed to overall strength in the Industrial Automation business segment. Orders also benefited from the weaker dollar.
 
Order growth for Network Power improved due to strong data-center computing and telecommunication end markets.
 
Climate Technologies order growth trends were positive, led by strength in Asia and in the controls businesses.
 
Appliance and Tools continued to be adversely impacted by weakness in consumer spending and residential investment, with strength from the professional tools business more than offset by weakness in appliance and motors.
