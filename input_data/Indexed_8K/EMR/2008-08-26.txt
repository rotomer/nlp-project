Emerson GAAP Underlying Orders  3 Month Summary
(Percent change. Trailing 3-month average versus prior year.)
 
 
July 2008 Order Comments:
 
Order growth trends remained strong at 10 percent for the three months ended in July. Orders continued to benefit from the weaker dollar as favorable currency exchange rates contributed approximately 4 percentage points to the increase.
 
Process Management orders strengthened as energy related market demand remained high. The geographic diversity, broad capabilities and market leading technologies of this segment continued to drive strong order growth rates.
 
Continued strength in the power generating alternator business contributed to overall order strength for the Industrial Automation business segment. Orders also benefited from the weaker dollar.
 
Network Power order growth moderated compared to the prior month as the business segment cycles into a period of more difficult comparisons. Strength in the China power systems business was offset by weakness in the financial sector end market and segments of the telecommunications end market.
 
Climate Technologies orders improved due to the hot weather in the United States and modest heat pump market recovery in Europe. Orders also benefited from more favorable comparisons to the prior year.
 
Weakness in U.S. residential investment and consumer spending continued to negatively impact the Appliance and Tools business segment.
