Debt Securities
Underwriting Agreement Standard Provisions
January 15, 2009
From time to time Emerson Electric Co. (the "
Company
") proposes to enter into one or more Pricing Agreements (each a "
Pricing Agreement
") in the form of Annex I hereto, with such additions and deletions as the parties thereto may determine, and, subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and therein, to issue and sell to the firms named in Schedule I to the applicable Pricing Agreement or named in the applicable Pricing Agreement (such firm or firms constituting the "
Underwriters
" with respect to such Pricing Agreement and the securities specified therein) certain of its debt securities (the "
Securities
") specified in Schedule II to such Pricing Agreement (with respect to such Pricing Agreement, the "
Designated Securities
").
The terms and rights of any particular issuance of Designated Securities shall be as specified in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto and in or pursuant to the Indenture (the "
Indenture
"), dated as of December 10, 1998, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (successor to The Bank of New York). The Pricing Agreement, including the provisions incorporated therein by reference, is herein referred to as the "
Underwriting Agreement
." Unless otherwise defined herein, terms defined in the Pricing Agreement are used herein as therein defined.
1.   Particular sales of Designated Securities may be made from time to time to the Underwriters of such Securities, for whom the firms designated as representatives of the Underwriters of such Securities in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto will act as representatives (the "
Representatives
"). The term "Representatives" also refers to a single firm acting as sole representative of the Underwriters and to Underwriters who act without any firm being designated as their representative. This Underwriting Agreement Standard Provisions shall not be construed as an obligation of the Company to sell any of the Securities or as an obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities. The obligation of the Company to issue and sell any of the Securities and the obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Securities shall be evidenced by the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities specified therein. Each Pricing Agreement shall specify the aggregate principal amount of such Designated Securities, the initial public offering price of such Designated Securities, the purchase price to the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the names of the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the names of the Representatives of such Underwriters and the principal amount of such Designated Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter and shall set forth the date, time and manner of delivery of such Designated Securities and payment therefor. The Pricing Agreement shall also specify (to the extent not set forth in the Indenture and the Registration Statement and Prospectus referred to below) the terms of such Designated Securities. A Pricing Agreement shall be in the form of an executed writing (which may be in counterparts), and may be evidenced by an exchange of telegraphic or facsimile communications or other electronic communications satisfactory to the parties which produce a record of communications transmitted. The obligations of the Underwriters under the Underwriting Agreement shall be several and not joint.

") in the forms heretofore delivered or to be delivered to the Representatives and, excluding exhibits to such registration statement, but including all documents incorporated by reference in the prospectus contained in such registration statement, to each of the other Underwriters and such registration statement in such form became effective upon being filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 462(e) of the Act, and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement has been issued and no proceeding for that purpose has been initiated or threatened by the Commission (such registration statement, including all exhibits thereto but excluding the Statement of Eligibility and Qualification on Form T-1, as amended at each time it became effective being hereinafter called the "

12
 
 
(ix)         The Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any further amendments and supplements thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; such counsel believes that (A) as of the effective date of the Registration Statement, the Registration Statement and the prospectus included therein (and, as of its date, any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery) (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no belief) did not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; (B) the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (and any such further amendment or supplement thereto) (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no belief), at the Time of Sale, did not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; (C) the Time of Sale Information (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no belief), at the Time of Sale or as amended or supplemented, if applicable, as of the Time of Delivery, did not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (D), as of the Time of Delivery, the Prospectus (and any such further amendment or supplement thereto) (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no belief) does not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and such counsel does not know of any contracts or other documents of a character required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or required to be incorporated by reference into the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented which are not filed or incorporated by reference or described as required; and

8.   (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Time of Sale Information, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Company information that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Time of Sale Information, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter of Designated Securities through the Representatives expressly for use in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to such Securities.
(b) Each Underwriter severally will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Time of Sale Information, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Time of Sale Information, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any
 
 
15
 
 
indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection or to the extent that it is not materially prejudiced by such omission. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other from the offering of the Designated Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party
 
 
16
 
 
in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Designated Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint.
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
9. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Designated Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Designated Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Designated Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Designated Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in the Underwriting Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities.
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Designated Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of
 
 
17
 
 
Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities and, in addition, to require each non defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Designated Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Designated Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non defaulting Underwriters to purchase Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 8 hereof, but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
10. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in the Underwriting Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
11. If any Pricing Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 9 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Designated Securities covered by such Pricing Agreement except as provided in Section 6 and Section 8 hereof; but, if for any other reason Designated Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all reasonable out of pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Securities except as provided in Section 6 and Section 8 hereof.
12. In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of Designated Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly or by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose in the Pricing Agreement.
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing or by telegram if promptly confirmed in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be sufficient in all respects if
 
 
18
 
 
delivered or sent by facsimile or registered mail to the address of the Representatives as set forth in the Pricing Agreement; and if to the Company shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered or sent by facsimile or registered mail to the address of the Company set forth in the Basic Prospectus: Attention: Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 8(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by registered mail to such Underwriter at its address as specified by such Underwriter to the Representatives, which address will be supplied to the Company by the Representatives upon request.
13. The Underwriting Agreement, including this Underwriting Agreement Standard Provisions and each Pricing Agreement, shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Section 8 and Section 10 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Underwriting Agreement Standard Provisions or any such Pricing Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
14. Time shall be of the essence of each Pricing Agreement.
15. This Underwriting Agreement Standard Provisions and each Pricing Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
16. Each Pricing Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto and thereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall, together with this Underwriting Agreement Standard Provisions, constitute one and the same instrument.
17. The Company hereby acknowledges that (a) the purchase and sale of the Designated Securities pursuant to any Pricing Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters and any affiliate through which it may be acting, on the other, (b) the Underwriters are acting as principal and not as an agent or fiduciary of the Company and (c) the Company's engagement of the Underwriters in connection with the offering and the process leading up to the offering is as independent contractors and not in any other capacity. Furthermore, the Company agrees that it is solely responsible for making its own judgments in connection with the offering (irrespective of whether any of the Underwriters has advised or is currently advising the Company on related or other matters). The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters have rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owe an agency, fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.

TRUSTEE'S CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION
 
This is one of the Securities described in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
 
 
EMERSON ELECTRIC CO.
4.875% Note Due 2019
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of unsecured debentures, notes or other evidence of indebtedness of the Issuer (hereinafter called the "Securities") of the series hereinafter specified, all issued or to be issued under and pursuant to an indenture dated as of December 10, 1998 (herein called the "Indenture"), duly executed and delivered by the Issuer to The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (successor to The Bank of New York) (herein called the "Trustee"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Issuer and the holders of the Securities. The Securities may be issued in one or more series, which different series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest (if any) at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions (if any), may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds (if any) and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided. This Note is one of a series designated as the 4.875% Notes Due 2019 of the Issuer, limited in aggregate principal amount to $500,000,000 (herein called the "Notes").
The Notes will be redeemable, in whole or from time to time in part, at the Issuer's option on any date (a "Redemption Date"), at a redemption price equal to the greater of (1) 100 percent of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed and (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (exclusive of interest accrued to that Redemption Date) discounted to that Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate (as defined below) plus 40 basis points, plus, in either case, accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to that Redemption Date; provided that installments of interest on the Notes which are due and payable on an Interest Payment Date falling on or prior to the relevant Redemption Date shall be payable to the holders of those Notes, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant record date according to their terms and the provisions of the Indenture.
"Treasury Rate"
means, with respect to any Redemption Date of the Notes, (1) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue (as defined below) (if no maturity is within three months before or after the maturity date, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue shall be determined and the Treasury Rate shall be interpolated or extrapolated from those yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month) or (2) if that release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain those yields, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity for the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price (as defined below) for that Redemption Date. The Treasury Rate shall be calculated on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date.
 
 
"
Comparable Treasury Issue"
means the United States Treasury security selected by the Independent Investment Banker (as defined below) as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Notes.
"
Independent Investment Banker"
means Banc of America Securities LLC or J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., or, if those firms are unwilling or unable to select the Comparable Treasury Issue, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Trustee after consultation with the Issuer.
"
Comparable Treasury Price"
means with respect to any Redemption Date for the Notes (1) the average of five Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for that Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations (as defined below), or (2) if the Trustee obtains fewer than five such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations
"Reference Treasury Dealer"
means (1) Banc of America Securities LLC or J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.,
and their respective successors, provided, however, that if the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Issuer shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer, and (2) any other Primary Treasury Dealers selected by the Issuer.
"
Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation"
means with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer (as defined above) and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by that Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding that Redemption Date.
Notice of any redemption by the Issuer will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before any Redemption Date to each holder of the Notes to be redeemed. If less than all the Notes are to be redeemed at the Issuer's option the Trustee shall select, in such manner as it shall deem fair and appropriate, the Notes to be redeemed in whole or in part.
If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, unless the Issuer has exercised its option to redeem the Notes as described above, the Issuer will be required to make an offer (the "Change of Control Offer") to each holder of the Notes to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of that holder's Notes on the terms set forth herein. In the Change of Control Offer, the Issuer will be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased to the date of repurchase (the "Change of Control Payment"). Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event or, at the Issuer's option, prior to the date of the consummation of any Change of Control, but after public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control the
 
Issuer will be required to mail a notice to holders of Notes, with a copy to the Trustee, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute or may constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Notes on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the "Change of Control Payment Date") pursuant to the procedures described in such notice and in conformity with the Indenture.
The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of the consummation of the Change of Control, state that the offer to purchase is conditioned on the Change of Control Triggering Event occurring on or prior to the payment date specified in the notice.
On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will be required, to the extent lawful: (a) accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (b) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered; and (c) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted together with an Officers' Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes being repurchased.
The paying agent will promptly mail or electronically deliver to each holder of Notes properly tendered the purchase price for the Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of any Notes surrendered; provided that each new Note will be in a principal amount of U.S. $1,000 or an integral multiple of U.S. $1,000 in excess thereof.
The Issuer will not be required to make the Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Issuer and such third party purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer. In addition, the Issuer will not repurchase any Notes if there has occurred and is continuing on the Change of Control Payment Date an Event of Default under the Indenture, other than a default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.
The Issuer must comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Triggering Event provisions of the Notes, the Issuer will comply with those securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture or the Change of Control Offer provisions of the Notes by virtue of any such conflicts.
For purposes of the Change of Control Offer provisions, the following terms are applicable:
"Change of Control"
means the occurrence of any of the following: (1) the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange
 
Act) (other than the Issuer or one of its subsidiaries) becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Issuer's Voting Stock or other Voting Stock into which the Issuer's Voting Stock is reclassified, consolidated, exchanged or changed, measured by voting power rather than number of shares; (2) the direct or indirect sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one or more series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the Issuer's assets and the assets of its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to one or more "Persons" (as that term is defined in the Indenture) (other than the Issuer or one of its subsidiaries); or (3) the first day on which a majority of the members of the Issuer's Board of Directors are not Continuing Directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction will not be deemed to involve a Change of Control if (1) the Issuer becomes a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of a holding company and (2)(A) the direct or indirect holders of the Voting Stock of such holding company immediately following that transaction are substantially the same as the holders of the Issuer's Voting Stock immediately prior to that transaction or (B) immediately following that transaction no Person (other than a holding company satisfying the requirements of this sentence) is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Voting Stock of such holding company.
"Change of Control Triggering Event"
means the occurrence of both a Change of Control and a Rating Event.
"Continuing Directors"
means, as of any date of determination, any member of the Issuer's Board of Directors who (1) was a member of such Board of Directors on the date the Notes were issued or (2) was nominated for election, elected or appointed to such Board of Directors with the approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors who were members of such Board of Directors at the time of such nomination, election or appointment (either by a specific vote or by approval of the Issuer's proxy statement in which such member was named as a nominee for election as a director, without objection to such nomination).
"Investment Grade Rating"
means a rating equal to or higher than Baa3 (or the equivalent) by Moody's and BBB- (or the equivalent) by S&P, and the equivalent investment grade credit rating from any additional rating agency or rating agencies selected by us.
"Moody's"
means Moody's Investors Service Inc.
"Rating Agencies"
means (1) each of Moody's and S&P; and (2) if either of Moody's or S&P ceases to rate the Notes or fails to make a rating of the Notes publicly available for reasons outside of the Issuer's control, a "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" within the meaning of Rule 15c3- 1 (c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act selected by the Issuer (as certified by a resolution of the Issuer's Board of Directors) as a replacement agency for Moody's or S&P, or both of them, as the case may be.
"Rating Event"
means the rating on the Notes is lowered by each of the Rating Agencies and the Notes are rated below an Investment Grade Rating by each of the Rating Agencies on any day within the 60-day period (which 60-day period will be extended so long as the rating of the Notes is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by any of the Rating Agencies) after the earlier of (1) the occurrence of a Change of Control and (2) public
 
notice of the occurrence of a Change of Control or the Issuer's intention to effect a Change of Control; provided, however, that a Rating Event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating will not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular Change of Control (and thus will not be deemed a Rating Event for purposes of the definition of Change of Control Triggering Event) if the Rating Agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing at the Issuer or its request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable Change of Control (whether or not the applicable Change of Control has occurred at the time of the Rating Event).
"S&P"
means Standard & Poor's Rating Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.
"Voting Stock"
means, with respect to any specified "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) as of any date, the capital stock of such person that is at the time entitled to vote generally in the election of the board of directors or similar governing body of such person.
In case an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof may be declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Issuer and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding (as defined in the Indenture) of all series to be affected (voting as one class), evidenced as in the Indenture provided, to execute supplemental indentures adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each such series;
provided, however
, that no such supplemental indenture shall (i) extend the final maturity of any Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof or any premium thereon, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of any interest thereon, or reduce any amount payable on redemption thereof or reduce the amount of the principal of an Original Issue Discount Security (as defined in the Indenture) payable upon acceleration thereof or the amount thereof provable in bankruptcy, or impair or affect the rights of any Holder to institute suit for the payment thereof, or, if the Securities provide therefor, any right of repayment at the option of the Holder, without the consent of the Holder of each Security so affected, or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Securities, the Holders of which are required to consent to any such supplemental indenture, without the consent of the Holder of each Security affected. It is also provided in the Indenture that, with respect to certain defaults or Events of Default regarding the Securities of any series, prior to any declaration accelerating the maturity of such Securities, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount Outstanding of the Securities of such series (or, in the case of certain defaults or Events of Default, all or certain series of the Securities) may on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series (or all or certain series of the Securities, as the case may be) waive any such past default or Event of Default and its consequences. The preceding sentence shall not, however, apply to a default in the payment of
 
the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any of the Securities. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of this Note and any Notes which may be issued in exchange or substitution herefor, irrespective of whether or not any notation thereof is made upon this Note or such other Notes.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Issuer, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Note in the manner, at the respective times, at the rate and in the coin or currency herein prescribed.
The Notes are issuable only in registered form, without coupons, in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof, and in book-entry form. The Notes may be represented by one or more Global Securities (each, a "Global Note") deposited with the Depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the Depositary, with certain limited exceptions. So long as DTC or any successor Depositary or its nominee is the registered Holder of a Global Note, DTC, such Depositary or such nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole owner or Holder of the Notes represented by such Global Note for all purposes under the Indenture and the Notes. Beneficial interest in the Notes will be evidenced only by, and transfer thereof will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC and its participants. Except as provided below, an owner of a beneficial interest in a Global Note will not be entitled to have Notes represented by such Global Note registered in such owner's name, will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of the Notes in certificated form and will not be considered the owner or Holder thereof under the Indenture.
No Global Note may be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary. Global Notes are exchangeable for certificated Notes only if (x) the Depositary notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Notes or if at any time the Depositary ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Issuer fails within 90 days thereafter to appoint a successor, (y) the Issuer in its sole discretion determines that such Global Notes shall be so exchangeable or (z) there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default or an event which with the giving of notice or lapse of time or both would constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Notes represented by such Global Notes. In such event, the Issuer will issue Notes in certificated form in exchange for such Global Notes. In any such instance, an owner of a beneficial interest in the Global Notes will be entitled to physical delivery in certificated form of Notes equal in principal amount to such beneficial interest and to have such Notes registered in its name. Notes so issued in certificated form will be issued in denominations of $1,000 or any integral multiple thereof, and will be issued in registered form only, without coupons.
The Issuer, the Trustee and any authorized agent of the Issuer or the Trustee may deem and treat the registered Holder hereof as the absolute owner of this Note (whether or not this Note shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing hereon), for the purpose of receiving payment of, or on account of, the principal hereof and premium, if any, and subject to the provisions on the face hereof, interest hereon, and for all other purposes, and neither the Issuer nor the Trustee nor any authorized agent of the Issuer or the Trustee shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.
 
No recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement of the Issuer in the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto or in any Note, or because of the creation of any indebtedness represented thereby, shall be had against incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, of the Issuer or of any successor corporation, either directly or through the Issuer or any successor corporation, under any rule of law, statute or constitutional provision or by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or otherwise, all such liability being expressly waived and released by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof.
The acceptance of this Note shall be deemed to constitute the consent and agreement of the Holder hereof to all of the terms and provisions of the Indenture. Terms used herein which are defined in the Indenture shall have the respective meanings assigned thereto in the Indenture.
THE INDENTURE AND THE NOTES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF.

P.O. Box 4100
St. Louis, MO 63136-8506
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am Vice President, Associate General Counsel and Assistant Secretary of Emerson Electric Co. (the "Company"), and in such capacity I am familiar with the registration of up to $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 4.875% Notes Due 2019 (the "Notes") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"). The Notes are debt securities being issued under an Indenture (the "Indenture") dated December 10, 1998 between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (successor to The Bank of New York). The Company proposes to offer and sell the Notes to the public in accordance with the terms and conditions of an Underwriting Agreement dated as of January 15, 2009 (the "Agreement") and the Pricing Agreement (the "Pricing Agreement") dated as of January 15, 2009 among the Company and Banc of America Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc, as representatives of the several underwriters named therein, and the Company's Automatic Shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File Number 333-155674) (the "Registration Statement"), the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement dated January 15, 2009 and the accompanying Prospectus dated November 25, 2008, the Final Term Sheet relating to the Prospectus Supplement dated January 15, 2009 to the Prospectus dated November 25, 2008, and the Prospectus Supplement dated January 15, 2009 and the accompanying Prospectus dated November 25, 2008 for the sale of the Notes by the Company.
I have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records, certificates of public officials and other instruments as I deemed necessary for the purpose of the opinion expressed herein. In my examination of the foregoing, I have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, the genuineness of all signatures and the conformity to authentic originals of all documents submitted to me as copies. I have also assumed the legal capacity for all purposes relevant hereto of all natural persons and, with respect to all parties to agreements or instruments relevant hereto other than the Company, that such parties had the requisite power and authority (corporate or otherwise) to execute, deliver and perform such agreements or instruments, that such agreements or instruments have been duly authorized by all requisite action (corporate or otherwise), executed and delivered by such parties and that such agreements or instruments are the valid, binding and enforceable obligations of such parties. As to questions of fact material to my opinions, I have relied upon certificates or statements of officers and other representatives of the Company and of public officials and authorities. I have assumed without investigation that any certificates or statements on which I have relied that were given or dated earlier than the date
 
of this opinion letter continued to remain accurate, insofar as relevant to such opinion, from such earlier date through and including the date of this letter.
Capitalized terms used and not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
Based on the foregoing, I am of the opinion that the Notes have been duly authorized and, when executed, issued, sold and delivered against payment therefor in the manner described in the Registration Statement and in accordance with the Indenture, and duly authenticated by the Trustee as specified in the Indenture, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company.
The foregoing opinion is subject to the qualifications, that (i) the rights and remedies may be limited by bankruptcy, reorganization and other laws of general application relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights or the availability of equitable remedies and (ii) I am admitted to practice law in the State of Missouri and I express no opinion on any law other than that of Missouri and the federal law of the United States. This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose or relied upon by or furnished to any other person without my prior written consent.
I hereby consent to the use of my name in the Registration Statement and in the related prospectus, and in any supplement to such prospectus, and to the use of this Opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement. In giving such consent, I do not hereby admit that I am included in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Rules and Regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder.
