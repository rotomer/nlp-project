Emerson GAAP Underlying Orders  3 Month Summary
(Percent change. Trailing 3-month average versus prior year.)
 
 
July 2009 Order Comments:
 
Emerson's order rate for the trailing three-month period ended July 2009 continued to show signs of stabilization and was down 25 percent. Currency exchange rates had a negative impact of approximately 1 percentage point. Underlying order trends for May, June and July were at similar levels and the Company continues to see signs that the economic bottom is forming.
 
Process Management order rates continued to be negatively impacted by lower capital spending patterns and reduced MRO budgets. However, capital investments continued among end-markets focused on improving plant efficiencies by lowering operating costs, and on improving plant reliability and safety.
 
Continued weakness across capital goods end-markets pressured order rates for Industrial Automation, with the power generating alternator business remaining extremely weak.
 
Network Power trailing three-month underlying order trends have remained relatively stable since the beginning of calendar year 2009. Order trends for the China network power business continued to be better than the remaining businesses in this segment.
 
Climate Technologies order rates continued to show signs of stabilization and benefited from positive order growth in Asia driven by the impact of stimulus programs in China.
 
Appliance and Tools order trends remained weak as challenging residential and non-residential end-market conditions continued and consumer confidence remained low.
