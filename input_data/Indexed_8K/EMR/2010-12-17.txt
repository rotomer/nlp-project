Emerson GAAP Underlying Orders  3 Month Summary
(Percent change.  Trailing 3-month average versus prior year.)
 
 
                                                                                               
 
 
November 2010 Order Comments:
 
Order growth remained solid, led by strength from the capital goods businesses. Order comparisons will become more difficult as we move through fiscal 2011.  Currency exchange rates had a negligible impact on the order growth rate.
 
Order rates support the full-year expectations provided in the November 2, 2010 earnings conference call, and we continue to expect:
 
       
Underlying sales growth 7 to 10 percent
       
Reported sales growth 12 to 15 percent
       
Operating profit margin in the range of 17.2 to 17.5 percent
       
Operating cash flow in the $3.4 to $3.5 billion range
       
Pretax margin in the range of 14.2 to 14.7 percent
       
Tax rate of approximately 30 percent
 
Order growth in Process Management was strong as global energy markets continued to recover.  Longer lead-time project backlog is growing. Currency exchange rates negatively impacted orders by approximately one percentage point.
 
Order trends in the Industrial Automation segment remained strong, led by strength in the power generating alternator and electrical drives businesses.
 
Network Power order rates were solid, with broad strength across data center and telecommunication end markets.
 
Climate Technologies orders improved modestly with strength in the refrigeration business.  Asian and European markets have softened.
 
Tools and Storage order growth moderated as consumer spending and residential investment are slow to recover from a low base.

For purposes of calculating the Commitment Fee, n either Swing Line Loans nor Competitive Bid Loans shall be deemed to be a usage of the Commitments.  The Borrower may permanently reduce the Aggregate Commitment in whole, or in part ratably among the Lenders, in the amount of $25,000,000 or a multiple of $5,000,000 in excess thereof, upon at least three Business Days' written notice to the Agent, which notice shall specify the amount of any such reduction;

Section 2.02.4
, to but excluding the date it is paid or is converted into a Eurocurrency Ratable Advance pursuant to
Section 2.02.4
hereof, at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate for such day.  Changes in the rate of interest on that portion of any Advance maintained as a Base Rate Advance will take effect simultaneously with each change in the Alternate Base Rate.  Each Eurocurrency Ratable Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day during each Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the Eurocurrency Rate for such day.

Section 9.05
requiring unanimous consent of the Lenders to changes in interest rates), during the continuance of an Event of Default declare that no Ratable Advance may be made as, converted into or continued as a Eurocurrency Ratable Advance.  The Required
 
Lenders may, at their option, by notice to the Borrower (which notice may be revoked at the option of the Required Lenders notwithstanding any provision of
Section 9.05
requiring unanimous consent of the Lenders to changes in interest rates), declare that (a) overdue principal of and interest on each Fixed Rate Advance shall bear interest for the remainder of the applicable Interest Period at the rate otherwise applicable to such Interest Period plus 1% per annum and (b) overdue principal of and interest on each Base Rate Advance, each Swing Line Loan and each Reimbursement Obligation shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate in effect from time to time plus 1% per annum.
Section 2.11.   
Method of Payment
.  (a)  Except for Loans that have been converted into Loans of another Agreed Currency as provided in the definition of "Eligible Currency," each Advance shall be repaid and each payment of interest thereon shall be paid in the currency in which such Advance was made, and any such amount in respect of a Loan that has been converted as described above shall be paid in the currency into which such Loan has been converted.  All payments to be made by the Borrower hereunder in Dollars shall be made, without setoff, deduction, or counterclaim, in immediately available funds to the Agent at the Agent's address specified pursuant to
Section 9.01
or at any other Domestic Lending Office of the Agent specified in writing by the Agent to the Borrower, by 11:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on the date when due.  All payments to be made by the Borrower hereunder in any currency other than Dollars shall be made in such currency on the date due in such funds as may then be customary for the settlement of international transactions in such currency for the account of the Agent, at its Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency.  All payments of Obligations hereunder shall (except (x) repayments of Swing Line Loans and Competitive Bid Loans, (y) Reimbursement Obligations for which the LC Issuers have not been fully indemnified by the Lenders or (z) as otherwise specifically required hereunder) be applied ratably by the Agent among the Lenders.  Each payment delivered to the Agent for the account of any L ender shall be delivered promptly by the Agent to such Lender in the same type of funds that the Agent received at (i) with respect to Base Rate Loans and Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Dollars, its address specified pursuant to
Section 9.01
and (b) with respect to Eurocurrency Loans denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars, in the funds received from the Borrower at the address of the Agent's Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency.  Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, Base Rate Loans or Absolute Rate Loans or of fees shall be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day.  Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, Eurocurrency Loans shall be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the date for payment ther eof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless such Business Day falls in another calendar month, in which case the date for payment thereof shall be the next preceding Business Day.  If the date for any payment of principal is extended by operation of law or otherwise, interest thereon shall be payable for such extended time.  Each reference to the Agent in this
Section 2.11
shall also be deemed to refer, and shall apply equally, to the LC Issuers, in the case of payments required to be made by the Borrower directly to the LC Issuers pursuant to
Section 2.19.6
.
(b)     Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, if, after the making of any Loan in any currency other than Dollars, currency control or exchange regulations are imposed in the country which issues such currency with the result that the type of currency in which the Loan was made (the "
Original Currency
") no longer exists or the Borrower is not able to make payment to the Agent for the account of the Lenders in such
 
Original Currency, then all payments to be made by the Borrower hereunder in such currency shall instead be made when due in Dollars in an amount equal to the Dollar Amount (as of the date of repayment) of such payment due, it being the intention of the parties hereto that the Borrower take all risks of the imposition of any such currency control or exchange regulations.
Section 2.12.    [Reserved].

(b)     The Agent shall also maintain accounts in which it will record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Borrowing Date, the Agreed Currency and the Type thereof and any Interest Period with respect thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder, (iii) the original stated amount of each Facility LC and the amount of LC Obligations outstanding at any time, (iv) the amount of any sum received by the Agent hereunder from the Borrower and each Lender's share thereof and (v) the amount of any increase or decrease in the Aggregate Commitment pursuant to
Section 2.01.2
or
2.06
.
(c)     The entries maintained in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) above shall be
prima
facie
evidence of the existence and amounts of the Obligations therein recorded;
provided
,
however
,
that the failure of the Agent or any Lender to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Obligations in accordance with their terms or the rights of the Borrower to borrow in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
(d)     Any Lender may request that its Ratable Loans, Competitive Bid Loans or Swing Line Loans be evidenced by Ratable Notes, Competitive Bid Notes or Swing Line Notes, respectively.  In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender such Note or Notes payable to the order of such Lender.  Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such Note or Notes and interest thereon shall at all times (prior to any assignment pursuant to
Section 9.06(c)
) be represented by one or more Notes payable to the order of the payee named therein or any Assignee pursuant to
Section 9.06(c)
, except to the extent that any such Lender or Assignee subsequently returns any such Note for cancellation and requests that such Loans once again be evidenced as described in paragraphs (a) and (b) above.

Competitive Bid Quote Requests to be given telephonically.  The Borrower agrees to deliver promptly to the Agent a written confirmation signed by an Authorized Officer, if such confirmation is requested by the Agent or any Lender, of each telephonic notice.  If the written confirmation differs in any material respect from the action taken by the Agent and the Lenders, the records of the Agent and the Lenders shall govern absent manifest error.
Section 2.15.

The Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the amount of such payment available to the intended recipient in reliance upon such assumption.  If such Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, has not in fact made such payme nt to the Agent, the recipient of such payment shall, on demand by the Agent, repay to the Agent the amount so made available together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such amount was so made available by the Agent until the date the Agent recovers such amount at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of payment by a Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day for the first three days and, thereafter, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan or (ii) in the case of payment by the Borrower, a rate per annum equal to the higher of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan.

provided
,
further
, that neither the Borrower nor any Lender shall hereby be precluded from asserting any claim for direct (but not consequential) damages suffered by the Borrower or such Lender to the extent, but only to the extent, caused by (a) the willful misconduct or gross negligence of any LC Issuer in determining whether a request presented under any Facility LC issued by it complied with the terms of such Facility LC or (b) any LC Issuer's failure to pay under any Facility LC issued by it after the presentation to it of a request strictly complying with the terms and conditions of such Facility LC.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Section 2.19
, each Lender agrees that each LC Issuer shall in all cases be fully protected from liability to the Lenders in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement in accordance with a request of the Required Lenders, and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon the Lenders and any future holde rs of a participation in any Facility LC.

successor Beneficiary;
provided
that the Borrower shall not be required to indemnify any Lender, any LC Issuer or the Agent for any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses to the extent, but only to the extent, caused by (i) the willful misconduct or gross negligence of any LC Issuer in determining whether a request presented under any Facility LC complied with the terms of such Facility LC or (ii) any LC Issuer's failure to pay under any Facility LC after the presentation to it of a request strictly complying with the terms and conditions of such Facility LC.

Articles 2
and

with respect to any Advance in any Agreed Currency other than Dollars, if there shall occur on or prior to the date of such Advance any change in national or international financial, political or economic conditions or currency exchange rates or exchange controls which would in the reasonable opini on of the Agent or the Required Lenders make it impracticable for the Eurocurrency Loans comprising such Advance to be denominated in the 
 
Agreed Currency specified by the Borrower, then the Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders, and such Loans shall not be denominated in such Agreed Currency but shall be made on such Borrowing Date in Dollars, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Dollar Amount of the aggregate principal amount specified in the related Borrowing Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice, as the case may be, as Base Rate Loans, unless (a) the Borrower notifies the Agent at least one Business Day before such Borrowing Date that (i) it elects not to borrow on such date or (ii) it elects to borrow on such Borrowing Date in a different Agreed Currency, as the case may be, in which the denomination of such Loans would in the opinion of the Agent and the Required Lenders be practicable and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Dollar Amount of the aggregate pr incipal amount specified in the related Borrowing Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice, as the case may be, or (b) the Borrower notifies the Agent at least three Business Days before such Borrowing Date that it elects to borrow Eurocurrency Loans in a different Agreed Currency on such Borrowing Date.

specified currency
") into another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Agent could purchase the specified currency with such other currency at the Agent's main Chicago office on the Busi ness Day preceding that on which final, nonappealable judgment is given.  The obligations of the Borrower in respect of any sum due to any Lender or the Agent hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than the specified currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) may in accordance with normal, reasonable banking procedures purchase the specified currency with such other currency.  If the amount of the specified currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to such Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, in the specified currency, the Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, against such loss, and if the amount of the specified currency so purchased exceeds the sum originally due to any Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, in the specified currency, such Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, agrees to remit such excess to the Borrower.
Section 2.22.   
Funding Indemnification

); provided that (i) a Defaulting Lender's Commitment may not be increased or extended without its consent and (ii) the principal amount of, or interest or fees payable on, Loans of such Defaulting Lender may not be reduced or excused or the scheduled date of payment postponed as to such Defaulting Lender without such Defaulting Lender's consent;
(c)     if any Swing Line Obligations or LC Obligations exist at the time a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
(i)         the Swing Line Obligations and LC Obligations of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares but only to the extent the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders' Outstanding Credit Exposures plus such Defaulting Lender's Swing Line Obligations and LC Obligations does not exceed the aggregate Commitments of all non-Defaulting Lenders;
(ii)        if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall within three Business Days following notice by the Agent (x)
first
, prepay such Swing Line Obligations and (y)
second
, cash collateralize for the benefit of each LC Issuer only the Borrower's obligations corresponding, and in an amount equal, to such Defaulting Lender's LC Obligations (after giving effect to any partial reallocation effected pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set fo rth in
Section 6.03
for so long as such LC Obligations are outstanding;
(iii)       if the Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lender's LC Obligations pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees pursuant to
Section 2.19.4
with respect to such portion of such Defaulting Lender's LC Obligations during the period such Defaulting Lender's LC Obligations are cash collateralized;
(iv)       if the LC Obligations of the non-Defaulting Lenders are reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to
Section 2.06
and
Section 2.19.4
shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders' Pro Rata Shares; and
(v)        if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lender's LC Obligations are neither reallocated nor cash collateralized pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above,
 
then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of each LC Issuer or any other Lender hereunder, all letter of credit fees payable under
Section 2.19.4
with respect to such Defaulting Lender's LC Obligations shall be payable to the applicable LC Issuer until and to the extent that such LC Obligations are reallocated and/or cash collateralized; and
(d)     so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Swing Line Lender shall not be required to fund any Swing Line Loan and the LC Issuers shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Facility LC, unless it is or they are satisfied that (i) all of the Defaulting Lender's then outstanding LC Obligations will be reallocated to non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Borrower in accordance with
Section 2.23(c)
and (ii) participating interests in any newly made Swing Line Loan or any newly issued or increased Facility LC shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with
Section 2.23(c)(i)
(and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein).
In the event that the Agent, the Borrower, each LC Issuer and each Swing Line Lender each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Swing Line Obligations and LC Obligations of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender's Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders (other than Competitive Bid Loans and Swing Line Loans) as the Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Pro Rata Share.

the Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders, whereupon until the Agent notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, (i) the obligations of the Lenders to make Eurocurrency Loans in such Agreed Currency or to continue or convert outstanding Loans as or into Eurocurrency Loans in such Agreed Currency shall be suspended and (ii) each outstanding Eurocurrency Loan in such Agreed Currency shall be converted into a Base Rate Loan on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto.  Unless the Borrower notifies the Agent at least two Business Days before the date of any Eurocurrency Advance in the applicable Agreed Currency for which a
 
Borrowing Notice has previously been given that it elects not to borrow on such date (x) if such Eurocurrency Advance in such Agreed Currency is a Ratable Advance, such Advance shall instead be made as a Base Rate Advance and (y) if such Eurocurrency Advance in such Agreed Currency is a Eurocurrency Bid Rate Advance, the Eurocurrency Bid Rate Loans comprising such Advance shall bear interest for each day from and including the first day to but excluding the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto at the Alternate Base Rate for such day.

Before giving any notice to the Agent pursuant to this Section, such Lender shall designate a different Eurocurrency Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice and will not, in the judgment of such Lender, be otherwise significantly disadvantageous to such Lender.  If such notice is given, each Eurocurrency Loan of such Lender in the applicable Agreed Currency then outstanding shall be converted to a Base Rate Loan either (i) on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable to such Eurocurrency Loan in such Agreed Currency if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain and fund such Loan as a Eurocurrency Loan in such Agreed Currency to such day or (ii) immediately if such Lender shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain and fund such Loan as a Eurocurrency Loan in such Agreed Currency to such day.

(c)     Each Lender and each LC Issuer will promptly notify the Borrower and the Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle such Lender or such LC Issuer to compensation pursuant to this Section and will designate a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the judgment of such Lender or such LC Issuer, be otherwise significantly disadvantageous to such Lender or such LC Issuer.
