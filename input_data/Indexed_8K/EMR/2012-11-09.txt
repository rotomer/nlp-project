Section 8.
Voting
 
         . At any annual meeting of shareholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting. In addition to any other requirements imposed by or pursuant to law, the Articles or these Bylaws, each item of business to be properly brought before an annual meeting must (a) be specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board or the persons calling the meeting pursuant to the Articles; (b) be otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board; or (c) be otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a shareholder. For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder, the shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a shareholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event less than 100 days' notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting is given or made to shareholders, notice by the shareholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made. For purposes of these Bylaws public disclosure shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones, Associated Press, Reuters or comparable national news service, or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Sections 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act). A shareholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth as to each matter he or she proposes to bring before the annual meeting (a) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (b) the name and address, as they appear on the Corporation's books, of the shareholder(s) proposing such business, (c) the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by the proposing shareholder(s), and (d) any material interest of the proposing shareholder(s) in such business. Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, but subject to Article III, Section 1(c) hereof, no business shall be conducted at an annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section. The chairman of the annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the annual meeting that business was not properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the provisions of this Section; and if he or she should so determine, shall so declare to the meeting and any such business not properly brought before the annual meeting shall not be transacted. The chairman of the meeting shall have absolute authority to decide questions of compliance with the foregoing procedures, and his or her ruling thereon shall be final and conclusive. The provisions of this Section 9 shall also govern what constitutes timely notice for purposes of Rule 14a-4(c) under the 1934 Act.

(a)           The Board shall consist of such number of Directors as the Board may from time to time determine, provided that in no event shall the number of Directors be less than three (3), and provided further that no reduction in the number of Directors shall have the effect of shortening the term of any incumbent Director.
 
(b)           The Board of Directors (herein the Board) shall be divided into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible. In the event of any increase in the number of Directors, the additional Director(s) shall be added to such class(es) as may be necessary so that all classes shall be as nearly equal in number as possible. In the event of any decrease in the number of Directors, all classes of Directors shall be decreased as nearly equally as may be possible. Subject to the foregoing, the Board shall determine the class(es) to which any additional Director(s) shall be added and the class(es) which shall be decreased in the event of any decrease in the number of Directors.  At each annual meeting of shareholders the successors to the class of Directors whose term shall then expire shall be elected for a term expiring at the third succeeding annual meeting after such election.
 
(c)           In addition to the qualifications set out in Section 3 of this Article III, in order to be qualified for election as a Director, persons must be nominated in accordance with the following procedure:
 
Nominations of persons for election to the Board of the Corporation may be made at a meeting of shareholders by or at the direction of the Board or by any shareholder of the Corporation entitled to vote for the election of Directors at the meeting who complies with the procedures set forth in this Section 1(c). In order for persons nominated to the Board, other than those persons nominated by or at the direction of the Board, to be qualified to serve on the Board, such nominations shall be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a shareholder's notice shall be delivered to or mailed and received by the Secretary of the Corporation not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the meeting; provided, however, that in the event less than 100 days' notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made to shareholders, notice by the shareholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made. Such shareholder's notice shall set forth (i) as to each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a Director, (A) the name, age, business address and residence address of such person, (B) the principal occupation or employment of such person, (C) the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by such person, (D) any other information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of Directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (including without limitation such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a Director if elected) and (E) if the shareholder(s) making the nomination is an Interested Person, details of any relationship, agreement or understanding between the
 
 
-4-
 
shareholder(s) and the nominee; and (ii) as to the shareholder(s) making the nomination (A) the name and address, as they appear on the Corporation's books, of such shareholder(s) and (B) the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by such shareholder(s). At the request of the Board, any person nominated by the Board for election as a Director shall furnish to the Secretary of the Corporation that information required to be set forth in a shareholder's notice of nomination which pertains to the nominee. No person shall be qualified for election as a Director of the Corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 1(c). The chairman of a meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the Bylaws, and if he or she should so determine, shall so declare to the meeting, and the defective nomination shall be disregarded. The chairman of a meeting shall have absolute authority to decide questions of compliance with the foregoing procedures, and his or her ruling thereon shall be final and conclusive.
 
(d)           Directors shall be elected at annual meetings of the shareholders, except as provided in Section 2 of this Article III, and each Director shall hold office until his or her successor is elected and qualified.
 
         . Vacancies and newly created directorships shall be filled only by a majority of the remaining Directors, though less than a quorum, and each person so elected shall be a Director until his or her successor is elected by the shareholders, who may make such election at the next annual meeting of the shareholders at which Directors of his or her class are elected or at any special meeting of shareholders duly called for that purpose and held prior thereto.
Section 2.
Filling of Vacancies
 
         . Directors must be nominated in accordance with the procedure set out in Section 1(c) of this Article III. Directors need not be shareholders. No person shall be eligible for election as a Director, either under Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article III, if such person's seventy-second (72nd) birthday shall fall on a date prior to the commencement of the Term for which such Director is to be elected or appointed; provided, however, that this limitation shall not apply to Mr. A. A. Busch III until the annual meeting of shareholders held in 2014. No person shall be qualified to be elected and to hold office as a Director if such person is determined by a majority of the whole Board to have acted in a manner contrary to the best interests of the Corporation, including, but not limited to, violation of either State or Federal law, maintenance of interests not properly authorized and in conflict with the interests of the Corporation, or breach of any agreement between such Director and the Corporation relating to such Director's services as a Director, employee or agent of the Corporation.
Section 3.
Qualifications
 
         . By action of a majority of the whole Board, any Director may be removed from office for cause if such Director shall at the time of such removal fail to meet the qualifications for election as a Director as set forth under Article III, Section 3 hereof. Notice of the proposed removal shall be given to all Directors of the Corporation prior to action thereon. Directors may be otherwise removed only in the manner prescribed in the Articles.

A Director who may be disqualified, by reason of personal interest, from voting on any particular matter before a meeting of the Board may nevertheless be counted for the purpose of constituting a quorum of the Board.
 
       . Directors, as such, shall receive for their services such compensation as may be fixed, from time to time, by resolution of the Board, together with a stipend for attendance, and expenses of attendance, if any, for each meeting of the Board or meetings of any committee on which the Directors may serve; provided that nothing herein contained shall be construed to preclude any Director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor.

Vacancies in the membership of each Committee shall be filled by the Board at any regular or special meeting of the Board. A Director who may be disqualified, by reason of personal interest, from voting on any particular matter before a meeting of a Committee may nevertheless be counted for the purpose of constituting a quorum of the Committee. At all meetings of a Committee, a majority of the Committee members then in office shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of transacting business, and the acts of a majority of the Committee members present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the acts of the Committee.
Section 17.

Section 3.
Determination of Right to Indemnification in Certain Instances
 
(a)           Any indemnification under Section 1 of this Article VII (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation unless a determination is reasonably and promptly made that indemnification of the director, officer or employee is not proper in the circumstances because he or she has not satisfied the conditions to indemnification set forth in such Section 1. Such determination shall be made (1) by the Board by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (2) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested Directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (3) by the shareholders; provided, that no such determination shall preclude an action brought in an appropriate court to challenge such determination.
 
(b)           Any indemnification under Section 2 of this Article VII (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the agent is proper in the circumstances. Such determination shall be made (1) by the Board by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (2) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested Directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (3) by the shareholders.
 
         . Expenses incurred by an employee or agent in defending any  action, suit or proceeding referred to in Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article may be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the employee or agent to repay such amounts unless it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article. Expenses incurred by a director or officer in defending any  action, suit or proceeding referred to in Section 1 of this Article shall be paid by the Corporation as incurred; provided, however, that the Corporation shall have first received an undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer to repay such amounts unless it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article.

Section 5.
Successful Defense
 
(a)           Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article VII (but except as set forth in subsection (b) of this Section), to the extent that a director, officer or employee  of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise (including the dismissal of an action without prejudice) in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Section 1  of this Article VII, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he or she shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred in connection therewith. This Section 5 shall not apply to the defense of any action suit or proceeding against, or to related expenses incurred by, an agent of the Corporation; the eligibility of an agent of the Corporation for indemnification by the Corporation shall be determined solely pursuant to the provisions of Section 2 of this Article VII.
 
(b)           Indemnification shall not be provided under this Section or under Section 1 of this Article VII in defense of an action, suit or proceeding brought by the Corporation against an officer or employee; provided that such indemnification shall be provided as to such action, suit or proceeding brought in the right of the Corporation, or as to such action, suit or proceeding which arises as a result of or is related to the acquisition of the Corporation in a transaction not approved by a majority of its continuing Directors. Continuing Directors, for the purpose of this Article VII, shall be those Directors holding office as Directors prior to the time of such acquisition, or any successors thereof approved as successors by Directors in office prior to the time of such acquisition.
 
         . The indemnification provided by this Article VII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification may be entitled under any statute, bylaw, agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in an official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event of conflict between the provisions of this Article VII and the provisions of any agreement adopted by the shareholders between the Corporation on the one hand, and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation on the other, providing for indemnification, the terms of such agreement shall prevail. Any indemnification, whether required under this Bylaw or permitted by statute or otherwise, shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer or employee and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such person.
Section 6.
Not Exclusive Right
 
         . The Board shall have the power to cause the Corporation to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a Director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity, arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Article.
Section 7.
Insurance
 
         . For the purposes of this Article VII, (a) any officer, Director, or employee of the Corporation who shall serve as an officer, director, employee or agent of any other corporation, joint venture, trust or other enterprise of which the Corporation, directly or indirectly, is or was a stockholder or creditor, or in which the Corporation is or was in
Section 8.
Subsidiaries of Corporation

any way interested, or (b) any officer, director, or employee of any subsidiary corporation, venture, trust or other enterprise wholly owned by the Corporation, shall be deemed to be serving as such director, officer, employee or agent at the request of the Corporation, unless the Board shall determine otherwise. In all instances where any person shall serve as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, joint venture, trust or other enterprise of which the Corporation is or was a stockholder or creditor, or in which it is or was otherwise interested, if it is not otherwise established that such person is or was serving as such director, officer, employee or agent at the request of the Corporation, the Board may determine whether such service is or was at the request of the Corporation, and it shall not be necessary to show any actual or prior request for such service.
 
         . The spouse of a person entitled to indemnification under Section 1 hereof or who is granted indemnification under Section 2 hereof, shall be entitled to be so indemnified; provided, that the spouse was or is a party (other than a party plaintiff suing on his or her own behalf or in the right of the Corporation), or was or is threatened to be made a party, to any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative (including, but not limited to, an action by or in the right of the Corporation), solely by reason of the spousal relationship to the person who is entitled to indemnification under Section 1 hereof or who is granted indemnification under Section 2 hereof.

These Bylaws may be altered, amended or repealed solely by a majority vote of the members of the whole Board at any regular or special meeting thereof duly called and convened.
