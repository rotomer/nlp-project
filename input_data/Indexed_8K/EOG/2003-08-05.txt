Exhibit 99.1 News Release For Further Information Contact: Investors Maire A. Baldwin (713) 651-6EOG (651-6364) Media and Investors Elizabeth M. Ivers (713) 651-7132 EOG RESOURCES REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 2003 NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON OF $106 MILLION FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Tuesday, August 5, 2003 HOUSTON - EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG) today reported second quarter 2003 net income available to common of $106.0 million, or $0.91 per share. This compares to second quarter 2002 net income available to common of $35.4 million, or $0.30 per share. The results for second quarter 2003 included a previously disclosed $15.8 million ($10.2 million after tax, or $0.09 per share) loss on the mark-to-market of commodity price transactions. During the quarter, the net cash outflow from the settlement of commodity price transactions was $11.2 million ($7.2 million after tax, or $0.06 per share). Consistent with some analysts' practice of matching realizations to settlement months, adjusted non-GAAP net income available to common for the quarter was $109.0 million, or $0.94 per share. Similarly, EOG's second quarter 2002 results included a $0.7 million ($0.5 million after tax, or less than $0.01 per share) gain on mark-to-market commodity price transactions and net cash outflows from the settlement of commodity price transactions of $19.8 million ($12.8 million after tax, or $0.11 per share). Reflecting these items, second quarter 2002 adjusted non-GAAP net income available to common was $22.1 million, or $0.19 per share. (Please refer to the attached table for the reconciliation of net income to adjusted non-GAAP net income.) Consistent with its emphasis on financial strength and flexibility, EOG further reduced its debt-to-total capitalization ratio to 33.8 percent at June 30, 2003 from 40.6 percent at year- end 2002. During the second quarter, EOG repaid $33 million of debt and increased cash by $144 million. In the first half of this year, EOG reduced debt by $134 million and increased cash by $141 million. Operational Highlights "EOG's North America and Trinidad programs continue to generate the expected results, and we anticipate that organic North American natural gas volumes will ramp up both in the third and, more substantially, the fourth quarter," said Mark G. Papa, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. In Canada, the 1,000-well shallow natural gas drilling program planned for 2003 is underway with current drilling activity more than double that of the first quarter. EOG anticipates Canadian natural gas production will increase during the third quarter with the most significant growth expected during the fourth quarter when the new wells are put on sales. Additional fourth quarter production growth is expected from recent onshore natural gas drilling success. In the South Texas Division, the Raquel Gutierrez # 1 and the Hignio Gutierrez #2 were drilled to 10,000 feet, testing the Roleta Formation in the Charco Field. While the Hignio Gutierrez #2 is still awaiting completion, the Raquel Gutierrez #1 is producing over 10 million cubic feet per day (MMcfd) of natural gas. EOG has a 100 percent working interest in this acreage. EOG plans to drill six offset wells in the Charco Field prior to year-end. In the Oklahoma City Division, the Alexander 467 #2R encountered over 50 feet of pay in the Morrow Formation. Production is expected to increase from the current rate of 20 MMcfd to 25 MMcfd in mid-August when new pipeline capacity is added. EOG has a 75 percent working interest in the well. In West Texas, EOG's horizontal Devonian program continues to be successful. Year-to-date, EOG has drilled nine horizontal wells in this play. In the ATM area, the recently completed Blue Topaz 102-1H is producing 4.1 MMcfd and 350 barrels of oil per day (Bopd) at a restricted rate, and the Windham 108#2H is producing 6 MMcfd and 600 Bopd. EOG has a 100 and 96 percent working interest in these wells, respectively. "This is a unique time in the industry," said Papa. "At a time of high commodity prices, EOG's suite of drilling prospects in the U.S. onshore arena is increasing. EOG is pursuing attractive farm-in and lease and property acquisition opportunities that didn't exist even a year ago." Natural Gas Supply Outlook "It is our view that natural gas fundamentals will remain relatively tight during the second half of 2003 reflecting the industry's inability to significantly address declining production levels. EOG's concentration in natural gas, as well as our demonstrated track record of consistent performance, will continue to be important to the nation's supply of natural gas and our investors." Conference Call Scheduled for August 6, 2003 EOG's second quarter 2003 conference call will be available via live audio webcast at 9:00 a.m. Central Time (10:00 a.m. Eastern Time) Wednesday, August 6, 2003.

This press release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. Although EOG believes its expectations reflected in forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, no assurance can be given that these expectations will be achieved. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements include, among others: the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices for crude oil, natural gas and related products, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; the timing and impact of liquefied natural gas imports; the extent and effect of any hedging activities engaged in by EOG; the extent of EOG's success in discovering, developing, marketing and producing reserves and in acquiring oil and gas properties; the accuracy of reserve estimates, which by their nature involve the exercise of professional judgment and may therefore be imprecise; political developments around the world, including terrorist activities and responses to terrorist activities; acts of war; and financial market conditions. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events anticipated by EOG's forward- looking statements might not occur. EOG undertakes no obligations to update or revise its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
