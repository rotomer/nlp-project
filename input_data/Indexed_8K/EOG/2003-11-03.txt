EXHIBIT 99.1 News Release For Further Information Contact: Investors Maire A. Baldwin (713) 651-6EOG (651-6364) Media and Investors Elizabeth M. Ivers (713) 651-7132 EOG RESOURCES REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2003 NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON OF $115 MILLION FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Monday, November 3, 2003 HOUSTON - EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG) today reported third quarter 2003 net income available to common of $114.7 million, or $0.99 per share. This compares to third quarter 2002 net income available to common of $26.1 million, or $0.22 per share. The results for third quarter 2003 included a previously disclosed $23.6 million ($15.2 million after tax, or $0.13 per share) gain on the mark-to-market of commodity price transactions. During the quarter, the net cash outflow from the settlement of third quarter commodity price transactions and premium payments associated with certain 2004 natural gas financial collar contracts was $10.0 million ($6.5 million after tax, or $0.06 per share). Consistent with some analysts' practice of matching realizations to settlement months, adjusted non-GAAP net income available to common for the quarter was $93.0 million, or $0.80 per share. Similarly, EOG's third quarter 2002 results included a $7.8 million ($5.1 million after tax, or $0.04 per share) loss on mark-to-market commodity price transactions and net cash outflows from the settlement of commodity price transactions of $2.9 million ($1.9 million after tax, or $0.01 per share). Reflecting these items, third quarter 2002 adjusted non-GAAP net income available to common was $29.3 million, or $0.25 per share. (Please refer to the table below for the reconciliation of net income available to common to adjusted non-GAAP net income available to common.) On October 1, 2003, EOG closed the largest acquisition in its history. The $320 million transaction was majority funded with internally generated cash flow. The purchase increases EOG's Canadian drilling inventory, primarily in shallow natural gas properties in southern Alberta and complements the company's existing Canadian assets by providing incremental reserve potential. Also as a result of the transaction, EOG significantly increased its coal bed methane acreage position in the Twining Field. Based on favorable results from initial production testing of this acreage, EOG is planning a pilot development program in 2004. In South Texas, EOG recently made two significant discoveries in the Frio and Wilcox sands with three successful exploration wells. These wells are expected to add combined new production of 30 million cubic feet per day (MMcfd) of natural gas and 2,000 barrels of condensate per day, net by mid- December. EOG plans additional drilling in the fourth quarter 2003 to further delineate these discoveries. Also during the third quarter, EOG announced a discovery in the Southern Gas Basin of the United Kingdom North Sea that may contain up to 110 billion cubic feet of natural gas reserves. EOG has a 30 percent working interest in this well, its second successful North Sea farm-in. Production from the well, that encountered 196 feet of pay, is expected to begin in the second half of 2004. To date, EOG's strategy of allocating a moderate amount of capital to North Sea exploration has proved successful with two of three wells resulting in natural gas discoveries, adding to EOG's long-term international production growth. In addition, EOG further confirmed reserves in the Oilbird Field with a recent well drilled in the SECC Block off the southeast coast of Trinidad. EOG will soon spud the second well in a nine-month Trinidad drilling campaign aimed at finding significant additional reserves to further pursue new gas markets. Simultaneously, negotiations are under way to supply approximately 125 MMcfd of natural gas to the M5000 Methanol Plant in Trinidad that is currently under construction and expected to start up in mid-2005. "Based on our strong operational success in 2003, EOG has recently laid out longer term production growth targets of 6.5 percent in 2004, 10 percent in 2005 and 7 percent in 2006. North American natural gas will continue to be a key component of this growth," stated Mark G. Papa, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "EOG is one of a few large cap E&P companies that has organically grown year over year domestic gas production each of the last four quarters and we expect to grow North American gas production 6.5 percent in 2004. We are well positioned to attain the targets we have set forth for the coming years while maintaining our focus on rate of return." At September 30, 2003, EOG's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 32.5 percent with $184 million of cash on the balance sheet. The debt-to-total capitalization ratio at year-end, subsequent to the funding of the acquisition in Canada and factoring in recent commodity prices, is expected to be in the range of 34 to 37 percent.

EOG Resources, Inc. is one of the largest independent (non- integrated) oil and natural gas companies in the United States and is the operator of substantial proved reserves in the U.S., Canada and offshore Trinidad. EOG Resources, Inc. is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is traded under the ticker symbol "EOG." This press release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. Although EOG believes its expectations reflected in forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, no assurance can be given that these expectations will be achieved. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements include, among others: the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices for crude oil, natural gas and related products, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; the timing and impact of liquefied natural gas imports; the extent and effect of any hedging activities engaged in by EOG; the extent of EOG's success in discovering, developing, marketing and producing reserves and in acquiring oil and gas properties; the accuracy of reserve estimates, which by their nature involve the exercise of professional judgment and may therefore be imprecise; political developments around the world, including terrorist activities and responses to terrorist activities; acts of war; and financial market conditions. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events anticipated by EOG's forward-looking statements might not occur. EOG undertakes no obligations to update or revise its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only proved reserves that a company has demonstrated by actual production or conclusive formation tests to be economically and legally producible under existing economic and operating conditions. As noted above, statements of proved reserves are only estimates and may be imprecise. Any reserve estimates provided in this press release that are not specifically designated as being estimates of proved reserves may include not only proved reserves, but also other categories of reserves that the SEC's guidelines strictly prohibit EOG from including in filings with the SEC. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in EOG's Form 10-K for fiscal year ended December 31, 2002, available from EOG at P.O. Box 4362, Houston, Texas 77210-4362 (Attn: Investor Relations). You can also obtain this form from the SEC by calling 1-800-SEC-0330.
