EOG RESOURCES, INC.
Item 8.01 Other Events.
EOG Resources, Inc. ("EOG") is providing the below information in response to questions regarding certain disclosure in EOG's Definitive Proxy Statement filed on March 30, 2006.
William D. Stevens, a member of the board of directors of EOG since July, 2004, and currently nominated for reelection, attended only 60% of the board and committee meetings held in 2005. Due to an extended trip that was planned prior to his joining EOG's board, Mr. Stevens missed one set of board and committee meetings held on February 23 and 24, 2005. EOG normally has only four scheduled meetings of the board each year. Various committee meetings are also held as required along with the board meetings and each of those sets of board and committee meetings is held over a two day period. If any director is absent from one of these sets of meetings, he or she may have attended less than 75% of the total meetings depending on the schedule of committee meetings.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
