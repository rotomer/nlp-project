          (v) other than as set forth in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any Major Subsidiary is a party or of which any property or assets of the Company or a Major Subsidiary is the subject that are required to be described in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus, or that could adversely affect the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and to such counsel's knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or by others; and
          (vi) the descriptions in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus, of statutes, legal and governmental proceedings and contracts and other documents are accurate in all material respects and fairly present the information contained therein.
     The opinions to be provided on behalf of the Company shall also contain a statement to the effect that such counsel has participated in conferences with representatives of the Company, representatives of the Underwriters and counsel for the
 
Underwriters, and with representatives of the Company's independent accountants at which conferences the contents of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus and any amendment and supplement thereto and related matters were discussed and, although such counsel has not independently verified, is not passing upon and assumes no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information, the Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto (except as expressly provided above), no facts have come to such counsel's attention that have caused such counsel to believe that the Registration Statement (including the information, if any, deemed pursuant to Rule 430A, 430B or 430C under the Securities Act to be part of the Registration Statement at the time it became effective), at the time it became effective, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, that the Time of Sale Information, at the Time of Sale, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or that the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto as of its date and the Closing Date contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (in each case above, other than the financial statements, schedules and related data and other financial or accounting data and information pertaining to natural resource reserves, as to which such counsel need not comment).
     (e) On the date of this Agreement and on the Closing Date, Deloitte & Touche LLP shall have furnished to the Underwriters letters, dated the date hereof and the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Underwriters, containing statements and information of the type customarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" as to financial information contained in or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus;
     (f) (i) Since the date of the Company's latest audited financial statements incorporated by reference in the Time of Sale Information, the Company shall not have sustained any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Time of Sale Information, and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Time of Sale Information there shall not have been any change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, prospects, management, financial position, stockholder's equity or results of operations of the Company otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Time of Sale Information, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in the Representatives' judgment so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering of the Notes for resale or the delivery of the Notes on the terms and in the manner contemplated in this Agreement and the Prospectus;
 
     (g) On or after the earlier of the Time of Sale or the date hereof, (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded any securities of the Company by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as that term is defined for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the securities of the Company;

     (i) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Underwriters at the Closing Date certificates of officers of the Company satisfactory to the Representatives as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein at and as of the Closing Date, as to the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to the Closing Date, as to the matters set forth in subsections (f) and (g) of this Section and as to such other matters as the Underwriters may reasonably request; and
     (j) The Notes shall be eligible for clearance and settlement through The Depository Trust Company.
     8. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, each partner, manager, director, principal and officer of each Underwriter, and each person, if any, who controls each Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, as follows:
          (i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement to such documents), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
 
          (ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission; provided that (subject to Section 8(d) below) any such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company; and
          (iii) against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including, subject to Section 8(c) hereof, the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Underwriters), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above;
that the indemnity set forth in this Section 8(a) shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Representatives on behalf of the Underwriters expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement to such documents), or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
provided, however,
     (b) Each Underwriter, severally but not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each director and officer of the Company, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement to such documents), or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Representatives on behalf of such Underwriter expressly for use therein.
     (c) Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Underwriters, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(b) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Company, provided that if it so elects within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice, an indemnifying party, jointly with any other indemnifying parties receiving such
 
notice, may assume the defense of such action with counsel chosen by it and approved by the indemnified parties defendant in such action, unless such indemnified parties reasonably object to such assumption on the ground that there may be legal defenses available to them which are different from or in addition to those available to such indemnifying party. If an indemnifying party assumes the defense of such action, the indemnifying parties shall not be liable for any fees and expenses of counsel for the indemnified parties incurred thereafter in connection with such action. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 8 (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
     (d) If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 8(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, an indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 8(a)(ii) effected without its consent if such indemnifying party (i) reimburses such indemnified party in accordance with such request to the extent it considers such request to be reasonable and (ii) provides written notice to the indemnified party substantiating the unpaid balance as unreasonable, in each case prior to the date of such settlement.
     (e) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to herein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages
 
and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses but after deducting the total fee or commission received by the Underwriters ) received by the Company and the total fee or commission received by the Underwriters bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Notes. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(e) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 8(e). The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 8(e) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(e), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes purchased and resold by it were resold to investors exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. For purposes of this Section 8(e), each partner, manager, director, principal and officer of an Underwriter, and each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter; and each director and officer of the Company, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute as provided in this Section 8(e) are several and not joint.
 
     (f) The Underwriters hereby confirm and the Company acknowledges that the statements made in (i) the fifth paragraph of the text under the caption "Underwriting" in the Prospectus concerning the terms of the offering of the Notes by the Underwriters and (ii) the ninth paragraph of the text under the caption "Underwriting" in the Prospectus concerning price stabilization and short positions constitute the only written information furnished to the Company by the Representatives on behalf of the Underwriters expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement to such documents), or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
     9. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, any partner, manager, director, principal or officer of an Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company or any officer or director of the Company, or any controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Notes.
     10. If for any reason, the Notes are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Underwriters, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Notes, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to the Underwriters except as provided in Section 5 and Section 8 hereof.
     11. If any of the Underwriters shall fail at the Closing Date to purchase the Notes which it is obligated to purchase under this Agreement (the ""), the remaining Underwriter(s) (the "") shall have the right, but not the obligation, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements to purchase (alone or together with any other underwriters) all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Notes upon the terms herein set forth. If, however, the Non-Defaulting Underwriter(s) shall not have completed such arrangements within such 24-hour period, then this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of the Non-Defaulting Underwriter(s).
Defaulted Notes
Non-Defaulting Underwriter(s)
     No action taken pursuant to this Section 11 shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
     In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement, then the Non-Defaulting Underwriter(s) shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements.
     12. All statements, requests, notices, and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by courier service, mail or facsimile transmission to them in care of Barclays Capital Inc. at 745 Seventh Avenue, New York, New York 10019, Attention: Syndicate Registration, Facsimile No. (646) 834-8133; J.P.

No purchaser of any of the Notes from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
     14. Time shall be of the essence in this Agreement.
     15. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We have acted as counsel to EOG Resources, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the offering by the Company of $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 2.95% Senior Notes due 2015 and $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 4.40% Senior Notes due 2020 (collectively, the "Notes"). The Notes are to be issued pursuant to an Indenture dated May 18, 2009, as supplemented by an officers' certificate setting forth the specific terms applicable to the Notes (as so supplemented, the "Indenture") between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, NA, as trustee, which will establish the forms and terms of the Notes. We refer to the registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-163947) (the "Registration Statement"), filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") by the Company on December 22, 2009, including the base prospectus contained therein, and the prospectus supplement (the "Prospectus Supplement"), dated May 17, 2010, and filed with the Commission relating to the offering of the Notes.
     As counsel to the Company, we have examined such corporate records, documents and questions of law as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. In such examinations, we have assumed the genuineness of signatures and the conformity to the originals of the documents supplied to us as copies. As to various questions of fact material to this opinion, we have relied upon statements and certificates of officers and representatives of the Company. Without limiting the foregoing, we have examined the Underwriting Agreement, dated May 17, 2010, among the Company, Barclays Capital Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., UBS Securities LLC and the other underwriters (the "Underwriters") named therein (the "Underwriting Agreement").
     Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the limitations, qualifications, assumptions and exceptions stated herein, we are of the opinion that the Notes have been duly authorized and, when executed and authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, will,

We express no opinion concerning (a) the validity or enforceability of any provisions contained in the Indenture that purport to waive or not give effect to rights to notices, defenses, subrogation or other rights or benefits that cannot be effectively waived under applicable law or (b) the enforceability of indemnification provisions to the extent they purport to relate to liabilities resulting from or based upon negligence or any violation of federal or state securities or blue sky laws.
     The opinion expressed in this letter is subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally and to general principles of equity, including without limitation concepts of materiality and principles of reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity).
     The opinion expressed herein is limited exclusively to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and the applicable provisions of the Delaware Constitution and reported decisions concerning such laws, the laws of the State of New York and the federal laws of the United States of America, and we are expressing no opinion as to the effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction. We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an Exhibit to the Registration Statement and to the references to us under "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus Supplement. By giving such consent, we do not admit that we are within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the rules and regulations thereunder.
