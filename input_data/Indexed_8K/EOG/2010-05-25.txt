I. Price Risk Management
     With the objective of enhancing the certainty of future revenues, from time to time EOG enters into New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) related financial collar, price swap and basis swap contracts. EOG accounts for financial commodity derivative contracts using the mark-to-market accounting method. In addition to financial transactions, from time to time EOG is a party to various physical commodity contracts for the sale of hydrocarbons that cover varying periods of time and have varying pricing provisions. The financial impact of these physical commodity contracts is included in revenues at the time of settlement, which in turn affects average realized hydrocarbon prices.
II. Natural Gas Financial Collar, Price Swap and Basis Swap Contracts
     EOG has not entered into any additional natural gas financial collar, price swap or basis swap contracts since EOG filed its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2010 on May 4, 2010 which provided an update and comprehensive summary of all such contracts as of that date.
 
III. Crude Oil Financial Price Swap Contracts
     Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's crude oil financial price swap contracts at May 25, 2010, with notional volumes expressed in barrels per day (Bbld) and prices in dollars per barrel ($/Bbl). The average price of EOG's crude oil financial price swap contracts outstanding is $91.50 per barrel for the period from September 1, 2010 to December 31, 2010 and $93.18 per barrel for the year 2011.
