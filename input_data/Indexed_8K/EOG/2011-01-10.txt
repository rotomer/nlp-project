EOG RESOURCES, INC.
Item 7.01  Regulation FD Disclosure.
I.         Price Risk Management
With the objective of enhancing the certainty of future revenues, from time to time EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG) enters into New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) related financial collar, price swap and basis swap contracts.  EOG accounts for financial commodity derivative contracts using the mark-to-market accounting method.  In addition to financial transactions, from time to time EOG is a party to various physical commodity contracts for the sale of hydrocarbons that cover varying periods of time and have varying pricing provisions.  The financial impact of these physical commodity contracts is included in revenues at the time of settlement, which in turn affects average realized hydrocarbon prices.
For the fourth quarter of 2010, EOG anticipates a non-cash net loss of $43.9 million on the mark-to-market of its natural gas financial price swap and basis swap contracts and crude oil financial price swap contracts.  During the fourth quarter of 2010, net cash outflow related to settled natural gas basis swap and crude oil financial price swap contracts was $18.1 million.
For the quarter ended December 31, 2010, NYMEX natural gas at Henry Hub averaged $3.81 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) and NYMEX West Texas Intermediate crude oil averaged $85.17 per barrel.  EOG's actual realizations for natural gas and crude oil for the quarter ended December 31, 2010 will differ from these NYMEX prices due to location and quality adjustments.
II.         Natural Gas Financial Price Swap Contracts
Since filing its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2010 on November 2, 2010 (2010 Third Quarter Form 10-Q), EOG has entered into additional natural gas financial price swap contracts for the years 2011 and 2012.  Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's natural gas financial price swap contracts as of January 10, 2011, with notional volumes expressed in MMBtu per day (MMBtud) and prices expressed in dollars per MMBtu ($/MMBtu).
 
 
 
III.         Crude Oil Financial Price Swap Contracts
Since filing its 2010 Third Quarter Form 10-Q, EOG has entered into additional crude oil financial price swap contracts for 2011.  Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's crude oil financial price swap contracts as of January 10, 2011, with notional volumes expressed in barrels per day (Bbld) and prices expressed in dollars per barrel ($/Bbl).
IV.         Natural Gas Financial Basis Swap Contracts
Prices received by EOG for its natural gas production generally vary from NYMEX prices due to adjustments for delivery location (basis) and other factors.  EOG utilizes natural gas financial basis swap contracts in order to fix the differential between prices in the Rocky Mountain area and NYMEX Henry Hub prices.  EOG has not entered into any additional natural gas financial basis swap contracts since filing its 2010 Third Quarter Form 10-Q.  Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's natural gas financial basis swap contracts as of January 10, 2011.  The notional volumes are expressed in MMBtud and price differentials are expressed in $/MMBtu.  The weighted average price differential represents the amount of reduction to NYMEX g as prices per MMBtu for the notional volumes covered by the basis swap contracts.
V.         Proceeds from Assets Sales
In 2010, EOG received cash proceeds of approximately $650 million from the sales of certain assets.  These asset sales were a part of EOG's business plan to cover a portion of its 2010 cash flow shortfall.
 
 
 
VI.         Forward-Looking Statements
This document includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  All statements, other than statements of historical facts, including, among others, statements and projections regarding EOG's future financial position, operations, performance, business strategy, returns, budgets, reserves, levels of production and costs and statements regarding the plans and objectives of EOG's management for future operations, are forward-looking statements.  EOG typically uses words such as "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "project," "strategy," "intend," "plan," "target," "goal," "may," "will" and "believe" or the negative of those terms or other var iations or comparable terminology to identify its forward-looking statements.  In particular, statements, express or implied, concerning EOG's future operating results and returns or EOG's ability to replace or increase reserves, increase production or generate income or cash flows are forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance.  Although EOG believes the expectations reflected in its forward-looking statements are reasonable and are based on reasonable assumptions, no assurance can be given that these assumptions are accurate or that any of these expectations will be achieved (in full or at all) or will prove to have been correct.  Moreover, EOG's forward-looking statements may be affected by known and unknown risks, events or circumstances that may be outside EOG's control.  Important factors that could cause EOG's actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in EOG's forward-looking stat ements include, among others:
In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events anticipated by EOG's forward-looking statements may not occur, and, if any of such events do, we may not have anticipated the timing of their occurrence or the extent of their impact on our actual results.  Accordingly, you should not place any undue reliance on any of EOG's forward-looking statements. EOG's forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made and EOG undertakes no obligation, other than as required by applicable law, to update or revise its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events, anticipated or unanticipated circumstances or otherwise.
