EOG
Consistent with some analysts practice of matching realizations to settlement months and making certain other adjustments in order to exclude one-time items, adjusted non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $317.5 million, or $1.17 per share. Adjusted non-GAAP net income for the first quarter 2011 was $177.0 million, or $0.68 per share. The results for the first quarter 2012 included a $37.0 million, net of tax ($0.14 per share) impairment of certain North American non-core assets, net gains on asset dispositions of $43.2 million, net of tax ($0.16 per share) and a previously disclosed non-cash net gain of $134.2 million ($85.9 million after tax, or $0.32 per share) on the mark-to-market of financial commodity contracts. During the quarter, the net cash inflow related to financial commodity contracts was $133.6 million ($85.6 million after tax, or $0.31 per share). (Please refer to the attached tables for the reconciliation of adjusted non-GAAP net income to GAAP net income.)
Delivering on its goals of strong earnings, discretionary cash flow and adjusted EBITDAX growth, EOG posted robust financial metrics for the first quarter 2012 versus the same prior year period. Compared to the first quarter 2011, earnings per share increased 131 percent, discretionary cash flow increased 39 percent and adjusted EBITDAX rose 39 percent. (Please refer to the attached tables for the reconciliation of non-GAAP discretionary cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities (GAAP) and adjusted EBITDAX (non-GAAP) to income before interest expense and income taxes (GAAP).)
To put it simply, the marked improvement in productivity from individual wells is flowing to EOGs bottom line, said Mark G. Papa, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Our first quarter 2012 performance reflects both our prudent strategy of reinventing EOG as an oil company and underscores our early-mover advantage in prolific new domestic crude oil shale plays where we continue to hone our drilling and completion acumen.
Operational Highlights
Total company crude oil and condensate production increased 49 percent during the first quarter 2012 as compared to the first quarter 2011. United States crude oil and condensate production increased 61 percent driven by outstanding operational results from EOGs big four crude oil and liquids plays: the South Texas Eagle Ford, the North Dakota Bakken, the Fort Worth Barnett Combo and the Permian Basin Wolfcamp and Leonard. Total company natural gas liquids production increased 44 percent due to liquids-rich natural gas from these same four plays in which EOG holds premier acreage positions. Combined, EOGs first quarter 2012 total company liquids production from crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids increased 48 percent over the same prior year period.
Based on its first quarter 2012 operational results, EOG has raised its 2012 total company liquids production growth target to 33 percent from 30 percent and increased its total company production growth target to 7 percent from 5.5 percent.
Crude Oil and Liquids Activity
In the South Texas Eagle Ford, EOG is pursuing field development on spacing densities of 65 to 90 acres between wells. Production flow rates to date confirm well results equal to, or better than, previous development patterns. Testing is under way to address the viability of further downspacing and possible impact on well reserves and recovery factors.
In Gonzales County, the northeastern part of its Eagle Ford acreage, EOG drilled two new Henkhaus wells offsetting a series of six Henkhaus wells completed in late 2011. The Henkhaus Unit #5H well, drilled with a short lateral offsetting the previously drilled and producing Henkhaus Unit #4H, was turned to sales at 2,775 barrels of oil per day (Bopd) with 438 barrels per day (Bpd) of natural gas liquids (NGLs) and 2.3 million cubic feet per day (MMcfd) of natural gas. The Henkhaus Unit #4H, on-line since mid-December 2011, has produced over 130 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (Mboe). The Henkhaus Unit #12H, drilled offsetting the Henkhaus Unit #5H, began flowing at an initial rate of 3,000 Bopd with 425 Bpd of NGLs and 2.2 MMcfd of natural gas. Drilled on 65-acre spacing between wells, the Lord A Unit #2H and A Unit #3H were completed at 2,448 and 2,562 Bopd with 440 and 400 Bpd of NGLs and 2.3 and 2.1 MMcfd of natural gas, respectively. EOG has 100 percent working interest in these wells. Also in Gonzales County, the Brothers #4H, #5H and #6H began initial production at 3,424, 2,260 and 2,334 Bopd with 370, 233 and 274 Bpd of NGLs and 1.9, 1.2 and 1.4 MMcfd of natural gas, respectively. After 30 days on-line, these wells, in which EOG has 90 percent working interest, were producing 2,046, 1,427 and 1,553 Bopd, respectively.
In Karnes County, the center of EOGs 120-mile long Eagle Ford trend, the Alton Unit #2H, Unit #3H, Unit #4H, Unit #5H and Unit #6H were drilled on 85-acre spacing. The wells, in which EOG has 100 percent working interest, were completed to sales at initial individual production rates ranging from 1,940 to 3,158 Bopd with 206 to 329 Bpd of NGLs and 1.1 to 1.7 MMcfd of natural gas. The Alton Unit #6H had an average 30-day production rate of 1,770 Bopd. In McMullen County, the southwestern part of EOGs acreage, the Thelma-Brite #4H and #6H were completed to sales at rates of 1,697 and 1,902 Bopd each with 96 Bpd of NGLs and 500 thousand cubic feet per day (Mcfd) of natural gas, respectively.
Our confidence level in the Eagle Ford is very high. Even after we implemented denser well spacing earlier this year, individual well performance remains remarkably strong. In fact, based on ongoing completion refinements, 30-day crude oil production rates from recent wells have increased, Papa said.
In the Williston Basin, EOG posted positive results from its first quarter operations that focused on three distinct areas. In EOGs North Dakota Core Parshall Field, the Wayzetta 156-3329H, 124-3334H and 157-2835H were drilled on 320-acre infill spacing. Completed to sales at rates of 1,393, 992 and 1,083 Bopd with 600, 300 and 300 Mcfd of rich natural gas, respectively, these Mountrail County wells, in which EOG has 51 percent to 61 percent working interest, further confirm the economics and success of infill drilling. Additionally, production from previously drilled 640-acre offset wells in EOGs Core Parshall Field responded positively to the new downspaced completions. In McKenzie County, 25 miles southwest of its Core Parshall Field, EOG identified potential in both the Three Forks and Bakken in the Antelope Extension area where it brought a number of wells to sales. Four Three Forks wells, the Clarks Creek 11-0706H, 13-1806H, 14-1819H and 16-0706H, were completed at initial per well rates ranging from 926 to 3,415 Bopd with 1.2 to 3.0 MMcfd of rich natural gas. In this same area, EOG completed a Bakken well, the Clarks Creek 101-1819H, at 2,320 Bopd with 1.4 MMcfd of rich natural gas. EOG has 100 percent working interest in these five McKenzie County wells. On the Montana/North Dakota border, EOG drilled and completed a series of wells in the Stateline and Diamond Point areas that include the Stateline 03-1522H and the Diamond 02-3625H, both in Roosevelt County, Montana, with production rates exceeding expectations. The wells, in which EOG has 80 percent and 93 percent working interest, respectively, were turned to sales at 994 and 1,097 Bopd and began flowing with 400 and 700 Mcfd of rich natural gas, respectively. On the North Dakota side of the border in Williams County, the Hardscrabble 08-0409H, in which EOG has 39 percent working interest, began production at a rate of 1,693 Bopd with 600 Mcfd of rich natural gas. Recent success in the Montana/North Dakota border areas adds approximately 200 new locations to EOGs extensive Williston Basin crude oil drilling inventory.
EOG is testing several different methods to increase the recovery of oil in place on its Williston Basin acreage. Following encouraging infill drilling results from its Core Parshall Field, EOG plans to test downspaced drilling on certain parts of its Bakken Lite acreage outside the Core area later this year. Additionally, in mid-April EOG commenced two pilot Bakken waterflood projects in its Core Parshall Field to test secondary crude oil recovery methods as another viable way to improve oil recovery.
Another of EOGs key plays, the Fort Worth Barnett Combo, is on track to deliver the second largest contribution to total company liquids growth in 2012. During the first quarter, EOG completed the Ford A Unit #1H, A Unit #2H, B Unit #1H and B Unit #2H with individual maximum crude oil rates ranging from 420 to 700 Bopd with 80 to 184 Bpd of NGLs and 490 to 1,110 Mcfd of natural gas. EOG has approximately 99 percent working interest in these Cooke County wells. Also in Cooke County, the Kirk Unit #1H and Unit #2H had maximum production rates of 500 and 619 Bopd with 170 and 175 Bpd of NGLs and 1,038 and 1,060 Mcfd of natural gas, respectively. EOG has 93 percent working interest in these wells. During the first quarter, EOG also drilled successful step-out wells that expand the prospective area of its Barnett Combo acreage.
In the Permian Basin, EOG has ramped up drilling activity in both the West Texas Wolfcamp and New Mexico Leonard Plays. On the border between Crockett and Irion Counties in West Texas, EOG drilled the University 40 #1303H, #1310H, #1311H and #1312H in the Middle Wolfcamp interval. The wells, in which EOG has 75 percent working interest, were completed to sales at initial individual crude oil rates ranging from 517 to 645 Bopd with NGL production of 40 to 65 Bpd and 210 to 375 Mcfd of natural gas. The Linthicum M#2H in Irion County, in which EOG has 88 percent working interest, was turned to sales at 1,027 Bopd with 137 Bpd of NGLs and 778 Mcfd of natural gas. Based on drilling results to date on its West Texas Wolfcamp acreage, EOG estimates gross per well reserves to be 430 Mboe. In Lea County, New Mexico, EOG reported drilling success from the Leonard Shale with the Caballo 23 Fed #2H, #3H and #5H, which began initial sales at 820, 1,020 and 990 Bopd with 80, 200 and 110 Bpd of NGLs and 460, 1,105 and 600 Mcfd of natural gas, respectively. EOG has 86 percent working interest in the wells.
           During the first quarter, we made progress toward achieving a number of EOGs 2012 operational goals, Papa said. Production results and very strong 30-day flow rates from our Eagle Ford wells drilled on tighter spacing indicate we are effectively improving our completions. In addition, we expanded our Bakken operations in two different areas and confirmed economic infill drilling on our Core sweet spot acreage. Also, weve rapidly moved into development mode in the West Texas Wolfcamp. The momentum in our operations continues to drive every facet of our exploration and development activities. We are very upbeat about EOGs potential, Papa said.
Since the beginning of 2012, EOG has made additional strides in strategically positioning its marketing and operations. In April, EOG commissioned its crude-by-rail offloading facility at St. James, Louisiana. At this Gulf Coast sales point, EOG has the flexibility to market its Bakken, Eagle Ford and Permian crude oil production at Light Louisiana Sweet oil-indexed prices, which currently are trading at a premium to West Texas Intermediate. In addition, EOGs Wisconsin sand plant is in full operation. With the addition of this sand, EOG has the capacity to meet the requirements for the majority of its domestic well completions this year and beyond. Self-sourced sand is expected to generate significant operational cost savings.
Natural Gas Activity
Consistent with EOGs previously announced projections and pessimistic short-term view of the current natural gas price environment, its North American natural gas production declined by 9 percent in the first quarter 2012 compared to the same period 2011.
Hedging Activity
EOG has hedged approximately 28 percent of its North American crude oil production for 2012. For the period May 1 to June 30, 2012, EOG has crude oil financial price swap contracts in place for 52,000 barrels a day at a weighted average price of $105.80 per barrel, excluding unexercised options. For the period July 1 to December 31, 2012, EOG has crude oil financial price swap contracts in place for an average of 38,000 barrels a day at a weighted average price of $106.74 per barrel, excluding unexercised options.
EOG has hedged approximately 45 percent of its North American natural gas production for 2012. For the period June 1 through December 31, 2012, EOG has natural gas financial price swap contracts in place for 525,000 million British thermal units per day (MMBtud) at a weighted average price of $5.44 per million British thermal units (MMBtu), excluding unexercised options. For each of the years 2013 and 2014, EOG has natural gas financial price swap contracts in place for 150,000 MMBtud at a weighted average price of $4.79 per MMBtu, excluding unexercised options. (For a comprehensive summary of crude oil and natural gas derivative contracts, please refer to the attached tables.)
Capital Structure
Through May 1, cash proceeds from asset sales were approximately $565 million. At March 31, 2012, EOGs total debt outstanding was $5,011 million for a debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 28 percent. Taking into account cash on the balance sheet of $294 million at the end of the first quarter, EOGs net debt was $4,717 million for a net debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 27 percent. (Please refer to the attached tables for the reconciliation of net debt (non-GAAP) to long-term debt (GAAP) and the reconciliation of net debt-to-total capitalization ratio (non-GAAP) to debt-to-total capitalization ratio (GAAP).)
EOG made a strong start out of the gates for 2012. Based on first quarter performance in our big four plays, weve increased EOGs 2012 total company liquids production growth target to 33 percent and total company production growth target to 7 percent. In the first quarter, 85 percent of EOGs North American wellhead revenues emanated from liquids, driven by crude oil. With strong natural gas hedges in place for the remainder of the year, we are well positioned to realize our plan for 2012 while maintaining a strong balance sheet, Papa said.
