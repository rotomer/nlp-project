EOG Resources Reports Second Quarter 2012 Results and Increases 2012 Crude Oil Production Growth Target to 37 Percent
            _______________________________________________________
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Thursday, August 2, 2012
HOUSTON - EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG) today reported second quarter 2012 net income of $395.8 million, or $1.47 per share. This compares to second quarter 2011 net income
of $295.6 million, or $1.10 per share.
Consistent with some analysts' practice of matching realizations to settlement months and making certain other adjustments in order to exclude one-time items, adjusted non-GAAP net income for the second quarter 2012 was $312.4 million, or $1.16 per share. Adjusted non-GAAP net income for the second quarter 2011 was $299.2 million, or $1.11 per share. The results for the second quarter 2012 included impairments of $1.5 million, net of tax ($0.01 per share) related to certain non-core North American assets, net gains on asset dispositions of $75.1 million, net of tax ($0.28 per share) and a previously disclosed non-cash net gain of $188.4 million ($120.7 million after tax, or $0.45 per share) on the mark-to-market of financial commodity contracts. During the quarter, the net cash inflow related to financial commodity contracts was $173.2 million ($110.9 million after tax, or $0.41 per share). (Please refer to the attached tables for the reconciliation of adjusted non-GAAP net income to GAAP net income.)
With 86 percent of North American wellhead revenues currently derived from crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids, EOG delivered strong earnings per share growth of 64 percent for the first half of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011. Discretionary cash flow increased 29 percent and adjusted EBITDAX rose 28 percent over the first half of 2011. (Please refer to the attached tables for the reconciliation of non-GAAP discretionary cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities (GAAP) and adjusted EBITDAX (non-GAAP) to income before interest expense and income taxes (GAAP).)
"EOG's financial and operating results get better and better. We are achieving this consistent string of home runs because EOG has captured the finest inventory of onshore crude oil assets in the entire United States and has the technical acumen to maximize reserve recoveries," said Mark G. Papa, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "EOG is the largest crude oil producer in the South Texas Eagle Ford and North Dakota Bakken with the sweet spot positions in both plays. In addition, we are uniquely positioned to market a significant portion of this crude oil at robust Brent-type pricing through our own rail offloading facility at St. James, Louisiana, and to reach the Houston Gulf Coast market via the recently completed Enterprise Eagle Ford pipeline."
Operational Highlights
Due to robust operational results from the Eagle Ford and Bakken plays, EOG's total crude oil and condensate production for the second quarter 2012 increased 52 percent compared to the second quarter 2011. Total crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids production increased 49 percent over the same period in 2011. Based on these outstanding results, together with contributions from its West Texas Wolfcamp and New Mexico Leonard horizontal shale plays, EOG has increased its 2012 total company crude oil and condensate production growth target to 37 percent from 33 percent and its total liquids production growth target to 35 percent from 33 percent. Overall, EOG has increased its total company full year 2012 production growth target to 9 percent from 7 percent with no changes to its capital expenditure budget.
In the South Texas Eagle Ford, EOG drilled its best well to date. The Boothe Unit #10H in Gonzales County began initial production at 4,820 barrels of oil per day (Bopd) while an offset well, the Boothe Unit #9H, had an initial production rate of 3,708 Bopd. The Boothe wells produced 972 and 527 barrels per day (Bpd) of natural gas liquids (NGLs) and 4.5 and 2.4 million cubic feet per day (MMcfd) of associated natural gas production, respectively.
"We continually focus on making better wells and with an initial flow rate in excess of 4,800 barrels of crude oil per day, EOG's Boothe Unit #10H is clearly the top producing oil well in the entire Eagle Ford play to date," Papa added.
Drilled from the same pad as the Boothe wells to minimize costs, the Dreyer Unit #19H and #20H were turned to sales at initial rates of 3,703 and 2,650 Bopd with 460 and 300 Bpd of NGLs and 2.1 and 1.4 MMcfd of natural gas, respectively. EOG has 100 percent working interest in these four wells.
Also in Gonzales County, the Henkhaus Unit #9H, #10H and #11H flowed at individual initial well rates of 4,184, 3,546, and 4,140 Bopd, with 633, 730 and 670 Bpd of NGLs and 2.9, 3.4 and 3.1 MMcfd of natural gas, respectively. The Guadalupe Unit #5H, #6H, #7H and #8H were turned to sales early in the second quarter at initial individual crude oil production rates ranging from 2,675 to 3,900 Bopd with 175 to 590 Bpd of NGLs and 800 thousand cubic feet per day (Mcfd) to 2.7 MMcfd of natural gas. EOG has 100 percent working interest in these seven wells.
In Karnes County, the Crews Unit #1H, #2H, #3H, #4H and #5H initially produced at individual well rates ranging from 2,645 to 2,986 Bopd with 193 to 390 Bpd of NGLs and 900 Mcfd to 1.8 MMcfd of natural gas. EOG has 100 percent working interest in these five wells.
EOG's marketing options for its prolific Eagle Ford production expanded in July when Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (Enterprise) began first commercial operation of the first phase of a 24-inch crude oil pipeline linking the Eagle Ford with extensive Houston area refining markets. Enterprise also has commissioned a new natural gas processing plant, as well as rich natural gas pipelines to gather and transport production to its Mont Belvieu NGL complex.
In the Bakken, EOG's 90,000 net acre Core Parshall Field has evolved into a growth engine fueled by success from drilling wells on tighter densities. Initial infill drilling results in the over-pressured Core area and simultaneous increased production rates from proximate existing wells indicate significant amounts of recoverable crude oil remain. In an effort to improve recovery of the resource in place, EOG plans to further develop the Core on 320-acre spacing and test even tighter drilling densities.
During the second quarter, EOG reported a number of favorable results from its ongoing infill drilling program in the Core area. In Mountrail County, the Liberty LR 12-11H and Liberty LR 15-26H tested at 1,037 and 1,114 Bopd with 720 and 552 Mcfd of natural gas, respectively. EOG has 66 percent and 95 percent working interest in the wells, respectively. Also in the Core area, the Fertile 42-3231H and the Fertile 49-3024H came online at 1,063 Bopd with 408 Mcfd of natural gas and 928 Bopd with 365 Mcfd of natural gas, respectively. EOG has 69 percent and 80 percent working interest, respectively, in the wells.
In McKenzie County, North Dakota, 25 miles southwest of the Bakken Core, EOG is realizing economic production from its inventory of both Bakken and Three Forks drilling locations on its Antelope Extension prospect. EOG has 94 percent working interest in the Riverview 04-3031H drilled in the Bakken and the Riverview 100-3031H drilled in the Three Forks. The wells had initial production rates of 1,863 Bopd with 730 Mcfd of natural gas and 1,834 Bopd with 1.3 MMcfd of natural gas, respectively. Completed in the Bakken, the Clarks Creek 10-0805H initially produced 1,478 Bopd with 576 Mcfd of natural gas, while the Clarks Creek 100-0805H had an initial rate of 1,437 Bopd with 635 Mcfd of natural gas from the Three Forks. EOG has 85 percent working interest in the two wells. Also in the Antelope prospect, the Mandaree 16-04H, in which EOG has 90 percent working interest, produced 1,059 Bopd with 960 Mcfd of natural gas from the Bakken formation. In Roosevelt County, Montana, EOG completed the Stateline 08-3328H, with an initial production rate of 1,260 Bopd with 687 Mcfd of natural gas. EOG has 39 percent working interest in the well.
Having identified a large, multi-year drilling inventory on its Bakken Core, Antelope Extension and Stateline acreage, EOG expects to post crude oil production growth from North Dakota and Montana in 2013 and beyond.
In the West Texas and New Mexico Permian Basin, EOG is operating a seven-rig drilling program. Five rigs are operating in the Texas Wolfcamp horizontal shale play in Irion, Crockett and Reagan counties where drilling operations are defining the pervasiveness of the Wolfcamp middle interval across EOG's acreage. During the second quarter and early July, a number of wells from the middle Wolfcamp were brought to sales. In Irion County, the Munson #1001H, #1002H and #1003H came on-line at 1,110, 856 and 1,015 Bopd with 80, 70 and 40 Bpd of NGLs and 455, 405 and 230 Mcfd of natural gas, respectively. EOG has 85 percent working interest in these three Munson wells. The University 43A-#0802H, 43A-#0803H, 43A-#0805H and 43A-#0807H began production at individual initial rates ranging from 610 to 760 Bopd with 35 to 105 Bpd of NGLs and 200 to 590 Mcfd of natural gas. EOG has 50 percent working interest in these four Irion County University 43A wells.
EOG is operating two rigs in the New Mexico Leonard horizontal shale play in Eddy and Lea counties. The Ross Draw 8 Fed #2H had 722 Bopd of initial production with 270 Bpd of NGLs and 1.9 MMcfd of natural gas. The Ross Gulch 8 Fed Com #1H began sales at 540 Bopd with 145 Bpd of NGLs and 990 Mcfd of natural gas. EOG has 88 and 91 percent working interest in these Eddy County wells, respectively. In Lea County, EOG has 100 percent working interest in the Pitchblende 29 Fed Com #1H, which had an initial production rate of 1,026 Bopd with 120 Bpd of NGLs and 650 Mcfd of natural gas. This significant step-out well sets up numerous additional drilling locations. Early in the third quarter, EOG completed the Vaca 14 Fed #4H in Lea County with first sales of 986 Bopd with 200 Bpd of NGLs and 1.1 MMcfd of natural gas. EOG has 100 percent working interest in the well. Following the Eagle Ford and Bakken, EOG's Permian Basin operation was the third largest contributor to its crude oil and condensate production growth during the second quarter.
Crude Oil and Liquids Activity
"We increased EOG's 2012 crude oil production growth target to 37 percent based on the strength of our drilling results for the first half of the year. This new goal sets EOG up to achieve an all-organic, five-year compounded annual crude oil production growth rate of 38 percent through year-end 2012," Papa said.
"Looking ahead, we expect EOG's resource-rich portfolio will continue to generate high crude oil production growth rates for a long time," Papa added.
Natural Gas Activity
Due to the ongoing weakness in natural gas pricing, EOG plans to further decrease drilling activity on its dry gas resource plays in the second half of 2012. Through active drilling programs in prior years and 2012 to date, EOG has captured strategic natural gas acreage in the Uinta, Horn River, Barnett, Haynesville and Marcellus plays. When natural gas prices rebound, EOG will hold an attractive portfolio of natural gas resources for future development.
Hedging Activity
EOG has hedged approximately 22 percent of its North American crude oil production from August 1 to December 31, 2012. EOG has crude oil financial price swap contracts in place for an average of 35,600 Bpd at a weighted average price of $106.69 per barrel, excluding unexercised options. For the period January 1 to June 30, 2013, EOG has crude oil financial price swap contracts in place for an average of 16,000 barrels per day at a weighted average price of $98.12.
EOG has hedged approximately 45 percent of its North American natural gas production for 2012. For the period September 1 through December 31, 2012, EOG has natural gas financial price swap contracts in place for 525,000 million British thermal units per day (MMBtud) at a weighted average price of $5.44 per million British thermal units (MMBtu), excluding unexercised options. For 2013, EOG has natural gas financial price swap contracts in place for 150,000 MMBtud at a weighted average price of $4.79 per MMBtu, excluding unexercised options. (For a comprehensive summary of EOG's crude oil and natural gas derivative contracts, please refer to the attached tables.)
Capital Structure
Through June 30, 2012 EOG's cash proceeds from asset sales were approximately $1,112 million. EOG is targeting total asset sales for the year of $1.2 to $1.25 billion. At June 30, 2012, EOG's total debt outstanding was $5,012 million for a debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 27 percent. Taking into account cash on the balance sheet of $280 million at the end of the second quarter, EOG's net debt was $4,732 million for a net debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 26 percent. (Please refer to the attached tables for the reconciliation of net debt (non-GAAP) to long-term debt (GAAP) and the reconciliation of net debt-to-total capitalization ratio (non-GAAP) to debt-to-total capitalization ratio (GAAP).)
 "By harnessing our team's outstanding technical expertise and innovative marketing strengths to EOG's exceptional asset base, during the first half of 2012 we achieved a number of our corporate goals. EOG reported growth in earnings per share, discretionary cash flow and adjusted EBITDAX. With our tremendous momentum, we increased our crude oil production growth target twice, achieved our asset sales goal and maintained a strong balance sheet," Papa said. "Moving into the second half of the year, our focus is on realizing our 2012 goal of 37 percent crude oil production growth while we moderate our drilling activity level to stay within our capital budget."

QUANTITATIVE RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED NET INCOME (NON-GAAP)
TO NET INCOME (GAAP)
(Unaudited; in thousands, except per share data)
The following chart adjusts the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 reported Net Income (GAAP) to reflect actual net cash realized from financial commodity price transactions by eliminating the unrealized mark-to-market gains from these transactions, to add back impairment charges related to certain of EOG's North American assets in 2012 and 2011 and to eliminate the net gains on asset dispositions primarily in North America in 2012 and 2011.  EOG believes this presentation may be useful to investors who follow the practice of some industry analysts who adjust reported company earnings to match realizations to production settlement months and make certain other adjustments to exclude non-recurring items.  EOG management uses this information for comparative purposes within the industry.
