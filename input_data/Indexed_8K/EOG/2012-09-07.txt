required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances existing when the Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, not misleading or (ii) it is necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus to comply with law, to immediately notify the Underwriters thereof and forthwith prepare and, subject to paragraph (d) above, file with the Commission and furnish to the Underwriters and to such dealers as the Representatives may designate, such amendments or supplements to the Prospectus as may be necessary so that the statements in the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances existing when the Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, be misleading or so that the Prospectus will comply with law;
(h) During the period from the date hereof through and including the Closing Date, the Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Representatives, offer, sell or otherwise dispose of any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Company and having a tenor of more than one year;
(i) During the period of five years from the date hereof, to supply or to make available via the Commission's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval (EDGAR) system, to the Representatives, and to each other Underwriter who may so request in writing, copies of such financial statements and other periodic and special reports as the Company may from time to time distribute to the holders of any class of its securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act and to furnish to the Representatives and such Underwriters a copy of each annual or other report it shall be required to file with the Commission;

(k) Pursuant to reasonable procedures developed in good faith, to retain copies of each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus that is not filed with the Commission in accordance with Rule 433 under the Securities Act.

(b) It is not subject to any pending proceeding under Section 8A of the Securities Act with respect to the offering (and will promptly notify the Company if any such proceeding against it is initiated during the Prospectus Delivery Period).
7. The obligations of the Underwriters hereunder shall be subject, in their discretion, to the condition that all representations and warranties and other statements of the Company herein are, at and as of the Time of Sale and the Closing Date, true and correct, the condition that the Company shall have performed all of its obligations hereunder theretofore to be performed, and the following additional conditions:
(a) No order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement shall be in effect, and no proceeding for such purpose, pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) or pursuant to Section 8A under the Securities Act, shall be pending before or threatened by the Commission; the Prospectus and each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus shall have been timely filed with the Commission under the Securities Act (in the case of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, to the extent required by Rule 433 under the Securities Act) and in accordance with Section 4(a) hereof; and all requests by the Commission for additional information shall have been complied with to the reasonable satisfaction of the Representatives;
 
(b) Bracewell & Giuliani LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, shall have furnished to them such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date, with respect to the Company, this Agreement, the Notes and the Indenture, and other related matters as the Underwriters may reasonably request, and such counsel shall have received such papers and information as they may reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such matters;

(f) (i) Since the date of the Company's latest audited financial statements incorporated by reference in the Time of Sale Information, the Company shall not have sustained any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Time of Sale Information, and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Time of Sale Information there shall not have been any change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, prospects, management, financial position, stockholder's equity or results of operations of the Company otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Time of Sale Information, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in the Representatives' judgment so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering of the Notes for resale or the delivery of the Notes on the terms and in the manner contemplated in this Agreement and the Prospectus;
(g) On or after the earlier of the Time of Sale or the date hereof, (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded any securities of the Company by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as that term is defined in Section 3(a)(62) of the Exchange Act and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the securities of the Company;

(i) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Underwriters at the Closing Date certificates of officers of the Company satisfactory to the Representatives as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein at and as of the Closing Date, as to the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to the Closing Date, as to the matters set forth in subsections (f) and (g) of this Section and as to such other matters as the Underwriters may reasonably request; and
(j) The Notes shall be eligible for clearance and settlement through The Depository Trust Company.
8. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, each partner, manager, director, principal and officer of each Underwriter, each person, if any, who controls each Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and each entity that is an affiliate of an Underwriter and that has participated in the distribution of the Notes as an underwriter, as follows:
(i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement to such documents), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
(ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission; provided that (subject to Section 8(d) below) any such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company; and
 
(iii) against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including, subject to Section 8(c) hereof, the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Underwriters), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above;
that the indemnity set forth in this Section 8(a) shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Representatives on behalf of the Underwriters expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement to such documents), or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
provided, however,
(b) Each Underwriter, severally but not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each director and officer of the Company, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement to such documents), or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Representatives on behalf of such Underwriter expressly for use therein.
(c) Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Underwriters, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(b) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Company, provided that if it so elects within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice, an indemnifying party, jointly with any other indemnifying parties receiving such notice, may assume the defense of such action with counsel chosen by it and approved by the indemnified parties defendant in such action, unless such indemnified parties reasonably object to such assumption on the ground that there may be legal defenses available to them which are different from or in addition to those available to such indemnifying party. If an indemnifying party assumes the defense of such action, the
 
indemnifying parties shall not be liable for any fees and expenses of counsel for the indemnified parties incurred thereafter in connection with such action. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 8 (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 8(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, an indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 8(a)(ii) effected without its consent if such indemnifying party (i) reimburses such indemnified party in accordance with such request to the extent it considers such request to be reasonable and (ii) provides written notice to the indemnified party substantiating the unpaid balance as unreasonable, in each case prior to the date of such settlement.
(e) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to herein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred
 
to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses but after deducting the total fee or commission received by the Underwriters ) received by the Company and the total fee or commission received by the Underwriters bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Notes. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(e) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 8(e). The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 8(e) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(e), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes purchased and resold by it were resold to investors exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. For purposes of this Section 8(e), each partner, manager, director, principal and officer of an Underwriter, and each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter; and each director and officer of the Company, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute as provided in this Section 8(e) are several and not joint.
(f) The Underwriters hereby confirm and the Company acknowledges that the statements made in (i) the fourth paragraph of the text under the caption "Underwriting" in the Prospectus concerning the terms of the offering of the Notes by the Underwriters and (ii) the eighth paragraph of the text under the caption "Underwriting" in the Prospectus concerning price stabilization and short positions constitute the only written information furnished to the Company by the Representatives on behalf of the Underwriters expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement to such documents), or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
 
9. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, any partner, manager, director, principal or officer of an Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company or any officer or director of the Company, or any controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Notes.
10. If for any reason, the Notes are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Underwriters, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Notes, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to the Underwriters except as provided in Section 5 and Section 8 hereof.
11. If any of the Underwriters shall fail at the Closing Date to purchase the Notes which it is obligated to purchase under this Agreement (the ""), the remaining Underwriter(s) (the "") shall have the right, but not the obligation, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements to purchase (alone or together with any other underwriters) all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Notes upon the terms herein set forth. If, however, the Non-Defaulting Underwriter(s) shall not have completed such arrangements within such 24-hour period, then:
Defaulted Notes
Non-Defaulting Underwriter(s)
(a) if the aggregate principal amount of Defaulted Notes does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be purchased on such date, each of the Non-Defaulting Underwriter(s) shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations hereunder bear to the underwriting obligations of all Non-Defaulting Underwriter(s), or
(b) if the aggregate principal amount of Defaulted Notes exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be purchased on such date, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any Non-Defaulting Underwriter.
No action taken pursuant to this Section 11 shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement, then the Non-Defaulting Underwriter(s) shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements.
 
12. All statements, requests, notices, and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by courier service, mail or facsimile transmission to them in care of (i) Barclays Capital Inc. at 745 Seventh Avenue, New York, New York 10019, Attention: Syndicate Registration, Facsimile No. (646) 834-8133; (ii) Citigroup Global Markets Inc. at 388 Greenwich Street, New York, New York 10013, Facsimile No. (212) 816-7912, Attention: General Counsel; (iii) J.P.

We have also assumed the legal capacity of natural persons, the corporate or other power and due authorization of each person not a natural person other than the Company to execute and deliver the Indenture and the Underwriting Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Indenture and the Underwriting Agreement, the due execution and delivery of each of the Indenture and the Underwriting Agreement by all parties thereto, and that each of the Indenture and the Underwriting Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of each party thereto other than the Company, enforceable against such party in accordance with its terms.
Based upon the foregoing and subject to the assumptions, exceptions, qualifications and limitations set forth hereinafter, we are of the opinion that:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The opinions and other matters in this letter are qualified in their entirety and subject to the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For purposes of this letter, we have assumed that the Prospectus was deemed to be a part of and included in the Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 430B(f)(1) of the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Act as of the date of the Underwriting Agreement.
Because the primary purpose of our professional engagement was not to establish or confirm factual matters or financial, accounting, reserve or production information and because many determinations involved in the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus
 
and the Disclosure Package are of a wholly or partially non-legal character, except as expressly set forth in paragraphs 3, 5, 10 and 11 of this letter, we are not passing upon and do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the Disclosure Package, and we make no representation that we have independently verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of such statements.
However, in the course of our acting as special counsel to the Company in connection with the preparation of the Final Prospectus Supplement and the Disclosure Package, we have reviewed each such document and the Registration Statement and the Base Prospectus and have participated in conferences and telephone conversations with representatives of the Company, representatives of the Company's independent public accountant, representatives of the Company's independent petroleum engineers, representatives of the Underwriters and representatives of the Underwriters' counsel, during which conferences and conversations the contents of such documents and related matters were discussed.
Based on our participation in such conferences and conversations, our review of the documents described above, our understanding of the U.S. federal securities laws and the experience we have gained in our practice thereunder, we advise you that:
(a) Each of the Registration Statement, as of the date of the Underwriting Agreement, the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, as of its date, and the Prospectus, as of the date of the Final Prospectus Supplement, appeared on its face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, except that we express no view as to the financial statements, financial schedules and other financial, accounting, reserve and production data contained or incorporated by reference therein and the Statement of Eligibility and Qualification of the Trustee on Form T-1; and
(b) No facts have come to our attention that cause us to believe that (i) the Registration Statement, as of the date of the Underwriting Agreement, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; (ii) the Disclosure Package, as of [            ] p.m., New York City time, on the date of the Underwriting Agreement (which you have informed us is a time prior to the first sale of the Securities), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading; or (iii) the Prospectus, as of the date of the Final Prospectus Supplement and as of the date hereof, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that in the case of each of clauses (i)-(iii) above, we do not express any view as to the financial statements, financial schedules and other financial, accounting, reserve and production data contained or incorporated by reference therein and the Statement of Eligibility and Qualification of the Trustee on Form T-1.
