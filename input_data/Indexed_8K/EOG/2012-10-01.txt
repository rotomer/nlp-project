EOG RESOURCES, INC.
(e)
            
Effective September 25, 2012, the Compensation Committee (Committee) of the Board of Directors of EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG) granted long-term incentive awards to each of EOG's executive officers.  Consistent with prior year awards, the Committee awarded restricted stock or restricted stock units (RSUs) to each executive officer and stock-settled stock appreciation rights (SARs) to each executive officer (other than Mark G. Papa, EOG's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer), in each case under the terms of the EOG Resources, Inc. 2008 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan, as amended (2008 Plan).
The grants of restricted stock/RSUs will, consistent with prior year awards, "cliff" vest five years from the date of grant.  Dividends will be credited to the holder of the restricted stock/RSUs and will either be paid at the expiration of the vesting period or be forfeited if the related restricted stock/RSUs are forfeited and cancelled in accordance with the standard termination provisions set forth in each executive officer's grant agreement.  Also consistent with prior year awards, each of the grants of SARs (which may be settled upon exercise by the executive officer solely in shares of EOG common stock) have a term of seven years and will vest 25% on each of the first four anniversaries of the date of grant.  The SARs were awarded at an exercise price equal to $112.42 (the closing price of EOG's common stock on September 25, 2012) and are subject to the standard termination provisions set forth in each executive officer's grant agreement.
As a new element of the long-term incentive component of EOG's executive officer compensation program, the Committee also granted performance units and/or shares of performance stock to each executive officer, in each case under the terms of the 2008 Plan.  The performance metric applicable to these performance-based grants is EOG's Total Shareholder Return (as defined in the grant agreements) over a three-year performance period (January 2013 through December 2015) relative to the Total Shareholder Return of each of EOG's Peer Companies (as specified in the grant agreements).  If EOG achieves median Total Shareholder Return performance over the performance period relative to the Peer Companies, 100% of an executive officer's performance units/shares will be earned; conversely, a performance multiple of 0% to 200% (as specified in the grant agreements) will be applied to an executive officer's performance units/shares if EOG's Total Shareholder Return performance over the performance period is below or above the median of the Peer Companies.
Subject to the termination provisions set forth in each executive officer's grant agreement and the applicable performance multiple, the grants of performance units/shares will "cliff" vest five years from the date of grant.  Dividends will be credited to the holder of the performance units/shares and will have the same performance multiple applied as is applied to the executive officer's performance units/shares.  Any such credited dividends (as so adjusted) will be paid at the expiration of the vesting period, unless the related performance units/shares are forfeited and cancelled in accordance with the executive officer's grant agreement, in which case such dividends will also be forfeited.
The following table sets forth the restricted stock/RSUs, SARs and performance units/shares granted by the Committee to each of EOG's executive officers:
The foregoing descriptions of the grants of restricted stock, RSUs, SARs, performance units and performance stock do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the forms of grant agreement for the grants of restricted stock, RSUs, SARs, performance units and performance stock, which are filed as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4 and 10.5 hereto, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.

All statements, other than statements of historical facts, including, among others, statements and projections regarding EOG's future financial position, operations, performance, business strategy, returns, budgets, reserves, levels of production and costs and statements regarding the plans and objectives of EOG's management for future operations, are forward-looking statements.  EOG typically uses words such as "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "project," "strategy," "intend," "plan," "target," "goal," "may," "will" and "believe" or the negative of those terms or other variations or comparable terminology to identify its forward-looking statements.  In particular, statements, express or implied, concerning EOG's future operating results and returns or EOG's ability to replace or increase reserves, increase production, generate income or cash flows or pay dividends are forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance.  Although EOG believes the expectations reflected in its forward-looking statements are reasonable and are based on reasonable assumptions, no assurance can be given that these assumptions are accurate or that any of these expectations will be achieved (in full or at all) or will prove to have been correct.  Moreover, EOG's forward-looking statements may be affected by known and unknown risks, events or circumstances that may be outside EOG's control.  Important factors that could cause EOG's actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in EOG's forward-looking statements include, among others:
In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events anticipated by EOG's forward-looking statements may not occur, and, if any of such events do, we may not have anticipated the timing of their occurrence or the extent of their impact on our actual results.  Accordingly, you should not place any undue reliance on any of EOG's forward-looking statements. EOG's forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made, and EOG undertakes no obligation, other than as required by applicable law, to update or revise its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events, anticipated or unanticipated circumstances or otherwise.
