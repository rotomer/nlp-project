        On April 30, 2003, Equity Residential issued a press release announcing its results of operations and financial condition for the three months ended and as of March 31, 2003. The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. The information in this Current Report is being furnished pursuant to Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition, under Item 9 of Form 8-K as directed in Securities and Exchange Commission Release No. 34-47583.
        The attached press release includes a presentation of Equity Residential's Net Operating Income (" NOI"). If NOI falls within the definition of "non-GAAP financial measure" set forth in Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K, Equity Residential is required to include in this Current Report a statement disclosing the reasons why management believes that presentation of NOI provides useful information to investors regarding Equity Residential's results of operations. Equity Residential believes that NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the Company's apartment properties.

Exhibit 99.1
        
CHICAGO, IL APRIL 30, 2003
Equity Residential (NYSE: EQR) today reported results for the quarter ended March 31, 2003. All per share results are reported on a fully diluted basis. The Company also announced that Douglas Crocker II, its former CEO, has resigned from its Board of Trustees and will not stand for re-election at the annual meeting of shareholders on May 30, 2003.
        "After retiring as CEO, I have been presented with many business opportunities, some of which I would like to consider. Therefore, to avoid any real or perceived conflicts, I am resigning from the Board of Trustees. Although I am officially ending my business ties, I will never end my personal and emotional ties to Equity Residential," said Mr. Crocker.
        "We are very appreciative of Doug's leadership over the last ten years and we wish him well in his current and future endeavors," said Samuel Zell, Chairman of Equity Residential.
First Quarter 2003
        "The weak economy continues to take its toll on the multifamily industry," said Bruce W. Duncan, Equity Residential's President and CEO. "While we are encouraged that revenues in each of the first three months of 2003 are running at a higher rate than December 2002 revenues, it is still too early to make predictions regarding the timing of a recovery."
        For the quarter ended March 31, 2003, the Company reported earnings of $0.41 per share compared to $0.28 per share in the first quarter of 2002. The quarterly increase is primarily attributable to higher gains on property sales.
        Funds From Operations (FFO) for the quarter were $168.6 million, or $0.57 per share, compared to $192.1 million, or $0.64 per share, in the first quarter of 2002.
        Total revenues for the quarter were $486.1 million compared to $491.0 million in the same period of 2002.
"Same-Store" Results
        On a "same-store" first quarter 2003 to first quarter 2002 comparison, which includes 191,278 units, revenues decreased 3.5 percent, expenses increased 7.7 percent and net operating income (NOI) decreased 9.6 percent. On a sequential "same-store" comparison, for these same 191,278 units, from fourth quarter 2002 to first quarter 2003, revenues decreased 0.3 percent, expenses increased 2.0 percent and NOI decreased 1.8 percent.
Acquisitions/Dispositions
        During the first quarter of 2003, the Company acquired three properties consisting of 920 units for an aggregate purchase price of $111.5 million at an average capitalization (cap) rate of 7.0 percent. Also during the quarter, Equity Residential sold 17 properties, consisting of 4,000 units, for an aggregate sale price of $195.0 million at an average cap rate of 7.6 percent.
Second Quarter 2003 Earnings
        Equity Residential expects to announce second quarter 2003 results on Wednesday, August 13, 2003 and host a conference call to discuss those results that day at 10:00 am CT.
        Equity Residential is the largest publicly traded apartment company in America. Nationwide, Equity Residential owns or has investments in 1,027 properties in 36 states consisting of 221,249 units. For more information on Equity Residential, please visit our website at

Forward-Looking Statements
        The Company lists parameters for 2003 results in the final page of this release. 2003 results will depend upon a slowdown in multifamily starts and economic recovery and job growth.

. This news release also contains forward-looking statements concerning development properties. The total number of units and cost of development and completion dates reflect the Company's best estimates and are subject to uncertainties arising from changing economic conditions (such as costs of labor and construction materials), completion and local government regulation. The Company assumes no obligation to update or supplement forward-looking statements that become untrue because of subsequent events.
A live web cast of the Company's conference call discussing these results and outlook for 2003 will take place today at 10:00 a.m. Central. Please visit the Investor Information section of the Company's web site at

The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") defines funds from operations ("FFO") (April 2002 White Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. The April 2002 White Paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from FFO for previously depreciated operating properties only. Once the Company commences the conversion of units to condominiums, it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property. Accordingly, the Company included in FFO its incremental gains or losses from the sale of condominium units to third parties, which represented net gains of $443 and $339 for the quarters ended March 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because, along with cash flows from operating activities, financing activities and investing activities, it provides investors an understanding of the ability of the Company to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures. FFO in and of itself does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the Company's performance or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP as a measure of liquidity and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. The Company's calculation of FFO may differ from other real estate companies due to variations among the Company's and other real estate companies' accounting policies for replacement type items and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies.
