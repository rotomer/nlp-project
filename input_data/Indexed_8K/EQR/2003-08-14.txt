Exhibit 99.1 Equity Residential Reports Second Quarter Results CHICAGO, IL - August 13, 2003 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Equity Residential (NYSE: EQR) today reported results for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2003. All per share results are reported on a fully diluted basis. (Logo: http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20010801/ERPTCLOGO ) "We are pleased that sequential "same-store" revenues have stabilized, which would indicate that we are at the low point, but we are still awaiting the job growth that will drive the recovery of our industry. As a result, we continue to believe that our 2003 Funds from Operations (FFO) will be at the bottom of the $2.25 to $2.40 per share range we have previously discussed," said Bruce W. Duncan, Equity Residential's President and CEO. Second Quarter 2003 For the quarter ended June 30, 2003, the Company reported earnings of $0.41 per share compared to $0.32 per share in the second quarter of 2002. The quarterly increase is primarily attributable to higher gains on property sales. FFO for the quarter were $169.0 million, or $0.57 per share, compared to $189.7 million, or $0.63 per share, in the same period of 2002. Total revenues for the quarter were $483.1 million compared to $484.2 million in the second quarter of 2002. Six Months Ended June 30, 2003 For the six months ended June 30, 2003, the Company reported earnings of $0.82 per share compared to $0.60 per share in the same period of 2002. The six month increase is primarily attributable to higher gains on property sales. FFO were $337.7 million, or $1.14 per share, compared to $381.8 million, or $1.27 per share, for the six months ended June 30, 2002. Total revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2003 were $958.5 million compared to $964.2 million in the same period last year. "Same-Store" Results On a "same-store" second quarter to second quarter comparison, which includes 185,697 units, revenues decreased 3.0 percent, expenses increased 5.3 percent and net operating income (NOI) decreased 7.7 percent. On a sequential "same-store" comparison for these same 185,697 units from first quarter 2003 to second quarter 2003, revenues remained flat, expenses increased 0.9 percent and NOI decreased 0.6 percent. On a "same-store" six month to six month comparison, which includes 185,329 units, revenues decreased 3.2 percent, expenses increased 6.3 percent and NOI decreased 8.6 percent. Acquisitions/Dispositions During the second quarter of 2003, the Company acquired three properties, consisting of 1,038 units, for an aggregate purchase price of $166.2 million at an average capitalization (cap) rate of 6.6 percent. Also during the quarter, the Company sold 27 properties, consisting of 6,308 units, for an aggregate sale price of $303.4 million at an average cap rate of 7.5 percent. During the first six months of 2003, the Company acquired six properties, consisting of 1,958 units, for an aggregate purchase price of $277.7 million at an average cap rate of 6.8 percent and sold 44 properties, consisting of 10,308 units, for an aggregate sale price of $498.4 million at an average cap rate of 7.5 percent. Corporate Governance Equity Residential received high marks for its corporate governance policies and practices from Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), the world's leading provider of proxy voting and corporate governance services. According to ISS's Corporate Governance Quotient (CGQ) ratings, as of August 12, 2003 the Company has outperformed 99 percent of all companies in the S&P 500 index and 99.5 percent of companies in the real estate group. As a result, Equity Residential has the fifth highest CGQ rating of all the companies that comprise the S&P 500.

Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. The April 2002 White Paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from FFO for previously depreciated operating properties only. Once the Company commences the conversion of units to condominiums, it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property. Accordingly, the Company included in FFO its incremental gains or losses from the sale of condominium units to third parties, which represented net gains of $2,887 and $870 for the six months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and $2,444 and $531 for the quarters ended June 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively. (b) The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because it provides investors an understanding of the ability of the Company to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures. FFO in and of itself does not represent net income or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO should not be exclusively considered as an alternative to net income or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The Company's calculation of FFO may differ from other real estate companies due to variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies.

NOI represents rental income less property and maintenance expense, real estate tax and insurance expense, and property management expense. The Company believes that NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the Company's apartment communities.

EQUITY RESIDENTIAL As a result of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation FD, the Company will provide earnings guidance in its quarterly earnings release. These projections are based on current expectations and are forward- looking. 2003 Earnings Guidance (per share diluted) Q3 YEAR Expected EPS (a) $0.22 to $0.23 $1.27 to $1.42 Add: Expected depreciation expense 0.41 1.63 Less: Expected net gain on sales (a) (0.08) (0.65) Expected FFO (b) $0.55 to $0.56 $2.25 to $2.40 2003 Same-Store Operating Assumptions Physical occupancy 93.0% Revenue change (3.5%) to (1.2%) Expense change 2.8% to 5.2% NOI change (9.2%) to (3.7%) Dispositions $700 million (a) Earnings per share ("EPS") represents net income per share calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Expected EPS is calculated on a basis consistent with actual EPS. Due to the uncertain timing and extent of property dispositions and the resulting gains/losses on sales, actual EPS could differ materially from expected EPS. (b) The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") defines funds from operations ("FFO") (April 2002 White Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis.
