Exhibit 99.1 Equity Residential Reports Third Quarter Results CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 4, 2003--Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR) today reported results for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2003. All per share results are reported on a fully diluted basis. "We are encouraged by signs of an economic recovery," said Bruce W. Duncan, Equity Residential's President and CEO. "However, until we reach the point that we have sustained job growth, we do not anticipate much improvement in our business." Third Quarter 2003 For the quarter ended September 30, 2003, the Company reported earnings of $0.41 per share compared to $0.23 per share in the third quarter of 2002. The quarterly increase is primarily attributable to higher gains on property sales. Funds from Operations (FFO) for the quarter were $167.3 million, or $0.56 per share, compared to $162.9 million, or $0.54 per share, in the same period of 2002. Effective January 1, 2003, the Company no longer adds back impairment losses when computing FFO in accordance with NAREIT's definition. As a result, third quarter 2002 FFO per share of $0.54 reflects a $17.4 million, or $0.06 per share, charge that the Company took at that time as an impairment on the value of its corporate housing business and technology investments. Total revenues from continuing operations for the quarter were $473.0 million compared to $469.0 million in the third quarter of 2002. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2003 For the nine months ended September 30, 2003, the Company reported earnings of $1.23 per share compared to $0.83 per share in the same period of 2002. The nine- month increase is primarily attributable to higher gains on property sales. FFO were $504.9 million, or $1.70 per share, compared to $544.7 million, or $1.81 per share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2002. As noted in the section of this release regarding Third Quarter 2003 results, effective January 1, 2003, the Company no longer adds back impairment losses when computing FFO in accordance with NAREIT's definition. As a result, the nine-month 2002 FFO per share of $1.81 reflects an $18.0 million, or $0.06 per share, charge that the Company took in the third quarter 2002 as an impairment on the value of its corporate housing business and technology investments. Total revenues from continuing operations remained constant at $1.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 and September 30, 2002, respectively. "Same-Store" Results On a "same-store" third quarter to third quarter comparison, which includes 181,656 units, revenues decreased 1.9 percent, expenses increased 4.3 percent and net operating income (NOI) decreased 5.7 percent. On a sequential "same-store" comparison for these same 181,656 units from second quarter 2003 to third quarter 2003, revenues remained flat, expenses increased 3.1 percent and NOI decreased 1.9 percent. On a "same-store" nine-month to nine-month comparison, which includes 179,233 units, revenues decreased 2.8 percent, expenses increased 5.4 percent and NOI decreased 7.5 percent. Acquisitions/Dispositions During the third quarter of 2003, the Company acquired two properties, consisting of 720 units, for an aggregate purchase price of $112.0 million at an average capitalization (cap) rate of 6.2 percent. Also during the quarter, the Company sold 19 properties, consisting of 5,688 units, for an aggregate sale price of $304.8 million at an average cap rate of 7.4 percent. During the first nine months of 2003, the Company acquired eight properties, consisting of 2,678 units, for an aggregate purchase price of $389.7 million at an average cap rate of 6.6 percent and sold 63 properties, consisting of 15,996 units, for an aggregate sale price of $803.2 million at an average cap rate of 7.5 percent. Fourth Quarter/Year End 2003 Results Equity Residential expects to announce fourth quarter/year end 2003 results on Wednesday, February 4, 2004 and host a conference call to discuss those results at 10:00 a.m. CT that day.

Forward-Looking Statements The Company lists parameters for 2003 and 2004 results in the final page of this release. 2003 and 2004 results will depend upon a slowdown in multifamily starts and economic recovery and job growth.

Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. The April 2002 White Paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from FFO for previously depreciated operating properties only. Once the Company commences the conversion of units to condominiums, it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property. Accordingly, the Company included in FFO its incremental gains or losses from the sale of condominium units to third parties, which represented net gains of $7,487 and $1,198 for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and $4,600 and $328 for the quarters ended September 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Effective January 1, 2003, the Company no longer adds back impairment losses when computing FFO in accordance with NAREIT's definition. As a result, FFO for the nine months and quarter ended September 30, 2002 have been reduced by $17,994 and $17,413, respectively, to conform to the current year presentation. (2) The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because it provides investors an understanding of the ability of the Company to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures. FFO in and of itself does not represent net income or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO should not be exclusively considered as an alternative to net income or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The Company's calculation of FFO may differ from other real estate companies due to variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies.

The Company believes that NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the Company's apartment communities.

Expected EPS is calculated on a basis consistent with actual EPS. Due to the uncertain timing and extent of property dispositions and the resulting gains/losses on sales, actual EPS could differ materially from expected EPS. (2) The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") defines funds from operations ("FFO") (April 2002 White Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. Expected FFO is calculated on a basis consistent with actual FFO.
