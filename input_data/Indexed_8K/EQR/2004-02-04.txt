Exhibit 99.1 Equity Residential Reports 2003 Results CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 4, 2004--Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR) today reported results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2003. All per share results are reported on a fully diluted basis. "We still await the job growth and related household formations that will drive the recovery of the multifamily industry," said Bruce W. Duncan, Equity Residential's President and CEO. "We continue to focus our efforts on the reconfiguration of our portfolio as well as customer service and resident retention, as we keep an eye on the improving economy." Fourth Quarter 2003 For the quarter ended December 31, 2003, the Company reported earnings of $0.33 per share compared to $0.35 per share in the fourth quarter of 2002. Funds from Operations (FFO) for the quarter ended December 31, 2003 were $0.45 per share compared to $0.59 per share in the same period of 2002. The primary components of the reduction in FFO quarter over quarter include a one-time 2003 fourth quarter $0.07 per share expense related to the December 26, 2003 redemption of the Company's Series G Preferred Shares and a $0.03 per share reduction of "same-store" Net Operating Income (NOI) results. Total revenues from continuing operations for the quarter were $459.5 million compared to $447.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2003 For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, the Company reported earnings of $1.55 per share compared to $1.18 per share in the same period of 2002. The twelve-month increase is primarily attributable to higher gains on property sales. FFO for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 were $2.15 per share compared to $2.39 per share for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002. The primary components of the reduction year over year relate to a 2003 $0.25 per share reduction of "same-store" NOI results and the one-time $0.07 per share expense related to the Series G redemption. In addition, this reduction is partially offset by a 2002 one-time $0.06 per share impairment charge. Total revenues from continuing operations remained constant at $1.8 billion for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively. "Same-Store" Results On a "same-store" fourth quarter to fourth quarter comparison, which includes 175,333 units, revenues decreased 0.7 percent, expenses increased 4.1 percent and NOI decreased 3.6 percent. On a sequential "same-store" comparison for these same 175,333 units from third quarter 2003 to fourth quarter 2003, revenues decreased 0.3 percent, expenses decreased 2.4 percent and NOI increased 1.1 percent. On a "same-store" twelve-month to twelve-month comparison, which includes 171,841 units, revenues decreased 2.3 percent, expenses increased 5.8 percent and NOI decreased 7.0 percent. Acquisitions/Dispositions During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company acquired nine properties, consisting of 2,522 units, for an aggregate purchase price of $294.4 million at an average capitalization (cap) rate of 6.3 percent. Also during the quarter, the Company sold 33 properties, consisting of 7,490 units, for an aggregate sale price of $414.7 million at an average cap rate of 7.2 percent. During 2003, the Company acquired 17 properties, consisting of 5,200 units, for an aggregate purchase price of $684.1 million at an average cap rate of 6.5 percent and sold 96 properties, consisting of 23,486 units, for an aggregate sale price of $1.2 billion at an average cap rate of 7.4 percent.

diluted 300,141 312,301 302,515 308,673 =========== =========== =========== ========== (1) The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") defines funds from operations ("FFO") (April 2002 White Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. The April 2002 White Paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from FFO for previously depreciated operating properties only. Once the Company commences the conversion of units to condominiums, it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property. Accordingly, the Company included in FFO its incremental gains or losses from the sale of condominium units to third parties, which represented net gains of $10,280 and $1,682 for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and $2,793 and $484 for the quarters ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Effective January 1, 2003, the Company no longer adds back impairment losses when computing FFO in accordance with NAREIT's definition. As a result, FFO for the year and quarter ended December 31, 2002 have been reduced by $18,284 and $290, respectively, to conform to the current year presentation. (2) The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because it provides investors an understanding of the ability of the Company to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures. FFO in and of itself does not represent net income or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO should not be exclusively considered as an alternative to net income or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The Company's calculation of FFO may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies.

The Company believes that NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the Company's apartment communities. 2003 vs. 2002 Same-Store Results by Market 2003 2003 % of Weighted Actual Average Markets Units NOI Occupancy % -------------------------- ----------
