Exhibit 99.1 Equity Residential Reports First Quarter Results CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 28, 2004--Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR) today reported results for the quarter ended March 31, 2004. All per share results are reported on a fully diluted basis. "As expected, sequential same-store revenues were flat as we continue to bounce along the bottom found early last year," said Bruce W. Duncan, Equity Residential's President and CEO. "We continue to look at 2004 as a transitional year leading to very strong 2005 performance. While we are more optimistic today than we were three months ago, we remain cautious in our expectations for the remainder of the year." First Quarter 2004 For the quarter ended March 31, 2004, the Company reported earnings of $0.35 per share compared to $0.41 per share in the first quarter of 2003. Funds from Operations (FFO) for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 were $0.52 per share compared to $0.57 per share in the same period of 2003. The primary components of the reduction in FFO quarter over quarter include a $0.02 per share reduction of "same-store" Net Operating Income (NOI) results and a $0.02 per share reduction in operating results from unconsolidated entities. Total revenues from continuing operations for the quarter were $462.7 million compared to $438.3 million in the first quarter of 2003. "Same-Store" Results On a "same-store" first quarter to first quarter comparison, which includes 170,836 units, revenues decreased 0.2 percent, expenses increased 3.0 percent and NOI decreased 2.3 percent. On a sequential "same-store" comparison for these same 170,836 units from fourth quarter 2003 to first quarter 2004, revenues remained flat, expenses increased 1.3 percent and NOI decreased 0.9 percent. Acquisitions/Dispositions During the first quarter of 2004, the Company acquired: (i) five properties, consisting of 1,671 units, for an aggregate purchase price of $224.4 million at an average capitalization (cap) rate of 5.8 percent and (ii) its joint venture partners' interests in 15 previously unconsolidated development properties, consisting of 4,500 completed units, 315 units to be completed in the second quarter of 2004 and two vacant land parcels. The Company consolidated $948.0 million of real estate assets, assumed $265.0 million of mortgage debt, paid $51.7 million in cash and reduced investments in unconsolidated entities by $268.6 million (net of $339.7 million in mortgage debt paid off prior to closing) in connection with these 15 development properties. Also during the quarter, the Company sold 22 properties, consisting of 5,990 units, for an aggregate sale price of $301.3 million at an average cap rate of 6.6 percent. FIN 46 - Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities The Company adopted FIN 46, as required, effective March 31, 2004 with respect to all its unconsolidated development projects as of that date. FIN 46 requires the Company to consolidate the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the activities of a variable interest entity, which for the Company includes its development partnerships, if the Company is entitled to receive a majority of the entity's residual returns, or is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from such entity's activities. Accordingly, effective March 31, 2004, the Company consolidated $548.3 million of real estate assets and $294.7 million of mortgage debt and reduced investments in unconsolidated entities by $235.0 million. Second Quarter 2004 Results Equity Residential expects to announce second quarter 2004 results on Wednesday, August 4, 2004 and host a conference call to discuss those results at 10:00 a.m. CT that day. Equity Residential is the largest publicly traded apartment company in America. Nationwide, Equity Residential owns or has investments in 952 properties in 34 states consisting of 203,590 units.

Forward-Looking Statements The Company lists parameters for 2004 results in the final page of this release. 2004 results will depend upon a slowdown in multifamily starts and economic recovery and job growth. The forward-looking statements contained in this news release regarding 2004 results are further subject to certain risks and uncertainties including, without limitation, the risks described under the heading "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and available on our website, www.equityapartments.com. This news release also contains forward-looking statements concerning development properties. The total number of units and cost of development and completion dates reflect the Company's best estimates and are subject to uncertainties arising from changing economic conditions (such as costs of labor and construction materials), completion and local government regulation. The Company assumes no obligation to update or supplement forward-looking statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. A live web cast of the Company's conference call discussing these results and outlook for 2004 will take place today at 10:00 a.m. Central.

Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. The April 2002 White Paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from FFO for previously depreciated operating properties only. Once the Company commences the conversion of units to condominiums, it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property. (2) The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because it provides investors an understanding of the ability of the Company to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures. FFO in and of itself does not represent net income or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO should not be exclusively considered as an alternative to net income or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The Company's calculation of FFO may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies.

Expected EPS is calculated on a basis consistent with actual EPS. Due to the uncertain timing and extent of property dispositions and the resulting gains/losses on sales, actual EPS could differ materially from expected EPS. (2) The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") defines funds from operations ("FFO") (April 2002 White Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. Expected FFO is calculated on a basis consistent with actual FFO.
