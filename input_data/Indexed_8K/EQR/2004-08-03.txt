Exhibit 99.1 Equity Residential Reports Second Quarter Results; Announces First Acquisition in Manhattan CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 3, 2004--Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR) today reported results for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2004. All per share results are reported on a fully diluted basis. "We are encouraged by improving revenues in the majority of our top twenty markets, which we believe is a sign of the continuing recovery of the apartment industry," said Bruce W. Duncan, Equity Residential's President and CEO. "The improvement in our revenues is a result primarily of increases in occupancy and therefore we continue to remain cautious about the strength of the recovery until we see meaningful improvement in rental rate." Second Quarter 2004 For the quarter ended June 30, 2004, the Company reported earnings of $0.39 per share compared to $0.41 per share in the second quarter of 2003. Funds from Operations (FFO) for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 were $0.56 per share compared to $0.57 per share in the same period of 2003. The $0.56 per share FFO for the quarter was $0.03 above the guidance range of $0.51 to $0.53 provided by the Company in its first quarter earnings release on April 28, 2004. The positive variance was the result of $0.02 from the sale of vacant land associated with the Company's Water Terrace project in Marina del Rey, California and $0.01 from increased condominium sales for the quarter as well as lower than budgeted short-term interest rates. From an operating standpoint, the Company's results achieved the high end of the guidance range. Total revenues from continuing operations for the quarter were $488.6 million compared to $440.1 million in the second quarter of 2003. The primary components of this $48.5 million increase in revenues includes the properties acquired since July 1, 2003, the interests in the 15 development properties acquired in the first quarter of 2004 from the Company's joint venture partners as well as the properties consolidated due to the adoption of FIN 46 effective March 31, 2004. Six Months Ended June 30, 2004 For the six months ended June 30, 2004, the Company reported earnings of $0.74 per share compared to $0.82 per share in the same period of 2003. FFO for the six months ended June 30, 2004 were $1.08 per share compared to $1.14 per share in the same period of 2003. Total revenues from continuing operations for the six months ended June 30, 2004 were $945.7 million compared to $872.9 million in the same period of 2003. "Same-Store" Results On a "same-store" second quarter to second quarter comparison, which includes 169,099 units, revenues increased 1.1 percent, expenses increased 3.6 percent and NOI decreased 0.5 percent. On a sequential "same-store" comparison for these same 169,099 units from first quarter 2004 to second quarter 2004, revenues increased 1.3 percent, expenses increased 0.6 percent and NOI increased 1.8 percent. On a "same-store" six-month to six-month comparison, which includes 168,179 units, revenues increased 0.4 percent, expenses increased 3.4 percent and NOI decreased 1.5 percent. Acquisitions/Dispositions During the second quarter of 2004, the Company acquired eight properties, consisting of 1,869 units, for an aggregate purchase price of $223.6 million at an average capitalization (cap) rate of 5.9 percent. Also during the quarter, the Company sold 10 properties, consisting of 2,620 units, for an aggregate sale price of $167.8 million at an average cap rate of 5.9 percent. In addition, the Company sold 188 condominium units and one vacant land parcel for $25.7 million and $27.7 million, respectively. In the first six months of 2004, the Company acquired 13 properties, consisting of 3,540 units, for an aggregate purchase price of $448.0 million at an average cap rate of 5.8 percent and sold 31 properties, consisting of 8,485 units, for an aggregate sale price of $452.2 million at an average cap rate of 6.3 percent. In addition, the Company sold 313 condominiums and two vacant land parcels for $42.4 million and $27.9 million, respectively. Hudson Crossing On July 29, 2004, the Company closed on its first acquisition in New York City: Hudson Crossing, a 259-unit property located on Ninth Avenue between 36th and 37th in Manhattan. The property, which was constructed in 2003, features a mixture of studio, one and two-bedroom units, and an indoor parking garage. The purchase price was $93.1 million, representing a cap rate of 5.2%.

Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. The April 2002 White Paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from FFO for previously depreciated operating properties only. Once the Company commences the conversion of units to condominiums, it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property. (2) The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because it provides investors an understanding of the ability of the Company to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures. FFO in and of itself does not represent net income or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO should not be exclusively considered as an alternative to net income or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The Company's calculation of FFO may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies.
