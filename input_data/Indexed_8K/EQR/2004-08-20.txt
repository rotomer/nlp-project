ITEM 5. Other Events
 
Equity Residential (the "Company") is re-issuing in an updated format its historical financial statements to satisfy SEC requirements as they relate to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 144, .
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
 
In compliance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144, the results of operations of the Company's consolidated properties that were sold during the first six months of 2004 were reported as a component of discontinued operations for each period presented (including the comparable period of the prior year) in the Company's second quarter 2004 quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August 6, 2004.  Under SEC requirements, the same reclassification as discontinued operations is required for previously issued annual financial statements for each of the three years shown in the Company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K, if those financial statements are incorporated by reference in subsequent filings with the SEC made under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, even though those financial statements relate to periods prior to the sale date.  These reclassifications have no effect on the Company's previously reported net income available to Common Shares or funds from operations ("FFO").
 
This report on Form 8-K updates Items 6, 7, 8 and 15 (Exhibit 12 only) of the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 to reclassify those properties sold during the first six months of 2004 as a component of discontinued operations for each period presented in the annual report.  All other items of the Company's Form 10-K remain unchanged.  No attempt has been made to update matters in the Form 10-K except to the extent expressly provided above.
 
ITEM 7. Financial Statements, Pro Forma Financial Information and Exhibits
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Item 6. Selected Financial Data
 
The following table sets forth selected financial and operating information on a historical basis for the Company.  The following information should be read in conjunction with all of the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 8-K.  The historical operating and balance sheet data have been derived from the historical Financial Statements of the Company.  All amounts have also been restated in accordance with the discontinued operations provisions of SFAS No. 144.  Certain capitalized terms as used herein are defined in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
 
(1)
The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") defines funds from operations ("FFO") (April 2002 White Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP")), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. FFO has also been adjusted by preferred distributions and premium on redemption of preferred shares to arrive at FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units.  The April 2002 White Paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from FFO for previously depreciated operating properties only.  Once the Company commences the conversion of units to condominiums, it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property.  Accordingly, the Company included in FFO its incremental gains or losses from the sale of condominium units to third parties, which represented net gains of $10,280, $1,682 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. 
      
Effective January 1, 2003, the Company no longer adds back impairment losses when computing FFO in accordance with NAREIT's definition.  As a result, FFO for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 have been reduced by $18,284, $71,766 and $1,000, respectively, to conform to the current year presentation.   For the year ended December 31, 2001, FFO has been reduced by $5,324 to reflect the SEC's clarification of EITF Topic D-42 regarding premiums on redemption of preferred shares.  See Item 7 for a reconciliation between net income and FFO.
 
(2)
The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because it provides investors an understanding of the ability of the Company to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures.  FFO in and of itself does not represent net income or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP.  Therefore, FFO should not be exclusively considered as an alternative to net income or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity.  The Company's calculation of FFO may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies.
      
 
Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
 
Overview
 
The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of the Company should be read in connection with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto. Due to the Company's ability to control the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries other than entities owning interests in the Unconsolidated Properties and certain other entities in which the Company has investments, the Operating Partnership and each such subsidiary entity has been consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes.  Capitalized terms used herein and not defined are as defined elsewhere in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003.
 
Forward-looking statements in this Item 7 as well as Item 1 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K are intended to be made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Sources of capital to the Company or labor and materials required for maintenance, repair,
 - 
                 
capital expenditure or development are more expensive than anticipated;
Occupancy levels and market rents may be adversely affected by national and local economic and market conditions including, without limitation, new construction of multifamily housing, slow employment growth, availability of low interest mortgages for single-family home buyers and the potential for geopolitical instability, all of which are beyond the Company's control; and
 - 
                 
Additional factors as discussed in Part I of the Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly those under "Risk Factors".
 -

Results of Operations
 
The following table summarizes the number of properties and related units for the periods presented:
 
 
Properties that the Company owned for all of both 2003 and 2002 (the "2003 Same Store Properties"), which represented 171,841 units, impacted the Company's results of operations.  Properties that the Company owned for all of both 2002 and 2001 (the "2002 Same Store Properties"), which represented 188,027 units, also impacted the Company's results of operations.  Both the 2003 Same Store Properties and 2002 Same Store Properties are discussed in the following paragraphs.
 
The Company's acquisition, disposition and completed development activities also impacted overall results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002.  The impacts of these activities are also discussed in greater detail in the following paragraphs.
 
Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2003 to the year ended December 31, 2002
 
For the year ended December 31, 2003, income before allocation to Minority Interests, income (loss) from investments in unconsolidated entities, net gain on sales of unconsolidated entities, discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle decreased by approximately $21.2 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2002.
Revenues from the 2003 Same Store Properties decreased primarily as a result of lower overall physical occupancy, increased concessions and lower rental rates charged to both new and renewal residents.  Property operating expenses from the 2003 Same Store Properties increased primarily due to higher payroll, maintenance, utility, real estate taxes, insurance, leasing and advertising and building costs.  The following tables provide comparative revenue, expense, net operating income ("NOI") and weighted average occupancy for the 2003 Same Store Properties (NOI represents rental income less: property and maintenance expense; real estate taxes and insurance expense; and property management expense):
 
 
 
 
 
The Company's primary financial measure for evaluating each of its apartment communities is NOI.  The Company believes that NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the Company's apartment communities.
 
For properties that the Company acquired prior to January 1, 2003 and expects to continue to own through December 31, 2004, the Company anticipates the following same store results for the full year ending December 31, 2004:
 
 
 
These 2004 assumptions are based on current expectations and are forward-looking.
 
Rental income from properties other than 2003 Same Store Properties increased by approximately $47.5 million primarily as a result of revenue from newly acquired properties not yet included as 2003 Same Store Properties and additional Partially Owned Properties consolidated in the fourth quarter of 2002 and during the year ended December 31, 2003.
 
Fee and asset management revenues, net of fee and asset management expenses, increased by $4.9 million primarily as a result of additional income allocated from Ft. Lewis.  As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company managed 18,475 units and 18,965 units, respectively, for third parties and unconsolidated entities.
Property management expenses include off-site expenses associated with the self-management of the Company's properties as well as management fees paid to any third party management companies.  These expenses decreased by approximately $4.4 million or 6.0%.  This decrease is primarily attributable to a reversal of a profit sharing accrual in the first quarter of 2003 related to the 2002 calendar year as the Company didn't achieve its stated goals and management elected not to make a discretionary contribution to the plan.  In addition, the Company recorded lower expense in connection with granting less restricted shares and reducing the expense associated with the Company's matched funding of its 401(k) plan during 2003 and not incurring an expense for 2003 discretionary profit sharing contributions.
 
Depreciation expense, which includes depreciation on non-real estate assets, increased $25.0 million primarily as a result of properties acquired after December 31, 2002, many of which had significantly higher per unit acquisition costs than properties previously acquired, and additional depreciation on capital expenditures for all properties owned.
 
General and administrative expenses, which include corporate operating expenses, decreased approximately $7.7 million between the periods under comparison.  This decrease was primarily due to lower expenses recorded in connection with granting less restricted shares to employees during 2003, partially offset by approximately a $2.6 million increase related to the Company's decision to begin to expense its stock based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and its amendment (SFAS No. 148).  In addition, lower state income and franchise taxes also contributed to this decrease.
 
The Company recorded impairment charges on its technology investments and its corporate housing business of approximately $1.2 million and $18.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  See Note 22 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
 
Interest and other income increased by approximately $1.4 million, primarily as a result of higher cash balances available for short-term investments throughout 2003.
 
Interest expense, including amortization of deferred financing costs, decreased approximately $5.2 million primarily due to lower variable interest rates and lower overall levels of debt.  During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company capitalized interest costs of approximately $20.6 million as compared to $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002.  This capitalization of interest primarily related to equity investments in unconsolidated entities engaged in development activities.  The effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended December 31, 2003 was 6.36% as compared to 6.54% for the year ended December 31, 2002.
 
Loss from investments in unconsolidated entities increased approximately $6.4 million between the periods under comparison.  This increase is primarily the result of increased operating losses from equity investments partially offset by unrealized gains on derivative instruments.
 
Net gain on sales of discontinued operations increased approximately $206.4 million between the periods under comparison.  This increase is primarily the result of a greater number of properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2003, as well as the fact that several properties had lower net carrying values at sale.
 
Discontinued operations, net, decreased approximately $50.5 million between the periods under comparison.  See Note 16 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
 
Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2002 to the year ended December 31, 2001
For the year ended December 31, 2002, income before allocation to Minority Interests, income (loss) from investments in unconsolidated entities, net gain on sales of unconsolidated entities, discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle decreased by approximately $55.8 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2001.
Revenues from the 2002 Same Store Properties decreased primarily as a result of lower overall physical occupancy, increased concessions and lower rental rates charged to both new and renewal residents.  Property operating expenses from the 2002 Same Store Properties, which include property and maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance and an allocation of property management expenses, remained relatively stable with increases in real estate taxes and insurance costs offset by a decrease in utility costs.  The following tables provide comparative revenue, expense, NOI and weighted average occupancy for the 2002 Same Store Properties:
 
 
 
 
 
Rental income from properties other than 2002 Same Store Properties increased by approximately $19.8 million primarily as a result of revenue from newly acquired properties not yet included as 2002 Same Store Properties.
 
Fee and asset management revenues, net of fee and asset management expenses, increased by $1.5 million as a result of managing additional units at Fort Lewis, Washington starting in April 2002.  As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company managed 18,965 units and 16,539 units, respectively, for third parties and unconsolidated entities.
 
Property management expenses include off-site expenses associated with the self-management of the Company's properties.  These expenses decreased by approximately $4.6 million or 5.9%.  This decrease is primarily attributable to lower amounts accrued for employee bonuses and profit sharing for 2002 and lower headcount in 2002.
 
Depreciation expense, which includes depreciation on non-real estate assets, increased $21.9 million primarily as a result of properties acquired after December 31, 2001, many of which had significantly higher per unit acquisition costs than properties previously acquired, and additional depreciation on capital expenditures for all properties owned.
 
General and administrative expenses, which include corporate operating expenses, increased approximately $11.1 million between the years under comparison.  This increase was primarily due to retirement plan expenses for certain key executives, restricted shares/awards granted to key employees, additional compensation charges and costs associated with the Company's new President, higher state income taxes in Michigan and New Jersey and income taxes incurred by one of the Company's taxable REIT subsidiaries which has an ownership interest in properties that in prior periods were classified as Unconsolidated Properties.
 
The Company recorded impairment charges on its technology investments and its corporate housing
business of approximately $18.3 million and $11.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.  See Note 22 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
 
Interest and other income decreased by approximately $6.7 million, primarily as a result of lower balances available for investment and related interest rates being earned on short-term investment accounts along with lower balances on deposit in tax-deferred exchange accounts.
 
Interest income  investment in mortgage notes decreased by $8.8 million as a result of the consolidation of previously Unconsolidated Properties in July 2001.  No additional interest income will be recognized on such mortgage notes in future years as the Company now consolidates the results related to these previously Unconsolidated Properties.
 
Interest expense, including amortization of deferred financing costs, decreased approximately $10.5 million primarily due to lower variable interest rates and lower overall levels of debt.  During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company capitalized interest costs of approximately $27.2 million as compared to $28.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001.  This capitalization of interest primarily related to equity investments in unconsolidated entities engaged in development activities.  The effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended December 31, 2002 was 6.54% as compared to 6.89% for the year ended December 31, 2001.
 
Income (loss) from investments in unconsolidated entities decreased approximately $7.5 million between the periods under comparison.  This decrease is primarily the result of increased equity losses and unrealized losses on derivative instruments.
 
Net gain on sales of discontinued operations decreased approximately $44.6 million between the periods under comparison.  This decrease is primarily the result of the properties sold in 2001 having a lower net carrying value at sale, which resulted in higher gain recognition for financial reporting purposes.
 
Discontinued operations, net, increased approximately $43.4 million between the periods under comparison.  This increase is primarily attributable to a one-time $60.0 million impairment on the furniture rental business in 2001, which was subsequently sold in January 2002.  See Note 16 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
For the Year Ended December 31, 2003
 
As of January 1, 2003, the Company had approximately $29.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and $499.2 million available under its line of credit (net of $60.8 million which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and not available for borrowing).

Depending on its analysis of market prices, economic conditions, and other opportunities for the investment of available capital, the Company may repurchase up to an additional $85.0 million of its Common Shares pursuant to its existing share buyback program authorized by the Board of Trustees.  The Company did not repurchase any of its Common Shares during the year ended December 31, 2003.
 
The Company's total debt summary and debt maturity schedule as of December 31, 2003, are as follows:
 
 
 
* Net of the effect of any derivative instruments.
 
(1) Includes $300 million of unsecured debt with a final maturity of 2015 that is putable/callable in 2005.

In addition, the Operating Partnership carried over $280.0 million related to a prior registration statement.  As of February 4, 2004, $2.28 billion in debt securities remained available for issuance under this registration statement.
 
The Company's "Consolidated Debt-to-Total Market Capitalization Ratio" as of December 31, 2003 is presented in the following table.  The Company calculates the equity component of its market capitalization as the sum of (i) the total outstanding Common Shares and assumed conversion of all OP Units at the equivalent market value of the closing price of the Company's Common Shares on the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) the "Common Share Equivalent" of all convertible preferred shares and preference interests/units; and (iii) the liquidation value of all perpetual preferred shares and preference interests outstanding.
 
 
 
The Company's policy is to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt-to-total market capitalization of less than 50%.
 
From January 1, 2004 through February 4, 2004, the Company:
 
Acquired four properties (including two additional units at an existing property) consisting of 1,130 units for approximately $151.3 million;
 - 
                 
Assumed $36.9 million of mortgage debt on one property in connection with its acquisition;
 - 
                 
Disposed of twelve properties (including one Unconsolidated Property) and various individual condominium units consisting of 2,972 units for approximately $140.9 million;
 - 
                 
Obtained $16.5 million in new mortgage financing; and
 - 
                 
Repaid $50.0 million of mortgage loans.
 - 
                 
 
Capitalization of Fixed Assets and Improvements to Real Estate
 
Our policy with respect to capital expenditures is generally to capitalize expenditures that improve the value of the property or extend the useful life of the component asset of the property.  We track improvements to real estate in two major categories and several subcategories:
 
Replacements.  These include:
 - 
            
(inside the unit)
carpets and hardwood floors;
 - 
                 
appliances;
 - 
                 
mechanical equipment such as individual furnace/air units, hot water heaters, etc;
 - 
                 
furniture and fixtures such as kitchen/bath cabinets, light fixtures, ceiling fans, sinks, tubs, toilets, mirrors, countertops, etc;
 - 
                 
flooring such as vinyl, linoleum or tile; and
 - 
                 
blinds/shades.
 - 
                 
 
All replacements are depreciated over a five-year estimated useful life.  We expense as incurred all maintenance and turnover costs such as cleaning, interior painting of individual units and the repair of any replacement item noted above.
Building improvements ().  These include:
 - 
            
outside the unit
 
roof replacement and major repairs;
 - 
                 
paving or major resurfacing of parking lots, curbs and sidewalks;
 - 
                 
amenities and common areas such as pools, exterior sports and playground equipment, lobbies, clubhouses, laundry rooms, alarm and security systems and offices;
 - 
                 
major building mechanical equipment systems;
 - 
                 
interior and exterior structural repair and exterior painting and siding;
 - 
                 
major landscaping and grounds improvement; and
 - 
                 
vehicles and office and maintenance equipment.
 - 
                 
 
All building improvements are depreciated over a five to ten-year estimated useful life.  We expense as incurred all recurring expenditures that do not improve the value of the asset or extend its useful life.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2003, our actual improvements to real estate totaled approximately $181.9 million.  This includes the following detail (amounts in thousands except for unit and per unit amounts):
 
 
 
Total units exclude 22,578 unconsolidated units.

Includes properties either Partially Owned or sold during the period, commercial space, condominium conversions and $6.5 million included in building improvements spent on seven specific assets related to major renovations and repositioning of these assets.
(4)
         
 
For the year ended December 31, 2002, our actual improvements to real estate totaled approximately $156.8 million.  This includes the following detail (amounts in thousands except for unit and per unit amounts):

The Company expects to fund approximately $160.0 million for capital expenditures for replacements and building improvements for all consolidated properties in 2004.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company's total non-real estate capital additions, such as computer software, computer equipment, and furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements to the Company's property management offices and its corporate offices, was approximately $2.9 million.  The Company expects to fund approximately $6.5 million in total additions to non-real estate property in 2004.
 
Improvements to real estate and additions to non-real estate property were funded from net cash provided by operating activities.
 
Derivative Instruments
 
In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes.  The Company limits these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments.
 
The Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors.  When viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge, the Company has not sustained a material loss from those instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives.
 
See Note 14in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments at December 31, 2003.
 
Other
 
Minority Interests as of December 31, 2003 decreased by $10.4 million when compared to December 31, 2002.  The primary factors that impacted this account in the Company's consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets during the year ended December 31, 2003 were:
 
Distributions declared to Minority Interests, which amounted to $38.2 million (excluding Junior Preference Unit and Preference Interest distributions);
 - 
                 
The allocation of income from operations to holders of OP Units in the amount of $34.7 million;
 - 
                 
The issuance of 313,720 OP Units to various limited partners at an average price of $26.11 per unit;
 - 
                 
The issuance of Common Shares; and
 - 
                 
The conversion of OP Units into Common Shares.
 - 
                 
 
Total distributions paid in January 2004 amounted to $141.9 million (excluding distributions on Partially Owned Properties), which included certain distributions declared during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2003.
 
The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements, including capital expenditures related to maintaining its existing properties and certain scheduled unsecured note and mortgage note repayments, generally through its working capital, net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under its line of credit.  The Company considers its cash provided by operating activities to be adequate to
meet operating requirements and payments of distributions.  The Company also expects to meet its long-term liquidity requirements, such as scheduled unsecured note and mortgage debt maturities, property acquisitions, financing of construction and development activities and capital improvements through the issuance of unsecured notes and equity securities, including additional OP Units, and proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties.  In addition, the Company has significant unencumbered properties available to secure additional mortgage borrowings in the event that the public capital markets are unavailable or the cost of alternative sources of capital is too high.  The fair value of and cash flow from these unencumbered properties are in excess of the requirements the Company must maintain in order to comply with covenants under its unsecured notes and line of credit.
 
The Company has a revolving credit facility with potential borrowings of up to $700.0 million.    This facility matures in May 2005 and may, among other potential uses, be used to fund property acquisitions, costs for certain properties under development and short term liquidity requirements.  As of March 1, 2004, $255.0 million was outstanding under this facility (and $56.7 was restricted and dedicated to support letters of credit).
 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations
 
The Company has co-invested in various properties that are unconsolidated and accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  Management does not believe these investments have a materially different impact upon the Company's liquidity, capital resources, credit or market risk than its property management and ownership activities generally, except to the extent the development ventures mitigate risk by deploying the skill and expertise of locally based real estate developers.  The nature and business purpose of these ventures are as follows:
 
Institutional Ventures  During 2000 and 2001, the Company entered into ventures with an unaffiliated partner.   At the respective closing dates, the Company sold and/or contributed 45 properties containing 10,846 units to these ventures and retained a 25% ownership interest in the ventures.  The Company's joint venture partner contributed cash equal to 75% of the agreed-upon equity value of the properties comprising the ventures, which was then distributed to the Company.  The Company's strategy with respect to these ventures was to reduce its concentration of properties in a variety of markets.
 - 
                 
 
Development Ventures  Since 1998, the Company has generally engaged in development activities through various joint ventures with third party developers.   The Company uses the local expertise of these developers and lowers the overall risks associated with development by grouping various development properties into aggregate pools.  The Company generally contributes between 25% and 35% of the development cost of these projects with the remaining cost financed through third-party construction mortgages.  Voting rights are shared equally between the Company and its respective development partners.
 - 
                 
 
As of December 31, 2003, the Company has 13 projects in various stages of development with estimated completion dates ranging through June 30, 2005.  The three development agreements currently in place have the following key terms:
 
The first development partner has the right, at any time following completion of a project, to stipulate a value for such project and offer to sell its interest in the project to the Company based on such value.  If the Company chooses not to purchase the interest, it must agree to a sale of the project to an unrelated third party at such value.  The Company's partner must exercise this right as to all projects within five years after the receipt of the final certificate of occupancy on the last developed property.   In connection with this development agreement, the Company has an obligation to provide up to $40.0 million in credit enhancements to guarantee a portion of the third party construction financing.  As of February 4, 2004, the Company had set-aside $20.0 million towards this credit enhancement.  The Company would be required to perform under this agreement only if there was a material default under a third party construction mortgage
 - 
                 
agreement.  This agreement expires no later than December 31, 2018.  Notwithstanding the termination of the agreement, the Company shall have recourse against its development partner for any losses incurred.
 
The second development partner has the right, at any time following completion of a project, to require the Company to purchase the partners' interest in that project at a mutually agreeable price.  If the Company and the partner are unable to agree on a price, both parties will obtain appraisals.  If the appraised values vary by more than 10%, both the Company and its partner will agree on a third appraiser to determine which original appraisal is closest to its determination of value.  The Company may elect at that time not to purchase the property and instead, authorize its partner to sell the project at or above the agreed-upon value to an unrelated third party.  Five years following the receipt of the final certificate of occupancy on the last developed property, the Company must purchase, at the agreed-upon price, any projects remaining unsold.
 - 
                 
 
The third development partner has the exclusive right for six months following stabilization (generally defined as having achieved 90% occupancy for three consecutive months following the substantial completion of a project) to market a project for sale.  Thereafter, either the Company or its development partner may market a project for sale.  If the Company's development partner proposes the sale, the Company may elect to purchase the project at the price proposed by its partner or defer the sale until two independent appraisers appraise the project.  If the two appraised values vary by more than 5%, a third appraiser will be chosen to determine the fair market value of the property.  Once a value has been determined, the Company may elect to purchase the property or authorize its development partner to sell the project at the agreed-upon value.
 - 
                 
 
See Note 9 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding the Company's investments in unconsolidated entities.
 
In connection with one of its mergers, the Company provided a guaranty of a credit enhancement agreement with respect to certain tax-exempt bonds issued to finance certain public improvements at a multifamily development project.  The Company has the obligation to provide this guaranty for a period of eight years from the consummation of the merger or through May 2005.  The Company would be required to perform under this guaranty only if there was a draw on the letter of credit issued by the credit enhancement party.  The counterparty has also indemnified the Company for any losses suffered.  As of February 4, 2004, this guaranty was still in effect at a commitment amount of $12.7 million and no current outstanding liability.
 
The following table summarizes the Company's contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter as of December 31, 2003:
 
 
 
Amounts include aggregate principal payments only.  The Company paid $352,391, $365,782 and $380,745 for interest on debt, inclusive of derivative instruments, for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
 
The Company's significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  These policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended December 31, 2003.
 
The Company has identified six significant accounting policies as critical accounting policies.  These critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant judgments and estimates.  With respect to these critical accounting policies, management believes that the application of judgments and assessments is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented.  The six critical accounting policies are:
 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Including Goodwill
 
The Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets, including its investments in real estate and goodwill, for indicators of permanent impairment.  The judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance, market conditions, expected holding period of each asset and legal and environmental concerns.  Future events could occur which would cause the Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted.
 
Depreciation of Investment in Real Estate
 
The Company depreciates the building component of its investment in real estate over a 30-year estimated useful life, building improvements over a 5-year to 10-year estimated useful life and both the furniture, fixtures and equipment and replacements components over a 5-year estimated useful life, all of which are judgmental determinations.
 
Cost Capitalization
 
See the section for discussion of the policy with respect to capitalization vs. expensing of fixed asset/repair and maintenance costs.  In addition, the Company capitalizes the payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on the supervision of major capital projects.  These costs are reflected on the balance sheet as an increase to depreciable property.
Capitalization of Fixed Assets and Improvements to Real Estate
 
The Company follows the guidance in SFAS No. 67, , for all development projects and uses its professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred.  The Company capitalizes interest, real estate taxes and insurance and payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on development activities.  The Company expenses as incurred all payroll costs of employees working directly at our properties, except for costs that are incurred during the initial lease-up phase on a development project.  An allocated portion of payroll costs is capitalized based upon the occupancy of the project until stabilized occupancy is achieved.  The incremental payroll and associated costs are capitalized to the projects under development based upon the effort directly identifiable with such projects.  These costs are reflected on the balance sheet as either construction in progress or a separate component of investments in unconsolidated entities.  The Company ceases the capitalization of such costs as the property becomes substantially complete and ready for its intended use.
Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects
Fair Value of Financial Instruments, Including Derivative Instruments
 
The valuation of financial instruments under SFAS No. 107 and SFAS No. 133 and its amendments (SFAS Nos. 137/138/149) requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments.  The Company, where possible, bases the fair values of its financial instruments, including its derivative instruments, on listed market prices and third party quotes. Where these are not available, the Company bases its estimates on other factors relevant to the financial instruments.
 
Revenue Recognition
 
Rental income attributable to leases is recorded when due from residents and is recognized monthly as it is earned, which is not materially different than on a straight-line basis.  Leases entered into between a resident and a property for the rental of an apartment unit are generally year-to-year, renewable upon consent of both parties on an annual or monthly basis.  Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis.
 
Stock-Based Compensation
 
Prior to 2003, the Company had chosen to account for its stock-based compensation in accordance with APB No. 25, ,which resulted in no compensation expense for options issued with an exercise price equal to or exceeding the market value of the Company's Common Shares on the date of grant (intrinsic method).  The Company has elected to account for its stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and its amendment (SFAS No. 148), , effective in the first quarter of 2003, which resulted in compensation expense being recorded based on the fair value of the stock compensation granted.
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
Accounting for Stock Based Compensation
 
SFAS No. 148 provides three transition methods for entities that adopt the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123.  The Company has chosen to use the "Prospective Method".  This method requires that companies apply the recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to only employee awards granted or modified after the beginning of the fiscal year in which the recognition provisions are first applied, or January 1, 2003.  Compensation expense under all of the Company's plans is generally recognized over periods ranging from three months to five years.  Therefore, the cost related to stock-based employee compensation included in the determination of net income for the year ended December 31, 2003 is less than that which would have been recognized if the fair value based method had been applied to all awards since the original effective date of SFAS No. 123.  See Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion and comparative information regarding application of the fair value method to all outstanding employee awards.
 
Funds From Operations
 
For the year ended December 31, 2003, Funds From Operations ("FFO") available to Common Shares and OP Units decreased $78.9 million, or 11.0%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2002, FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units increased $13.0 million, or 1.8%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2001.
 
The following is a reconciliation of net income to FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001:
 
(1)
The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") defines funds from operations ("FFO") (April 2002 White Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP")), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis.  The April 2002 White Paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from FFO for previously depreciated operating properties only.  Once the Company commences the conversion of units to condominiums, it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property.  Accordingly, the Company included in FFO its incremental gains or losses from the sale of condominium units to third parties, which represented net gains of $10,280, $1,682 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. 
      
Effective January 1, 2003, the Company no longer adds back impairment losses when computing FFO in accordance with NAREIT's definition.  As a result, FFO for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 have been reduced by $18,284, $71,766 and $1,000, respectively, to conform to the current year presentation.  For the year ended December 31, 2001, FFO has been reduced by $5,324 to reflect the SEC's clarification of EITF Topic D-42 regarding premiums on redemption of preferred shares.
 
(2)
The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because it provides investors an understanding of the ability of the Company to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures.  FFO in and of itself does not represent net income or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP.  Therefore, FFO should not be exclusively considered as an alternative to net income or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity.  The Company's calculation of FFO may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies.

To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders
Equity Residential
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Equity Residential (the "Company") as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003.  Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index.  These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Equity Residential at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
 
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for stock-based compensation in 2003, changed its method of accounting for goodwill and discontinued operations in 2002 and changed its method of accounting for derivative instruments in 2001.

Business
                                     
 
Equity Residential ("EQR"), formed in March 1993, is a fully integrated real estate company engaged in the acquisition, development, ownership, management and operation of multifamily properties.  EQR has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT").
 
EQR is the general partner of, and as of December 31, 2003 owned an approximate 92.7% ownership interest in ERP Operating Limited Partnership, an Illinois limited partnership (the "Operating Partnership").   The Operating Partnership is, directly or indirectly, a partner, member or shareholder of numerous partnerships, limited liability companies and corporations which have been established primarily to own fee simple title to multifamily properties or to conduct property management activities and other businesses related to the ownership and operation of multifamily residential real estate.  References to the "Company" include EQR, the Operating Partnership and each of the partnerships, limited liability companies and corporations controlled by the Operating Partnership and/or EQR.
 
As of December 31, 2003, the Company owned or had investments in 968properties in 34 states consisting of 207,506 units.  The ownership breakdown includes:
 
 
The "Wholly Owned Properties" are accounted for under the consolidation method of accounting.  The Company beneficially owns 100% fee simple title to 842 of the 849 Wholly Owned Properties.  The Company owns the building and improvements and leases the land underlying the improvements under a long-term ground lease that expires in 2026 for one property.  This one property is consolidated and reflected as a real estate asset while the ground lease is accounted for as an operating lease in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 13, .  The Company owns the debt collateralized by two properties and owns an interest in the debt collateralized by the remaining four properties.  The Company consolidates its interest in these six properties in accordance with the accounting standards outlined in the AcSEC guidance for real estate acquisition, development and construction arrangements issued in the CPA letter dated February 10, 1986, and as such, reflects these assets as real estate in the consolidated financial statements.
Accounting for Leases
 
The "Partially Owned Properties" are controlled by the Company but have partners with minority interests and are accounted for under the consolidation method of accounting.  The "Unconsolidated Properties" are partially owned but not controlled by the Company.  With the exception of one property, the Unconsolidated Properties consist of investments in partnership interests and/or subordinated mortgages that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  The remaining one property consists of an investment in a limited liability company that, as a result of the terms of the operating agreement, is accounted for as a management contract right with all fees recognized as fee and asset management revenue.  The above table does not include various uncompleted development properties summarized in Note 9.
 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
2.
                                     
 
Basis of Presentation
 
Due to the Company's ability as general partner to control either through ownership or by contract the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries, other than entities that own controlling interests in the Unconsolidated Properties and certain other entities in which the Company has investments, the Operating
Partnership and each such subsidiary has been consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes.  In July 2001, the Company acquired 100% of a management company entity, which had a controlling ownership interest in a portfolio of 21 previously Unconsolidated Properties.  Subsequent to this transaction, the Company consolidated these 21 properties.  In September 2001, the Company acquired the remaining 5% of the preferred stock it did not own and 100% of the voting common stock in two other management company entities.  As a result, the Company now wholly-owns these two entities.  The Company consolidated the results of these two entities prior to this transaction despite not having legal control, the effects of which were immaterial.
 
The Company's mergers and acquisitions were accounted for as purchases in accordance with either Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 16, , or SFAS No. 141, .  SFAS No. 141 requires all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The fair value of the consideration given by the Company in the mergers were used as the valuation basis for each of the combinations.  The accompanying consolidated statements of operations and cash flows include the results of the properties purchased through the mergers and through acquisitions from their respective closing dates.

Real Estate Assets and Depreciation of Investment in Real Estate
 
The Company allocates the purchase price of properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 141.  In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, the Company utilizes a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property, our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio, and other market data.  The Company also considers information obtained about each property as a result of its pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired.  The Company allocates the purchase price of acquired real estate to various components as follows:
 
Land  Based on actual purchase price if acquired separately or market research/comparables if acquired with an operating property.
 - 
                 
Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment  Ranges between $1,500 and $3,000 per apartment unit acquired as an estimate of the fair value of the appliances & fixtures inside a unit.  The per-unit amount applied depends on the type of apartment building acquired.  Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of five years.
 - 
                 
In-Place Leases  The Company considers the value of acquired in-place leases that meet the definition outlined in SFAS No. 141, paragraph 37.  The amortization period is the remaining term of each respective in-place acquired lease.  Should a resident terminate its lease, the unamortized portion of the deferred in-place lease would be fully expensed.
 - 
                 
Other Intangible Assets - The Company considers whether it has acquired other intangible assets that meet the definition outlined in SFAS No. 141, paragraph 39, including any customer relationship intangibles.  The amortization period is the estimated useful life of the acquired intangible asset.
 - 
                 
Building - - Based on the fair value determined on an "as-if vacant" basis.  Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of thirty years.
 - 
                 
 
Replacements inside a unit such as appliances and carpeting, are depreciated over a five-year estimated useful life.  Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred and significant renovations and improvements that improve and/or extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized over their estimated useful life, generally five to ten years.  Initial direct leasing costs are expensed as incurred as such expense approximates the deferral and amortization of initial direct leasing costs over the lease terms.  Property sales or dispositions are recorded when title transfers and sufficient consideration has been received by the Company.  Upon disposition, the related costs and
accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts.  Any gain or loss on sale is recognized in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
 
The Company classifies real estate assets as real estate held for disposition when it is certain a property will be disposed of in accordance with SFAS No. 144 (see further discussion below).
 
The Company classifies properties under development and/or expansion and properties in the lease up phase as construction in progress until construction has been completed and all certificates of occupancy permits have been obtained.  The Company also classifies land relating to construction in progress as land on its balance sheets.
 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Including Goodwill
 
In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, .  SFAS No. 142 prohibits the amortization of goodwill and requires that goodwill be reviewed for impairment at least annually.  In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, . SFAS Nos. 142 and 144 were effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001.  The Company adopted these standards effective January 1, 2002.   See Notes 16 and 22 for further discussion.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
 
The Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets, including its investments in real estate and goodwill, for indicators of permanent impairment.  The judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance, market conditions, expected holding period of each asset and legal and environmental concerns.  Future events could occur which would cause the Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted.
 
For long-lived assets to be held and used, the Company compares the expected future undiscounted cash flows for the long-lived asset against the carrying amount of that asset.  If the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss would be recorded for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying amount of the asset.
 
For long-lived assets to be disposed of, an impairment loss is recognized when the estimated fair value of the asset, less the estimated cost to sell, is less than the carrying amount of the asset measured at the time that the Company has determined it will sell the asset.  Long-lived assets held for disposition and the related liabilities are separately reported at the lower of their carrying amounts or their estimated fair values, less their costs to sell, and are not depreciated after reclassification to real estate held for disposition.
 
Prior to January 1, 2002, the Company followed the guidance in SFAS No. 121,
Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of.
 
Prior to 2002, the Company amortized goodwill on a straight-line basis over a period of 20 years. The accumulated amortization of goodwill was $5.5 million at December 31, 2001.   Subsequent to January 1, 2002, goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests.
 
Cost Capitalization
 
See the section for discussion of the policy with respect to capitalization vs. expensing of fixed asset/repair and maintenance costs.  In addition, the Company capitalizes the payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on the supervision of major capital projects.  These costs are reflected on the balance sheet as an increase to depreciable property.
Real Estate Assets and Depreciation of Investment in Real Estate
The Company follows the guidance in SFAS No. 67, , for all development projects and uses its professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred.  The Company capitalizes interest, real estate taxes and insurance and payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on development activities.  The Company expenses as incurred all payroll costs of employees working directly at our properties, except for costs that are incurred during the initial lease-up phase on a development project.  An allocated portion of payroll costs is capitalized based upon the occupancy of the project until stabilized occupancy is achieved.  The incremental payroll and associated costs are capitalized to the projects under development based upon the effort directly identifiable with such projects.  These costs are reflected on the balance sheet as either construction in progress or a separate component of investments in unconsolidated entities.  The Company ceases the capitalization of such costs as the property becomes substantially complete and ready for its intended use.
Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents
 
The Company considers all demand deposits, money market accounts and investments in certificates of deposit and repurchase agreements purchased with a maturity of three months or less, at the date of purchase, to be cash equivalents.  The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions.  The combined account balances at one or more institutions periodically exceed the Federal Depository Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") insurance coverage, and, as a result, there is a concentration of credit risk related to amounts on deposit in excess of FDIC insurance coverage.  The Company believes that the risk is not significant, as the Company does not anticipate the financial institutions' non-performance.
 
Deferred Financing Costs
 
Deferred financing costs include fees and costs incurred to obtain the Company's line of credit, long-term financings and costs for certain interest rate protection agreements.  These costs are amortized over the terms of the related debt.  Unamortized financing costs are written-off when debt is retired before the maturity date.  The accumulated amortization of such deferred financing costs was $16.0 million and $15.2 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments, Including Derivative Instruments
 
The valuation of financial instruments under SFAS No. 107, , and SFAS No. 133 and its amendments (SFAS Nos. 137/138/149), , requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments.  The Company, where possible, bases the fair values of its financial instruments, including its derivative instruments, on listed market prices and third party quotes. Where these are not available, the Company bases its estimates on other factors relevant to the financial instruments.
Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
 
In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes.  The Company limits these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments.
 
The Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors.  When viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge, the Company has not sustained a material loss from those instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives.
On January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133 and its amendments (SFAS Nos. 137/138/149), which requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and to measure those instruments at fair value.  Additionally, the fair value adjustments will affect either shareholders' equity or net income depending on whether the derivative instruments qualify as a hedge for accounting purposes and, if so, the nature of the hedging activity.  When the terms of an underlying transaction are modified, or when the underlying transaction is terminated or completed, all changes in the fair value of the instrument are marked-to-market with changes in value included in net income each period until the instrument matures.  Any derivative instrument used for risk management that does not meet the hedging criteria of SFAS No. 133 is marked-to-market each period.  The Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
 
As of January 1, 2001, the adoption of the new standard resulted in derivative instruments reported on the balance sheet as liabilities of approximately $6.6 million; an adjustment of approximately $5.3 million to accumulated other comprehensive loss, which are gains and losses not affecting retained earnings in the consolidated statements of shareholders' equity; and a charge of approximately $1.3 million as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the consolidated statements of operations.
 
The fair values of the Company's financial instruments, other than derivative instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, mortgage notes payable, other notes payable, line of credit and other financial instruments, approximate their carrying or contract values.
 
Revenue Recognition
 
Rental income attributable to leases is recorded when due from residents and is recognized monthly as it is earned, which is not materially different than on a straight-line basis.  Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis.  Leases entered into between a resident and a property, for the rental of an apartment unit, are generally year-to-year, renewable upon consent of both parties on an annual or monthly basis.
 
Stock-Based Compensation
 
Prior to 2003, the Company had chosen to account for its stock-based compensation in accordance with APB No. 25, ,which resulted in no compensation expense for options issued with an exercise price equal to or exceeding the market value of the Company's Common Shares on the date of grant (intrinsic method).  The Company has elected to account for its stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and its amendment (SFAS No. 148), , effective in the first quarter of 2003, which resulted in compensation expense being recorded based on the fair value of the stock compensation granted.
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
Accounting for Stock Based Compensation
 
SFAS No. 148 provides three transition methods for entities that adopt the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123.  The Company has chosen to use the "Prospective Method".  This method requires that companies apply the recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to only employee awards granted or modified after the beginning of the fiscal year in which the recognition provisions are first applied, or January 1, 2003.  Compensation expense under all of the Company's plans is generally recognized over periods ranging from three months to five years.  Therefore, the cost related to stock-based employee compensation included in the determination of net income for the year ended December 31, 2003 is less than that which would have been recognized if the fair value based method had been applied to all awards since the original effective date of SFAS No. 123.
 
The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the fair value based method had been applied to all outstanding and unvested awards in each period presented:
 
(1)
Share options for the year ended December 31, 2003 included $1.4 million of expense recognition related to options granted in the first quarter of 2003 to the Company's former chief executive officer.  These options vested immediately upon grant.
      
 
The fair value of the option grants as computed under SFAS No. 123 would be recognized over the vesting period of the options.  The fair value for the Company's share options was estimated at the time the share options were granted using the Black Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:
 
 
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.  In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because the Company's share options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management's opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its share options.
Income Taxes
 
Due to the structure of the Company as a REIT and the nature of the operations of the properties and management business, the results of operations generally contain no provision for federal income taxes. The Company is subject to certain state and local income, excise and franchise taxes.  The aggregate cost of land and depreciable property for federal income tax purposes as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 was approximately $8.5 billion and $8.7 billion, respectively.
 
Effective in 2001, the Company has elected Taxable REIT Subsidiary ("TRS") status for certain of its corporate subsidiaries.  The provisions for federal income taxes for these TRS entities were not material during 2003, 2002 or 2001 and were recognized as general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
 
During the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company's tax treatment of distributions were as follows:
 
 
Minority Interests
 
Operating Partnership: Net income is allocated to minority interests based on their respective ownership percentage of the Operating Partnership.  The ownership percentage is calculated by dividing the number of units of limited partnership interest ("OP Units") held by the minority interests by the total OP Units held by the minority interests and EQR.  Issuance of additional common shares of beneficial interest, $0.01 par value per share (the "Common Shares"), and OP Units changes the ownership interests of both the minority interests and EQR.  Such transactions and the proceeds therefrom are treated as capital transactions.
 
Partially Owned Properties: The Company reflects minority interests in partially owned properties on the balance sheet for the portion of properties consolidated by the Company that are not wholly owned by the Company.  The earnings or losses from those properties attributable to the minority interests are reflected as minority interests in partially owned properties in the consolidated statements of operations.
 
U
se of Estimates
 
In preparation of the Company's financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Reclassifications
 
Certain reclassifications considered necessary for a fair presentation have been made to the prior period financial statements in order to conform to the current year presentation.  These reclassifications have not changed the results of operations or shareholders' equity.
 
Other
 
In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, Technical.  SFAS No. 145, among other items, rescinds the automatic classification of costs incurred on debt extinguishment as extraordinary charges.  Instead, gains and losses from debt extinguishment should only be classified as extraordinary if they meet the "unusual and infrequently occurring" criteria outlined in APB No. 30.  SFAS No. 145 is effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002.  The Company adopted the standard effective January 1, 2003.Prior period gains/losses have been reclassified to a component of interest expense.
Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and
Corrections
 
In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation ("FIN") No. 46, .  FIN No. 46 requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated if a company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity's activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity's residual returns or both.  The Company will adopt FIN No. 46 as required effective March 31, 2004.  FASB Staff Position ("FSP") No. FIN 46-6 deferred the effective date for applying the provisions of FIN No. 46 (for entities created before February 1, 2003) from July 1, 2003 to December 31, 2003.  FIN No. 46-R released in December 2003 further deferred the effective date for the Company's variable interest entities to March 31, 2004.  The Company has preliminarily determined that its unconsolidated stabilized development projects and projects under development (see Note 9) are variable interest entities in which the Company is the primary beneficiaryas of the date of the original formation of therespective joint ventures.  On such respective formation dates, the fair value of the assets, liabilities and non-controlling interests of these development projects approximates carryover basis.  If these development projects had been consolidated as of December 31, 2003, the Company's investment in real estate and mortgage notes payable would have increased by $1.3 billion and $877.7 million, respectively, and investments in unconsolidated entities would have decreased by $465.4 million.  The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of FIN No. 46 will have any material effect on net income.
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities
 
In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, .  SFAS No. 150 establishes standards for classifying and measuring as liabilities certain financial instruments that embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity.  On November 7, 2003, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 150-3, which deferred for an indefinite period the classification and measurement provisions, but not the disclosure provisions (see discussion below), of SFAS No. 150 as it relates to noncontrolling interests that are classified as equity in the financial statements of a subsidiary but would be classified as a liability in the parent's financial statements under SFAS No. 150 (e.g., minority interests in consolidated limited-life subsidiaries).  The Company has determined that it does not have any mandatorily redeemable preferred shares/units that fall within the scope of SFAS No. 150.
Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity
 
With regards to the aforementioned disclosure provisions, the Company is presently the controlling partner in various consolidated partnerships consisting of 35 properties and 6,778 units having a minority interest book value of $9.9 million at December 31, 2003. These partnerships contain provisions that require the partnerships to be liquidated through the sale of its assets upon reaching a date specified in each respective partnership agreement.  The Company, as controlling partner, has an obligation to cause the property owning partnerships to distribute proceeds of liquidation to the Minority Interests in these Partially Owned Properties only to the extent that the net proceeds received by the partnerships from the sale of its assets warrant a distribution based on the partnership agreements.  As of December 31, 2003, the Company estimates the value of Minority Interest distributions would have been
approximately $104 million ("Settlement Value") had the partnerships been liquidated.  This Settlement Value is based on estimated third party consideration realized by the partnerships upon disposition of the Partially Owned Properties and is net of all other assets and liabilities including yield maintenance on the mortgages encumbering the properties that would have been due on December 31, 2003 had those mortgages been prepaid.  Due to, among other things, the inherent uncertainty in the sale of real estate assets, the amount of any potential distribution to the Minority Interests in the Company's Partially Owned Properties is subject to change.  To the extent that the partnerships' underlying assets are worth less than the underlying liabilities, the Company has no obligation to remit any consideration to the Minority Interests in Partially Owned Properties.
 
On July 31, 2003, the SEC clarified its position with respect to Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Topic D-42, .  Under the SEC's revised interpretation, in connection with the redemption of preferred shares/units, the original issuance costs of these shares/units must be treated in a manner similar to preferred distributions and deducted from net income in arriving at net income available to Common Shares.  The clarification of EITF Topic D-42 was required to be adopted effective July 1, 2003 on a retroactive basis by restating prior periods included in the current financial statements.  The adoption of the clarification of EITF Topic D-42 resulted in the retroactive write-off of $5.3 million of original issuance costs related to the Company's redemption of its Series A Preferred Shares in June 2001.  In addition, the Company recorded an $8.3 million cash premium and $11.9 million in original issuance costs related to the redemption of its Series G Preferred Shares in December 2003.  The Company had no recorded original issuance costs associated with, nor did it incur any cash redemption premium upon redemption of, its Series F Preferred Shares redeemed in 2001 or its Series L Preferred Shares redeemed in 2003.

Business Combinations
                                     
 
During 2001 and prior to the one-year anniversary of the Globe Business Resources, Inc. ("Globe") acquisition, the Company recorded net increases to goodwill of $9.5 million to reallocate the original purchase price recorded at the acquisition date.  Also during 2001, the Company recorded a $60.0 million asset impairment charge related to its furniture rental business.  During 2002, the Company recorded a $17.1 million asset impairment charge related to Equity Corporate Housing ("ECH").  See Notes 16 and 22.
 
On January 11, 2002, the Company sold the former Globe furniture rental business for approximately $30.0 million in cash, which approximated the net book value at the sale date.   The Company has retained ownership of the former Globe short-term furnished housing business, which is now known as ECH.

Shareholders' Equity and Minority Interests
 
The following table presents the changes in the Company's issued and outstanding Common Shares for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001:
 
In February 1998, the Company filed and the SEC declared effective a Form S-3 Registration Statement to register $1.0 billion of equity securities.  In addition, the Company carried over $272.4 million related to a prior registration statement.  As of December 31, 2003, $956.5 million in equity securities remained available for issuance under this registration statement.
 
During October 2002, the Company repurchased 5,092,300 of its Common Shares on the open market at an average price of $22.58 per share.  The Company paid approximately $115.0 million for these shares, which were retired subsequent to the repurchase.
 
The equity positions of various individuals and entities that contributed their properties to the Operating Partnership in exchange for a partnership interest are collectively referred to as the "Minority Interests  Operating Partnership".  As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Minority Interests  Operating Partnership held 21,907,732 and 22,300,643 OP Units, respectively.  As a result, the Minority Interests had a 7.3% and 7.6% interest in the Operating Partnership at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  Assuming conversion of all OP Units into Common Shares, total Common Shares outstanding at December 31, 2003 and 2002 would have been 299,551,617 and 293,396,124, respectively.  Subject to applicable securities law restrictions, the Minority Interests  Operating Partnership may exchange their OP Units for EQR Common Shares on a one-for-one basis.
 
Net proceeds from the Company's Common Share and Preferred Share (see definition below) offerings are contributed by the Company to the Operating Partnership.  In return for those contributions, EQR receives a number of OP Units in the Operating Partnership equal to the number of Common Shares it has issued in the equity offering (or in the case of a preferred equity offering, a number of preference units in the Operating Partnership equal in number and having the same terms as the Preferred Shares issued in the equity offering).  As a result, the net offering proceeds from Common Shares are allocated between shareholders' equity and Minority Interests  Operating Partnership to account for the change in their respective percentage ownership of the underlying equity of the Operating Partnership.
 
During 2003, the Operating Partnership issued 313,720 OP Units to various limited partners at an average price of $26.11 per unit.  These OP Units are classified as Minority Interests  Operating Partnership in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
 
The Company's declaration of trust authorizes the Company to issue up to 100,000,000 preferred shares of beneficial interest, $0.01 par value per share (the "Preferred Shares"), with specific rights, preferences and other attributes as the Board of Trustees may determine, which may include preferences, powers and rights that are senior to the rights of holders of the Company's Common Shares.
The following table presents the Company's issued and outstanding Preferred Shares as of December 31, 2003 and 2002:
 
 
On or after the redemption date, redeemable preferred shares (Series B, C, D, K, and N) may be redeemed for cash at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the liquidation price per share, plus accrued and unpaid distributions, if any.
(1)
         
 
On or after the redemption date, convertible preferred shares (Series E & H) may be redeemed under certain circumstances at the option of the Company for cash or Common Shares, in whole or in part, at various redemption prices per share based upon the contractual conversion rate, plus accrued and unpaid distributions, if any.
(2)
         
Dividends on all series of Preferred Shares are payable quarterly at various pay dates.  Dividend rates listed for Series B, C, D and N are Preferred Share rates and the equivalent Depositary Share annual dividend rates are $2.281252, $2.281252, $2.15 and $1.62, respectively.
(3)
         
 
On June 19, 2003, the Company redeemed all of its outstanding Series L Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares at liquidation value for total cash consideration of $100.0 million.  The Company did not incur any original issuance costs as these shares were issued by Merry Land and Investment Company, Inc. prior to its merger with the Company.
(4)
         
 
On June 19, 2003, the Company issued 600,000 Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares in a public offering.  The Company received $145.3 million in net proceeds from this offering after payment of the underwriters' fee.
(5)
         
 
On December 26, 2003, the Company redeemed the remaining outstanding Series G Convertible Cumulative Preferred Shares for cash consideration of $295.3 million, which included the liquidation value of $287.0 million and a cash redemption premium of $8.3 million.  The Company recorded the $8.3 million cash redemption premium along with the write-off of $11.9 million in original issuance costs as a premium on redemption of preferred shares in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
(6)
         
 
The liquidation value of the Preference Interests and the Junior Preference Units (both as defined below) are included as separate components of Minority Interests in the consolidated balance sheets and the distributions incurred are included in preferred distributions in the consolidated statements of operations.
 
Cumulative through December 31, 2003, the Company, through a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, issued various series of Preference Interests with an equity value of $246.0 million receiving net proceeds of $239.9 million.  The following table presents the issued and outstanding Preference Interests as of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002:
 
On or after the fifth anniversary of the respective issuance (the "Redemption Date"), all of the Preference Interests may be redeemed for cash at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the liquidation preference of $50.00 per unit plus the cumulative amount of accrued and unpaid distributions, if any.
(1)
         
 
On or after the tenth anniversary of the respective issuance (the "Conversion Date"), all of the Preference Interests are exchangeable at the option of the holder (in whole but not in part) on a one-for-one basis for a respective reserved series of EQR Preferred Shares.  In addition, on or after the Conversion Date, the convertible Preference Interests (Series H, I & J) may be converted under certain circumstances at the option of the holder (in whole but not in part) to Common Shares based upon the contractual conversion rate, plus accrued and unpaid distributions, if any.

The following table summarizes the carrying amounts for investment in real estate (at cost) as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 :
(Amounts are in thousands)
 
 
During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company acquired the entire equity interest in seventeen properties containing 5,200 units from unaffiliated parties, inclusive of two additional units at an existing property, for a total purchase price of $684.1 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company acquired the majority of the remaining third party equity interests it did not previously own in eleven properties containing 1,090 units.  These properties were accounted for under the equity method of accounting and subsequent to each purchase were consolidated.  The Company recorded $111.1 million in investment in real estate and the following:
 
 
During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company acquired the entire equity interest in twelve properties containing 3,634 units for a total purchase price of $289.9 million.
 
During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company paid $40.1 million in cash and used tax-deferred (1031) exchange proceeds of $42.3 million to acquire the remaining third-party equity interests it did not previously own in two properties containing 826 units.  These properties were accounted for under the equity method of accounting and subsequent to these purchases were consolidated.  Accordingly, the Company recorded an additional $102.1 million in investment in real estate.
 
On December 31, 2002, the Company contributed one of its development properties to one of its development partners, retaining a 50% common equity ownership interest.  As a result of this contribution, the Company no longer can exercise sole control over the major decisions (such as sale and/or financing/refinancing) regarding this property.  Effective with the contribution, the Company accounted for this project under the equity method of accounting.  No gain or loss on sale was recognized as the contribution was effectuated at carryover basis.  As a result of this transaction, the Company reduced investment in real estate by $203.7 million (of which land and construction in progress were reduced by $60.6 million and $143.1 million, respectively), reduced mortgage debt by $118.4 million and increased investments in unconsolidated entities by $80.7 million.

As of February 4, 2004, in addition to the properties that were subsequently acquired as discussed in Note 24, the Company had entered into a separate agreement to acquire one multifamily property containing 540 units from an unaffiliated party.  The Company expects a purchase price of approximately $73.0 million.
 
As of February 4, 2004, in addition to the properties that were subsequently disposed of as discussed in Note 24, the Company had entered into separate agreements to dispose of eleven multifamily properties containing 3,626
units to unaffiliated parties.  The Company expects a combined disposition price of approximately $208.5 million.
 
The closings of these pending transactions are subject to certain contingencies and conditions, therefore, there can be no assurance that these transactions will be consummated or that the final terms thereof will not differ in material respects from those summarized in the preceding paragraphs.

Investment in Mortgage Notes, Net
                                     
 
In 1995, the Company invested $89 million in various partnership interests and subordinated mortgages collateralized by 21 properties consisting of 3,896 units.  Prior to the consolidation of these properties, the Company received $61.4 million in cash during 2001 as partial repayment of its investment in these mortgage notes.
 
On July 2, 2001, the Company acquired an additional ownership interest in the 21 entities that own the Unconsolidated Properties.  As a result of this additional ownership interest, the Company now has a controlling interest, and as such, consolidates these properties for financial reporting purposes.
 
During 2001, the Company amortized $2.3 million, which represented a portion of the original discount when the notes were purchased.  This discount was being amortized utilizing the effective yield method based on the expected life of the investment.

Investments in unconsolidated entities include the Unconsolidated Properties as well as various development properties under construction or pending construction.  These investments are accounted for utilizing the equity method of accounting.  Under the equity method of accounting, the net equity investment of the Company is reflected on the consolidated balance sheets and after the project is completed, the consolidated statements of operations include the Company's share of net income or loss from the unconsolidated entity.  Prior to the project being completed, the Company capitalizes interest on its equity contribution in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 58,   During the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company capitalized $20.6 million, $17.2 million and $19.9 million, respectively, in interest cost related to its unconsolidated development projects (which reduced interest expense incurred in the consolidated statements of operations).
Capitalization of Interest Cost in Financial Statements That Include Investments Accounted for by the Equity Method.
 
The Company generally contributes between 25% and 35% of the project cost of the unconsolidated projects under development (constituting 100% of the equity), with the remaining cost financed through third-party construction mortgages.  Voting rights are shared equally between the Company and its respective development partners.
 
See Note 2 for further discussion regarding FIN No. 46 and its anticipated effect on the Company's unconsolidated development projects.

Line of Credit
                              
 
On May 30, 2002, the Company obtained a new three-year $700.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility maturing May 29, 2005.  The new line of credit replaced the $700.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire in August 2002.  The prior existing revolving credit facility was terminated upon the closing of the new facility.  Advances under the new credit facility bear interest at variable rates based upon LIBOR at various interest periods, plus a spread dependent upon the Operating Partnership's credit rating, or based upon bids received from the lending group.  EQR has guaranteed the Operating Partnership's line of credit up to the maximum amount and for the full term of the facility.
 
As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, $10.0 million and $140.0 million, respectively, was outstanding and $56.7 million and $60.8 million, respectively, was restricted (dedicated to support letters of credit and not available for borrowing) on the line of credit.  During the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, the weighted average interest rate was 1.85% and 2.30%, respectively.
 
Derivative Instruments
14.
                              
 
The following table summarizes the consolidated derivative instruments at December 31, 2003 (dollar amounts are in thousands):
 
 
During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company paid approximately $13.0 million to terminate eight forward starting interest rate swaps in conjunction with the issuance of $400.0 million of ten-year unsecured notes.  The $13.0 million payment has been deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and will be recognized as additional interest expense over the ten-year life of the unsecured notes.
 
At December 31, 2003, certain unconsolidated development partnerships in which the Company invested had entered into swaps to hedge the interest rate risk exposure on unconsolidated floating rate construction mortgage loans.  The Company has recorded these hedges on its consolidated balance sheets.  These swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges with a current aggregate notional amount of $277.9million (notional amounts range from $26.5million to $285.9million over the terms of the swaps) at interest rates ranging from 1.78% to 6.94% maturing at various dates ranging from 2004 to 2005 with a net liability fair value of $5.2million.  During the years ended December 31 2003 and 2002, the Company recognized an unrealized gain of $1.5 million and an unrealized loss of $1.1 million, respectively, due to ineffectiveness of certain of these unconsolidated development derivatives (included in loss from investments in unconsolidated entities).
 
On December 31, 2003, the derivative instruments were reported at their fair value as other assets of approximately $10.4 million, as other liabilities of approximately $6.5 million and as a reduction to investments in unconsolidated entities of approximately $5.2 million.  As of December 31, 2003, there were approximately $23.3 million in deferred losses, net, included in accumulated other comprehensive loss.
Based on the estimated fair values of the net derivative instruments at December 31, 2003, the Company may recognize an estimated $9.4 million of accumulated other comprehensive loss as additional interest expense ($5.7 million related to its consolidated derivatives) or as additional loss on investments in unconsolidated entities ($3.7 million related to its unconsolidated development partnerships) during the twelve months ending December 31, 2004.

Discontinued Operations
                              
 
The Company has presented separately as discontinued operations in all periods the results of operations for all consolidated assets disposed of on or after January 1, 2002 (the date of adoption of SFAS No. 144) through June 30, 2004.
 
The components of discontinued operations are outlined below and include the results of operations for the respective periods that the Company owned such assets during each of the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.
 
 
(1)
Includes expenses paid in the current period for Wholly Owned Properties sold in prior periods related to the Company's period of ownership.
      
(2)
Interest includes only specific amounts from each property sold.
      
 
For the properties sold during 2003 and the first six months of 2004, the investment in real estate, net of accumulated depreciation, and the mortgage notes payable balances at December 31, 2002 were $1.2 billion and $147.5 million, respectively.  For the properties sold during the first six months of 2004, the investment in real estate, net of accumulated depreciation, and the mortgage notes payable balances at December 31, 2003 were $303.9 million and $48.8 million, respectively.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company disposed of its furniture rental business for $30.0 million and received net proceeds of $28.7 million.  After giving effect to a previously recorded impairment loss, no gain/loss on sale was recognized as the net book value at the sale date approximated the sales price.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company recorded $60.0 million of asset impairment charges related to its furniture rental business.  These charges were the result of a review of the existing intangible and tangible assets reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2001.  The Company reviewed the current net book value taking into consideration existing business and economic conditions as well as projected cash flows.  The impairment loss includes the write-down of the following assets: a) goodwill of approximately $26.0 million; b) rental furniture, net of approximately $28.6 million; c) property and equipment, net of approximately $4.5 million; and d) other assets of approximately $0.9 million.
 
17.
Share Incentive Plans
                              
 
On May 15, 2002, the shareholders of EQR approved the Company's 2002 Share Incentive Plan.
The maximum aggregate number of awards that may be granted under this plan may not exceed 7.5% of the Company's outstanding Common Shares calculated on a "fully diluted" basis and determined annually on the first day of each calendar year.  In January 2003, the Company filed a Form S-8 registration statement to register 23,125,828 Common Shares for issuance under this plan.  As of January 1, 2004, 22,736,239 shares were available for issuance under this plan.  No awards may be granted under the 2002 Share Incentive Plan after February 20, 2012.
 
Pursuant to the 2002 Share Incentive Plan and the Fifth Amended and Restated 1993 Share Option and Share Award Plan (collectively the "Share Incentive Plans"), officers, trustees, key employees and consultants of the Company may be offered the opportunity to acquire Common Shares through the grant of share options ("Options") including non-qualified share options ("NQSOs"), incentive share options ("ISOs") and share appreciation rights ("SARs") or may be granted restricted or non-restricted shares.  Additionally, officers and key employees of the Company may be awarded Common Shares, subject to conditions and restrictions as described in the Share Incentive Plans.  Finally, certain executive officers of the Company are subject to the Company's performance based restricted share plan.  Options, SARs, restricted shares and performance shares are sometimes collectively referred to herein as "Awards".
 
The Options generally are granted at the fair market value of the Company's Common Shares at the date of grant, vest over a three year period, are exercisable upon vesting and expire ten years from the date of grant.  The exercise price for all Options under the Share Incentive Plans shall not be less than the fair market value of the underlying Common Shares at the time the Option is granted.  The Fifth Amended and Restated 1993 Share Option and Share Award Plan will terminate at such time as all outstanding Awards have expired or have been exercised/vested.  The Board of Trustees may at any time amend or terminate the Share Incentive Plans, but termination will not affect Awards previously granted.  Any Options, which had vested prior to such a termination, would remain exercisable by the holder thereof.
 
As to the Options that have been granted through December 31, 2003, generally, one-third are exercisable one year after the initial grant, one-third are exercisable two years following the date such Options were granted and the remaining one-third are exercisable three years following the date such Options were granted.
 
As to the restricted shares that have been awarded through December 31, 2003, these shares generally vest three years from the award date.  During the three-year period of restriction, the employee receives quarterly dividend payments on their shares.  The Company's unvested restricted shareholders receive dividends at the same rate and on the same date as any other Common Share holder.  In addition, the Company's unvested restricted shareholders have the same voting rights as any other Common Share holder.  As a result, dividends paid on unvested restricted shares are included as a distribution in excess of accumulated earnings and have not been considered in reducing net income available to Common Shares in a manner similar to the Company's preferred share dividends for the earnings per share calculation.  If employment is terminated prior to the lapsing of the restriction, the shares are canceled.
 
In addition, each year the Company's executive officers receive performance-based awards.  Three years after grant, restricted shares may be issued based upon the total return (Common Share dividends and funds from operations ("FFO") growth per share) of the Company. One-half of any such restricted shares are then subject to vesting over an additional two-year period.  The performance-based awards generally are expensed over a five-year period based upon the Company's estimates of the number of shares expected to be awarded.
 
The following table summarizes information regarding both the restricted and performance-based share plans for the three years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001:
 
Prior to 2003, the Company had chosen to account for its stock-based compensation in accordance with APB No. 25, ,which resulted in no compensation expense for options issued with an exercise price equal to or exceeding the market value of the Company's Common Shares on the date of grant (intrinsic method).  The Company has elected to account for its stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and its amendment (SFAS No. 148), , effective in the first quarter of 2003, which resulted in compensation expense being recorded based on the fair value of the stock compensation granted.
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
Accounting for Stock Based Compensation
 
Compensation expense related to restricted and performance-based share grants was previously recognized in accordance with APB No. 25.  The adoption of SFAS No. 123 does not significantly change the amount of compensation expense recognized for these grants.
 
See Note 2 for additional information regarding the Company's stock-based compensation.
 
The table below summarizes the Option activity of the Share Incentive Plans and options assumed in connection with mergers (the "Merger Options") for the three years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001:
 
 
The following table summarizes information regarding options outstanding at December 31, 2003:
 
 
As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, 8,252,203 Options (with a weighted average exercise price of $22.25) and 7,291,897 Options (with a weighted average exercise price of $21.62) were exercisable, respectively.
 
18.
Employee Plans
                              
 
The Company established an Employee Share Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") to provide employees and trustees the ability to annually acquire up to $100,000 of Common Shares of the Company.  In 2003, the Company's shareholders approved an increase in the aggregate number of Common Shares available under the ESPP to 7,000,000 (from 2,000,000).  The Common Shares may be purchased quarterly at a price equal to 85% of the lesser of: (a) the closing price for a share on the last day of such quarter; and (b) the greater of: (i) the closing price for a share on the first day of such quarter, and (ii) the average closing price for a share for all the business days in the quarter.  During 2003, the Company issued 289,274 Common Shares at net prices that ranged from $20.64 per share to $24.74 per share and received proceeds of approximately $6.3 million.  During 2002, the Company issued 324,238 Common Shares at net prices that ranged from $21.65 per share to $24.43 per share and received proceeds of approximately $7.4 million.  During 2001, the Company issued 310,261 Common Shares at net prices that ranged from $21.76 per share to $23.69 per
share and received proceeds of approximately $6.9 million.
 
The Company established a defined contribution plan (the "401(k) Plan") to provide retirement benefits for employees that meet minimum employment criteria.  The Company matches dollar for dollar up to the first 2% of eligible compensation that a participant contributes to the 401(k) Plan (4% for 2002 and prior years).  Participants are vested in the Company's contributions over five years.  The Company made contributions in the amount of $3.5 million and $3.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and expects to make contributions in the amount of approximately $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.
 
The Company may also elect to make an annual discretionary profit-sharing contribution as a percentage of each individual employee's eligible compensation under the 401(k) Plan.  The Company made a contribution in the amount of $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001.  The Company did not make a contribution for both the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002.
 
The Company established a supplemental executive retirement savings plan (the "SERP") to provide certain officers and trustees an opportunity to defer a portion of their eligible compensation in order to save for retirement and for the education of their children.  The SERP is restricted to investments in Company Common Shares, certain marketable securities that have been specifically approved, and cash equivalents.  The deferred compensation liability represented in the SERP and the securities issued to fund such deferred compensation liability are consolidated by the Company and carried on the Company's balance sheet, and the Company's Common Shares held in the SERP are accounted for as a reduction to paid in capital.
 
19.
Distribution Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan
                              
 
On November 3, 1997, the Company filed with the SEC a Form S-3 Registration Statement to register 14,000,000 Common Shares pursuant to a Distribution Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan (the "DRIP Plan").  The registration statement was declared effective on November 25, 1997.
 
The DRIP Plan provides holders of record and beneficial owners of Common Shares and Preferred Shares with a simple and convenient method of investing cash distributions in additional Common Shares (which is referred to herein as the "Dividend Reinvestment  DRIP Plan").  Common Shares may also be purchased on a monthly basis with optional cash payments made by participants in the DRIP Plan and interested new investors, not currently shareholders of the Company, at the market price of the Common Shares less a discount ranging between 0% and 5%, as determined in accordance with the DRIP Plan (which is referred to herein as the "Share Purchase  DRIP Plan").  Common Shares purchased under the DRIP Plan may, at the option of the Company, be directly issued by the Company or purchased by the Company's transfer agent in the open market using participants' funds.
 
20.
Transactions with Related Parties
                              
 
The Company provided asset and property management services to certain related entities for properties not owned by the Company.  Fees received for providing such services were approximately $0.3 million, $0.7 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
 
The Company reimbursed its Chief Operating Officer for the actual operating costs (excluding acquisition costs) of operating his personal aircraft for himself and other employees on Company business.  Amounts incurred were approximately $0.2 million, $0.5 million and $0.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
 
The Company leases its corporate headquarters from an entity controlled by EQR's Chairman of the Board of Trustees.  Amounts incurred for such office space for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002
and 2001, respectively, were approximately $1.7 million, $1.6 million and $1.8 million.  The Company believes these amounts equal market rates for such space.
 
The Company leases space in an office building in Augusta, Georgia indirectly owned by one of EQR's trustees since May 2003 and directly owned by an entity affiliated with the same EQR trustee from 1998 to 2003.  Amounts incurred for such office space were approximately $0.2 million, $0.1 million and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.  The Company believes these amounts equal market rates for such space.
 
In prior years, the Company had the following additional related party transactions:
 
Certain executive officers of the Company purchased Common Shares which were financed with loans made by the Company, all of which were repaid in full in 2002;
 - 
                 
 
The Company made consulting payments to two former trustees (individuals were trustees through May 2003) in the approximate amounts of $0.2 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively; and

Commitments and Contingencies
                              
 
The Company, as an owner of real estate, is subject to various Federal, state and local environmental laws.  Compliance by the Company with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on the Company.  However, the Company cannot predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations on its current properties or on properties that it may acquire in the future.
 
The Company is a party to a class action lawsuit in Florida state court alleging that several of the types of fees that the Company charged when residents breached their leases were illegal, as were all efforts to collect them.  The Company is vigorously contesting the plaintiffs' claims and has sought immediate appellate review of the 2003 class action certification decision.  Due to the uncertainty of many critical factual and legal issues, including the viability of the case as a class action, it is not possible to determine or predict the outcome.  While no assurances can be given, the Company does not believe that this lawsuit, if adversely determined, will have a material adverse effect on the Company.
 
The Company does not believe there is any other litigation pending or threatened against the Company which, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably may be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company.
 
As of December 31, 2003, the Company has 13 projects in various stages of development with estimated completion dates ranging through June 30, 2005.  The three development agreements currently in place have the following key terms:
 
 - 
                 
The first development partner has the right, at any time following completion of a project, to stipulate a value for such project and offer to sell its interest in the project to the Company based on such value.  If the Company chooses not to purchase the interest, it must agree to a sale of the project to an unrelated third party at such value.  The Company's partner must exercise this right as to all projects within five years after the receipt of the final certificate of occupancy on the last developed property.   In connection with this development agreement, the Company has an obligation to provide up to $40.0 million in credit enhancements to guarantee a portion of the third party construction financing.  As of February 4, 2004, the Company had set-aside $20.0 million towards this credit enhancement.  The Company would be required to perform under this agreement
only if there was a material default under a third party construction mortgage agreement.  This agreement expires no later than December 31, 2018.  Notwithstanding the termination of the agreement, the Company shall have recourse against its development partner for any losses incurred.
 
 - 
                       
The second development partner has the right, at any time following completion of a project, to require the Company to purchase the partners' interest in that project at a mutually agreeable price.  If the Company and the partner are unable to agree on a price, both parties will obtain appraisals.  If the appraised values vary by more than 10%, both the Company and its partner will agree on a third appraiser to determine which original appraisal is closest to its determination of value.  The Company may elect at that time not to purchase the property and instead, authorize its partner to sell the project at or above the agreed-upon value to an unrelated third party. 
Five years following the receipt of the final certificate of occupancy on the last developed property, the Company must purchase, at the agreed-upon price, any projects remaining unsold.
 
The third development partner has the exclusive right for six months following stabilization (generally defined as having achieved 90% occupancy for three consecutive months following the substantial completion of a project) to market a project for sale.  Thereafter, either the Company or its development partner may market a project for sale.  If the Company's development partner proposes the sale, the Company may elect to purchase the project at the price proposed by its partner or defer the sale until two independent appraisers appraise the project.  If the two appraised values vary by more than 5%, a third appraiser will be chosen to determine the fair market value of the property.  Once a value has been determined, the Company may elect to purchase the property or authorize its development partner to sell the project at the agreed-upon value.
 - 
                 
 
In connection with one of its mergers, the Company provided a guaranty of a credit enhancement agreement with respect to certain tax-exempt bonds issued to finance certain public improvements at a multifamily development project.  The Company has the obligation to provide this guaranty for a period of eight years from the consummation of the merger or through May 2005.  The Company would be required to perform under this guaranty only if there was a draw on the letter of credit issued by the credit enhancement party.  The counterparty has also indemnified the Company for any losses suffered.  As of December 31, 2003, this guaranty was still in effect at a commitment amount of $12.7 million and no current outstanding liability.
 
During the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, total operating lease payments incurred for office space, including a portion of real estate taxes, insurance, repairs and utilities, aggregated $4,985,899, $4,709,363 and $4,929,018, respectively.
 
The minimum basic aggregate rental commitment under the Company's operating leases, including fixed base rent due on a ground lease for one property, in years following December 31, 2003 is as follows:
 
 
The Company has entered into a retirement benefits agreement with its Chairman of the Board of Trustees and deferred compensation agreements with two of its executive officers and its former chief executive officer.  During the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company recognized compensation expense of $3.0 million, $5.1 million and $3.7 million, respectively, related to these
agreements.  The projected commitments under these agreements based on estimated retirement dates are:

Asset Impairment
                              
 
For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company recorded approximately $1.2 million, $1.2 million and $11.8 million, respectively, of asset impairment charges related to its technology investments. These charges were the result of a review of the existing investments reflected on the consolidated balance sheet.  These impairment losses are reflected on the consolidated statements of operations in total expenses and include the write-down of assets classified as other assets and investments in unconsolidated entities.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company recorded approximately $17.1 million of asset impairment charges related to its corporate housing business.  Following the guidance in SFAS No. 142, these charges were the result of the Company's decision to reduce the carrying value of its corporate housing business to $30.0 million, given the continued weakness in the economy and management's expectations for near-term performance.  This impairment loss is reflected on the consolidated statements of operations as impairment on corporate housing business and on the consolidated balance sheets as a reduction in goodwill, net.

Reportable Segments
                              
 
Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by senior management.  Senior management decides how resources are allocated and assesses performance on a monthly basis.
 
The Company's primary business is owning, managing, and operating multifamily residential properties, which includes the generation of rental and other related income through the leasing of apartment units to residents and includes ECH.  Senior management evaluates the performance of each of our apartment communities on an individual basis; however, each of our apartment communities has similar economic characteristics, residents, and products and services so they have been aggregated into one reportable segment.  The Company's rental real estate segment comprises approximately 99.2%, 99.5% and 99.1% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.  The Company's rental real estate segment comprises approximately 99.7% and 99.7% of total assets at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
 
The primary financial measure for the Company's rental real estate segment is net operating income ("NOI"), which represents rental income less: 1) property and maintenance expense; 2) real estate taxes and insurance expense; and 3) property management expense (all as reflected in the accompanying statements of operations).  The Company believes that NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the Company's apartment communities.  Current year NOI is compared to prior year NOI and current year budgeted NOI as a measure of financial performance.  NOI from our rental real estate totaled approximately $1.0 billion, $1.0 billion, and $1.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
 
During the acquisition, development and/or disposition of real estate, the Company considers its NOI return on total investment as the primary measure of financial performance.
 
The Company's fee and asset management activity is immaterial and does not meet the threshold requirements of a reportable segment as provided for in SFAS No. 131.
 
All revenues are from external customers and there is no customer who contributed 10% or more of the Company's total revenues during the three years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 or 2001.
