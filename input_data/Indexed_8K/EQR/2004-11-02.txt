Exhibit 99.1 Equity Residential Reports Third Quarter Results CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 2, 2004--Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR) today reported results for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2004. All per share results are reported on a fully diluted basis. Third Quarter 2004 For the quarter ended September 30, 2004, the Company reported earnings of $0.26 per share compared to $0.41 per share in the third quarter of 2003. The quarterly decrease is primarily attributable to $0.07 per share in lower gains on property sales and $0.05 per share in hurricane damage discussed below. Funds from Operations (FFO) for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 were $0.50 per share compared to $0.56 per share in the same period of 2003. These results reflect an expense of $14.1 million, or $0.05 per share, in uninsured property damage at certain of the Company's properties primarily in Florida caused by Hurricanes Frances, Charley, Ivan and Jeanne. On September 8, 2004, the Company issued a press release stating that $9.0 million in uninsured property damage had been incurred as a result of Hurricanes Frances and Charley, and revised guidance downward by $0.03 to $0.50 to $0.51 FFO per share. The Company incurred an additional $5.1 million, or $0.02 per share, in uninsured property damage caused by Hurricanes Ivan and Jeanne subsequent to the September 8 press release. "Business continues to improve in almost all of our markets as evidenced by the second quarter in a row of year over year positive same store revenue growth. This is something we have not experienced since 2001. As a result of the work we have done over the past two years to aggressively reconfigure our portfolio and enhance our operations, we are well positioned to take advantage of the improving economic fundamentals," said Bruce W. Duncan, Equity Residential's President and CEO. Total revenues from continuing operations for the quarter were $491.5 million compared to $438.8 million in the third quarter of 2003. The primary components of this $52.7 million increase in revenues include the properties acquired since October 1, 2003, the interests in the 15 development properties acquired in the first quarter of 2004 from the Company's joint venture partners as well as the properties consolidated due to the adoption of FIN 46 effective March 31, 2004. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2004 For the nine months ended September 30, 2004, the Company reported earnings of $1.00 per share compared to $1.23 per share in the same period of 2003. FFO for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 were $1.58 per share compared to $1.70 per share in the same period of 2003. Total revenues from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 were $1.4 billion compared to $1.3 billion in the same period of 2003. "Same-Store" Results On a "same-store" third quarter to third quarter comparison, which includes 168,063 units, revenues increased 1.5 percent, expenses increased 4.4 percent (excluding hurricane property damage) and NOI decreased 0.4 percent. On a sequential "same-store" comparison for these same 168,063 units from second quarter 2004 to third quarter 2004, revenues increased 0.4 percent, expenses increased 3.9 percent (excluding hurricane property damage) and NOI decreased 2.0 percent. On a "same-store" nine-month to nine-month comparison, which includes 165,905 units, revenues increased 0.7 percent, expenses increased 3.5 percent (excluding hurricane property damage) and NOI decreased 1.2 percent. Acquisitions/Dispositions During the third quarter of 2004, the Company acquired five properties, consisting of 879 units, for an aggregate purchase price of $186.5 million at an average capitalization (cap) rate of 5.9 percent. Also during the quarter, the Company sold eight properties, consisting of 2,274 units, for an aggregate sale price of $133.4 million at an average cap rate of 6.7 percent. In addition, the Company sold 208 condominium units for $38.0 million. In the first nine months of 2004, the Company acquired 18 properties, consisting of 4,419 units, for an aggregate purchase price of $634.5 million at an average cap rate of 5.8 percent and sold 39 properties, consisting of 10,759 units, for an aggregate sale price of $585.6 million at an average cap rate of 6.4 percent. In addition, the Company sold 521 condominium units and two vacant land parcels for $80.4 million and $27.9 million, respectively. Michael J. McHugh Retirement The Company also announced today that Michael J. McHugh, its Chief Accounting Officer and Treasurer, has informed the Company of his intention to retire next year, after a long and distinguished career with Equity Residential and its affiliates. "Mike has been part of the Equity family for over twenty years," said Bruce W. Duncan. "We owe him many thanks for his contributions to Equity's success during that time." To ensure a smooth transition of his responsibilities, Mr. McHugh will retire at a mutually acceptable time next year, not earlier than the filing of the Company's 2004 Form 10-K. Internal candidates have been identified to assume Mr. McHugh's roles as Chief Accounting Officer and Treasurer.

Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. The April 2002 White Paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from FFO for previously depreciated operating properties only. Once the Company commences the conversion of units to condominiums, it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property. (2) The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company, because it is a recognized measure of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. FFO in and of itself does not represent net income or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO should not be exclusively considered as an alternative to net income or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The Company's calculation of FFO may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies.

(2) The Company's primary financial measure for evaluating each of its apartment communities is net operating income ("NOI"). NOI represents rental income less property and maintenance expense, real estate tax and insurance expense, and property management expense. The Company believes that NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the Company's apartment communities.

Expected EPS is calculated on a basis consistent with actual EPS. Due to the uncertain timing and extent of property dispositions and the resulting gains/losses on sales, actual EPS could differ materially from expected EPS. (2) The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") defines funds from operations ("FFO") (April 2002 White Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. Expected FFO is calculated on a basis consistent with actual FFO.
