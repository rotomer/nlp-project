Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure. On December 21, 2004, Equity Residential (the "Company") issued a press release disclosing its ownership interest in Rent.com. The press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein. The press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. A "non-GAAP financial measure" is defined as a numerical measure of a company's financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the company's financial statements. Non-GAAP financial measures utilized by the Company include Funds from Operations ("FFO"). The Company's management believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company, because it is a recognized measure of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. FFO in and of itself does not represent net income or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO should not be exclusively considered as an alternative to net income or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The Company's calculation of FFO may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies.

EXHIBIT 99.1 Equity Residential Announces Ownership Interest in Rent.com CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 21, 2004--Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR) today announced that the company has an ownership investment in Rent.com, a leading internet listing website in the apartment and rental housing industry. On December 17, 2004, eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) announced its proposed acquisition of privately held Rent.com for total consideration equal to $415 million plus Rent.com's year end cash balance, less transaction expenses, payable in approximately $30 million of cash and the remainder in eBay common stock. The acquisition, which is subject to various regulatory approvals and approval of Rent.com's stockholders, is expected to close in the first quarter of 2005. If the closing occurs, with no material decrease in the price of eBay stock, Equity Residential would receive approximately $57 million of eBay common stock. If Equity Residential sells this stock following the closing, the company would record a one-time gain to earnings and Funds from Operations of approximately $0.18 per share. There is no assurance that the acquisition will close or if it does, whether Equity Residential will sell the eBay stock it receives. Equity Residential will provide 2005 earnings guidance on Wednesday, February 2, 2005, when it announces its fourth quarter/full year 2004 results.
