Exhibit 99.1 Equity Residential Reports 2004 Results; Names Fred Tuomi President of Property Management; Completes Sale of Water Terrace CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 2, 2005--Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR) today reported results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2004. All per share results are reported on a fully diluted basis. Fourth Quarter 2004 For the quarter ended December 31, 2004, the Company reported earnings of $0.48 per share compared to $0.33 per share in the fourth quarter of 2003. The quarterly increase is primarily attributable to $0.08 per share in higher gains on property sales in 2004 and the $0.07 per share impact in the fourth quarter of 2003 of the costs associated with the redemption of the Company's Series G preferred shares. Funds from Operations (FFO) for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 were $0.56 per share compared to $0.45 per share in the same period of 2003. The quarterly increase is primarily attributable to $0.04 per share in higher incremental gains on sales of condominium units and the $0.07 per share of costs associated with the redemption of the Series G preferred shares noted above. Total revenues from continuing operations for the quarter were $487.4 million compared to $430.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. The primary components of this $56.7 million increase in revenues include the properties acquired since January 1, 2004, the interests in the 15 development properties acquired in the first quarter of 2004 from the Company's joint venture partners as well as the properties consolidated due to the adoption of FIN 46 effective March 31, 2004. Year Ended December 31, 2004 For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company reported earnings of $1.48 per share compared to $1.55 per share in the same period of 2003. FFO for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $2.14 per share compared to $2.15 per share in the same period of 2003. Total revenues from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $1.9 billion compared to $1.7 billion in the same period of 2003. "Operationally, 2004 was a year of improving fundamentals. Revenues in the majority of our markets increased primarily as a result of decreased concessions. On the transactions front, we took advantage of the opportunities. We sold nearly $1.0 billion in assets, at excellent prices, in markets we were determined to cull from our portfolio and invested $900 million in assets and markets with greater long-term potential," said Bruce W. Duncan, Equity Residential's President and CEO. "In 2005 we expect to see a continued improvement in fundamentals and revenues as well as a positive impact from the work we have been doing on improving our operations. Also, we will be active on the transactions front as we continue to aggressively reposition our portfolio and demonstrate the value of our underlying assets." "Same-Store" Results On a "same-store" fourth quarter to fourth quarter comparison, which includes 165,123 units, revenues increased 1.6 percent, expenses increased 3.7 percent and net operating income (NOI) increased 0.2 percent. On a sequential "same-store" comparison for these same 165,123 units from third quarter 2004 to fourth quarter 2004, revenues decreased 0.2 percent, expenses decreased 2.4 percent and NOI increased 1.4 percent. On a "same-store" year to year comparison, which includes 162,201 units, revenues increased 0.9 percent, expenses increased 3.6 percent and NOI decreased 0.9 percent. Full Year and quarterly 2004 "same-store" expenses exclude the uninsured property damage caused by Hurricanes Frances, Charley, Ivan and Jeanne. Acquisitions/Dispositions During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company acquired six properties, consisting of 1,763 units, for an aggregate purchase price of $266.3 million at an average capitalization (cap) rate of 5.5 percent and a land parcel for future development for $12.4 million. Also during the quarter, the Company sold 17 properties, consisting of 3,400 units, for an aggregate sale price of $202.2 million at an average cap rate of 6.4 percent. In addition, the Company sold 456 condominium units, including through joint ventures, for $96.9 million. In 2004, the Company acquired 24 properties, consisting of 6,182 units, for an aggregate purchase price of $900.8 million at an average cap rate of 5.7 percent and a land parcel for future development for $12.4 million and sold 56 properties, consisting of 14,159 units, for an aggregate sale price of $787.8 million at an average cap rate of 6.4 percent. In addition, the Company sold 977 condominium units, including through joint ventures, and two vacant land parcels for $177.3 million and $27.9 million, respectively. Water Terrace On January 31, 2005, Equity Residential completed the previously announced sale of Water Terrace, a 450-unit high rise luxury apartment building in Marina del Rey, California, for a sales price of $305 million. The Company expects to recognize an estimated GAAP gain on sale of $80.0 million in the first quarter of 2005. Fred Tuomi named President of Property Management As a part of the Company's continued drive toward achieving operational excellence and taking advantage of functional efficiencies, Equity Residential is combining its two property management operating divisions into one. Fred Tuomi, currently President of Equity Residential's Western Division has been named President of the combined entity. Edward Geraghty, the President of the Company's Eastern Division, has elected to leave the Company to pursue other opportunites and will stay on to assist in the transition until March 1, 2005. The Company anticipates recording a $0.01 per share charge during the first quarter of 2005 for severance in connection with this reorganization. First Quarter 2005 Results Equity Residential expects to announce first quarter 2005 results on Tuesday, April 26, 2005 and host a conference call to discuss those results at 10:00 a.m. CT that day. Equity Residential is the largest publicly traded apartment company in America. Nationwide, Equity Residential owns or has investments in 939 properties, in 32 states and the District of Columbia, consisting of 200,149 units.

Forward-Looking Statements The Company lists parameters for 2005 results in the final page of this release. 2005 results will depend upon a slowdown in multifamily starts and economic recovery and job growth.

This news release also contains forward-looking statements concerning development properties. The total number of units and cost of development and completion dates reflect the Company's best estimates and are subject to uncertainties arising from changing economic conditions (such as costs of labor and construction materials), completion and local government regulation.

There can be no assurance that the deal will close or if it does, when. The Company assumes no obligation to update or supplement forward-looking statements that become untrue because of subsequent events.

Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. The April 2002 White Paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from FFO for previously depreciated operating properties only. Once the Company commences the conversion of units to condominiums, it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property. (2) The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company, because it is a recognized measure of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. FFO in and of itself does not represent net income or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO should not be exclusively considered as an alternative to net income or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The Company's calculation of FFO may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies.

(2) The Company's primary financial measure for evaluating each of its apartment communities is net operating income ("NOI"). NOI represents rental income less property and maintenance expense, real estate tax and insurance expense, and property management expense. The Company believes that NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the Company's apartment communities.
