Item 1.01  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
Amended and Restated Employment Agreement
 
On March 28, 2005, Equity Residential (the "Company") and Bruce W. Duncan, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, entered into an Amended and Restated Employment Agreement (the "Amendment") to reflect changes required in view of Mr. Duncan's planned retirement as President, Chief Executive Officer and trustee to be effective as of January 2, 2006 (as further described below in Item 5.02(b)  (c)). A copy of the Amendment is being filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
The Company had previously entered into an Employment Agreement with Mr. Duncan in January 2003 in connection with Mr. Duncan's appointment as Chief Executive Officer as of January 1, 2003.  The term of the agreement was four years, from January 1, 2003 until December 31, 2006.  Under the agreement, Mr. Duncan's target annual compensation is $6,330,000, comprised of a base annual salary of $750,000, a target cash bonus of $1,080,000 and a long-term incentive grant of options, restricted shares and performance shares valued at $4,500,000.
 
The Amendment provides that Mr. Duncan will receive target compensation for services provided during 2005 of $6,330,000 (comprised of $750,000 salary and January 2006 grants of cash bonus and long-term incentive grants as discussed below), unless his employment is terminated by the Company for cause or he resigns without good reason.  In the event of Mr. Duncan's death or disability prior to January 2, 2006, his cash bonus and long-term incentive grant would be prorated based on the number of days served in the calendar year.
 
The Amendment further provides that upon Mr. Duncan's termination of employment on January 2, 2006 (unless his employment is terminated by the Company for cause or he resigns without good reason), he will receive the following benefits:
 
A $1,080,000 cash bonus and $4,500,000 of options, restricted shares and performance shares for services provided during 2005, each to be received on January 2, 2006.
 - 
                                         
 
All his options, restricted shares and performance shares, including the grants made in January 2006, vest in full, with the performance shares vesting at the greater of the 100% level or the performance level achieved through December 31, 2006, with the exception of Mr. Duncan's 2003 performance share grant, which will be valued at December 31, 2005 pursuant to its terms, which provide no minimum guarantee.  Mr. Duncan has the balance of the 10-year option period to exercise any vested options
 - 
                                         
.
 
A cash payment of $30,000 and a grant of 17,239 vested common shares and 42,614 vested stock options, each made on January 2, 2006.
 - 
                                         
 
The Company will pay for Mr. Duncan's medical and dental coverage through December 31, 2006.
 - 
                                         
 
Any benefits due Mr. Duncan are subject to his execution of a general release agreement with a two and one-half (2 ) year non-competition and employee non-solicitation clause.
 - 
                                         
 
The $4,500,000 long-term incentive grant will be allocated between options, restricted shares and performance shares in the same ratio as approved by the Board in late 2005 for the annual long-term incentive grants to the Company's executive officers.  Typically, an amount equal to ten percent of the total annual compensation is allocated to performance shares with the balance being allocated 75% to restricted shares and 25% to options.  The number of options granted is determined by dividing the dollar amount allocated to options by the fair market value of each option using the same valuation criteria utilized by the Company's Compensation Committee in its annual employee option grants.  The options are granted for a period of ten years at the fair market value of the Company's common shares at the date of grant. The number of shares granted is determined by dividing the dollar amount allocated to shares by the closing price of common shares of the Company on the grant date.
Deferred Compensation Agreement
 
The Amendment also amended Mr. Duncan's Deferred Compensation Agreement entered into in January 2003 with the Company to treat Mr. Duncan's retirement from the Company in January 2006 as a retirement effective as of December 31, 2006.  This agreement provides Mr. Duncan with a salary benefit after the termination of his employment with the Company.  Upon Mr. Duncan's retirement on January 2, 2006 (or if his employment is otherwise terminated by the Company without cause or he resigns for good reason prior to that date), he will be entitled to receive a payment of deferred compensation for a ten-year period commencing at age 62 (August 15, 2013) equal to $375,000 (increased by a CPI Index from January 2003 through December 31, 2005). Should Mr. Duncan be terminated for cause or should he choose to leave voluntarily, without good reason, prior to January 2, 2006, he will not be entitled to any deferred compensation.
 
Item 5.02  Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers
 
(b)  (c)  On March 28, 2005, the Company announced that Bruce W. Duncan, its President and Chief Executive Officer, will retire on January 2, 2006.  He will also retire from the Company's Board of Trustees at the same time.  The Board named David J. Neithercut to be Mr. Duncan's successor.  Mr. Neithercut, 49, who has been with the Company since it went public in 1993, currently serves as the Company's Executive Vice President  Corporate Strategy, where he oversees the Company's transactions, portfolio management, development, condominium and research groups.  Mr. Neithercut assumed the post of Executive Vice President  Corporate Strategy in January 2004.  From 1995 until August 2004, Mr. Neithercut served as the Company's Chief Financial Officer.  The terms of Mr. Neithercut's compensation as successor to Mr. Duncan have not been determined.
 
Item 7.01  Regulation FD Disclosure
 
On March 28, 2005, the Company issued a press release announcing the planned retirement of Bruce W. Duncan as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company effective as of January 2, 2006 and the naming of David J. Neithercut as successor to Mr. Duncan.  The press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Acknowledgment

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties execute the foregoing Release and Waiver of Claims:
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
Chicago, IL  March 28, 2005  Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR) today announced that Bruce W. Duncan, 53, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer, will retire on January 2, 2006.  The Board of Trustees has named David J. Neithercut, 49, as Mr. Duncan's successor.  Mr. Neithercut, who has been with the company since it went public in 1993, currently serves as an Executive Vice President of the company.
 
Mr. Duncan joined the company as President in April 2002 and was named CEO in January 2003.  He assumed the role of CEO with the goal of refining the company's portfolio, improving its operations through centralization and aligning the company's team, including implementing succession planning throughout the organization.  Having made great strides in accomplishing these goals, and with a strong successor ready to assume the position of CEO, Mr. Duncan informed the Board of his desire to retire in January 2006.
 
"I became CEO with the goal of taking this high-performing company and making it even better.  Much of what we set out to accomplish is near completion and will be achieved by year-end.  I am extremely pleased with the current state of our portfolio, the consolidation of our operations into a single operating unit, the tremendous progress we've made in expanding our development and condominium conversion capabilities and the efforts we've made on the people side of the business.  In the past three years the company has divested itself of over $2.7 billion of older, less strategically located assets and replaced them with significantly newer assets in strategic markets, most of which are in markets with higher barriers of entry.  Today almost 60%
of our net income comes from high barrier markets.  We have embarked upon an exciting set of new initiatives, including procurement, revenue and pricing optimization, centralized software and control systems, and a myriad of new programs on the personnel side of our company.  Most importantly, however, I believe we have an outstanding person to succeed me.  David is a great leader and has the full respect and support of our Board and management team.  Over the past three years, David has been integrally involved in all these efforts and has materially expanded his significant role in a way that uniquely qualifies him for the leadership post he's about to assume," said Mr. Duncan.
 
The company's Chairman of the Board, Sam Zell, said, "I would like to express my appreciation to Bruce for his service to the company.  He has moved it in the right direction across the enterprise  reshaping our portfolio, harnessing the full potential of the company's size, centralizing operations and instituting succession management.  As part of that succession plan, I believe that going forward our company will be in excellent hands under David's leadership and strategic vision."
 
Mr. Neithercut assumed the newly created post of Executive Vice President  Corporate Strategy in January 2004, and oversees the company's Transactions, Portfolio Management, Development, Condominium and Research groups.  From 1995 until August 2004, Mr. Neithercut served as the company's Chief Financial Officer and was responsible for all of the company's capital market activities, and played a key role in the company's mergers and acquisitions.
 
The company anticipates recording an approximate $10 million, or $0.03 per share, charge during 2005 in connection with Mr. Duncan's retirement primarily relating to the accelerated vesting of restricted shares, stock options and performance shares awarded, or to be awarded, to Mr. Duncan for services provided during 2003, 2004 and 2005. The company is reaffirming its first quarter guidance of earnings of $0.82 to $0.84 per share and Funds from Operations of $0.73 to $0.75 per share.
 
Equity Residential is the largest publicly traded apartment company in America.  Nationwide, Equity Residential owns or has investments in 938 properties, in 32 states and the District of Columbia, consisting of 199,292 units.
