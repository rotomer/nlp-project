Item 1.01
Entry Into a Material Agreement
                                            
 
On April 1, 2005, ERP Operating Limited Partnership (the "Operating Partnership") entered into a new $1 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement that replaced the Operating Partnership's then existing $700 million credit facility, which was scheduled to mature in May, 2005.  Equity Residential, the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, remains a guarantor of the Operating Partnership's obligations under the new credit facility.  The new credit facility is with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as syndication agent, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Banc of America Securities LLC, as joint lead arrangers and joint book runners, Commerzbank AG, New York and Grand Cayman Branches, Wachovia Bank, National Association, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Suntrust Bank, and US Bank National Association, as co-documentation agents, and a syndicate of other banks.
 
The new credit facility matures on May 29, 2008, and has a one-year extension option.  The Operating Partnership has the ability to increase available borrowings up to $500 million by adding additional banks to the facility or obtaining the agreement of existing banks to increase their commitments.  The interest rate on the advances under the new credit facility will generally be LIBOR plus a spread, which is dependent on the current credit rating of the Operating Partnership's long-term debt and is currently 50 basis points, or based upon bids received from the lending group.  In addition, there is an annual facility fee, which is based on the credit rating of the Operating Partnership's long-term debt, and is currently 15 basis points.

The Administrative Agent shall promptly (and in any event within one (1) Domestic Business Day after such offers are accepted) notify the Borrower and each such Bank in writing of any such allocation of Money Market Loans.  Determinations by the Administrative Agent of the allocation of Money Market Loans shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

Any Designated Lender which funds a Money Market Loan shall on and after the time of such funding become the obligee under such Money Market Loan and be entitled to receive payment thereof when due.  No Bank shall be relieved of its obligation to fund a Money Market Loan, and no Designated Lender shall assume such obligation, prior to the time the applicable Money Market Loan is funded.

(a)
                                 
 
Not later than 1:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on the date of each Borrowing as indicated in the Notice of Borrowing, each Bank shall (except as provided in subsection (c) of this Section) make available its share of such Borrowing in Federal funds immediately available in Chicago, to the Administrative Agent at its address referred to in Section 9.1.  If the Borrower has requested the issuance of a Letter of Credit, no later than 12:00 Noon (Chicago time) on the date of such issuance as indicated in the notice delivered pursuant to Section 2.2(b), the Fronting Bank shall issue such Letter of Credit in the amount so requested
(b)
                                
and deliver the same to the Borrower with a copy thereof to the Administrative Agent.  Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit by the Fronting Bank, such Fronting Bank shall be deemed to have sold and transferred to each other Bank, and each such other Bank shall be deemed, and hereby agrees, to have irrevocably and unconditionally purchased and received from the Fronting Bank, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and a participation in such Letter of Credit, any drawing thereunder, and the obligations of the Borrower hereunder with respect thereto, and any security therefor or guaranty pertaining thereto, in an amount equal to such Bank's ratable share thereof (based upon the ratio its Commitment bears to the aggregate of all Commitments).  Upon any change in any of the Commitments in accordance herewith, there shall be an automatic adjustment to such participations to reflect such changed shares.  The Fronting Bank shall have the primary obligation to fund any and all draws made with respect to such Letter of Credit notwithstanding any failure of a participating Bank to fund its ratable share of any such draw.  The Administrative Agent will instruct the Fronting Bank to make such Letter of Credit available to the Borrower and the Fronting Bank shall make such Letter of Credit available to the Borrower at the Borrower's aforesaid address or at such address in the United States as Borrower shall request on the date of the issuance thereof.
 
Not later than 3:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on the date of each Swingline Borrowing as indicated in the applicable Notice of Borrowing, the Swingline Lender shall make available such Swingline Borrowing in Federal funds immediately available in Chicago, Illinois, to the Administrative Agent at its address referred to herein.
(c)
                                 
 
Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Bank prior to the date of any Borrowing that such Bank will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Bank's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Bank has made such share available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with subsection (b) of this Section 2.4 and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, but shall not be obligated to, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount on behalf of such Bank.  If and to the extent that such Bank shall not have so made such share available to the Administrative Agent, such Bank and the Borrower severally agree to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on

If such Bank shall repay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Bank's Loan included in such Borrowing as of the date of such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.

(a)
                                 
 
Each Bank may, by notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, request that its Loans of a particular type (including Swingline Loans and Money Market Loans) be evidenced by a separate Note in an amount equal to the aggregate unpaid principal amount of such Loans. Any additional costs incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Borrower or the Banks in connection with preparing such a Note shall be at the sole cost and expense of the Bank requesting such Note. In the event any Loans evidenced by such a Note are paid in full prior to the Maturity Date, any such Bank shall return such Note to Borrower.  Each such Note shall be in substantially the form of hereto with appropriate modifications to reflect the fact that it evidences solely Loans of the relevant type.  Upon the execution and delivery of any such Note, any existing Note payable to such Bank shall be replaced or modified accordingly.  Each reference in this Agreement to the "" of such Bank shall be deemed to refer to and include any or all of such Notes, as the context may require.

Note

if such Loans are Euro-Dollar Loans, the Borrower may elect to convert all or any portion of such Loans to Base Rate Loans and/or elect to continue all or any portion of such Loans as Euro-Dollar Loans for an additional Interest Period or additional Interest Periods, in each case effective on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable to such Loans, or on such other date designated by Borrower in the Notice of Interest Rate

Election provided Borrower shall pay any losses pursuant to Section 2.13.
 
Each such election shall be made by delivering a notice (a "") to the Administrative Agent at least three (3) Euro-Dollar Business Days before the conversion or continuation selected in such notice is to be effective.  A Notice of Interest Rate Election may, if it so specifies, apply to only a portion of the aggregate principal amount of the relevant Group of Loans; that (I) such portion is allocated ratably among the Loans comprising such Group of Loans, (ii) the portion to which such Notice of Interest Rate Election applies, and the remaining portion to which it does not apply, are each $500,000 or any larger multiple of $100,000, (iii) there shall be no more than ten (10) Euro-Dollar Groups of Loans outstanding at any time, (iv) no Committed Loan may be continued as, or converted into, a Euro-Dollar Loan when any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and (v) no Interest Period shall extend beyond the Maturity Date.

Any change in the Borrower's Credit Rating causing it to move into a different range on the table shall effect an immediate change in the applicable percentage per annum.  In the event that the Borrower receives two (2) Credit Ratings and such ratings are split between a higher and a lower range on the table, the applicable percentage per annum shall be based upon the lower of such two (2) Credit Ratings.  In the event that Borrower receives more than two (2) Credit Ratings, and such Credit Ratings are not equivalent, the applicable percentage per annum shall be determined by the lower of the two (2) highest Credit Ratings, provided that each of said two (2) highest Credit Ratings shall be Investment Grade Ratings and at least one of which shall be an Investment Grade Rating from S&P or Moody's.  In the event that each of said two (2) highest Credit Ratings shall not be Investment Grade Ratings or at least one shall not be an Investment Grade Rating from S&P or Moody's, then the applicable percentage per annum shall be determined by the lowest of the Credit Ratings.  In the event that only one (1) Rating Agency has set the Borrower's Credit Rating, then the applicable percentage per annum shall be based on such single Credit Rating.

During the Term, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Banks in proportion to their interests in respect of issued and undrawn Letters of Credit, a fee (a "") in an amount, provided that no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, equal to a rate per annum equal to the then percentage per annum of the Applicable Margin with respect to Euro-Dollar Loans less 0.10%, on the daily average of such issued and undrawn Letters of Credit, which fee shall be payable, in arrears, on each January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 during the Term, and on the Maturity Date, and, if and to the extent that the term of any Letter of Credit shall extend beyond the Maturity Date, on each January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 until all Letters of Credit shall have expired and/or been returned and on the date such final Letter of Credit expires or is returned.

The Borrower may, from time to time on any Domestic Business Day so long as prior notice is given to the Administrative Agent and Swingline Lender no later than 1:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on the day on which Borrower intends to make such prepayment, prepay any Swingline Loans in whole or in part in amounts aggregating $100,000 or a higher integral multiple of $100,000 (or, if less, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Swingline Loans then outstanding) by paying the principal amount to be prepaid no later than 2:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on such day.  Each such optional prepayment shall be applied to prepay ratably the Loans of the several Banks included in such Group of Loans or Borrowing(or the Swingline Lender in the case of Swingline Loans) included in such Group of Loans or Borrowing.
(a)
                                 
The Borrower may, upon at least one (1) Euro-Dollar Business Day's notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify each of the Banks), prepay any Euro-Dollar Loan as of the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto.  Except as provided in Article VIII and except with respect to any Euro-Dollar Loan which has been converted to a Base Rate Loan pursuant to Section 8.2, 8.3 or 8.4 hereof, the Borrower may not prepay all or any portion of the principal amount of any Euro-Dollar Loan prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto unless the Borrower shall also pay any applicable expenses pursuant to Section 2.13.  Any such prepayment shall be upon at least three (3) Euro-Dollar Business Days' notice to the Administrative Agent.  Each such optional prepayment shall be in the amounts set forth in Section 2.11(a) above and shall be applied to prepay ratably the Loans of the Banks included in any Group of Loans which are Euro-Dollar Loans, except that any Euro-Dollar Loan which has been converted to a Base Rate Loan pursuant to Section 8.2, 8.3 or 8.4 hereof may be prepaid without ratable payment of the other Loans in such Group of Loans which have not been so converted.
(b)
                                
 
The Borrower may, upon at least one (1) Domestic Business Day's notice to the Administrative Agent (by 11:00 a.m Chicago time on such Domestic Business Day), reimburse the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Fronting Bank for the amount of any drawing under a Letter of Credit in whole or in part in any amount.

If there are Loans then outstanding or, if there are no Loans outstanding at such time as to which the Commitments with respect thereto are being cancelled, upon at least one (1) Domestic Business Day's notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify each of the Banks), whereupon, in either event, all or such portion of the Commitments, as applicable, shall terminate as to the Banks, pro rata on the date set forth in such notice of cancellation, and, if there are any Loans then outstanding, Borrower shall prepay, as applicable, all or such portion of Loans outstanding on such date in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.11(a) 
(e)
                                 
and (b). In no event shall the Borrower be permitted to cancel Commitments for which a Letter of Credit has been issued and is outstanding unless the Borrower returns (or causes to be returned) such Letter of Credit to the Fronting Bank. Borrower shall be permitted to designate in its notice of cancellation which Loans, if any, are to be prepaid.  A reduction of the Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.11(e) shall not effect a reduction in the Swingline Commitment (unless so elected by the Borrower) until the aggregate Commitments have been reduced to an amount equal to or less than the Swingline Commitment.
 
Any amounts so prepaid pursuant to Section 2.11 (a), (b), (c) or (d) may be reborrowed. In the event Borrower elects to cancel all or any portion of the Commitments and the Swingline Commitment pursuant to Section 2.11(e) hereof, such amounts may not be reborrowed.

The Administrative Agent will promptly (and if received prior to 12:00 noon, on the same Domestic Business Day, if received after 12:00 noon on the immediately following Domestic Business Day) distribute to each Bank its ratable share (or applicable share with respect to Money Market Loans) of each such payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of the Banks.  If and to the extent that the Administrative Agent shall receive any such payment for the account of the Banks on or before 12:00 Noon (Chicago time) on any Domestic Business Day, and Administrative Agent shall not have distributed to any Bank its applicable share of such payment on such Domestic Business Day, Administrative Agent shall distribute such amount to such Bank together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount should have been distributed to such Bank until the date Administrative Agent distributes such amount to such Bank, at the Federal Funds Rate.  Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on the Base Rate Loans or Swingline Loans or of fees shall be due

Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Euro-Dollar Loans shall be due on a day which is not a Euro-Dollar Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Euro-Dollar Business Day unless such Euro-Dollar Business Day falls in another calendar month, in which case the date for payment thereof shall be the next preceding Euro-Dollar Business Day.  Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Money Market Loans shall be due on a day which is not a Euro-Dollar Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Euro-Dollar Business Day.  If the date for any payment of principal is extended by operation of law or otherwise, interest thereon shall be payable for such extended time.
 
Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Banks hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Bank on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Bank.  If and to the extent that the Borrower shall not have so made such payment, each Bank shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Bank together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Bank until the date such Bank repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

Intentionally Omitted
 
In the event of any request for a drawing under any Letter of Credit by the beneficiary thereunder, the Fronting Bank shall notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (and the Administrative Agent shall notify each Bank thereof) on or before the date on which the Fronting Bank intends to honor such drawing, and, except as provided in this subsection (e), the Borrower shall reimburse the Fronting Bank, in immediately available funds, on the same day on which such drawing is honored in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing.  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, however, unless the Borrower shall have notified the Administrative Agent, and the Fronting Bank prior to 11:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on the Domestic Business Day immediately prior to the date of such drawing that the Borrower intends to reimburse the Fronting Bank for the amount of such drawing with funds other than the proceeds of the Loans, the Borrower shall be deemed to have timely given a Notice of Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.2 to the Administrative Agent, requesting a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans on the date on which such drawing is honored and in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing.  Each Bank (other than the Fronting Bank) shall, in accordance with Section 2.4(b), make available its Pro Rata Share of such Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, the proceeds of which shall be applied directly by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Fronting Bank for the amount of such draw.  In the event that any such Bank fails to make available to the Fronting Bank the amount of such Bank's participation on the date of a drawing, the Fronting Bank shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Bank together with interest at the Federal Funds Rate commencing on the date such drawing is honored, and the provisions of Section 9.16 shall otherwise apply to such failure.
(e)
                                 
If, after the date hereof, any change in any law or regulation or in the interpretation thereof by any court or administrative or governmental authority charged with the administration thereof shall either (I) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against letters of credit issued by, or assets held by, or deposits in or for the account of, or participations in any letter of credit, upon any Bank (including the Fronting Bank) or (ii) impose on any Bank any other condition regarding this Agreement or such Bank (including the Fronting Bank) as it pertains to the Letters of Credit or any participation therein and the result of any event referred to in the preceding clause (I) or (ii) shall be to increase, by an amount deemed by the Fronting Bank or such Bank to be material, the cost to the Fronting Bank or any Bank of issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or participating therein, then the Borrower shall pay to the Fronting Bank or such Bank, within 15 days after written demand by such Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), which demand shall be accompanied by a certificate showing, in reasonable detail, the calculation of such amount or amounts, such additional amounts as shall be required to compensate the Fronting Bank or such Bank for such increased costs or reduction in amounts received or receivable hereunder.  Each Bank will promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle such Bank to compensation pursuant to this Section 2.16 and will designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the reasonable judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank.  If such Bank shall fail to notify Borrower of any such event within 90 days following the end of the month during which such event occurred, then Borrower's liability for any amounts described in this Section incurred by such Bank as a result of such event shall be limited to those attributable to the period occurring subsequent to the ninetieth (90th) day prior to the date upon which such Bank actually notified Borrower of the occurrence of such event.  A certificate of any Bank claiming compensation under this Section 2.16 and setting forth a reasonably detailed calculation of the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of demonstrable error.  In determining such amount, such Bank may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.
(f)
                                   
The Borrower hereby agrees to protect, indemnify, pay and save harmless the Fronting Bank and the Banks from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, charges and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements) which the Fronting Bank or any Bank may incur or be subject to as a result of (I) the issuance of the Letters of Credit, other than to the extent of the bad faith, gross negligence or wilful misconduct of the Fronting Bank or (ii) the failure of the Fronting Bank to honor a drawing under any Letter of Credit as a result of any act or omission, whether rightful or wrongful, of any present or future or government or governmental authority, including by reason of court order (collectively, ""), other than to the extent of the bad faith, gross negligence or wilful misconduct of the Fronting Bank.  As between the Borrower and the Fronting Bank and each Bank, the Borrower assumes all risks of the acts and omissions of any beneficiary with respect to its use, or misuses of, the Letters of Credit issued by the Fronting Bank. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Fronting Bank and the Banks shall not be responsible (I) for the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any document submitted by any party in connection with the application for and issuance of any Letter of Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged; (ii) for the validity or insufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (iii) for failure of the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit to comply fully with conditions required in order to draw upon such Letter of Credit, other than as a result of the bad faith, gross negligence or wilful misconduct of the Fronting Bank; (iv) for errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any message, by mail, cable, telegraph, facsimile transmission, or otherwise; (v) for errors in interpretation of any technical terms; (vi) for any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any documents required in order to make a drawing under any Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof; (vii) for the misapplication by the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of the proceeds of such Letter of Credit; or (viii) for any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Fronting Bank or any Bank,

including any Government Acts, in each case other than to the extent of the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Fronting Bank.

In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of the specific provisions hereinabove set forth, any action taken or omitted by the Fronting Bank under or in connection with the Letters of Credit issued by it or the related certificates, if taken or omitted in good faith, shall not put the Fronting Bank or any Bank under any resulting liability to the Borrower; provided that, notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, the Fronting Bank will be liable to the Borrower for any damages suffered by the Borrower or its Subsidiaries as a result of the Fronting Bank's grossly negligent or wilful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it of a sight draft and certificates strictly in compliance with the terms and conditions of the Letter of Credit, except as a result of any court order.
 
If the Fronting Bank or the Administrative Agent is required at any time, pursuant to any bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation or reorganization law or otherwise, to return to the Borrower any reimbursement by the Borrower of any drawing under any Letter of Credit, each Bank shall pay to the Fronting Bank or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, its Pro Rata Share of such payment, but without interest thereon unless the Fronting Bank or the Administrative Agent is required to pay interest on such amounts to the person recovering such payment, in which case with interest thereon, computed at the same rate, and on the same basis, as the interest that the Fronting Bank or the Administrative Agent is required to pay.

(b)
                                
 
Since December 31, 2004, (I) except as may have been disclosed in writing to the Banks, nothing has occurred prior to the Closing Date having a Material Adverse Effect, and (ii) except as previously disclosed to the Banks, neither the Borrower nor EQR has incurred any material indebtedness or guaranty on or before the Closing Date.

SECTION 4.5
                         
Litigation
 
.  The transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents will not constitute a nonexempt prohibited transaction (as such term is defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA) that could subject the Administrative Agent or the Banks to any tax or penalty for prohibited transactions imposed under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(I) of ERISA.
SECTION 4.6
                         
Compliance with ERISA
 
.  The Borrower and EQR each conducts reviews of the effect of Environmental Laws on the business, operations and properties of the Borrower, EQR and Consolidated Subsidiaries of either or both when necessary in the course of which it identifies and evaluates associated liabilities and costs (including, without limitation, any capital or operating expenditures required for clean-up or closure of properties presently owned, any capital or operating expenditures required to achieve or maintain compliance with environmental protection standards imposed by law or as a condition of any license, permit or contract, any related constraints on operating activities, and any actual or potential liabilities to third parties, including employees, and any related costs and expenses).  On the basis of this review, the Borrower and EQR each has reasonably concluded that such associated liabilities and costs, including the costs of compliance with Environmental Laws, are unlikely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of the Borrower, EQR and their Consolidated Subsidiaries in respect of taxes or other governmental charges are, in the opinion of the Borrower, adequate.

If no successor Administrative Agent or Syndication Agent (as applicable) shall have been so appointed by the Required Banks and (if required) approved by the Borrower, or, if so appointed, shall not have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent or Syndication Agent (as applicable) gives notice of resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent or retiring Syndication Agent (as applicable) may, on behalf of the Banks, appoint a successor Administrative Agent or Syndication Agent (as applicable), which shall be the Syndication Agent or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, who shall act until the Required Banks shall appoint a successor Administrative Agent or Syndication Agent.  In any event, the retiring Administrative Agent shall continue to act as Administrative Agent until such time as a successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Banks, approved by Borrower (if required), and assumed its duties hereunder. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as the Administrative Agent or Syndication Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent or successor Syndication Agent, as applicable, such successor Administrative Agent or successor Syndication Agent, as applicable, shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent or retiring Syndication Agent, as applicable, and the retiring Administrative Agent or the retiring Syndication Agent, as applicable, shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder.  The rights and duties of the Administrative Agent to be vested in any successor Administrative Agent shall include, without limitation, the rights and duties as Swingline Lender.  After any retiring Administrative Agent's or retiring Syndication Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was the Administrative Agent or the Syndication Agent, as applicable.  For gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by the Required Banks (excluding for such determination the Bank serving as Administrative Agent or Syndication Agent in its capacity as a Bank, as applicable), the Administrative Agent or Syndication Agent may be removed at any time by giving at least thirty (30) Domestic Business
Days prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, Syndication Agent and Borrower.  Such resignation or removal shall take effect upon the acceptance of appointment by a successor Administrative Agent or Syndication Agent, as applicable, in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7.8.

Basis for Determining Interest Rate Inadequate or Unfair
 
the Administrative Agent determines in good faith that deposits in dollars (in the applicable amounts) are not being offered in the relevant market for such Interest Period, or
(a)
                                 
 
Banks having 50% or more of the aggregate amount of the Commitments advise the Administrative Agent that the Euro-Dollar Rate, as determined by the Administrative Agent will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to each such Bank of funding its Euro-Dollar Loans for such Interest Period,
(b)
                                
 
the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Banks, whereupon until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligations of the Banks to make Euro-Dollar Loans shall be suspended.  Unless the Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent at least two Domestic Business Days before the date of (I) any Euro-Dollar Borrowing for which a Notice of Borrowing has previously been given that it elects not to borrow on such date, such Borrowing shall instead be made as a Base Rate Borrowing, or (ii) any Money Market LIBOR Borrowing for which a Notice of Money Market Borrowing has previously been given, the Money Market LIBOR Loans comprising such Borrowing shall bear interest for each day from and including the first day to but excluding the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto at the Base Rate for such day.  For purposes of Section 8.1(b), in determining whether the Euro-Dollar Rate, as determined by Administrative Agent, will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to any Bank of funding its Euro-Dollar Loans for such Interest Period, such determination will be based solely on the ability of such Bank to obtain matching funds in the London interbank market at a reasonably equivalent rate.

With respect to Euro-Dollar Loans, before giving any notice to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section, such Bank shall designate a different Euro-Dollar Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice and will not, in the judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank.  If such Bank shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain and fund any of its outstanding Euro-Dollar Loans to maturity and shall so specify in such notice, the Borrower shall be deemed to have delivered a Notice of Interest Rate Election and such Euro-Dollar Loan shall be converted as of such date to a Base Rate Loan (without payment of any amounts that Borrower would otherwise be obligated to pay pursuant to Section 2.13 hereof with respect to Loans converted pursuant to this Section 8.2) in an equal principal amount from such Bank (on which interest and principal shall be payable contemporaneously with the related Euro-Dollar Loans of the other Banks), and such Bank shall make such a Base Rate Loan.
 
If, at any time, it shall be unlawful for any Bank to make, maintain or fund its Euro-Dollar Loans, the Borrower shall have the right, upon five (5) Domestic Business Day's notice to the Administrative Agent, to either (x) cause a bank, reasonably acceptable to the
Administrative Agent, to offer to purchase the Commitments of such Bank for an amount equal to such Bank's outstanding Loans and all amounts due such Bank hereunder (including, without limitation, interest, Facility Fees, Letter of Credit Fees and all amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.13), and to become a Bank hereunder, or obtain the agreement of one or more existing Banks to offer to purchase the Commitments of such Bank for such amount, which offer such Bank is hereby required to accept, or (y) to repay in full all Loans then outstanding of such Bank, together with interest thereon, Facility Fees, Letter of Credit Fees and all other amounts due such Bank hereunder (including, without limitation, amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.13), upon which event, such Bank's Commitments shall be deemed to be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.11(e).  Any Bank subject to this paragraph shall retain the benefits of Sections 2.16(f), 2.16(g), 8.3, 8.4 and 9.3 for the period prior to such purchase or cancellation.

SECTION 8.3
                         
Increased Cost and Reduced Return
 
If, on or after (x) the date hereof in the case of Committed Loans made pursuant to Section 2.1, or (y) the date of the related Money Market Quote, in the case of any Money Market Loan, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) made after the Closing Date of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve (including, without limitation, any such requirement imposed by the Federal Reserve Board (but excluding with respect to any Euro-Dollar Loan any such requirement to the extent reflected in an applicable Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage)), special deposit, insurance assessment or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) or shall impose on any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) or on the London interbank market any other condition materially more burdensome in nature, extent or consequence than those in existence as of the Closing Date affecting such Bank's Euro-Dollar Loans, its Note, or its obligation to make Euro-Dollar Loans, and the result of any of the foregoing is to
(a)
                                 
increase the cost to such Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) of making or maintaining any Euro-Dollar Loan, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) under this Agreement or under its Note with respect to such Euro-Dollar Loans, by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then, within 15 days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts (based upon a reasonable allocation thereof by such Bank to the Euro-Dollar Loans made by such Bank hereunder) as will compensate such Bank for such increased cost or reduction to the extent such Bank generally imposes such additional amounts on other borrowers of such Bank in similar circumstances.
 
If any Bank shall have reasonably determined that, after the date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change in any law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) made after the Closing Date of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on capital of such Bank (or its Parent) as a consequence of such Bank's obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Bank (or its Parent) could have achieved but for such adoption, change, request or directive (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount reasonably deemed by such Bank to be material, then from time to time, within 15 days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank (or its Parent) for such reduction to the extent such Bank generally imposes such additional amounts on other borrowers of such Bank in similar circumstances.
(b)
                                
 
Each Bank will promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle such Bank to compensation pursuant to this Section and will designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the reasonable
(c)
                                 
judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank.  If such Bank shall fail to notify Borrower of any such event within 90 days following the end of the month during which such event occurred, then Borrower's liability for any amounts described in this Section incurred by such Bank as a result of such event shall be limited to those attributable to the period occurring subsequent to the ninetieth (90th) day prior to the date upon which such Bank actually notified Borrower of the occurrence of such event.  A certificate of any Bank claiming compensation under this Section and setting forth a reasonably detailed calculation of the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of demonstrable error.  In determining such amount, such Bank may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.
 
If at any time, any Bank shall be owed amounts pursuant to this Section 8.3, the Borrower shall have the right, upon five (5) Domestic Business Day's notice to the Administrative Agent to either (x) cause a bank, reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, to offer to purchase the Commitments of such Bank for an amount equal to such Bank's outstanding Loans and all amounts due such Bank hereunder (including, without limitation, interest, Facility Fees, Letter of Credit Fees and all amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.13 and this Section 8.3), and to become a Bank hereunder, or to obtain the agreement of one or more existing Banks to offer to purchase the Commitments of such Bank for such amount, which offer such Bank is hereby required to accept, or (y) to repay in full all Loans then outstanding of such Bank, together with interest thereon, Facility Fees, Letter of Credit Fees and all other amounts due such Bank hereunder (including, without limitation, amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.13 and this Section 8.3), upon which event, such Bank's Commitment shall be deemed to be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.11(e).  Any Bank subject to this Section 8.3(d) shall retain the benefits of Sections 2.16(f), 2.16(g), 8.3, 8.4 and 9.3 for the period prior to such purchase or cancellation.

SECTION 8.4
                         
Taxes
 
Any and all payments by the Borrower to or for the account of any Bank or the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities

with respect thereto, , in the case of each Bank and the Administrative Agent, taxes imposed on its income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) is organized or any political subdivision thereof and, in the case of each Bank, taxes imposed on its income, and franchise or similar taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction of such Bank's Applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof or by any other jurisdiction (or any political subdivision thereof) as a result of a present or former connection between such Bank or Administrative Agent and such other jurisdiction or by the United States (all such non-excluded taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "").  If the Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Non-Excluded Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any Note or in respect of any Letter of Credit, (I) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 8.4) such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions, (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law and (iv) the Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.1, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.

In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes, or charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or under any Note or in respect of any Letter of Credit or from the execution or delivery of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any Note or Letter of Credit (hereinafter referred to as "").

This indemnification shall be made within 15 days from the date such Bank, the Fronting Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) makes demand therefor.
 
Each Bank organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this Agreement in the case of each Bank listed on the signature pages hereof and on or prior to the date on which it becomes a Bank in the case of each other Bank, shall provide the Borrower with an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, as appropriate, or any successor form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, and shall provide Borrower with two further copies of any such form or certification on or before the date that any such form or certification expires or becomes obsolete and after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form previously delivered by it to Borrower, certifying (I) in the case of a Form 1001, that such Bank is entitled to benefits under an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party which reduces the rate of withholding tax on payments of interest or certifying that the income receivable pursuant to this Agreement is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, and (ii) in the case of being under Sections 1442(c)(1) and 1442(a) of the Code, that it is entitled to an exemption from United States backup withholding tax.  If the form provided by a Bank at the time such Bank first becomes a party to this Agreement indicates a United States interest withholding tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be considered excluded from "Non-Excluded Taxes" as defined in Section 8.4(a).

If the Borrower is required to pay additional amounts to or for the account of any Bank pursuant to this Section 8.4, then such Bank will change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office so as to eliminate or reduce any such additional payment which may thereafter accrue if such change, in the judgment of such Bank, is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank.
(f)
                                   
 
If, at any time, any Bank shall be owed amounts pursuant to this Section 8.4, the Borrower shall have the right, upon five (5) Domestic Business Day's notice to the Administrative Agent to either (x) cause a bank, reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, to offer to purchase the Commitments of such Bank for an amount equal to such Bank's outstanding Loans and all amounts due such Bank hereunder (including, without limitation, interest, Facility Fees, Letter of Credit Fees and all amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.13 and this Section 8.4), and to become a Bank hereunder, or to obtain the agreement of one or more existing Banks to offer to purchase the Commitments of such Bank for such amount, which offer such Bank is hereby required to accept, or (y) to repay in full all Loans then outstanding of such Bank, together with interest thereon, Facility Fees, Letter of Credit Fees and all other amounts due such Bank hereunder (including, without limitation, amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.13 and this Section 8.4), upon which event, such Bank's Commitment shall be deemed to be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.11(c).

Borrower shall be deemed to have delivered a Notice of Interest Rate Election with respect to such affected Euro-Dollar Loans and thereafter all Loans which would otherwise be made by such Bank as Euro-Dollar Loans shall be made instead as Base Rate Loans (on which interest and principal shall be payable contemporaneously with the related Euro-Dollar Loans of the other Banks), and
(a)
                                 
 
after each of its Euro-Dollar Loans has been repaid, all payments of principal which would otherwise be applied to repay such Euro-Dollar Loans shall be applied to repay its Base Rate Loans instead, and

Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Bank prior to the date of any Borrowing that such Bank will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Bank's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Bank has made such share available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with subsection (b) of Section 2.4 or Section 2.16(e), and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to Borrower on such date a corresponding amount.  If and to the extent that such Bank shall not have so made such share available to the Administrative Agent, such Bank and Borrower severally agree to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.4(c) or Section 2.16(e).  If such Bank shall repay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Bank's Loan included in such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement as of the date of such Borrowing.  Nothing contained in this Section or Sections 2.4(c) or 2.16(e) shall be deemed to reduce the Commitment of any Bank or in any way affect the rights of Borrower with respect to any defaulting Bank or Administrative Agent.

Each Junior Creditor shall file in any bankruptcy or other proceeding of Borrower in which the filing of claims is required by law, all claims relating to Subordinated Debt that such Junior Creditor may have against Borrower and assign to the Banks who are not Junior Creditors all rights of such Junior Creditor thereunder.  If such Junior Creditor does not file any such claim prior to forty-five (45) days before the expiration of the time to file such claim, Administrative Agent, as attorney-in-fact for such Junior Creditor, is hereby irrevocably authorized to do so in the name of such Junior Creditor or, in Administrative Agent's sole discretion, to assign the claim to a nominee and to cause proof of claim to be filed in the name of such nominee.  The foregoing power of attorney is
(f)
                                   
with an interest and cannot be revoked.  The Administrative Agent shall, to the exclusion of each Junior Creditor, have the sole right, subject to Section 9.5 hereof, to accept or reject any plan proposed in any such proceeding and to take any other action that a party filing a claim is entitled to take.  In all such cases, whether in administration, bankruptcy or otherwise, the Person or Persons authorized to pay such claim shall pay to Administrative Agent the amount payable on such claim and, to the full extent necessary for that purpose, each Junior Creditor hereby transfers and assigns to the Administrative Agent all of the Junior Creditor's rights to any such payments or distributions to which Junior Creditor would otherwise be entitled.
coupled
 
(I)  If any payment or distribution of any character or any security, whether in cash, securities or other property, shall be received by any Junior Creditor in contravention of any of the terms hereof, such payment or distribution or security shall be received for the benefit of, and shall promptly be paid over or delivered and transferred to, Administrative Agent for application to the payment of all Senior Debt, to the extent necessary to achieve Payment in Full.  In the event of the failure of any Junior Creditor to endorse or assign any such payment, distribution or security, Administrative Agent is hereby irrevocably authorized to endorse or assign the same as attorney-in-fact for such Junior Creditor.
(g)
                                
 
(ii)  Each Junior Creditor shall take such action (including, without limitation, the execution and filing of a financing statement with respect to this Agreement and the execution, verification, delivery and filing of proofs of claim, consents, assignments or other instructions that Administrative Agent may require from time to time in order to prove or realize upon any rights or claims pertaining to Subordinated Debt or to effectuate the full benefit of the subordination contained herein) as may, in Administrative Agent's sole and absolute discretion, be necessary or desirable to assure the effectiveness of the subordination effected by this Agreement.
 
(I)  Each Bank that becomes a Junior Creditor understands and acknowledges by its execution hereof that each other Bank is entering into this Agreement and the other Loan Documents in reliance upon the absolute subordination in right of payment and in time of payment of Subordinated Debt to Senior Debt as set forth herein.
(h)
                                
(ii)  Only upon the Payment in Full of all Senior Debt shall any Junior Creditor be subrogated to any remaining rights of the Banks which are not Defaulting Banks to receive payments or distributions of assets of the Borrower made on or applicable to any Senior Debt.
 
(iii)  Each Junior Creditor agrees that it will deliver all instruments or other writings evidencing any Subordinated Debt held by it to Administrative Agent, promptly after request therefor by the Administrative Agent.
 
(iv)  No Junior Creditor may at any time sell, assign or otherwise transfer any Subordinated Debt, or any portion thereof, including, without limitation, the granting of any Lien thereon, unless and until satisfaction of the requirements of Section 9.6 above and the proposed transferee shall have assumed in writing the obligation of the Junior Creditor to the Banks under this Agreement, in a form acceptable to the Administrative Agent.
 
(v)  If any of the Senior Debt should be invalidated, avoided or set aside, the subordination provided for herein nevertheless shall continue in full force and effect and, as between the Banks which are not Defaulting Banks and all Junior Creditors, shall be and be deemed to remain in full force and effect.
 
(vi)  Each Junior Creditor hereby irrevocably waives, in respect of Subordinated Debt, all rights (x) under Sections 361 through 365, 502(e) and 509 of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar sections hereafter in effect under any other Federal or state laws or legal or equitable principles relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganizations, liquidations or otherwise for the relief of debtors or protection of creditors), and (y) to seek or obtain conversion to a different type of proceeding or to seek or obtain dismissal of a proceeding, in each case in relation to a bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency or other proceeding under similar laws with respect to the Borrower.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Junior Creditor hereby specifically waives (A) the right to seek to give credit (secured or otherwise) to the Borrower in any way under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code unless the same is subordinated in all respects to Senior Debt in a manner acceptable to Administrative Agent in its sole and absolute discretion and (B) the right to receive any collateral security (including any "super priority" or
equal or "priming" or replacement Lien) for any Subordinated Debt unless the Banks which are not Defaulting Banks have received a senior position acceptable to the Banks in their sole and absolute discretion to secure all Senior Debt (in the same collateral to the extent collateral is involved).
 
(I)  In addition to and not in limitation of the subordination effected by this Section 9.16, the Administrative Agent and each of the Banks which are not Defaulting Banks may in their respective sole and absolute discretion also exercise any and all other rights and remedies available at law or in equity in respect of a Defaulting Bank; and
(i)
                                    
 
(ii)   The Administrative Agent shall give each of the Banks notice of the occurrence of a default under this Section 9.16 by a Defaulting Bank and if the Administrative Agent and/or one or more of the other Banks shall, at their option, fund any amounts required to be paid or advanced by a Defaulting Bank, the other Banks who have elected not to fund any portion of such amounts shall not be liable for any reimbursements to the Administrative Agent and/or to such other funding Banks.
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained or implied herein, a Defaulting Bank shall not be entitled to vote on any matter as to which a vote by the Banks is required hereunder, including, without limitation, any actions or consents on the part of the Administrative Agent as to which the approval or consent of all the Banks or the Required Banks is required under Article VIII, Section 9.5 or elsewhere, so long as such Bank is a Defaulting Bank; , , that in the case of any vote requiring the unanimous consent of the Banks, if all the Banks other than the Defaulting Bank shall have voted in accordance with each other, then the Defaulting Bank shall be deemed to have voted in accordance with such Banks.

Each of the Administrative Agent and any one or more of the Banks which are not Defaulting Banks may, at their respective option, (I) advance to the Borrower such Bank's Pro Rata Share of the Loans not advanced by a Defaulting Bank in accordance with the Loan Documents, or (ii) pay to the Administrative Agent such Bank's Pro Rata Share of any costs, expenses or disbursements incurred or made by the Administrative Agent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement not theretofore paid by a Defaulting Bank.  Immediately upon the making of any such advance by the
(k)
                                 
Administrative Agent or any one of the Banks, such Bank's Pro Rata Share and the Pro Rata Share of the Defaulting Bank shall be recalculated to reflect such advance.  All payments, repayments and other disbursements of funds by the Administrative Agent to Banks shall thereupon and, at all times thereafter be made in accordance with such Bank's recalculated Pro Rata Share unless and until a Defaulting Bank shall fully cure all defaults on the part of such Defaulting Bank under the Loan Documents or otherwise existing in respect of the Loans or this Agreement, at which time the Pro Rata Share of the Bank(s) which advanced sums on behalf of the Defaulting Bank and of the Defaulting Bank shall be restored to their original percentages.

Each of the Borrower, the Banks and the Administrative Agent hereby agrees that it will not institute against any Designated Lender or join any other Person in instituting against any Designated Lender any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceeding under any federal or state bankruptcy or similar law, until the later to occur of (I) one year and one day after the payment in full of the latest maturing commercial paper note issued by such Designated Lender and (ii) the Maturity Date.

condition and any other fact which might materially increase the risk to Guarantor), all of which Guarantor hereby expressly waives; and Guarantor hereby expressly agrees that the validity of this Guaranty and the obligations of Guarantor hereunder shall in no way be terminated, affected, diminished, modified or impaired by reason of the assertion of or the failure to assert by the Administrative Agent or any Bank against Borrower or its respective successors or assigns, any of the rights or remedies reserved to the Administrative Agent and the Banks pursuant to the provisions of the Loan Documents.  Guarantor agrees that any notice or directive given at any time to the Administrative Agent which is inconsistent with the waiver in the immediately preceding sentence shall be void and may be ignored by the Administrative Agent and the Banks, and, in addition, may not be pleaded or introduced as evidence in any litigation relating to this Guaranty for the reason that such pleading or introduction would be at variance with the written terms of this Guaranty, unless the Administrative Agent and the Banks have specifically agreed otherwise in a writing, signed by a duly authorized officer.  Guarantor specifically acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing waivers are of the essence of this transaction and that, but for this Guaranty and such waivers, the Administrative Agent and the Banks would decline to execute the Loan Documents.
Guarantor waives, and covenants and agrees that it will not at any time insist upon, plead or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any and all appraisal, valuation, stay, extension, marshalling-of-assets or redemption laws, or right of homestead or exemption, whether now or at any time hereafter in force, which may delay, prevent or otherwise affect the performance by Guarantor of its obligations under, or the enforcement by the Administrative Agent of, this Guaranty. Guarantor further covenants and agrees not to set up or claim any defense, counterclaim, offset, set-off or other objection of any kind to any action, suit or proceeding at law, in equity or otherwise, or to any demand or claim that may be instituted or made by the Administrative Agent other than the defense of the actual timely payment and performance by Borrower of the Guaranteed Obligations; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not be deemed a waiver of Guarantor's right to assert any compulsory counterclaim, if such counterclaim
3.
                                      
is compelled under local law or rule of procedure, nor shall the foregoing be deemed a waiver of Guarantor's right to assert any claim which would constitute a defense, setoff, counterclaim or crossclaim of any nature whatsoever against Administrative Agent or any Bank in any separate action or proceeding.  Guarantor represents, warrants and agrees that, as of the date hereof, its obligations under this Guaranty are not subject to any counterclaims, offsets or defenses against the Administrative Agent or any Bank of any kind.
 
The provisions of this Guaranty are for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Banks and their successors and permitted assigns, and nothing herein contained shall impair as between Borrower and the Administrative Agent and the Banks the obligations of Borrower under the Loan Documents.

Until this Guaranty is terminated pursuant to the terms hereof, Guarantor (I) shall have no right of subrogation against Borrower or any entity comprising same by reason of any payments or acts of performance by Guarantor in compliance with the obligations of Guarantor hereunder; (ii) waives any right to enforce any remedy which Guarantor now or hereafter shall have against Borrower or any entity comprising same by reason of any one or more payment or acts of performance in compliance with the obligations of Guarantor hereunder and (iii) from and after an Event of Default, subordinates any liability or indebtedness of Borrower or any entity comprising same now or hereafter held by Guarantor or any affiliate of Guarantor to the obligations of Borrower under the Loan Documents. The foregoing, however, shall not be deemed in any way to limit any rights that Guarantor may have pursuant to the Agreement of Limited Partnership of
7.
                                      
Borrower or which it may have at law or in equity with respect to any other partners of Borrower.
 
Guarantor represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and the Banks with the knowledge that the Administrative Agent and the Banks are relying upon the same, as follows:
8.
                                      
 
as of the date hereof, Guarantor is the sole general partner of Borrower;
(a)
                                 
 
based upon such relationship, Guarantor has determined that it is in its best interests to enter into this Guaranty;
(b)
                                
 
this Guaranty is necessary and convenient to the conduct, promotion and attainment of Guarantor's business, and is in furtherance of Guarantor's business purposes;
(c)
                                 
 
the benefits to be derived by Guarantor from Borrower's access to funds and other credit made possible by the Loan Documents are at least equal to the obligations undertaken pursuant to this Guaranty;
(d)
                                
 
Guarantor is solvent and has full power and legal right to enter into this Guaranty and to perform its obligations under the terms hereof and (I) Guarantor is organized and validly existing under the laws of the State of Maryland, (ii) Guarantor has complied with all provisions of applicable law in connection with all aspects of this Guaranty, and (iii) the person executing this Guaranty has all the requisite power and authority to execute and deliver this Guaranty;
(e)
                                 
 
to the best of Guarantor's knowledge, there is no action, suit, proceeding, or investigation pending or threatened against or affecting Guarantor at law, in equity, in admiralty or before any arbitrator or any governmental department, commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality (domestic or foreign) which is likely to materially and adversely affect the property, assets or condition (financial or otherwise) of Guarantor or which is likely to materially and adversely impair the
(f)
                                   
ability of Guarantor to perform its obligations under this Guaranty;
 
the execution and delivery of and the performance by Guarantor of its obligations under this Guaranty have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of Guarantor and do not (I) violate any provision of any law, rule, regulation (including, without limitation, Regulation U or X of the Federal Reserve Board of the United States), order, writ, judgment, decree, determination or award presently in effect having applicability to Guarantor or the organizational documents of Guarantor, the consequences of which violation would materially and adversely affect the property, assets or condition (financial or otherwise) of Guarantor or which is likely to materially and adversely impair the ability of Guarantor to perform its obligations under this Guaranty or (ii) violate or conflict with, result in a breach of or constitute (with due notice or lapse of time or both) a default under any indenture, agreement or other instrument to which Guarantor is a party, or by which Guarantor or any of its property is bound, the consequences of which violation, conflict, breach or default would materially and adversely affect the property, assets or condition (financial or otherwise) of Guarantor or which is likely to materially and adversely impair the ability of Guarantor to perform its obligations under this Guaranty;
(g)
                                
 
this Guaranty has been duly executed by Guarantor and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Guarantor, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms except as enforceability may be limited by applicable insolvency, bankruptcy or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally or general principles of equity, whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law;
(h)
                                
 
no authorization, consent, approval, license or formal exemption from, nor any filing, declaration or registration with, any Federal, state, local or foreign court, governmental agency or regulatory authority is required in connection with the making and performance by Guarantor of this
(i)
                                    
Guaranty, except those which have already been obtained;
 
Guarantor is not an "investment company" as that term is defined in, nor is it otherwise subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended;
(j)
                                    
 
Guarantor is not engaged principally, or as one of its important activities, in the business of purchasing, carrying, or extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any margin stock (within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States); and
(k)
                                 
 
All of the representations and warranties in the Credit Agreement concerning Guarantor are true and correct.
(l)
                                    
 
Guarantor covenants that it will comply or cause compliance with all covenants in the Credit Agreement which are applicable to it.
 
Guarantor and the Administrative Agent each acknowledge and agree that this Guaranty is a guarantee of payment and performance and not of collection and enforcement in respect of any obligations which may accrue to the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks from Borrower under the provisions of any Loan Document.
9.
                                      
 
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, and in conjunction therewith, the Administrative Agent or any Bank may assign any or all of its rights under this Guaranty.  In the event of any such assignment, the Administrative Agent shall give Guarantor prompt notice of same.  If the Administrative Agent or any Bank elects to sell all the Loans or participations in the Loans and the Loan Documents, including this Guaranty, the Administrative Agent or any Bank may forward to each purchaser and prospective purchaser all documents and information relating to this Guaranty or to Guarantor, whether furnished by Borrower or Guarantor or otherwise, subject to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement.
10.
                                
Guarantor agrees, upon the written request of the Administrative Agent, to execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent, from time to time, any modification or amendment hereto or any additional instruments or documents reasonably considered necessary by the Administrative Agent or its counsel to cause this Guaranty to be, become or remain valid and effective in accordance with its terms, provided, that any such modification, amendment, additional instrument or document shall not increase Guarantor's obligations or diminish its rights hereunder and shall be reasonably satisfactory as to form to Guarantor and to Guarantor's counsel.
11.
                                
 
The representations and warranties of Guarantor set forth in this Guaranty shall survive until this Guaranty shall terminate in accordance with the terms hereof.
12.
                                
 
This Guaranty contains the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements relating to such subject matter and may not be modified, amended, supplemented or discharged except by a written agreement signed by Guarantor and the Administrative Agent (acting with the requisite consent of the Banks as provided in the Credit Agreement).
13.
                                
 
If all or any portion of any provision contained in this Guaranty shall be determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect for any reason, such provision or portion thereof shall be deemed stricken and severed from this Guaranty and the remaining provisions and portions thereof shall continue in full force and effect.
14.
                                
 
This Guaranty may be executed in counterparts which together shall constitute the same instrument.
15.
                                
 
All notices, requests and other communications to any party hereunder shall be in writing (including bank wire, facsimile transmission followed by telephonic confirmation or similar writing) and shall be addressed to such party at the address set forth below or to such other address as may be identified by any party in a written notice to the others:
16.
                                
 
Each such notice, request or other communication shall be effective (I) if given by facsimile transmission, when such facsimile is transmitted to the facsimile number specified in this Section and the appropriate facsimile confirmation is received, (ii) if given by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested, with first class postage prepaid, addressed as aforesaid, upon receipt or refusal to accept delivery, (iii) if given by a nationally recognized overnight carrier, 24 hours after such communication is deposited with such carrier with postage prepaid for next day delivery, or (iv) if given by any other means, when delivered at the address specified in this Section.
 
Any acknowledgment or new promise, whether by payment of principal or interest or otherwise by Borrower or Guarantor, with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations shall, if the statute of limitations in favor of Guarantor against the Administrative Agent and the Banks shall have commenced to run, toll the running of such statute of limitations, and if the period of such statute of limitations shall have expired, prevent the operation of such statute of limitations.
17.
                                
 
This Guaranty shall be binding upon Guarantor and its successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Banks and their successors and permitted assigns; provided, however, that the Guarantor may not assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of all of the Banks, and any attempted such assignment or transfer without such consent shall be null and void.
18.
                                
 
The failure of the Administrative Agent to enforce any right or remedy hereunder, or promptly to enforce any such right or remedy, shall not constitute a waiver thereof, nor give rise to any estoppel against the Administrative Agent or any Bank, nor excuse Guarantor from its obligations hereunder.  Any waiver of any such right or remedy to be enforceable against the Administrative Agent and the Banks must be expressly set forth in a writing signed by the Administrative Agent (acting with the requisite consent of the Banks as provided in the Credit Agreement).
19.
                                
 
(a)   THIS GUARANTY AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS.
20.
                                
 
Any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Guaranty and any action for enforcement
(b)
                                
of any judgment in respect thereof may be brought in the courts of the State of Illinois or of the United States of America for the Northern District of Illinois, and, by execution and delivery of this Guaranty, the Guarantor hereby accepts for itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and appellate courts from any thereof.  The Guarantor irrevocably consents to the service of process out of any of the aforementioned courts in any such action or proceeding by the mailing of copies thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to the Guarantor at its address for notices set forth herein.  The Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any of the aforesaid actions or proceedings arising out of or in connection with this Guaranty brought in the courts referred to above and hereby further irrevocably waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.  Nothing herein shall affect the right of the Administrative Agent to serve process in any other manner permitted by law or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against the Guarantor in any other jurisdiction.
 
GUARANTOR HEREBY WAIVES ITS RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY AND ALL CLAIMS OR CAUSES OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS GUARANTY.  IT IS HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGED BY GUARANTOR THAT THE WAIVER OF A JURY TRIAL IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE BANKS TO ACCEPT THIS GUARANTY AND THAT THE LOANS AND OTHER EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT MADE BY THE BANKS ARE MADE IN RELIANCE UPON SUCH WAIVER.  GUARANTOR FURTHER WARRANTS AND REPRESENTS THAT SUCH WAIVER HAS BEEN KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY MADE, FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL.  IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS GUARANTY MAY BE FILED BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT IN COURT AS A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A NON-JURY TRIAL.
(c)
                                 
 
Guarantor does hereby further covenant and agree to and with the Administrative Agent and the Banks that Guarantor may be joined in any action against Borrower in connection with the Loan Documents and that recovery may be had against Guarantor in such action or in any independent action against Guarantor (with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations), without the
(d)
                                
Administrative Agent and the Banks first pursuing or exhausting any remedy or claim against Borrower or its successors or assigns.  Guarantor also agrees that, in an action brought with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations in any jurisdiction, it shall be conclusively bound by the judgment in any such action by the Administrative Agent (wherever brought) against Borrower or its successors or assigns, as if Guarantor were a party to such action, even though Guarantor was not joined as a party in such action.
 
Guarantor agrees to pay all reasonable expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and disbursements) which may be incurred by the Administrative Agent or the Banks in connection with the enforcement of their rights under this Guaranty, whether or not suit is initiated.
(e)
                                 
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein (but subject to Section 6 hereof), this Guaranty shall terminate and be of no further force or effect upon the full performance and payment of the Guaranteed Obligations hereunder.  Upon termination of this Guaranty in accordance with the terms of this Guaranty, the Administrative Agent promptly shall deliver to Guarantor such documents as Guarantor or Guarantor's counsel reasonably may request in order to evidence such termination.
21.
                                
 
All of the Administrative Agent's and the Banks' rights and remedies under each of the Loan Documents or under this Guaranty are intended to be distinct, separate and cumulative and no such right or remedy therein or herein mentioned is intended to be in exclusion of or a waiver of any other right or remedy available to the Administrative Agent or any Bank.
22.
                                
 
No claim may be made by Guarantor or any other Person acting by or through Guarantor against the Administrative Agent or any Bank or the affiliates, directors, officers, employees, attorneys or agent of any of them for any consequential or punitive damages in respect of any claim for breach of contract or any other theory of liability arising out of or related to the transactions contemplated by this Guaranty or by the other Loan Documents, or any act, omission or event occurring in connection therewith; and Guarantor hereby
23.
                                
waives, releases and agrees not to sue upon any claim for any such damages, whether or not accrued and whether or not known or suspected to exist in its favor.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed and delivered this Guaranty as of the date and year first above written.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On March 29, 2005, before me personally came Mark J. Parrell, to me known to be the person who executed the foregoing instrument, and who, being duly sworn by me, did depose and say that he is first vice president and treasurer of Equity Residential, and that he executed the foregoing instrument in the organization's name, and that he had authority to sign the same, and he acknowledged to me that he executed the same as the act and deed of said organization for the uses and purposes therein mentioned.
