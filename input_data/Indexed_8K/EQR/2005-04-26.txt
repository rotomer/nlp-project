Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. On April 25, 2005, Equity Residential (the "Company") entered into a Second Amendment to the Amended and Restated Compensation Agreement (the "Second Amendment") with Samuel Zell, age 63, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Company. The Second Amendment increases the age - from 62 to 70 - after which Mr. Zell may retire from the Board and receive accelerated vesting on the restricted shares and unvested options awarded to him under his compensation agreement. On April 25, 2005, the Company also made a conforming change to its 2002 Share Incentive Plan and its predecessor plan (the "Plan Amendment"). Pursuant to the terms of the Company's 2002 Share Incentive Plan (the "Share Incentive Plan") and Mr. Zell's Amended and Restated Compensation Agreement dated March 5, 2003 (the "Compensation Agreement"), if Mr. Zell retired, he would be entitled to accelerated vesting on all restricted shares and options awarded pursuant to his Compensation Agreement. Mr. Zell has no present intention of resigning from the Board, but recognizes that the retirement age specified in his Compensation Agreement may appear to diminish his financial incentives for continued service on the Company's Board. Accordingly, the Company and Mr. Zell have amended the Compensation Agreement and the Company has amended the Share Incentive Plan to increase the age from 62 to 70 after which he may voluntarily resign and receive accelerated vesting of his restricted shares and unvested options.

Exhibit 99.1 Equity Residential Reports First Quarter Results CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 26, 2005--Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR) today reported results for the quarter ended March 31, 2005. All per share results are reported on a fully diluted basis. First Quarter 2005 For the quarter ended March 31, 2005, the company reported earnings of $0.74 per share compared to $0.35 per share in the first quarter of 2004. The quarterly increase is primarily attributable to $0.26 per share in higher gains on property sales and the previously announced $0.18 per share gain due to eBay Inc.'s acquisition of the company's ownership in Rent.com. The above amounts are partially offset by the previously announced $0.03 per share in higher executive compensation expense due to the 2006 planned retirement of Bruce W. Duncan, the company's President and CEO, and the resignation of Edward Geraghty, the company's former Eastern Division President, and additional accruals for certain management incentive programs that could increase as a result of the Rent.com gain. Funds from Operations (FFO) for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 were $0.74 per share compared to $0.52 per share in the same period of 2004. The increase is primarily attributable to the $0.18 per share associated with the Rent.com sale, $0.03 per share in higher incremental gains on sales of condominium units and $0.03 per share in higher gains on the sale of vacant land parcels, partially offset by the $0.03 per share in higher compensation expense. "In the first quarter we saw continuing improvement in our operating fundamentals which were in line with our expectations and should lead to strong performance for the next several years," said Bruce W. Duncan. "But the highlights of the quarter were the opportunities we seized to monetize value through the sale of Water Terrace, vacant land parcels and our interest in Rent.com. Capitalizing on these unique opportunities is just one way in which we demonstrate the value we create for our shareholders everyday." Total revenues from continuing operations for the quarter were $488.5 million compared to $439.0 million in the first quarter of 2004. The primary components of this $49.5 million increase in revenues include the properties acquired since January 1, 2004, the interests in the 15 development properties acquired in the first quarter of 2004 from the company's joint venture partners as well as the properties consolidated due to the adoption of FIN 46 effective March 31, 2004. "Same-Store" Results On a "same-store" first quarter to first quarter comparison, which includes 166,350 units, revenues increased 2.4 percent, expenses increased 4.8 percent and NOI increased 0.8 percent. On a sequential "same-store" comparison for these same 166,350 units from fourth quarter 2004 to first quarter 2005, revenues increased 0.9 percent, expenses increased 2.5 percent and NOI decreased 0.2 percent. Acquisitions/Dispositions During the first quarter of 2005, the company acquired nine properties, consisting of 2,232 units, for an aggregate purchase price of $284.2 million at an average capitalization (cap) rate of 5.6 percent and a vacant land parcel for $30.3 million. Also during the quarter, the company sold 10 properties, consisting of 2,674 units, for an aggregate sale price of $425.3 million at an average cap rate of 4.4 percent. In addition, the company sold 338 condominium units for $92.0 million and sold two vacant land parcels for $36.3 million. Second Quarter 2005 Results Equity Residential expects to announce second quarter 2005 results on Wednesday, July 27, 2005 and host a conference call to discuss those results at 10:00 a.m. CT that day. Equity Residential is the largest publicly traded apartment company in America. Nationwide, Equity Residential owns or has investments in 939 properties, in 32 states and the District of Columbia, consisting of 199,510 units.

Forward-Looking Statements The company lists parameters for 2005 results in the final page of this release. 2005 results will depend upon a slowdown in multifamily starts and economic recovery and job growth. The forward-looking statements contained in this news release regarding 2005 results are further subject to certain risks and uncertainties including, without limitation, the risks described under the heading "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and available on our website, www.equityresidential.com. This news release also contains forward-looking statements concerning development properties. The total number of units and cost of development and completion dates reflect the company's best estimates and are subject to uncertainties arising from changing economic conditions (such as costs of labor and construction materials), completion and local government regulation. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement forward-looking statements that become untrue because of subsequent events.

Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. The April 2002 White Paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from FFO for previously depreciated operating properties only. Once the Company commences the conversion of units to condominiums, it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property. (2) The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company, because it is a recognized measure of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. FFO in and of itself does not represent net income or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO should not be exclusively considered as an alternative to net income or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The Company's calculation of FFO may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies.
