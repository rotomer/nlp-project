Equity Residential today announced that its operating partnership, ERP Operating Limited Partnership (collectively with Equity Residential, the "Company") has entered into a contract dated June 17, 2005 with The Carlyle Group and Extell Development Company to acquire three high-rise apartment towers, currently known as Trump Place, located at 140, 160 and 180 Riverside Boulevard on the Upper West Side of Manhattan for approximately $816 million.  The properties, which were constructed between 1998 and 2003, consist of 1,325 apartment units totaling approximately 1.06 million square feet, approximately 40,000 square feet of retail space and 424 parking spaces.
 
This transaction is part of a larger transaction in which The Carlyle Group and Extell have agreed to purchase these properties and a large tract of developable land on Manhattan's Upper West Side from a consortium of Hong Kong investors and Donald J. Trump.
 
The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, as well as the closing of the larger transaction between The Carlyle Group, Extell and the Hong Kong consortium.  The Company anticipates closing in the third or fourth quarter of 2005.
