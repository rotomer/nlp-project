Exhibit 99.1 Equity Residential Reports Second Quarter Results CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 27, 2005--Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR) today reported results for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2005. All per share results are reported on a fully diluted basis. "Business continues to strengthen and the table is set for a strong second half of 2005 and a very good 2006," said Bruce W. Duncan, Equity Residential's CEO. Second Quarter 2005 For the quarter ended June 30, 2005, the company reported earnings of $0.44 per share compared to $0.39 per share in the second quarter of 2004. The quarterly increase is primarily attributable to $0.10 per share in higher gains on property and condominium sales, partially offset by $0.03 per share of higher interest expense and $0.01 per share of higher compensation expense related to the previously announced planned retirement of Bruce W. Duncan. Funds from Operations (FFO) for both the quarters ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 were $0.56 per share. Total revenues from continuing operations for the quarter were $499.5 million compared to $460.2 million in the second quarter of 2004. The primary components of this $39.3 million increase in revenues include the properties acquired since July 1, 2004 as well as an approximate $13.3 million increase in second quarter "same-store" revenues. Six Months Ended June 30, 2005 For the six months ended June 30, 2005, the company reported earnings of $1.19 per share compared to $0.74 per share in the same period of 2004. FFO for the six months ended June 30, 2005 were $1.30 per share compared to $1.08 per share in the same period of 2004. Total revenues from continuing operations for the six months ended June 30, 2005 were $981.4 million compared to $892.2 million in the same period of 2004. "Same-Store" Results On a "same-store" second quarter to second quarter comparison, which includes 168,385 units, revenues increased 3.0 percent, expenses increased 4.9 percent and net operating income (NOI) increased 1.8 percent. On a sequential "same-store" comparison for these same 168,385 units from first quarter 2005 to second quarter 2005, revenues increased 1.9 percent, expenses increased 1.4 percent and NOI increased 2.3 percent. On a "same-store" six-month to six-month comparison, which includes 162,598 units, revenues increased 2.7 percent, expenses increased 4.8 percent and NOI increased 1.3 percent. Acquisitions/Dispositions During the second quarter of 2005, the company acquired 11 properties, consisting of 2,642 units, for an aggregate purchase price of $445.6 million at an average capitalization (cap) rate of 5.6 percent and one land parcel for $15.0 million. Also during the quarter, the company sold 14 properties, consisting of 3,320 units, for an aggregate sale price of $218.7 million at an average cap rate of 5.9 percent. In addition, the company sold 434 condominium units for $106.4 million. In the first six months of 2005, the company acquired 20 properties, consisting of 4,874 units, for an aggregate purchase price of $729.8 million at an average cap rate of 5.6 percent and two land parcels for $45.3 million. Also during the first six months of 2005, the company sold 24 properties, consisting of 5,994 units, for an aggregate sale price of $644.0 million at an average cap rate of 4.9 percent. In addition, the company sold 772 condominium units and two land parcels for $198.3 million and $36.3 million, respectively.

Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. The April 2002 White Paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from FFO for previously depreciated operating properties only. Once the Company commences the conversion of units to condominiums, it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property. (2) The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company, because it is a recognized measure of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. FFO in and of itself does not represent net income or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO should not be exclusively considered as an alternative to net income or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The Company's calculation of FFO may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies.
