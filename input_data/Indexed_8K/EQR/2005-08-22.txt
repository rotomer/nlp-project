ITEM 8.01 Other Events
 
Equity Residential (the "Company") is re-issuing in an updated format its historical financial statements to satisfy SEC requirements as they relate to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 144, .
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
 
In compliance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144, the results of operations of the Company's consolidated properties that were sold during the first six months of 2005 were reported as a component of discontinued operations for each period presented (including the comparable period of the prior year) in the Company's second quarter 2005 quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August 8, 2005.  Under SEC requirements, the same reclassification as discontinued operations is required for previously issued annual financial statements for each of the three years shown in the Company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K, if those financial statements are incorporated by reference in subsequent filings with the SEC made under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, even though those financial statements relate to periods prior to the sale date.  These reclassifications have no effect on the Company's previously reported net income available to Common Shares or funds from operations ("FFO").
 
This report on Form 8-K updates Items 6, 7, 8 and 15 (Exhibit 12 only) of the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002 to reclassify those properties sold during the first six months of 2005 as a component of discontinued operations for each period presented in the annual report.  All other items of the Company's Form 10-K remain unchanged.  No attempt has been made to update matters in the Form 10-K except to the extent expressly provided above.
 
ITEM 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
Item 6.
          
Selected Financial Data
 
The following table sets forth selected financial and operating information on a historical basis for the Company.  The following information should be read in conjunction with all of the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 8-K.  The historical operating and balance sheet data have been derived from the historical financial statements of the Company.  All amounts have also been restated in accordance with the discontinued operations provisions of SFAS No. 144.  Certain capitalized terms as used herein are defined in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
 
(1)
      
The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") defines funds from operations ("FFO") (April 2002 White Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP")), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. The April 2002 White Paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from FFO for previously depreciated operating properties only.  Once the Company commences the conversion of units to condominiums, it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property.  See Item 7 for a reconciliation of net income to FFO.
 
(2)
      
The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company, because it is a recognized measure of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to different companies.  FFO in and of itself does not represent net income or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP.  Therefore, FFO should not be exclusively considered as an alternative to net income or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity.  The Company's calculation of FFO may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies.
 
Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
 
Overview
 
The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of the Company should be read in connection with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto. Due to the Company's ability to control the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries other than entities owning interests in the Unconsolidated Properties and certain other entities in which the Company has investments, the Operating Partnership and each such subsidiary entity has been consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes.  Capitalized terms used herein and not defined are as defined elsewhere in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004.
 
Forward-looking statements in this Item 7 as well as Item 1 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K are intended to be made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  The words "believes", "estimates", "expects" and "anticipates" and other similar expressions that are predictions of or indicate future events and trends and which do not relate solely to historical matters identify forward-looking statements.  Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results, performance, or achievements of the Company to differ materially from anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.  Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, the following:
 
The total number of development units, cost of development and completion dates as well as anticipated capital expenditures for replacements and building improvements all reflect the Company's best estimates and are subject to uncertainties arising from changing economic conditions (such as the cost of labor and construction materials), competition and local government regulation;
 - 
                 
Sources of capital to the Company or labor and materials required for maintenance, repair, capital expenditure or development are more expensive than anticipated;
 - 
                 
Occupancy levels and market rents may be adversely affected by national and local economic and market conditions including, without limitation, new construction of multifamily housing, slow employment growth, availability of low interest mortgages for single-family home buyers and the potential for geopolitical instability, all of which are beyond the Company's control; and
 - 
                 
Additional factors as discussed in Part I of the Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly those under "Risk Factors".
 - 
                 
Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof.  The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements, which may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.  Forward-looking statements and related uncertainties are also included in Note 5 and 11 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.
 
Results of Operations
 
The following table summarizes the number of properties and related units for the periods presented:
 
 
The Company's primary financial measure for evaluating each of its apartment communities is net operating income ("NOI").  The Company believes that NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the Company's apartment communities.
 
Properties that the Company owned for all of both 2004 and 2003 (the "2004 Same Store Properties"), which represented 162,201 units, impacted the Company's results of operations.  Properties that the Company owned for all of both 2003 and 2002 (the "2003 Same Store Properties"), which represented 171,841 units, also impacted the Company's results of operations.  Both the 2004 Same Store Properties and 2003 Same Store Properties are discussed in the following paragraphs.
 
The Company's acquisition, disposition, completed development and consolidation of previously unconsolidated property and variable interest entity activities also impacted overall results of operations
for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003.  The impacts of these activities are also discussed in greater detail in the following paragraphs.
 
Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2004 to the year ended December 31, 2003
 
For the year ended December 31, 2004, income from continuing operations decreased by approximately $12.9 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2003.  During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company established a reserve and recorded a corresponding expense of $15.2 million in estimated uninsured property damage at certain of its properties primarily located in Florida caused by Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne.  Of this amount, approximately $9.4 million had been spent for hurricane related repairs through December 31, 2004.
 
Revenues from the 2004 Same Store Properties increased $14.1 million primarily as a result of lower concessions provided residents and a slight increase in occupancy rates.  Expenses from the 2004 Same Store Properties increased $22.5 million primarily due to higher payroll, utility costs and real estate taxes.  The following tables provide comparative revenue, expense, NOI and weighted average occupancy for the 2004 Same Store Properties:
 
 
 
(1)  Results have not been updated to remove properties sold in the first six months of 2005.
 
(2)  December 2004 expenses exclude the uninsured property damage caused by Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan & Jeanne.
 
 
 
The following table presents a reconciliation of operating income per the consolidated statements of operations included in the original Form 10-K to NOI for the 2004 Same Store Properties (table has not been updated to reflect discontinued operations treatment for properties sold in the first six months of 2005).
 
For properties that the Company acquired prior to January 1, 2004 and expects to continue to own through December 31, 2005, the Company anticipates the following same store results for the full year ending December 31, 2005:
 
 
 
These 2005 assumptions are based on current expectations and are forward-looking.
 
million primarily as a result of revenue from newly acquired properties not yet included as 2004 Same Store Properties and the consolidation of all previously unconsolidated development projects.
Rental income from properties other than 2004 Same Store Properties increased by approximately $172.6
 
Fee and asset management revenues, net of fee and asset management expenses, decreased by $4.0 million primarily as a result of lower income earned from Ft. Lewis and managing fewer properties for third parties and unconsolidated entities.  As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company managed 17,988 units and 18,475 units, respectively, for third parties and unconsolidated entities.
 
Property management expenses include off-site expenses associated with the self-management of the Company's properties as well as management fees paid to any third party management companies.  These expenses increased by approximately $7.7 million or 11.1%.  This increase is primarily attributable to higher payroll costs, including bonuses and long-term compensation costs as well as severance costs for certain employees.  In addition, the property management company experienced slightly higher costs for travel, temporary help, internal conferences and legal and professional fees.
 
Depreciation expense, which includes depreciation on non-real estate assets, increased $64.0 million primarily as a result of the consolidation of previously unconsolidated projects and properties acquired after
December 31, 2003, many of which had significantly higher per unit acquisition costs than properties previously acquired, and also due to additional depreciation on capital expenditures for all properties owned.
 
General and administrative expenses, which include corporate operating expenses, increased approximately $12.2 million or 32.7% between the periods under comparison.  This increase was primarily due to the costs of consulting services rendered to increase operating efficiencies and increased litigation and internal control costs partially offset by $1.4 million of immediate expense recognition related to options granted in the first quarter of 2003 to the Company's former chief executive officer.   Consulting services were contracted to enhance resident satisfaction/retention, unit pricing and expense procurement/reduction.  The Company believes that these additional expenditures may be more than offset by increased rental revenues and/or reduced operating expenses in future years.  The Company also anticipates that general and administrative expenses will approximate $43.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005.  The above assumptions are based on current expectations and are forward-looking.
 
The Company recorded impairment charges on its technology investments of approximately $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.  See Note 19 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
 
million, primarily as a result of lower balances available for investments including deposits in tax deferred exchange accounts and collateral agreements related to development projects.
Interest and other income decreased approximately $6.6
 
Interest expense, including amortization of deferred financing costs, increased approximately $12.9 million.  This increase was primarily attributable to increases in mortgage and unsecured note balances and lower capitalized interest.  During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company capitalized interest costs of approximately $14.0 million as compared to $20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.  This capitalization of interest primarily related to equity investments in Partially Owned Properties (consolidated) engaged in development activities.  The effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended December 31, 2004 was 5.87% as compared to 6.36% for the year ended December 31, 2003.
 
Loss from investments in unconsolidated entities decreased approximately $2.8 million between the periods under comparison.  This decrease is primarily the result of consolidation of properties that were previously unconsolidated, partially offset by an increase in realized losses on the settlement of derivative instruments.
 
Net gain on sales of discontinued operations increased approximately $13.2 million between the periods under comparison.  This increase is primarily the result of an increase in the number of condominium units sold.
 
Discontinued operations, net, decreased approximately $51.3 million between the periods under comparison.  See Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
 
Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2003 to the year ended December 31, 2002
 
For the year ended December 31, 2003, income from continuing operations decreased by approximately $27.4 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2002.  This decrease was primarily attributable to increased operating expenses incurred including property management costs and depreciation.
 
Revenues from the 2003 Same Store Properties decreased by $38.2 million primarily as a result of lower overall physical occupancy, increased concessions and lower rental rates charged to both new and renewal residents.  Property operating expenses from the 2003 Same Store Properties increased by $36.3 million primarily due to higher payroll, maintenance, utility, real estate taxes, insurance, leasing
and advertising and building costs.  The following tables provide comparative revenue, expense, NOI and weighted average occupancy for the 2003 Same Store Properties:
 
 
 
 
million primarily as a result of revenue from newly acquired properties not yet included as 2003 Same Store Properties and additional Partially Owned Properties consolidated in the fourth quarter of 2002 and during the year ended December 31, 2003.
Rental income from properties other than 2003 Same Store Properties increased by approximately $47.5
 
Fee and asset management revenues, net of fee and asset management expenses, increased by $4.9 million primarily as a result of additional income allocated from Ft. Lewis.  As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company managed 18,475 units and 18,965 units, respectively, for third parties and unconsolidated entities.
 
Property management expenses include off-site expenses associated with the self-management of the Company's properties as well as management fees paid to any third party management companies.  These expenses decreased by approximately $4.5 million or 6.1%.  This decrease is primarily attributable to a reversal of a profit sharing accrual in the first quarter of 2003 related to the 2002 calendar year as the Company didn't achieve its stated goals and management elected not to make a discretionary contribution to the plan.  In addition, the Company recorded lower expense in connection with granting less restricted shares and reducing the expense associated with the Company's matched funding of its 401(k) plan during 2003 and not incurring an expense for 2003 discretionary profit sharing contributions.
 
Depreciation expense, which includes depreciation on non-real estate assets, increased $25.4 million primarily as a result of properties acquired after December 31, 2002, many of which had significantly higher per unit acquisition costs than properties previously acquired, and additional depreciation on capital expenditures for all properties owned.
 
General and administrative expenses, which include corporate operating expenses, decreased approximately $7.7 million between the periods under comparison.  This decrease was primarily due to lower expenses recorded in connection with granting less restricted shares to employees during 2003, partially offset by approximately a $2.6 million increase related to the Company's decision to begin to expense its stock based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and its amendment (SFAS No. 148).  In addition, lower state income and franchise taxes also contributed to this decrease.
The Company recorded impairment charges on its technology investments and its corporate housing business of approximately $1.2 million and $18.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  See Note 19 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
 
million, primarily as a result of higher cash balances available for short-term investments throughout 2003.
Interest and other income increased by approximately $0.9
 
Interest expense, including amortization of deferred financing costs, decreased approximately $4.1 million primarily due to lower variable interest rates and lower overall levels of debt.  During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company capitalized interest costs of approximately $20.6 million as compared to $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002.  This capitalization of interest primarily related to equity investments in unconsolidated entities engaged in development activities.  The effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended December 31, 2003 was 6.36% as compared to 6.54% for the year ended December 31, 2002.
 
Loss from investments in unconsolidated entities increased approximately $6.4 million between the periods under comparison.  This increase is primarily the result of increased operating losses from equity investments partially offset by unrealized gains on derivative instruments.
 
Net gain on sales of discontinued operations increased approximately $206.4 million between the periods under comparison.  This increase is primarily the result of a greater number of properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2003, as well as the fact that several properties had lower net carrying values at sale.
 
Discontinued operations, net, decreased approximately $56.5 million between the periods under comparison.  See Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
For the Year Ended December 31, 2004

In June 2003, the Operating Partnership filed and the SEC declared effective a Form S-3 registration statement to register $2.0 billion of debt securities.  In addition, the Operating Partnership carried over $280.0 million related to a prior registration statement.  As of February 2, 2005, $1.48 billion in debt securities remained available for issuance under this registration statement.

The Company's "Consolidated Debt-to-Total Market Capitalization Ratio" as of December 31, 2004 is presented in the following table.  The Company calculates the equity component of its market capitalization as the sum of (i) the total outstanding Common Shares and assumed conversion of all OP Units at the equivalent market value of the closing price of the Company's Common Shares on the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) the "Common Share Equivalent" of all convertible preferred shares and preference interests/units; and (iii) the liquidation value of all perpetual preferred shares and preference interests outstanding.
 
 
 
The Company's policy is to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt-to-total market capitalization of less than 50%.
 
From January 1, 2005 through February 7, 2005, the Company:
 
Acquired four properties consisting of 734 units and one parcel of vacant land for approximately $144.1 million;

Capitalization of Fixed Assets and Improvements to Real Estate
 
Our policy with respect to capital expenditures is generally to capitalize expenditures that improve the value of the property or extend the useful life of the component asset of the property.  We track improvements to real estate in two major categories and several subcategories:
 
Replacements.  These include:
 - 
            
(inside the unit)
carpets and hardwood floors;
 - 
                 
appliances;
 - 
                 
mechanical equipment such as individual furnace/air units, hot water heaters, etc;
 - 
                 
furniture and fixtures such as kitchen/bath cabinets, light fixtures, ceiling fans, sinks, tubs, toilets, mirrors, countertops, etc;
 - 
                 
flooring such as vinyl, linoleum or tile; and
 - 
                 
blinds/shades.
 - 
                 
 
All replacements are depreciated over a five-year estimated useful life.  We expense as incurred all maintenance and turnover costs such as cleaning, interior painting of individual units and the repair of any replacement item noted above.
 
Building improvements ().  These include:
 - 
            
outside the unit
roof replacement and major repairs;
 - 
                 
paving or major resurfacing of parking lots, curbs and sidewalks;
 - 
                 
amenities and common areas such as pools, exterior sports and playground equipment, lobbies, clubhouses, laundry rooms, alarm and security systems and offices;
 - 
                 
major building mechanical equipment systems;
 - 
                 
interior and exterior structural repair and exterior painting and siding;
 - 
                 
major landscaping and grounds improvement; and
 - 
                 
vehicles and office and maintenance equipment.
 - 
                 
 
All building improvements are depreciated over a five to ten-year estimated useful life.  We expense as incurred all recurring expenditures that do not improve the value of the asset or extend its useful life.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2004, our actual improvements to real estate totaled approximately $212.2 million.  This includes the following detail (amounts in thousands except for unit and per unit amounts):
Total units exclude 16,218 unconsolidated units.
(1)

Derivative Instruments
 
In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes.  The Company limits these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments.
The Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors.  When viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge, the Company has not sustained a material loss from those instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives.
 
See Note 11in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments at December 31, 2004.
 
Other
 
Minority Interests as of December 31, 2004 decreased by $65.3 million when compared to December 31, 2003.  The primary factors that impacted this account in the Company's consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets during the year ended December 31, 2004 were:
 
Distributions declared to Minority Interests, which amounted to $35.9 million (excluding Junior Preference Unit and Preference Interest distributions);
 - 
                 
The allocation of income from operations to holders of OP Units in the amount of $31.2 million;
 - 
                 
The issuance of 306,694 OP Units to various limited partners at an average price of $29.63 per unit;
 - 
                 
The redemption of 800,000 Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preference Interests with a liquidation value of $40.0 million and a premium on redemption of $1.1 million (see Note 3 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion);
 - 
                 
The issuance of Common Shares; and
 - 
                 
The conversion of 1.7 million OP Units into Common Shares valued at $36.9 million at an average price of $21.16 per unit.
 - 
                 
 
Total distributions paid in January 2005 amounted to $144.1 million (excluding distributions on Partially Owned Properties), which included certain distributions declared during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2004.
 
The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements, including capital expenditures related to maintaining its existing properties and certain scheduled unsecured note and mortgage note repayments, generally through its working capital, net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under its line of credit.  The Company considers its cash provided by operating activities to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payments of distributions.  The Company also expects to meet its long-term liquidity requirements, such as scheduled unsecured note and mortgage debt maturities, property acquisitions, financing of construction and development activities and capital improvements through the issuance of unsecured notes and equity securities, including additional OP Units, and proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties.  In addition, the Company has significant unencumbered properties available to secure additional mortgage borrowings in the event that the public capital markets are unavailable or the cost of alternative sources of capital is too high.  The fair value of and cash flow from these unencumbered properties are in excess of the requirements the Company must maintain in order to comply with covenants under its unsecured notes and line of credit.  Of the $14.9 billion in investment in real estate on the Company's balance sheet at December 31, 2004, $9.5 billion or 63.8%, was unencumbered.
 
  This facility matures in May 2005 and may, among other potential uses, be used to fund property acquisitions, costs for certain properties under development and short term liquidity requirements.  As of March 1, 2005, $135.0million was outstanding under this facility (and $51.0 million was restricted and dedicated to support letters of credit).
The Operating Partnership has a revolving credit facility with potential borrowings of up to $700.0 million. 
The Operating Partnership is currently negotiating a new credit facility to replace or expand its existing facility and fully expects to obtain this at current or improved terms in March or April 2005.
 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations
 
The Company has co-invested in various properties that are unconsolidated and accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  Management does not believe these investments have a materially different impact upon the Company's liquidity, capital resources, credit or market risk than its property management and ownership activities.  The nature and business purpose of these ventures are as follows:
 
 - 
                       
Institutional Ventures  During 2000 and 2001, the Company entered into ventures with an unaffiliated partner.   At the respective closing dates, the Company sold and/or contributed 45 properties containing 10,846 units to these ventures and retained a 25% ownership interest in the ventures.  The Company's joint venture partner contributed cash equal to 75% of the agreed-upon equity value of the properties comprising the ventures, which was then distributed to the Company. The Company's strategy with respect to these ventures was to reduce its concentration of properties in a variety of markets.
 
 - 
                       
Lexford/Other  As of December 31, 2004, the Company has ownership interests in twelve properties containing 1,571 units acquired in a prior merger.  The current weighted average ownership percentage is 11.0%.  The Company's strategy with respect to these interests is either to acquire a majority ownership or sell the Company's interest.
 
As of December 31, 2004, the Company has five projects totaling 1,306 units in various stages of development with estimated completion dates ranging through September 30, 2006.  The three development agreements currently in place have the following key terms:
 
The first development partner has the right, at any time following completion of a project subject to the agreement, to stipulate a value for such project and offer to sell its interest in the project to the Company based on such value.  If the Company chooses not to purchase the interest, the Company must agree to a sale of the project to an unrelated third party at such value.  The Company's partner must exercise this right as to all projects subject to the agreement within five years after the receipt of the final certificate of occupancy on the last developed property.   In connection with this development partner, the Company has an obligation to provide up to $40.0 million in credit enhancements to guarantee a portion of the third party construction financing.  As of February 2, 2005, the Company had set-aside $5.0 million towards this credit enhancement.  The Company would be required to perform under this agreement only if there was a material default under a third party construction mortgage agreement.  This agreement expires no later than December 31, 2018.  Notwithstanding the termination of the agreement, the Company shall have recourse against its development partner for any losses incurred.
 - 
                       
 
The second development partner has the right, at any time following completion of a project subject to the agreement, to require the Company to purchase the partners' interest in that project at a mutually agreeable price.  If the Company and the partner are unable to agree on a price, both parties will obtain appraisals.  If the appraised values vary by more than 10%, both the Company and its partner will agree on a third appraiser to determine which original appraisal is closest to its determination of value.  The Company may elect at that time not to purchase the property and instead, authorize its partner to sell the project at or above the agreed-upon value to an unrelated third party.  Five years following the receipt of the final certificate of occupancy on the last developed property, the Company must purchase, at the agreed-upon price, any projects remaining unsold.
 - 
                       
 
The third development partner has the exclusive right for six months following stabilization, as defined, to market a subject project for sale.  Thereafter, either the Company or its development
 - 
                       
partner may market a subject project for sale. If the Company's development partner proposes the sale, the Company may elect to purchase the project at the price proposed by its partner or defer the sale until two independent appraisers appraise the project.  If the two appraised values vary by more than 5%, a third appraiser will be chosen to determine the fair market value of the property.  Once a value has been determined, the Company may elect to purchase the property or authorize its development partner to sell the project at the agreed-upon value.
 
See Note 6 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding the Company's investments in unconsolidated entities.
 
In connection with one of its mergers, the Company provided a guaranty of a credit enhancement agreement with respect to certain tax-exempt bonds issued to finance certain public improvements at a multifamily development project.  The Company has the obligation to provide this guaranty for a period of eight years from the consummation of the merger or through May 2005.  The Company would be required to perform under this guaranty only if there was a draw on the letter of credit issued by the credit enhancement party.  The counterparty has also indemnified the Company for any losses suffered.  As of February 2, 2005, this guaranty was still in effect at a commitment amount of $10.4 million and no current outstanding liability.
 
The following table summarizes the Company's contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter as of December 31, 2004:
 
 
Amounts include aggregate principal payments only.  The Company paid $348,574, $352,391 and $365,782 for interest on debt, inclusive of derivative instruments, for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
 
The Company's significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  These policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended December 31, 2004.
 
The Company has identified six significant accounting policies as critical accounting policies.  These critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant judgments and estimates.  With respect to these critical
accounting policies, management believes that the application of judgments and assessments is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented.  The six critical accounting policies are:
 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Including Goodwill
 
The Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets, including its investments in real estate and goodwill, for indicators of permanent impairment.  The judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance, market conditions, expected holding period of each asset and legal and environmental concerns.  Future events could occur which would cause the Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted.
 
Depreciation of Investment in Real Estate
 
The Company depreciates the building component of its investment in real estate over a 30-year estimated useful life, building improvements over a 5-year to 10-year estimated useful life and both the furniture, fixtures and equipment and replacements components over a 5-year estimated useful life, all of which are judgmental determinations.
 
Cost Capitalization
 
See the section for discussion of the policy with respect to capitalization vs. expensing of fixed asset/repair and maintenance costs.  In addition, the Company capitalizes the payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on the supervision of major capital and/or renovation projects.  These costs are reflected on the balance sheet as an increase to depreciable property.
Capitalization of Fixed Assets and Improvements to Real Estate
 
The Company follows the guidance in SFAS No. 67, , for all development projects and uses its professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred.  The Company capitalizes, through the date the certificates of occupancy ("CO") are issued (CO's are deemed final within 90 days of issuance), interest, real estate taxes and insurance and payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on development activities.  These costs are reflected on the balance sheet as construction in progress for each specific property.  The Company expenses as incurred all payroll costs of on-site employees working directly at our properties, except as noted above on our development properties prior to certificate of occupancy issuance and on specific major renovation at selected properties when additional incremental employees are hired.
Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects
 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments, Including Derivative Instruments
 
The valuation of financial instruments under SFAS No. 107 and SFAS No. 133 and its amendments (SFAS Nos. 137/138/149) requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments.  The Company, where possible, bases the fair values of its financial instruments, including its derivative instruments, on listed market prices and third party quotes. Where these are not available, the Company bases its estimates on other factors relevant to the financial instruments.
 
Revenue Recognition
 
Rental income attributable to leases is recorded when due from residents and is recognized monthly as it is earned, which is not materially different than on a straight-line basis.  Leases entered into between a resident and a property for the rental of an apartment unit are generally year-to-year, renewable
upon consent of both parties on an annual or monthly basis.  Fee and asset management revenue and interest income are recorded on an accrual basis.
 
Stock-Based Compensation
 
he Company had chosen to account for its stock-based compensation in accordance with APB No. 25, ,which resulted in no compensation expense for options issued with an exercise price equal to or exceeding the market value of the Company's Common Shares on the date of grant (intrinsic method).  The Company elected to account for its stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and its amendment (SFAS No. 148), , effective in the first quarter of 2003, which resulted in compensation expense being recorded based on the fair value of the stock compensation granted.
Prior to 2003, t
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
Accounting for Stock Based Compensation
 
SFAS No. 148 provides three transition methods for entities that adopt the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123.  The Company elected the "Prospective Method" which requires expensing of employee awards granted or modified after January 1, 2003.  Compensation expense under all of the Company's plans is generally recognized over periods ranging from three months to five years.  See Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion and comparative information regarding application of the fair value method to all outstanding employee awards.
 
Funds From Operations
 
For the year ended December 31, 2004, Funds From Operations ("FFO") available to Common Shares and OP Units increased $11.4 million, or 1.8%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. For the year ended December 31, 2003, FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units decreased $78.9 million, or 11.0%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002.
 
The following is a reconciliation of net income to FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002:
 
(1)
                
The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") defines funds from operations ("FFO") (April 2002 White Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP)), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis.  The April 2002 White Paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from FFO for previously depreciated operating properties only.  Once the Company commences the conversion of units to condominiums, it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property.
 
(2)
                
The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company, because it is a recognized measure of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to different companies.  FFO in and of itself does not represent net income or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP.  Therefore, FFO should not be exclusively considered as an alternative to net income or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity.  The Company's calculation of FFO may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies.

To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders
Equity Residential
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Equity Residential (the "Company") as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004.  Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index to the financial statements and schedule.  These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Equity Residential at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
 
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for variable interest entities in 2004 and changed its method of accounting for stock-based compensation in 2003.
 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Equity Residential's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28, 2005 (not provided herein) expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.             Business
 
Equity Residential ("EQR"), formed in March 1993, is a fully integrated real estate company engaged in the acquisition, development, ownership, management and operation of multifamily properties.  EQR has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT").
 
EQR is the general partner of, and as of December 31, 2004 owned an approximate 93.3% ownership interest in ERP Operating Limited Partnership, an Illinois limited partnership (the "Operating Partnership").   The Company is structured as an umbrella partnership REIT ("UPREIT"), under which all property ownership and business operations are conducted through the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries.  References to the "Company" include EQR, the Operating Partnership and each of the partnerships, limited liability companies and corporations controlled by the Operating Partnership and/or EQR.
 
As of December 31, 2004, the Company, directly or indirectly through investments in title holding entities, owned all or a portion of 939properties in 32 states and the District of Columbia consisting of 200,149 units.  The ownership breakdown includes:
 
 
The "Wholly Owned Properties" are accounted for under the consolidation method of accounting.  The Company beneficially owns 100% fee simple title to 841 of the 842 Wholly Owned Properties.  The Company owns the building and improvements and leases the land underlying the improvements under a long-term ground lease that expires in 2026 for one property.  This one property is consolidated and reflected as a real estate asset while the ground lease is accounted for as an operating lease in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 13, .
Accounting for Leases
 
The "Partially Owned Properties" are controlled by the Company but have partners with minority interests and are accounted for under the consolidation method of accounting.  The "Unconsolidated Properties" are partially owned but not controlled by the Company.  With the exception of one property, the Unconsolidated Properties consist of investments in partnership interests and/or subordinated mortgages that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  The remaining one property consists of an investment in a limited liability company that, as a result of the terms of the operating agreement, is accounted for as a management contract right with all fees recognized as fee and asset management revenue.  The above table does not include various uncompleted development properties.

been consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes.  Effective March 31, 2004, the consolidated financial statements also include all variable interest entities for which the Company is the primary beneficiary.
Due to the Company's ability as general partner to control either through ownership or by contract the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries, other than entities that own controlling interests in the Unconsolidated Properties and certain other entities in which the Company has investments, the Operating Partnership and each such subsidiary has
The Company's mergers and acquisitions were accounted for as purchases in accordance with either Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 16, , or SFAS No. 141, .  The fair value of the consideration given by the Company in the mergers were used as the valuation basis for each of the combinations.  The accompanying consolidated statements of operations and cash flows include the results of the properties purchased through the mergers and through acquisitions from their respective closing dates.
Business Combinations
Business Combinations
SFAS No. 141 requires all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.
 
Real Estate Assets and Depreciation of Investment in Real Estate
 
The Company allocates the purchase price of properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 141.  In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, the Company utilizes a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property, our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio, and other market data.  The Company also considers information obtained about each property as a result of its pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired.  The Company allocates the purchase price of acquired real estate to various components as follows:
 
Land  Based on actual purchase price if acquired separately or market research/comparables if acquired with an operating property.
 - 
                 
Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment  Ranges between $1,500 and $3,000 per apartment unit acquired as an estimate of the fair value of the appliances & fixtures inside a unit.  The per-unit amount applied depends on the type of apartment building acquired.  Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of five years.
 - 
                 
In-Place Leases  The Company considers the value of acquired in-place leases that meet the definition outlined in SFAS No. 141, paragraph 37.  The amortization period is the average remaining term of each respective in-place acquired lease.
 - 
                 
Other Intangible Assets  The Company considers whether it has acquired other intangible assets that meet the definition outlined in SFAS No. 141, paragraph 39, including any customer relationship intangibles.  The amortization period is the estimated useful life of the acquired intangible asset.
 - 
                 
Building  Based on the fair value determined on an "as-if vacant" basis.  Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of thirty years.
 - 
                 
 
Replacements inside a unit such as appliances and carpeting are depreciated over a five-year estimated useful life.  Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred and significant renovations and improvements that improve and/or extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized over their estimated useful life, generally five to ten years.  Initial direct leasing costs are expensed as incurred as such expense approximates the deferral and amortization of initial direct leasing costs over the lease terms.  Property sales or dispositions are recorded when title transfers and sufficient consideration has been received by the Company.  Upon disposition, the related costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts.  Any gain or loss on sale is recognized in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
 
The Company classifies real estate assets as real estate held for disposition when it is certain a property will be disposed of in accordance with SFAS No. 144 (see further discussion below).
 
The Company classifies properties under development and/or expansion and properties in the lease up phase (including land) as construction in progress until construction has been completed and all certificates of occupancy permits have been obtained.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Including Goodwill
 
In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 142, .  SFAS No. 142 prohibits the amortization of goodwill and requires that goodwill be reviewed for impairment at least annually.  In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144,   SFAS Nos. 142 and 144 were effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001.  The Company adopted these standards effective January 1, 2002.  See Notes 13 and 19 for further discussion.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.
 
The Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets, including its investments in real estate and goodwill, for indicators of permanent impairment.  The judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance, market conditions, expected holding period of each asset and legal and environmental concerns.  Future events could occur which would cause the Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted.
 
or long-lived assets to be held and used, the Company compares the expected future undiscounted cash flows for the long-lived asset against the carrying amount of that asset.  If the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, the Company further analyzes each individual asset for other temporary or permanent indicators of impairment.  An impairment loss would be recorded for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying amount of the asset if the Company deems this difference to be permanent.
F
 
For long-lived assets to be disposed of, an impairment loss is recognized when the estimated fair value of the asset, less the estimated cost to sell, is less than the carrying amount of the asset measured at the time that the Company has determined it will sell the asset.  Long-lived assets held for disposition and the related liabilities are separately reported at the lower of their carrying amounts or their estimated fair values, less their costs to sell, and are not depreciated after reclassification to real estate held for disposition.
 
Cost Capitalization
 
See the section for discussion of the policy with respect to capitalization vs. expensing of fixed asset/repair and maintenance costs.  In addition, the Company capitalizes the payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on the supervision of major capital and/or renovation projects.  These costs are reflected on the balance sheet as an increase to depreciable property.
Real Estate Assets and Depreciation of Investment in Real Estate
 
The Company follows the guidance in SFAS No. 67, , for all development projects and uses its professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred.  The Company capitalizes, through the date the certificates of occupancy ("CO") are issued (CO's are deemed final within 90 days of issuance), interest, real estate taxes and insurance and payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on development activities.  These costs are reflected on the balance sheet as construction in progress for each specific property.  The Company expenses as incurred all payroll costs of on-site employees working directly at our properties, except as noted above on our development properties prior to certificate of occupancy issuance and on specific major renovation at selected properties when additional incremental employees are hired.
Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects
Cash and Cash Equivalents
 
The Company considers all demand deposits, money market accounts and investments in certificates of deposit and repurchase agreements purchased with a maturity of three months or less, at the date of purchase, to be cash equivalents.  The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions.  The combined account balances at one or more institutions typically exceed the Federal Depository Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") insurance coverage, and, as a result, there is a concentration of credit risk related to amounts on deposit in excess of FDIC insurance coverage.  The Company believes that the risk is not significant, as the Company does not anticipate the financial institutions' non-performance.
 
Deferred Financing Costs
 
Deferred financing costs include fees and costs incurred to obtain the Company's line of credit and long-term financings.  These costs are amortized over the terms of the related debt.  Unamortized financing costs are written-off when debt is retired before the maturity date.  The accumulated amortization of such deferred financing costs was $18.1 million and $16.0 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments, Including Derivative Instruments
 
The valuation of financial instruments under SFAS No. 107, , and SFAS No. 133 and its amendments (SFAS Nos. 137/138/149), , requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments.  The Company, where possible, bases the fair values of its financial instruments, including its derivative instruments, on listed market prices and third party quotes. Where these are not available, the Company bases its estimates on other factors relevant to the financial instruments.
Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
 
In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes.  The Company limits these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments.
 
The Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors.  When viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge, the Company has not sustained a material loss from those instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives.
 
On January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133 and its amendments (SFAS Nos. 137/138/149), which requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and to measure those instruments at fair value.  Additionally, the fair value adjustments will affect either shareholders' equity or net income depending on whether the derivative instruments qualify as a hedge for accounting purposes and, if so, the nature of the hedging activity.  When the terms of an underlying transaction are modified, or when the underlying transaction is terminated or completed, all changes in the fair value of the instrument are marked-to-market with changes in value included in net income each period until the instrument matures.  Any derivative instrument used for risk management that does not meet the hedging criteria of SFAS No. 133 is marked-to-market each period.  The Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
 
The fair values of the Company's financial instruments, other than derivative instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, mortgage notes payable, other notes payable, line of credit and other financial instruments, approximate their carrying or contract values.
Revenue Recognition
 
Rental income attributable to leases is recorded when due from residents and is recognized monthly as it is earned, which is not materially different than on a straight-line basis.  Leases entered into between a resident and a property, for the rental of an apartment unit, are generally year-to-year, renewable upon consent of both parties on an annual or monthly basis.  Fee and asset management revenue and interest income are recorded on an accrual basis.
 
Stock-Based Compensation
 
he Company had chosen to account for its stock-based compensation in accordance with APB No. 25, ,which resulted in no compensation expense for options issued with an exercise price equal to or exceeding the market value of the Company's Common Shares on the date of grant (intrinsic method).  The Company elected to account for its stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and its amendment (SFAS No. 148), , effective in the first quarter of 2003, which resulted in compensation expense being recorded based on the fair value of the stock compensation granted.
Prior to 2003, t
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
Accounting for Stock Based Compensation
 
The Company elected the "Prospective Method" which requires expensing of employee awards granted or modified after January 1, 2003.  Compensation expense under all of the Company's plans is generally recognized over periods ranging from three months to five years.  The cost related to stock-based employee compensation included in the determination of net income for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 is less than that which would have been recognized if the fair value based method had been applied to all awards since the original effective date of SFAS No. 123.
 
The Company will adopt SFAS No. 123(R), as required effective July 1, 2005.   The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) will have a material effect on its consolidated statements of operations or financial position.
Share-Based Payment,
 
The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the fair value based method had been applied to all outstanding and unvested awards in each period presented:
 
(1)
           
Share options for the year ended December 31, 2003 included $1.4 million of expense recognition related to options granted in the first quarter of 2003 to the Company's former chief executive officer.  These options vested immediately upon grant.
 
The fair value of the option grants as computed under SFAS No. 123 would be recognized over the vesting period of the options.  The fair value for the Company's share options was estimated at the time the share options were granted using the Black Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:
 
 
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.  In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because the Company's share options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management's opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its share options.
Income Taxes
 
Due to the structure of the Company as a REIT and the nature of the operations of the properties and management business, the results of operations do not contain a provision for federal income taxes. The Company is subject to certain state and local income, excise and franchise taxes.  The aggregate cost of land and depreciable property for federal income tax purposes as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 was approximately $9.3 billion and $8.5 billion, respectively.
 
The Company has elected Taxable REIT Subsidiary ("TRS") status for certain of its corporate subsidiaries.  The federal income taxes for these TRS entities were not material during 2004, 2003 or 2002 and were recognized as general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
 
During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company's tax treatment of dividends and distributions were as follows:
 
 
Minority Interests
 
Operating Partnership:  Net income is allocated to minority interests based on their respective ownership percentage of the Operating Partnership.  The ownership percentage is calculated by dividing the number of units of limited partnership interest ("OP Units") held by the minority interests by the total OP Units held by the minority interests and EQR.  Issuance of additional common shares of beneficial interest, $0.01 par value per share (the "Common Shares"), and OP Units changes the ownership interests of both the minority interests and EQR.  Such transactions and the proceeds therefrom are treated as capital transactions.
 
Partially Owned Properties:  The Company reflects minority interests in partially owned properties on the balance sheet for the portion of properties consolidated by the Company that are not wholly owned by the Company.  The earnings or losses from those properties attributable to the minority interests are reflected as minority interests in partially owned properties in the consolidated statements of operations.
 
U
se of Estimates
 
In preparation of the Company's financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Reclassifications
 
Certain reclassifications considered necessary for a fair presentation have been made to the prior period financial statements in order to conform to the current year presentation.  These reclassifications have not changed the results of operations or shareholders' equity.
 
Other
 
The Company adopted FASB Interpretation ("FIN") No. 46, as required, effective March 31, 2004.  The adoption required the consolidation of all previously unconsolidated development projects.  FIN No. 46 requires the Company to consolidate the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the activities of a variable interest entity, which for the Company includes only its development partnerships, if the Company is entitled to receive a majority of the entity's residual returns and/or is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from such entity's activities.  As of the original formation of the respective joint ventures, the Company is considered to be the primary beneficiary and the fair value of the assets, liabilities and non-controlling interests of these development projects approximates carryover basis.  Due to the March 31, 2004 effective date, the Company has only consolidated the results of operations beginning April 1, 2004.  The adoption of FIN No. 46 did not have any effect on net income as the aggregate results of operations of these development properties were previously included in loss from investments in unconsolidated entities.  See Note 4 for additional discussion.
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,
 
The Company generally contributes between 25% and 35% of the project cost of the joint venture projects under development (constituting 100% of the equity), with the remaining cost financed through third-party construction mortgages.  Voting rights are shared equally between the Company and its respective development partners and accordingly, these projects were accounted for under the equity method prior to the adoption of FIN No. 46.
 
In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, .  SFAS No. 150 establishes standards for classifying and measuring as liabilities certain financial instruments that embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity.  On November 7, 2003, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 150-3, which deferred for an indefinite period the classification and measurement provisions, but not the disclosure provisions (see discussion below), of SFAS No. 150 as it relates to noncontrolling interests that are classified as equity in the financial statements of a subsidiary but would be classified as a liability in the parent's financial statements under SFAS No. 150 (e.g., minority interests in consolidated limited-life subsidiaries).  The Company does not have any mandatorily redeemable preferred shares/units that fall within the scope of SFAS No. 150.
Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity
 
With regards to the aforementioned disclosure provisions, the Company is presently the controlling partner in various consolidated partnerships consisting of 39 properties and 7,220 units having a minority interest book value of $9.6 million at December 31, 2004. These partnerships contain provisions that require the partnerships to be liquidated through the sale of its assets upon reaching a date specified in each respective partnership agreement.  The Company, as controlling partner, has an obligation to cause the property owning partnerships to distribute proceeds of liquidation to the Minority Interests in these Partially Owned Properties only to the extent that the net proceeds received by the partnerships from the sale of its assets warrant a distribution based on the partnership agreements.  As of December 31, 2004, the Company estimates the value of Minority Interest distributions would have been approximately $111.3 million ("Settlement Value") had the partnerships been liquidated.  This Settlement Value is based on estimated third party consideration realized by the partnerships upon disposition of the Partially Owned Properties and is net of all other assets and liabilities, including yield maintenance on the mortgages encumbering the properties, that would have been due on December 31, 2004 had those
mortgages been prepaid.  Due to, among other things, the inherent uncertainty in the sale of real estate assets, the amount of any potential distribution to the Minority Interests in the Company's Partially Owned Properties is subject to change.  To the extent that the partnerships' underlying assets are worth less than the underlying liabilities, the Company has no obligation to remit any consideration to the Minority Interests in Partially Owned Properties.
 
On July 31, 2003, the SEC clarified its position with respect to Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Topic D-42, .  Under the SEC's revised interpretation, in connection with the redemption of preferred shares/units, the original issuance costs of these shares/units must be treated in a manner similar to preferred distributions and deducted from net income in arriving at net income available to Common Shares.  The clarification of EITF Topic D-42 was required to be adopted effective July 1, 2003 on a retroactive basis by restating prior periods included in the current financial statements.  The Company recorded an $8.3 million cash premium and $11.9 million in original issuance costs as a premium on the redemption of its Series G Preferred Shares in December 2003.  In addition, the Company recorded $1.1 million in original issuance costs as a premium on the redemption of its Series A Preference Interests in September 2004.  The Company had no recorded original issuance costs associated with, nor did it incur any cash redemption premium upon redemption of, its Series L Preferred Shares redeemed in 2003.
The Effect on the Calculation of Earnings per Share for the Redemption or Induced Conversion of Preferred Stock
 
In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, .  SFAS No. 145, among other items, rescinds the automatic classification of costs incurred on debt extinguishment as extraordinary charges.  Instead, gains and losses from debt extinguishment should only be classified as extraordinary if they meet the "unusual and infrequently occurring" criteria outlined in APB No. 30.  SFAS No. 145 is effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002.  The Company adopted the standard effective January 1, 2003.Prior period gains/losses have been reclassified to a component of interest expense.

Shareholders' Equity and Minority Interests
 
The following tables present the changes in the Company's issued and outstanding Common Shares and OP Units for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002:
 
In February 1998, the Company filed and the SEC declared effective a Form S-3 Registration Statement to register $1.0 billion of equity securities.  In addition, the Company carried over $272.4 million related to a prior registration statement.  As of December 31, 2004, $956.5 million in equity securities remained available for issuance under this registration statement.
 
During October 2002, the Company repurchased 5,092,300 of its Common Shares on the open market at an average price of $22.58 per share.  The Company paid approximately $115.0 million for these shares, which were retired subsequent to the repurchase.
 
The equity positions of various individuals and entities that contributed their properties to the Operating Partnership in exchange for a partnership interest are collectively referred to as the "Minority Interests  Operating Partnership".  Subject to certain restrictions, the Minority Interests  Operating Partnership may exchange their OP Units for EQR Common Shares on a one-for-one basis.   These OP Units are classified as Minority Interests  Operating Partnership in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Net proceeds from the Company's Common Share and Preferred Share (see definition below) offerings are contributed by the Company to the Operating Partnership.  In return for those contributions, EQR receives a number of OP Units in the Operating Partnership equal to the number of Common Shares it has issued in the equity offering (or in the case of a preferred equity offering, a number of preference units in the Operating Partnership equal in number and having the same terms as the Preferred Shares issued in the equity offering).  As a result, the net offering proceeds from Common Shares are allocated between shareholders' equity and Minority Interests  Operating Partnership to account for the change in their respective percentage ownership of the underlying equity of the Operating Partnership.
 
The Company's declaration of trust authorizes the Company to issue up to 100,000,000 preferred shares of beneficial interest, $0.01 par value per share (the "Preferred Shares"), with specific rights, preferences and other attributes as the Board of Trustees may determine, which may include preferences, powers and rights that are senior to the rights of holders of the Company's Common Shares.
 
The following table presents the Company's issued and outstanding Preferred Shares as of December 31, 2004 and 2003:
 
On or after the redemption date, redeemable preferred shares (Series B, C, D, K and N) may be redeemed for cash at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the liquidation price per share, plus accrued and unpaid distributions, if any.
(1)
              
 
On or after the redemption date, convertible preferred shares (Series E & H) may be redeemed under certain circumstances at the option of the Company for cash or Common Shares, in whole or in part, at various redemption prices per share based upon the contractual conversion rate, plus accrued and unpaid distributions, if any.

On June 19, 2003, the Company issued 600,000 Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares in a public offering.  The Company received $145.3 million in net proceeds from this offering after payment of the underwriters' fee.
 
On December 26, 2003, the Company redeemed the remaining outstanding Series G Convertible Cumulative Preferred Shares for cash consideration of $295.3 million, which included the liquidation value of $287.0 million and a cash redemption premium of $8.3 million.  The Company recorded the $8.3 million cash redemption premium along with the write-off of $11.9 million in original issuance costs as a premium on redemption of Preferred Shares in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
 
The following table presents the issued and outstanding Preference Interests as of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003:
 
On or after the fifth anniversary of the respective issuance (the "Redemption Date"), all of the Preference Interests may be redeemed for cash at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the liquidation preference of $50.00 per unit plus the cumulative amount of accrued and unpaid distributions, if any.

10.          Line of Credit
 
On May 30, 2002, the Operating Partnership obtained a three-year $700.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility maturing May 29, 2005.  Advances under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates based upon LIBOR at various interest periods, plus a spread dependent upon the Operating Partnership's credit rating, or based upon bids received from the lending group.  EQR has guaranteed the Operating Partnership's line of credit up to the maximum amount and for the full term of the facility.
 
As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, $150.0 million and $10.0 million, respectively, was outstanding and $65.4 million and $56.7 million, respectively, was restricted (dedicated to support letters of credit and not available for borrowing) on the credit facility.  During the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the weighted average interest rate was 1.73% and 1.85%, respectively.
 
11.          Derivative Instruments
 
The following table summarizes the consolidated derivative instruments at December 31, 2004 (dollar amounts are in thousands):
 
During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company paid approximately $3.3 million to terminate five interest rate swaps in conjunction with the repayment of the underlying mortgage loans.  The Company recognized a $1.9 million loss in connection with these terminations (included in loss from investments in unconsolidated entities as the losses occurred prior to the acquisition and/or consolidation of the respective properties  see further discussion in Notes 2 and 4).  The Company also paid approximately $0.5 million to terminate two forward starting swaps in conjunction with the issuance of $300.0 million of five-year unsecured notes.  The $0.5 million cost has been deferred and will be recognized as additional interest expense over the five-year life of the unsecured notes.  The Company also paid approximately $3.5 million to terminate ten forward starting swaps in conjunction with the issuance of $500.0 million of ten-year unsecured notes.  Approximately $3.3 million of the $3.5 million cost has been deferred and will be recognized as additional interest expense over the ten-year life of the unsecured notes.
 
On December 31, 2004, the net derivative instruments were reported at their fair value as other assets of approximately $1.3 million and as other liabilities of approximately $9.2 million.  As of December 31, 2004, there were approximately $21.0 million in deferred losses, net, included in accumulated other comprehensive loss.  Based on the estimated fair values of the net derivative instruments at December 31, 2004, the Company may recognize an estimated $4.5 million of accumulated other comprehensive loss as additional interest expense during the twelve months ending December 31, 2005.
 
12.          Earnings Per Share

Share Incentive Plans
 
On May 15, 2002, the shareholders of EQR approved the Company's 2002 Share Incentive Plan.  The maximum aggregate number of awards that may be granted under this plan may not exceed 7.5% of the Company's outstanding Common Shares calculated on a "fully diluted" basis and determined annually on the first day of each calendar year.  As of January 1, 2005, this amount equaled 23,069,873, of which 17,683,625 is available for future issuance.  No awards may be granted under the 2002 Share Incentive Plan after February 20, 2012.
 
Pursuant to the 2002 Share Incentive Plan and the Fifth Amended and Restated 1993 Share Option and Share Award Plan (collectively the "Share Incentive Plans"), officers, trustees, key employees and consultants of the Company may be offered the opportunity to acquire Common Shares through the grant of share options ("Options") including non-qualified share options ("NQSOs"), incentive share options ("ISOs") and share appreciation rights ("SARs"), or may be granted restricted or non-restricted shares.  Additionally, officers and key employees of the Company may be awarded Common Shares, subject to conditions and restrictions as described in the Share Incentive Plans.  Finally, certain executive officers of the Company are subject to the Company's performance based restricted share plan.  Options, SARs, restricted shares and performance shares are sometimes collectively referred to herein as "Awards".
 
The Options generally are granted at the fair market value of the Company's Common Shares at the date of grant, vest over a three year period, are exercisable upon vesting and expire ten years from the date of grant.  The exercise price for all Options under the Share Incentive Plans shall not be less than the fair market value of the underlying Common Shares at the time the Option is granted.  The Fifth Amended and Restated 1993 Share Option and Share Award Plan will terminate at such time as all outstanding Awards have expired or have been exercised/vested.  The Board of Trustees may at any time amend or terminate the Share Incentive Plans, but termination will not affect Awards previously granted.  Any Options which had vested prior to such a termination would remain exercisable by the holder thereof.
 
As to the Options that have been granted through December 31, 2004, generally, one-third are exercisable one year after the initial grant, one-third are exercisable two years following the date such Options were granted and the remaining one-third are exercisable three years following the date such Options were granted.
 
As to the restricted shares that have been awarded through December 31, 2004, these shares generally vest three years from the award date.  During the three-year period of restriction, the employee receives quarterly dividend payments on their shares.  The Company's unvested restricted shareholders
receive dividends at the same rate and on the same date as any other Common Share holder.  In addition, the Company's unvested restricted shareholders have the same voting rights as any other Common Share holder.  As a result, dividends paid on unvested restricted shares are included as a distribution in excess of accumulated earnings and have not been considered in reducing net income available to Common Shares in a manner similar to the Company's preferred share dividends for the earnings per share calculation.  If employment is terminated prior to the lapsing of the restriction, the shares are canceled.
 
In addition, each year the Company's executive officers receive performance-based awards.  The executive officers have the opportunity to earn in Common Shares an amount as little as 0% to as much as 225% of the target number of performance-based awards.  The owners of performance-based awards have no right to vote, receive dividends or transfer the awards until Common Shares are issued in exchange for the awards.  The number of Common Shares the executive officer actually receives on the third anniversary of the grant date will depend on the excess, if any, by which the Company's Average Annual Return (i.e., the average of the Common Share dividends declared during each year as a percentage of the Common Share price as of the first business day of the first performance year and the average percentage increase in funds from operations ("FFO") for each calendar year on a per share basis over the prior year) for the three performance years exceeds the average of the 10-year Treasury Note interest rate as of the first business day in January of each performance year (the "T-Note Rate").
 
 
Fifty percent of the Common Shares to which an executive officer may be entitled under the performance share grants will vest, subject to the executive's continued employment with the Company, on the third anniversary of the award (which will be the date the Common Shares are issued); twenty-five percent will vest on the fourth anniversary and the remaining twenty-five percent will vest on the fifth anniversary.  The Common Shares will also fully vest upon the executive's death, retirement at or after age 62, disability or upon a change in control of the Company.
 
The following table summarizes information regarding both the restricted and performance-based share plans for the three years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002:
 
he Company had chosen to account for its stock-based compensation in accordance with APB No. 25, ,which resulted in no compensation expense for options issued with an exercise price equal to or exceeding the market value of the Company's Common Shares on the date of grant (intrinsic method).  The Company has elected to account for its stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and its amendment (SFAS No. 148), , effective in the first quarter of 2003, which resulted in compensation expense being recorded based on the fair value of the stock compensation granted.
Prior to 2003, t

Accounting for Stock Based Compensation
 
Compensation expense related to restricted and performance-based share grants was previously recognized in accordance with APB No. 25.  The adoption of SFAS No. 123 does not significantly change the amount of compensation expense recognized for these grants.
 
See Note 2 for additional information regarding the Company's stock-based compensation.
 
The table below summarizes the Option activity of the Share Incentive Plans and options assumed in connection with mergers (the "Merger Options") for the three years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002:
 
The following table summarizes information regarding options outstanding at December 31, 2004:
 
As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, 8,274,915 Options (with a weighted average exercise price of $23.86) and 8,252,203 Options (with a weighted average exercise price of $22.25) were exercisable, respectively.
 
15.
                              
Employee Plans
 
The Company established an Employee Share Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") to provide employees and trustees the ability to annually acquire up to $100,000 of Common Shares of the Company.  In 2003, the Company's shareholders approved an increase in the aggregate number of Common Shares available under the ESPP to 7,000,000 (from 2,000,000).  The Company has 4,770,937 Common Shares available for purchase under the ESPP at December 31, 2004.  The Common Shares may be purchased quarterly at a price equal to 85% of the lesser of: (a) the closing price for a share on the last day of such quarter; and (b) the greater of: (i) the closing price for a share on the first day of such quarter, and (ii) the average closing price for a share for all the business days in the quarter.  The following table summarizes information regarding the Common Shares issued under the ESPP:
 
 
The Company established a defined contribution plan (the "401(k) Plan") to provide retirement benefits for employees that meet minimum employment criteria.  The Company matches dollar for dollar up to the first 2% of eligible compensation that a participant contributes to the 401(k) Plan (4% for 2002 and prior years).  Participants are vested in the Company's contributions over five years.  The Company made contributions in the amount of $1.5 million and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and expects to make contributions in the amount of approximately $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.
 
The Company may also elect to make an annual discretionary profit-sharing contribution as a percentage of each individual employee's eligible compensation under the 401(k) Plan.  The Company did not make a contribution for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 or 2002.
 
The Company established a supplemental executive retirement savings plan (the "SERP") to provide certain officers and trustees an opportunity to defer a portion of their eligible compensation in order to save for retirement.  The SERP is restricted to investments in Company Common Shares, certain marketable securities that have been specifically approved, and cash equivalents.  The deferred compensation liability represented in the SERP and the securities issued to fund such deferred compensation liability are consolidated by the Company and carried on the Company's balance sheet, and the Company's Common Shares held in the SERP are accounted for as a reduction to paid in capital.
 
16.
                              
Distribution Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan
 
On November 3, 1997, the Company filed with the SEC a Form S-3 Registration Statement to register 14,000,000 Common Shares pursuant to a Distribution Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan (the "DRIP Plan").  The registration statement was declared effective on November 25, 1997.  The Company has 11,571,446 Common Shares available for issuance under the DRIP Plan at December 31, 2004.
The DRIP Plan provides holders of record and beneficial owners of Common Shares and Preferred Shares with a simple and convenient method of investing cash distributions in additional Common Shares (which is referred to herein as the "Dividend Reinvestment  DRIP Plan").  Common Shares may also be purchased on a monthly basis with optional cash payments made by participants in the DRIP Plan and interested new investors, not currently shareholders of the Company, at the market price of the Common Shares less a discount ranging between 0% and 5%, as determined in accordance with the DRIP Plan (which is referred to herein as the "Share Purchase  DRIP Plan").  Common Shares purchased under the DRIP Plan may, at the option of the Company, be directly issued by the Company or purchased by the Company's transfer agent in the open market using participants' funds.
 
17.
                              
Transactions with Related Parties
 
The Company provided asset and property management services to certain related entities for properties not owned by the Company.  Fees received for providing such services were approximately $0.2 million, $0.3 million and $0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
 
The Company reimbursed its Chief Operating Officer for the actual operating costs (excluding acquisition costs) of operating his personal aircraft for himself and other employees on Company business.  Amounts incurred were approximately $0.3 million, $0.2 million and $0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
 
The Company leases its corporate headquarters from an entity controlled by EQR's Chairman of the Board of Trustees.  Amounts incurred for such office space for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, were approximately $1.9 million, $1.7 million and $1.6 million.  The Company believes these amounts equal market rates for such space.
 
The Company had the following additional non-continuing related party transactions:
 
 - 
                 
The Company leased space in an office building in Augusta, Georgia indirectly owned by one of EQR's trustees since May 2003 and directly owned by an entity affiliated with the same EQR trustee from 1998 to 2003 (individual was a trustee through May 2004).  Amounts incurred for such office space were approximately $0.2 million, $0.2 million and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively;
 
 -

18.
                              
Commitments and Contingencies
 
The Company, as an owner of real estate, is subject to various Federal, state and local environmental laws.  Compliance by the Company with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on the Company.
However, the Company cannot predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations on its current properties or on properties that it may acquire in the future.
 
In August 2004, the Company tried a class action lawsuit in Palm Beach County, Florida regarding certain charges made to residents who terminated their leases early or failed to provide sufficient notice of intent to vacate.  In December 2004, the Court issued a Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law holding those fees legally uncollectible under Florida law. In recognition of the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, which awarded damages and interest to the class in the amount of approximately $1.6 million, the Company established a reserve of approximately $1.6 million and correspondingly recorded this as a general and administrative expense.  Due to pending appeals, the award is neither final nor enforceable.  Accordingly, it is not possible to determine or predict the ultimate outcome of the case.  While no assurances can be given, the Company does not believe that this lawsuit, if the ultimate outcome is unfavorable, will have a material adverse effect on the Company.
 
The Company does not believe there is any other litigation pending or threatened against the Company which, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably may be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company established a reserve and recorded a corresponding expense of $15.2 million in estimated uninsured property damage at certain of its properties primarily located in Florida caused by Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne (included in rents received in advance and other liabilities and real estate taxes and insurance expense on the consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations, respectively).  Of this amount, approximately $9.4 million had been spent for hurricane related repairs through December 31, 2004.
 
totaling 1,306 units in various stages of development with estimated completion dates ranging through September 30, 2006. The three development agreements currently in place have the following key terms:
As of December 31, 2004 the Company has five projects
 
The first development partner has the right, at any time following completion of a project subject to the agreement, to stipulate a value for such project and offer to sell its interest in the project to the Company based on such value.  If the Company chooses not to purchase the interest, the Company must agree to a sale of the project to an unrelated third party at such value.  The Company's partner must exercise this right as to all projects subject to the agreement within five years after the receipt of the final certificate of occupancy on the last developed property.  In connection with this development agreement, the Company has an obligation to provide up to $40.0 million in credit enhancements to guarantee a portion of the third party construction financing.  As of February 2, 2005, the Company had set-aside $5.0 million towards this credit enhancement.  The Company would be required to perform under this agreement only if there was a material default under a third party construction mortgage agreement.  This agreement expires no later than December 31, 2018.  Notwithstanding the termination of the agreement, the Company shall have recourse against its development partner for any losses incurred.
 - 
                 
 
The second development partner has the right, at any time following completion of a project subject to the agreement, to require the Company to purchase the partners' interest in that project at a mutually agreeable price.  If the Company and the partner are unable to agree on a price, both parties will obtain appraisals.  If the appraised values vary by more than 10%, both the Company and its partner will agree on a third appraiser to determine which original appraisal is closest to its determination of value.  The Company may elect at that time not to purchase the property and instead, authorize its partner to sell the project at or above the agreed-upon value to an unrelated third party.  Five years following the receipt of the final certificate of occupancy on the last
 - 
                       
developed property, the Company must purchase, at the agreed-upon price, any projects remaining unsold.
 
The third development partner has the exclusive right for six months following stabilization, as defined, to market a subject project for sale.  Thereafter, either the Company or its development partner may market a subject project for sale.  If the Company's development partner proposes the sale, the Company may elect to purchase the project at the price proposed by its partner or defer the sale until two independent appraisers appraise the project.  If the two appraised values vary by more than 5%, a third appraiser will be chosen to determine the fair market value of the property.  Once a value has been determined, the Company may elect to purchase the property or authorize its development partner to sell the project at the agreed-upon value.
 - 
                 
 
In connection with one of its mergers, the Company provided a guaranty of a credit enhancement agreement with respect to certain tax-exempt bonds issued to finance certain public improvements at a multifamily development project.  The Company has the obligation to provide this guaranty for a period of eight years from the consummation of the merger or through May 2005.  The Company would be required to perform under this agreement only if there was a draw on the letter of credit issued by the credit enhancement party.  The counterparty has also agreed to indemnify the Company for any losses suffered.  As of December 31, 2004, this guaranty was still in effect at a commitment amount of $12.7 million (reduced to $10.4 million effective in January 2005) and no current outstanding liability.
 
During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, total operating lease payments incurred for office space, including a portion of real estate taxes, insurance, repairs and utilities, aggregated $5.8 million, $5.7 million and $5.8 million, respectively.
 
The Company has entered into a retirement benefits agreement with its Chairman of the Board of Trustees and deferred compensation agreements with two of its executive officers and its former chief executive officer.  During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company recognized compensation expense of $39,000, $3.0 million and $5.1 million, respectively, related to these agreements.
 
The following table summarizes the Company's contractual obligations for minimum rent payments under operating leases and deferred compensation for the next five years and thereafter as of December 31, 2004:
 
 
Minimum basic rent due for various office space the Company leases and fixed base rent due on a ground lease for one property.

19.
                              
Asset Impairment
 
The Company recorded approximately $1.2 million of asset impairment charges related to its technology investments in each of the years ending December 31, 2003 and 2002. These charges were the
result of a review of the existing investments reflected on the consolidated balance sheet.  These impairment losses are reflected on the consolidated statements of operations in total expenses and include the write-down of assets classified as other assets.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company recorded approximately $17.1 million of asset impairment charges related to its corporate housing business.  Following the guidance in SFAS No. 142, these charges were the result of the Company's decision to reduce the carrying value of its corporate housing business to $30.0 million, given the weakness in the economy and management's expectations for near-term performance.  This impairment loss is reflected on the consolidated statements of operations as impairment on corporate housing business and on the consolidated balance sheets as a reduction in goodwill, net.

Reportable Segments
 
Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by senior management.  Senior management decides how resources are allocated and assesses performance on a monthly basis.
 
The Company's primary business is owning, managing, and operating multifamily residential properties, which includes the generation of rental and other related income through the leasing of apartment units to residents and includes Equity Corporate Housing ("ECH").  Senior management evaluates the performance of each of our apartment communities on an individual basis; however, each of our apartment communities has similar economic characteristics, residents, and products and services so they have been aggregated into one reportable segment.  The Company's rental real estate segment comprises approximately 99.4%, 99.1% and 99.4% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  The Company's rental real estate segment comprises approximately 99.8% and 99.7% of total assets at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
 
The primary financial measure for the Company's rental real estate segment is net operating income ("NOI"), which represents rental income less: 1) property and maintenance expense; 2) real estate taxes and insurance expense; and 3) property management expense (all as reflected in the accompanying statements of operations).  The Company believes that NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the Company's apartment communities.  Current year NOI is compared to prior year NOI and current year budgeted NOI as a measure of financial performance.  The following table presents the NOI from our rental real estate specific to continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively:
 
The Company's fee and asset management activity is immaterial and does not meet the threshold requirements of a reportable segment as provided for in SFAS No. 131.
 
All revenues are from external customers and there is no customer who contributed 10% or more of the Company's total revenues during the three years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 or 2002.
