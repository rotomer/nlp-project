On September 21, 2005, the Board of Trustees of Equity Residential (the "Company") approved an increase in the base annual fee paid to its trustees (other than its Chairman and employee trustees) from $95,000 to $125,000, effective January 1, 2006. The Board of Trustees also approved the increases in the committee and lead trustee fees set forth in the table below also effective January 1, 2006.

In past years, the long-term incentive grants have typically been allocated 25% to options and 75% to restricted shares.
