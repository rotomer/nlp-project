Exhibit 99.1 Equity Residential Reports Third Quarter Results; Announces Additional $500 Million Share Buyback Program CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 1, 2005--Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR) today reported results for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2005. All per share results are reported on a fully diluted basis. "Our third quarter results were driven by very good same-store revenue growth, strong condominium sales and excellent progress on our portfolio reconfiguration. Continued success in these areas as well as good job growth and household formations in our key markets should lead to a strong finish to 2005 and a very good 2006," said Bruce W. Duncan, Equity Residential's CEO. Third Quarter 2005 For the quarter ended September 30, 2005, the company reported earnings of $0.86 per share compared to $0.26 per share in the third quarter of 2004. The quarterly increase is primarily attributable to $0.63 per share in higher gains on property and condominium sales, partially offset by $0.04 per share in higher interest expense. Funds from Operations (FFO) for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 were $0.56 per share compared to $0.50 per share in the same period of 2004. The positive variance was primarily the result of $0.07 per share in higher gains on condominium sales and $0.02 per share of improved same-store results, offset by the previously mentioned $0.04 per share of higher interest expense. Total revenues from continuing operations for the quarter were $504.4 million compared to $456.6 million in the third quarter of 2004. The primary components of this $47.8 million increase in revenues include the properties acquired since October 1, 2004 as well as an approximate $18.4 million increase in third quarter same-store revenues. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2005 For the nine months ended September 30, 2005, the company reported earnings of $2.05 per share compared to $1.00 per share in the same period of 2004. The increase for the period is primarily attributable to higher gains on property and condominium sales and the previously announced gain due to eBay Inc.'s acquisition of the company's ownership interest in Rent.com. FFO for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 were $1.86 per share compared to $1.58 per share in the same period of 2004. Total revenues from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 were $1.5 billion compared to $1.3 billion in the same period of 2004. Same-Store Results On a same-store third quarter to third quarter comparison, which includes 165,673 units, revenues increased 4.3 percent, expenses increased 6.2 percent and net operating income (NOI) increased 3.0 percent. The increase in same-store expenses in the third quarter of 2005 includes approximately $3.7 million of additional insurance expense related to the impact of two property fires and Hurricane Katrina. Without the fire and hurricane related insurance expenses, the same-store expense and NOI increases would have been 4.1 percent and 4.4 percent, respectively, for the quarter. On a sequential same-store comparison for these same 165,673 units from second quarter 2005 to third quarter 2005, revenues increased 1.5 percent, expenses increased 5.0 percent and NOI decreased 0.8 percent. Without the fire and hurricane related insurance expenses, the same-store expense and NOI increases for the sequential period would have been 2.9 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively. On a same-store nine-month to nine-month comparison, which includes 158,005 units, revenues increased 3.2 percent, expenses increased 5.6 percent and NOI increased 1.6 percent. Without the fire and hurricane related insurance expenses, the same-store expense and NOI increases for the period would have been 4.8 percent and 2.2 percent, respectively. Acquisitions/Dispositions During the third quarter of 2005, the company acquired six properties, consisting of 2,294 units, for an aggregate purchase price of $416.0 million at an average capitalization (cap) rate of 5.7 percent and one land parcel for $1.4 million. Also during the quarter, the company sold 15 properties, consisting of 4,218 units, for an aggregate sale price of $433.0 million at an average cap rate of 5.2 percent. In addition, the company sold 569 condominium units for $183.9 million and a 248-unit property in the process of being converted to condominiums for $45.9 million. In the first nine months of 2005, the company acquired 26 properties, consisting of 7,168 units, for an aggregate purchase price of $1.1 billion at an average cap rate of 5.6 percent and three land parcels for $46.7 million. In addition, the company sold 39 properties, consisting of 10,212 units, for an aggregate sale price of $1.1 billion at an average cap rate of 5.0 percent. In addition, the company sold 1,341 condominium units for $382.2 million, a 248-unit property in the process of being converted to condominiums for $45.9 million and two land parcels for $36.3 million. "We have had an excellent year in our transaction activity, garnering very good prices on the sale of assets and executing on opportunities to add high-quality, well-located properties to our portfolio," said David J. Neithercut, Equity Residential's President. Share Buyback Authorization The company also announced a new common share repurchase program in the amount of $500 million. The new authorization is in addition to the $85 million remaining under the company's existing $200 million authorization approved in July 2002. The new program authorizes the company to repurchase common shares from time to time through the open market or privately negotiated transactions, subject to financial and market conditions and legal requirements.

Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. The April 2002 White Paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from FFO for previously depreciated operating properties only. Once the Company commences the conversion of units to condominiums, it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property. (2) The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company, because it is a recognized measure of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. FFO in and of itself does not represent net income or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO should not be exclusively considered as an alternative to net income or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The Company's calculation of FFO may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies.

Expected EPS is calculated on a basis consistent with actual EPS. Due to the uncertain timing and extent of property dispositions and the resulting gains/losses on sales, actual EPS could differ materially from expected EPS. (2) The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") defines funds from operations ("FFO") (April 2002 White Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. Expected FFO is calculated on a basis consistent with actual FFO.
