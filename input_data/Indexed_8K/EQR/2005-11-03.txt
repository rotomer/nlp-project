Equity Residential today announced that its operating partnership, ERP Operating Limited Partnership (collectively with Equity Residential, the "Company") has closed on its previously announced acquisition of three high-rise apartment towers, currently known as Trump Place, located at 140, 160 and 180 Riverside Boulevard on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.  The purchase price, after closing adjustments, was approximately $809 million.
 
The properties were constructed between 1998 and 2003 and consist of 1,325 apartment units totaling approximately 1.06 million square feet, approximately 40,000 square feet of retail space and 424 parking spaces.
 
This transaction was part of a larger transaction in which The Carlyle Group and Extell Development Company simultaneously purchased a large tract of developable land directly to the south of Trump Place from a consortium of Hong Kong investors and Donald J. Trump.
 
The acquisition is being financed primarily through the proceeds of asset sales as well as the Company's $1.6 billion credit facilities.
