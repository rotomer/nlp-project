Exhibit 99.1
 
The Board of Trustees and Shareholders Equity Residential
 
The Partners
ERP Operating Limited Partnership
 
We have audited the accompanying combined statement of revenue and certain expenses of Trump Place for the year ended December 31, 2004. This combined statement is the responsibility of the management of Trump Place (the "Property"). Our responsibility is to express an opinion on this combined statement based on our audit.
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the combined statement is free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Property's internal control over financial reporting.  Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Property's internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the combined financial statement, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall combined financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
The accompanying combined statement was prepared for the purpose of complying with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for inclusion in a Current Report on Form 8-K of Equity Residential and ERP Operating Limited Partnership, as described in Note 1, and is not intended to be a complete presentation of the Property's revenue and expenses.
 
In our opinion, the combined statement referred to above presents fairly, in all material respects, the revenue and certain expenses of Trump Place for the year ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
 
 
See accompanying notes.
 
1. Basis of Presentation
 
On November 3, 2005, ERP Operating Limited Partnership (collectively with Equity Residential, its general partner, the "Company") acquired three high-rise apartment towers in New York, New York known as Trump Place.  Due to common ownership and management of the apartment towers, these statements are shown on a combined basis.
 
The combined statements of revenue and certain expenses relate to the operations of Trump Place and were prepared for the purpose of complying with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Rule 3-14 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, the accompanying combined statements of revenue and certain expenses have been prepared using the accrual method of accounting, and certain expenses such as depreciation, amortization, income taxes, mortgage interest expense and entity expenses are not reflected in the combined statements of revenue and certain expenses, as required by Rule 3-14 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Consequently, the combined statements of revenue and certain expenses for the periods presented are not representative of the actual operations for the periods presented, as certain revenues and expenses which may not be in the proposed future operations of Trump Place have been excluded in accordance with Rule 3-14 of Regulation S-X.
 
The accompanying unaudited interim combined statement of revenue and certain expenses has been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and was prepared on the same basis as the combined statement of revenue and certain expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the information for this interim period have been made. The revenue in excess of certain expenses for such interim period is not necessarily indicative of the excess of revenue over certain expenses for the full year.
 
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 
Revenue Recognition
 
The apartments are leased under operating leases with terms of generally two years or less. Rental income is recognized as it is earned, which is not materially different than on a straight-line basis.
 
Repairs and Maintenance
 
Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred, while significant improvements, renovations and replacements are capitalized.
 
Estimates
 
The preparation of the combined statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
Advertising Costs
 
All advertising costs are expensed as incurred and reported on the statement of revenue and certain expenses within the line item "Operating Expenses". For the year ended December 31, 2004 and the nine month period ended September 30, 2005, advertising expenses were approximately $464,543 and $170,928, respectively.
3. Related Party Transactions
 
Property management fees in the amount of $412,500 and $337,500 were charged by a related party during 2004 and the nine month period ended September 30, 2005, respectively.
The accompanying unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets of Equity Residential and ERP Operating Limited Partnership (collectively, the "Company") are presented as if Trump Place had been acquired on September 30, 2005.  These Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets should be read in conjunction with the Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2005 and for the year ended December 31, 2004 and the historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of the Company reported on Forms 10-Q for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2005 and on Forms 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004, as updated on Forms 8-K dated December 2, 2005.  In management's opinion, all adjustments necessary to reflect the acquisition of Trump Place have been made.  The following Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets are not necessarily indicative of what the actual financial position would have been assuming the above transaction had been consummated at September 30, 2005, nor do they purport to represent the future financial position of the Company.
