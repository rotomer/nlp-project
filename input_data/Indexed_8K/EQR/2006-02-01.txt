Exhibit 99.1 Equity Residential Reports 2005 Results; Exceeds Guidance Due to Strong Condominium Sales CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 31, 2006--Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR), the largest publicly traded apartment company in America, today reported results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2005. All per share results are reported on a fully diluted basis. "As we expected, the continuing improvement in the economy, growth in jobs and diminished supply in our core markets facilitated a strong finish to 2005 and will continue to benefit Equity Residential in 2006," said David J. Neithercut, Equity Residential's President and CEO. Fourth Quarter 2005 For the quarter ended December 31, 2005, the company reported earnings of $0.74 per share compared to $0.48 per share in the fourth quarter of 2004. The quarterly increase is primarily attributable to higher gains from sales of land parcels, properties and condominiums. Funds from Operations (FFO) for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 were $0.66 per share compared to $0.56 per share in the same period of 2004. The positive variance was primarily the result of higher gains on sales of land parcels and condominiums in the quarter. The company's fourth quarter FFO exceeded the high end of the guidance provided by the company on November 1, 2005 by $0.06 per share. This excess is comprised of $0.01 per share from continued improvement in the company's same-store performance, $0.02 per share related to the company's Watermarke condominium joint venture property in California and $0.03 per share from the sale of condominium units at two of the company's Florida properties. Total revenues from continuing operations for the quarter were $518.9 million compared to $451.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. The primary components of this $67.0 million increase in revenues include the properties purchased after January 1, 2005 as well as a $25.1 million increase in same-store revenues. Year Ended December 31, 2005 For the year ended December 31, 2005, the company reported earnings of $2.79 per share compared to $1.48 per share in the same period of 2004. The annual increase is primarily attributable to higher gains on property and condominium sales and the previously announced gain due to eBay Inc.'s acquisition of the company's ownership interest in Rent.com. FFO for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $2.52 per share compared to $2.14 per share in the same period of 2004. Total revenues from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $1.95 billion compared to $1.75 billion in the same period of 2004. Same-Store Results On a same-store fourth quarter to fourth quarter comparison, which includes 163,196 apartment units, revenues increased 5.9 percent, expenses increased 5.2 percent and NOI increased 6.4 percent. On a sequential same-store comparison for these same 163,196 apartment units from third quarter 2005 to fourth quarter 2005, revenues increased 1.3 percent, expenses decreased 4.0 percent and NOI increased 5.2 percent. On a same-store year to year comparison, which includes 154,854 apartment units, revenues increased 3.9 percent, expenses increased 5.6 percent and NOI increased 2.8 percent. Acquisitions/Dispositions "2005 was a tremendous year of progress towards our goal of adding high-quality, well-located assets to our portfolio, with acquisitions of over $2.5 billion," said Mr. Neithercut. "We also sold more than $1.9 billion of properties that were older or in slower growth markets, receiving good pricing and furthering our goal of reducing the number of markets in which we operate. In 2006 we will continue to work towards these goals with $1.5 billion in anticipated acquisitions and $1.5 billion in planned dispositions." During the fourth quarter of 2005, the company acquired 15 properties, consisting of 4,891 apartment units, for an aggregate purchase price of $1.4 billion at an average capitalization (cap) rate of 4.7 percent and four land parcels for $91.6 million. Also during the quarter, the company sold 11 properties, consisting of 2,636 apartment units, for an aggregate sale price of $274.6 million at an average cap rate of 5.2 percent and three land parcels for $72.0 million. In addition, the company sold 652 condominium units for $165.2 million. In the year ended December 31, 2005, the company acquired 41 properties, consisting of 12,059 apartment units, for an aggregate purchase price of $2.5 billion at an average cap rate of 5.1 percent and seven land parcels for $138.3 million. In addition, the company sold 50 properties, consisting of 12,848 apartment units, for an aggregate sale price of $1.4 billion at an average cap rate of 5.0 percent. In addition, the company sold 2,241 condominium units for $593.3 million and five land parcels for $108.3 million.

Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. The April 2002 White Paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from FFO for previously depreciated operating properties only. Once the Company commences the conversion of units to condominiums, it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property. (2) The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company, because it is a recognized measure of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. FFO in and of itself does not represent net income or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO should not be exclusively considered as an alternative to net income or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The Company's calculation of FFO may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies.

December YTD 2004 and Fourth Quarter 2004 expenses exclude the uninsured property damage caused by Hurricanes Frances, Charley, Ivan and Jeanne. (2) The Company's primary financial measure for evaluating each of its apartment communities is net operating income ("NOI"). NOI represents rental income less property and maintenance expense, real estate tax and insurance expense, and property management expense. The Company believes that NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the Company's apartment communities.

Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. Expected FFO is calculated on a basis consistent with actual FFO.
