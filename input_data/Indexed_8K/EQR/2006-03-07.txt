In addition, the Properties and Trump Place are directly or indirectly owned by entities that elect or have elected to be treated as real estate investment trusts ("REIT's") for federal income tax purposes.

We have audited the accompanying statement of revenue and certain expenses of Harbor Steps for the year ended December 31, 2004. This statement is the responsibility of the management of Harbor Steps (the "Property"). Our responsibility is to express an opinion on this statement based on our audit.
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the statement is free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Property's internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Property's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statement, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
The accompanying statement was prepared for the purpose of complying with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for inclusion in a Current Report on Form 8-K of Equity Residential  and ERP Operating Limited Partnership, as described in Note 1, and is not intended to be a complete presentation of the Property's revenue and expenses.
 
In our opinion, the statement referred to above presents fairly, in all material respects, the revenue and certain expenses of Harbor Steps for the year ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

1. Basis of Presentation
 
On September 23, 2005, ERP Operating Limited Partnership (collectively with Equity Residential, its general partner, the "Company") indirectly acquired Harbor Steps (the "Property"), a residential and commercial property, located in Seattle, Washington.
 
The statements of revenue and certain expenses relate to the operations of Harbor Steps and were prepared for the purpose of complying with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Rule 3-14 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, the accompanying statements of revenue and certain expenses have been prepared using the accrual method of accounting, and certain expenses such as depreciation, amortization, income taxes, mortgage interest expense and entity expenses are not reflected in the statements of revenue and certain expenses, as required by Rule 3-14 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Consequently, the statements of revenue and certain expenses for the periods presented are not representative of the actual operations for the periods presented, as certain revenues and expenses which may not be in the proposed future operations of Harbor Steps have been excluded in accordance with Rule 3-14 of Regulation S-X.
 
The accompanying unaudited interim statement of revenue and certain expenses has been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and was prepared on the same basis as the statement of revenue and certain expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the information for this interim period have been made. The revenue in excess of certain expenses for such interim period is not necessarily indicative of the excess of revenue over certain expenses for the full year.
 
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 
Revenue Recognition
 
The residential apartments are leased under operating leases with terms of generally one year or less. Rental income is recognized as it is earned, which is not materially different than on a straight-line basis.
 
Rental income from commercial space is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. All commercial leases have been accounted for as operating leases with remaining lease terms from one to eight years.
 
Repairs and Maintenance
 
Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred, while significant improvements, renovations and replacements are capitalized.
 
Estimates
 
The preparation of the statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
Advertising Costs
 
All advertising costs are expensed as incurred and included as operating expenses on the statement of revenue and certain expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2004 and the period from January 1, 2005 to September 23, 2005 (unaudited), advertising expenses were approximately $219,000 and $156,000, respectively.

5. Parking Facility Revenue

Accordingly, the accompanying statements of revenue and certain expenses have been prepared using the accrual method of accounting, and certain expenses such as depreciation, amortization, income taxes, mortgage interest expense and entity expenses are not reflected in the statements of revenue and certain expenses, as required by Rule 3-14 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Consequently, the statements of revenue and certain expenses for the periods presented are not representative of the actual operations for the periods presented, as certain revenues and expenses which may not be in the proposed future operations of Skyline Towers have been excluded in accordance with Rule 3-14 of Regulation S-X.
 
The accompanying unaudited interim statement of revenue and certain expenses has been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and was prepared on the same basis as the statement of revenue and certain expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the information for this interim period have been made. The revenue in excess of certain expenses for such interim period is not necessarily indicative of the excess of revenue over certain expenses for the full year.
 
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 
Revenue Recognition
 
The residential apartments are leased under operating leases with terms of generally one year or less. Rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
 
Repairs and Maintenance
 
Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred, while significant improvements, renovations and replacements are capitalized.
 
Estimates
 
The preparation of the statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
Advertising Costs
 
All advertising costs are expensed as incurred and included as promotion and advertising expenses on the statement of revenue and certain expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2004 and the nine month period ended September 30, 2005 (unaudited), advertising expenses were approximately $187,000 and $149,000, respectively.
3. Related Party Transactions
 
An affiliate of Skyline Towers performed the property management function and charged total management fees of 3% of rental and other property income for this service for 2004 and the nine month period ended September 30, 2005. Management fees in the amount of $363,965 and $345,114 were charged to the Property during 2004 and the nine month period ended September 30, 2005 (unaudited), respectively.
The accompanying unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets of Equity Residential and ERP Operating Limited Partnership (collectively, the "Company") are presented as if Trump Place, Oak Mill I, Stoney Ridge and Skyline Towers had been acquired on September 30, 2005.
