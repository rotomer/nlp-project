Exhibit 99.1 Equity Residential Reports First Quarter Results CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 2, 2006--Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR) today reported results for the quarter ended March 31, 2006. All per share results are reported on a fully diluted basis. "As expected, 2006 will be a very good year for the multifamily industry," said David J. Neithercut, Equity Residential's President and CEO. "We continue to see good job growth and household formation across all of our markets. That, combined with little new supply, existing rental units taken off the market when converted to condominiums and the rising cost of single family homes, make for the strongest fundamentals we have seen in years." First Quarter 2006 For the quarter ended March 31, 2006, the company reported earnings of $1.25 per share compared to $0.74 per share in the first quarter of 2005. The quarterly increase is primarily attributable to higher gains on sales of properties as well as the items discussed below. Funds from Operations (FFO) for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 were $0.56 per share compared to $0.74 per share in the same period of 2005. The decrease is primarily attributable to an $0.18 per share decrease in other income due to the gain recognized in 2005 from eBay's acquisition of the company's interest in Rent.com, a $0.03 per share reduction in gains on sales of land parcels and a $0.02 per share decrease in incremental gains on sales of condominiums, offset by a $0.05 per share improvement in same-store NOI results. Total revenues from continuing operations for the quarter were $521.0 million compared to $444.0 million in the first quarter of 2005. The primary components of this $77.0 million increase in revenues include the properties acquired in 2005. "Same-Store" Results "Our same-store properties experienced exceptionally strong net operating income ("NOI") growth of 6.3% in the first quarter," said Mr. Neithercut. "Once again the benefits of our portfolio repositioning were evident in the first quarter, with our 2003 acquisitions achieving 9.2% NOI growth and the 2004 acquisitions delivering NOI growth of 10.8%." On a "same-store" first quarter to first quarter comparison, which includes 158,398 units, revenues increased 6.0 percent, expenses increased 5.7 percent and NOI increased 6.3 percent. The increase in same-store revenues was driven primarily by increases in occupancy and rental rate and a decrease in concessions. The same-store expense increase was primarily attributable to increases in utilities, real estate taxes and insurance. Acquisitions/Dispositions During the first quarter of 2006, the company acquired eleven properties, consisting of 2,779 units, for an aggregate purchase price of $506.6 million at an average capitalization (cap) rate of 5.0 percent and two land parcels for $14.2 million. Also during the quarter, the company sold 25 properties, consisting of 8,110 units, for an aggregate sale price of $799.9 million at an average cap rate of 5.5 percent. In addition, the company sold 171 condominium units for $35.0 million. Lexford Housing Division Sale On March 2, 2006, Equity Residential announced that it had retained JPMorgan to assist the company in the possible sale of its Lexford Housing Division, currently comprised of 289 properties consisting of 26,118 apartment units and a property management business based in Columbus, Ohio. Potential purchasers are currently in contact with JPMorgan but there can be no guarantee that a sale will occur. Second Quarter 2006 Results Equity Residential expects to announce second quarter 2006 results on Tuesday, August 1, 2006 and host a conference call to discuss those results at 10:00 a.m. CT on Wednesday, August 2, 2006. Equity Residential is the largest publicly traded apartment company in America. Nationwide, Equity Residential owns or has investments in 911 properties, in 31 states and the District of Columbia, consisting of 192,240 units.

Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. The April 2002 White Paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from FFO for previously depreciated operating properties only. Once the Company commences the conversion of units to condominiums, it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property. (2) The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company, because it is a recognized measure of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. FFO in and of itself does not represent net income or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO should not be exclusively considered as an alternative to net income or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The Company's calculation of FFO may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies.

NOI represents rental income less property and maintenance expense, real estate tax and insurance expense, and property management expense. The Company believes that NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the Company's apartment communities.
