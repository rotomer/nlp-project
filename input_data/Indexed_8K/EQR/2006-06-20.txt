Item 5.02
           
On June 19, 2006, the Board of Trustees of Equity Residential (the "Company") increased the size of its board from 11 to 12 and appointed John E. Neal as a Trustee of the Company's Board of Trustees effective as of July 1, 2006, to serve until the next annual meeting of shareholders or until his successor has been elected and qualified. It is expected that the Board of Trustees will appoint Mr. Neal as a member of one or more of the Board's independent committees when the Board meets in September 2006 or at an earlier date. The Board of Trustees has determined that Mr. Neal is independent of the Company and its management within the meaning of the NYSE listing standards.
(d)
           
Based on information provided to the Company by Mr. Neal, and other records and information available to the Company, the Company believes that there are no transactions or proposed transactions to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries was or is a party, and in which Mr. Neal had, or will have, a direct or indirect material interest. In addition, there is no arrangement or understanding between Mr. Neal and any other person pursuant to which Mr. Neal was selected as a trustee.
