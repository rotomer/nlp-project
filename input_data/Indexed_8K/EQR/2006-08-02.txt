Exhibit 99.1 Equity Residential Reports Second Quarter Results; Second Quarter Same-Store NOI Increases 7.6 Percent CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 1, 2006--Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR) today reported results for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2006. All per share results are reported on a fully diluted basis. "Our second quarter performance, with same-store NOI growth of 7.6 percent, reflects both the continuing strength of the multifamily business, as well as the progress we have made in transforming our portfolio," said David J. Neithercut, Equity Residential's President and CEO. "We are creating value for our shareholders by focusing on markets and properties which will generate better long term returns as evidenced by the second quarter same-store results of our 2004 and first quarter 2005 acquisitions, which achieved 12.5 percent and 16.8 percent NOI growth, respectively." Second Quarter 2006 For the quarter ended June 30, 2006, the company reported earnings of $0.51 per share compared to $0.44 per share in the second quarter of 2005. The quarterly increase is primarily attributable to higher gains on property sales as well as the items discussed below. Funds from Operations (FFO) for the quarter ended June 30, 2006 were $0.61 per share compared to $0.56 per share in the same period of 2005. The increase is primarily attributable to continued improvement in "same-store" net operating income and excellent growth from new acquisitions. On June 28, 2006, the company announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell its Lexford Housing Division. At that time, the company revised its guidance range for second quarter FFO to $0.56 to $0.58 per share from $0.55 to $0.60 per share due to an anticipated second quarter 2006 charge of $0.02 per share related to the early extinguishment of certain debt encumbering that portfolio. That charge will be incurred when the debt is extinguished, which is anticipated to occur concurrently with the closing of the sale, expected in the fourth quarter of 2006. As a result of the above as well as very positive property performance, the reported second quarter FFO of $0.61 per share exceeded the high end of the company's original guidance range by $0.01 per share. Total revenues from continuing operations for the quarter were $491.9 million compared to $415.2 million in the second quarter of 2005. The primary components of this $76.7 million increase in revenues include the properties acquired in 2005 and early 2006 as well as strong same store performance. Six Months Ended June 30, 2006 For the six months ended June 30, 2006, the company reported earnings of $1.76 per share compared to $1.19 per share in the same period of 2005. FFO for the six months ended June 30, 2006 were $1.17 per share compared to $1.30 per share in the same period of 2005. This decrease was primarily attributable to a $0.18 per share decrease in other income due to the gain recognized in 2005 from eBay's acquisition of the company's interest in Rent.com. Total revenues from continuing operations for the six months ended June 30, 2006 were $963.7 million compared to $814.3 million in the same period of 2005. Same-Store Results On a same-store second quarter to second quarter comparison, which includes 132,093 units, revenues increased 5.9 percent, expenses increased 3.5 percent and NOI increased 7.6 percent. The increase in same-store revenues was driven primarily by increases in rental rate and a decrease in concessions. On a same-store six-month to six-month comparison, which includes 129,965 units, revenues increased 6.0 percent, expenses increased 4.5 percent and NOI increased 7.0 percent. All same-store results exclude the Lexford Housing Division. Same-Store and FFO Guidance "The continued improvement in the performance of our properties in the second quarter and first six months of the year and our new expectations for the second half of the year lead us to raise our guidance for same-store revenues and NOI and lower our expense guidance for the year," said Mr. Neithercut. "This guidance is not affected by the removal of the Lexford portfolio from our same-store results. The Lexford revenue and expense numbers are tracking similarly to our conventional same-store portfolio." "We are leaving unchanged our 2006 FFO guidance of $2.30 to $2.50 per share, because the sale of the Lexford portfolio, which is a very positive step in our portfolio reconfiguration, will result in $0.05 per share of FFO dilution for the full year and result in the company generating FFO in the middle of that range. It is important to note, however, that this dilution will be partially offset by a reduction in capital expenditures." Same-Store Guidance Assumptions ------------------------------- New Previous --- -------- Revenues 5.25% to 5.75% 4.75% to 5.75% Expenses 2.5% to 3.5% 4.25% to 5.25% NOI 6.5% to 8.0% 4.5% to 6.5% Portfolio Reconfiguration During the second quarter of 2006, the company acquired seven properties, consisting of 2,143 units, for an aggregate purchase price of $430.6 million at an average capitalization (cap) rate of 4.8 percent, and three land parcels for $62.3 million. Also during the quarter, the company sold 13 properties, consisting of 2,418 units, for an aggregate sale price of $229.6 million at an average cap rate of 5.3 percent generating an unlevered internal rate of return (IRR) of 11.1 percent. In addition, the company sold 354 condominium units for $72.1 million and one land parcel for $0.9 million. In the first six months of 2006, the company acquired 18 properties, consisting of 4,922 units, for an aggregate purchase price of $937.2 million at an average cap rate of 4.9 percent, and five land parcels for $76.5 million. During the six months ended June 30, 2006, the company sold 38 properties, consisting of 10,528 units, for an aggregate sale price of $1.0 billion at an average cap rate of 5.5 percent generating an unlevered IRR of 12.2 percent. In addition, the company sold 525 condominium units for $107.2 million and one land parcel for $0.9 million. Lexford Housing Division Sale On June 28, 2006, Equity Residential announced that it agreed to sell its Lexford Housing Division, comprised of 289 properties consisting of 27,115 apartment units and a property management business based in Columbus, Ohio, for a cash purchase price of $1.086 billion. The purchase price is equivalent to $40,052 per apartment unit and a cap rate, after capital replacements of $400 per apartment unit, on 2006 net operating income of 7.4 percent. The sale is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2006 and generate a total book gain of approximately $430 million and an unlevered IRR of 15 percent. Third Quarter 2006 Results Equity Residential expects to announce third quarter 2006 results on Tuesday, October 31, 2006 and host a conference call to discuss those results at 1:00 p.m. CT on Wednesday, November 1, 2006. Equity Residential is the largest publicly traded apartment company in America.

Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. The April 2002 White Paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from FFO for previously depreciated operating properties only. Once the Company commences the conversion of units to condominiums, it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property. (2) The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company, because it is a recognized measure of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. FFO in and of itself does not represent net income or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO should not be exclusively considered as an alternative to net income or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The Company's calculation of FFO may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies.

Expected EPS is calculated on a basis consistent with actual EPS. Due to the uncertain timing and extent of property dispositions and the resulting gains/losses on sales, actual EPS could differ materially from expected EPS. (2) The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") defines funds from operations ("FFO") (April 2002 White Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. Expected FFO is calculated on a basis consistent with actual FFO.
