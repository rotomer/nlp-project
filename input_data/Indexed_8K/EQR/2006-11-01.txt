Exhibit 99.1 Equity Residential Reports Third Quarter Results Third Quarter Same-Store NOI Increases 9.1 Percent CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 31, 2006--Equity Residential (NYSE: EQR) today reported results for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2006. All per share results are reported on a fully diluted basis. "We had an excellent third quarter, with our same-store portfolio generating 9.1 percent NOI growth and our 2003, 2004 and 2005 acquisitions generating average NOI growth of 12.5 percent. Complimenting this terrific operating performance were acquisitions of high quality assets in our target markets and the completion of the sale of our Lexford portfolio in early October," said David J. Neithercut, Equity Residential's President and CEO. "Although we have expectations for continued strong same-store performance for the remainder of the year, we are revising our FFO guidance range for the full year to $2.32 to $2.35 per share, from our previous guidance toward the middle of a $2.30 to $2.50 per share range, due primarily to slightly higher than expected debt prepayment costs from the sale of Lexford as well as a lower than expected contribution from our condominium business." Third Quarter 2006 For the quarter ended September 30, 2006, the company reported earnings of $0.19 per share compared to $0.87 per share in the third quarter of 2005. The quarterly decrease is primarily attributable to higher gains on sales of properties in the third quarter of 2005 as well as the items discussed below. Funds from Operations (FFO) for the quarter ended September 30, 2006 were $0.62 per share compared to $0.56 per share in the same period of 2005. The increase is primarily attributable to continued improvement in same store net operating income and excellent growth from new acquisitions. Total revenues from continuing operations for the quarter were $513.9 million compared to $430.8 million in the third quarter of 2005. The primary components of this $83.1 million increase in revenues are the properties acquired in 2005 and 2006 as well as strong same-store performance. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2006 For the nine months ended September 30, 2006, the company reported earnings of $1.95 per share compared to $2.05 per share in the same period of 2005. FFO for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 were $1.78 per share compared to $1.86 per share in the same period of 2005. Total revenues from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 were $1.5 billion compared to $1.2 billion in the same period of 2005. Same-Store Results On a same-store third quarter to third quarter comparison, which includes 133,526 units, revenues increased 5.9 percent, expenses increased 1.4 percent and NOI increased 9.1 percent. The increase in same-store revenues was driven primarily by continued increases in rental rate. On a same-store nine-month to nine-month comparison, which includes 129,965 units, revenues increased 6.0 percent, expenses increased 3.2 percent and NOI increased 7.8 percent. All same-store results exclude the Lexford Housing Division. Portfolio Transformation During the third quarter of 2006, the company acquired ten properties, consisting of 2,558 units, for an aggregate purchase price of $504.8 million at an average capitalization (cap) rate of 5.1 percent, and one land parcel for $17.0 million. Also during the quarter, the company sold two properties, consisting of 133 units, for an aggregate sale price of $3.0 million at an average cap rate of 7.6 percent. In addition, the company sold 315 condominium units for $65.4 million and one land parcel for $0.7 million. In the first nine months of 2006, the company acquired 28 properties, consisting of 7,480 units, for an aggregate purchase price of $1.4 billion at an average cap rate of 5.0 percent, and six land parcels for $93.5 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2006, the company sold 40 properties, consisting of 10,661 units, for an aggregate sale price of $1.0 billion at an average cap rate of 5.5 percent generating an unlevered internal rate of return (IRR) of 12.2 percent. In addition, the company sold 840 condominium units for $172.6 million and two land parcels for $1.6 million. Lexford Housing Division Sale On October 5, 2006, Equity Residential completed the previously announced sale of its Lexford Housing Division, comprised of 289 properties consisting of 27,115 apartment units, for a cash purchase price of $1.086 billion.

Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. The April 2002 White Paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from FFO for previously depreciated operating properties only. Once the Company commences the conversion of units to condominiums, it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property. (2) The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company, because it is a recognized measure of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. FFO in and of itself does not represent net income or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO should not be exclusively considered as an alternative to net income or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The Company's calculation of FFO may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies. (3) Gain on sales of discontinued operations, net of minority interests, has been reduced by approximately $4.5 million in one-time accrued retention benefits for both the nine months and quarter ended September 30, 2006, related to the previously announced October 5, 2006 closing of the Lexford Housing Division disposition.

NOI represents rental income less property and maintenance expense, real estate tax and insurance expense, and property management expense. The Company believes that NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the Company's apartment communities. All same-store results exclude the Lexford Housing Division.

Expected EPS is calculated on a basis consistent with actual EPS. Due to the uncertain timing and extent of property dispositions and the resulting gains/losses on sales, actual EPS could differ materially from expected EPS. (2) The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") defines funds from operations ("FFO") (April 2002 White Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. Expected FFO is calculated on a basis consistent with actual FFO.
