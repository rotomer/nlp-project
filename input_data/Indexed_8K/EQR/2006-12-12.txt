C:\docs\1802883cImpairment_12-12-06_b_(3)_en.DOC Item 2.06 Material Impairments On December 6, 2006, Equity Residential (together with its operating partnership, ERP Operating Limited Partnership, the "Company") concluded that a material asset impairment charge of $30 million related to its corporate housing business was required under generally accepted accounting principles. The conclusion to take this non-cash charge was based on a review by the Company of the existing intangible assets reflected on the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as Goodwill related to its corporate housing business. The Company does not carry any other Goodwill amount on its consolidated balance sheets. The Company does not believe this impairment charge will result in any future cash expenditures.

Exhibit 99.1 Equity Residential Increases Common Share Dividend 4.5% Takes Goodwill Impairment Charge on Corporate Housing Business; Revises FFO Guidance for 2006 CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 12, 2006--Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR), today announced that the company declared dividends on its common and preferred shares. The company increased its common share dividend to $1.85 per share annually, an increase of 4.5 percent. In addition, the company announced that it will recognize a charge to fourth quarter earnings as a result of the write down of the carrying value of its corporate housing business. Fourth Quarter Dividends The quarterly common share dividend of $0.4625 per share will be paid on January 12, 2007 to shareholders of record on December 22, 2006. "The excellent performance of our core portfolio and our expectations for continued momentum in 2007 have allowed us to reward our shareholders with this dividend increase," said David J. Neithercut, Equity Residential's President and CEO. The following regular quarterly dividends will be paid on the company's preferred/depositary shares: Series Record Date Payment Date Amount/Share - -------- -------------------- -------------------- ---------------- D December 22, 2006 January 16, 2007 $0.5375 E December 22, 2006 January 2, 2007 $0.4375 H December 22, 2006 January 2, 2007 $0.4375 K December 21, 2006 January 2, 2007 $1.03625 N December 22, 2006 January 16, 2007 $0.405 Impairment Charge and Revised FFO Guidance The company is recording an asset impairment charge of $30 million related to its corporate housing business. This non-cash charge is the result of a review of the existing intangible assets reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as Goodwill. The company does not carry any other Goodwill amount. As a result of the charge, the company is revising its Funds from Operations (FFO) guidance range for both the fourth quarter and full year 2006 by $0.09 per share. The company now expects to report FFO per share of $0.45 to $0.48 for the fourth quarter and $2.23 to $2.26 per share for the full year. See the attached schedule for this revised guidance. "While corporate housing is an ongoing part of our business, driving more than $13 million in annual rental revenues to our properties, those revenues are not used in determining value on a GAAP basis. Therefore, based on a periodic review of the third party value of this business unit, we are compelled to make this adjustment. However, we continue to believe that our corporate housing business provides value to Equity Residential and we will continue to support their efforts for growth and increased profitability while serving their important corporate customer base," said Mr. Neithercut. The company expects to announce results for the fourth quarter and full year 2006 on Tuesday, February 6, 2007 and host a conference call to discuss those results and the company's outlook for 2007 on Wednesday, February 7, 2007 at 10:00 a.m. CT.

Expected EPS is calculated on a basis consistent with actual EPS. Due to the uncertain timing and extent of property dispositions and the resulting gains/losses on sales, actual EPS could differ materially from expected EPS. (2) The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") defines funds from operations ("FFO") (April 2002 White Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. Expected FFO is calculated on a basis consistent with actual FFO. (3) The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company, because it is a recognized measure of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. FFO in and of itself does not represent net income or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO should not be exclusively considered as an alternative to net income or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The Company's calculation of FFO may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies.
