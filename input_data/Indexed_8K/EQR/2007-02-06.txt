Exhibit 99.1 Equity Residential Reports 2006 Results Year over Year Same-Store NOI Increases 7.0 Percent CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 6, 2007--Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR) today reported results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2006. All per share results are reported on a fully diluted basis. "2006 was a terrific year for Equity Residential, having produced some of the best same-store results in our history. In addition, we successfully continued the transformation of our portfolio with the sale of our Lexford portfolio and the addition of numerous high-quality assets across our core markets," said David J. Neithercut, Equity Residential's President and CEO. "2007 should be another very good year as favorable apartment fundamentals continue to drive strong same-store results. Our 2007 FFO guidance range of $2.25 to $2.35 per share reflects our expectations for solid core growth offset by dilution from the Lexford sale and lower profits from condominium sales. Despite this short-term dilution, Equity Residential is positioned for greater long term growth and capital appreciation." Fourth Quarter 2006 For the quarter ended December 31, 2006, the company reported earnings of $1.54 per share compared to $0.74 per share in the fourth quarter of 2005. The quarterly increase is primarily attributable to $0.94 per share in higher gains on sales of properties in the fourth quarter of 2006, which includes the sale of the company's Lexford Housing Division, net of the goodwill impairment charge discussed below. The company's fourth quarter and full year results reflect the previously announced goodwill impairment charge of $0.09 per share taken by the company in relation to its corporate housing business. Funds from Operations (FFO) for the quarter ended December 31, 2006 were $0.49 per share compared to $0.66 per share in the same period of 2005. This decrease is primarily attributable to the above referenced goodwill impairment charge as well as a gain of $0.06 per share from the sale of a land parcel in the fourth quarter of 2005. Total revenues from continuing operations for the quarter were $517.9 million compared to $449.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. The primary components of this $68.4 million increase are the properties acquired in 2005 and 2006. Year Ended December 31, 2006 For the year ended December 31, 2006, the company reported earnings of $3.50 per share compared to $2.79 per share in the same period of 2005. FFO for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $2.27 per share compared to $2.52 per share in the same period of 2005. Total revenues from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $2.0 billion compared to $1.7 billion in the same period of 2005. Same-Store Results On a same-store fourth quarter to fourth quarter comparison, which includes 133,988 units, revenues increased 5.3 percent, expenses increased 5.2 percent and NOI increased 5.4 percent. The increase in same-store revenues was driven primarily by continued increases in rental rate. On a same-store year to year comparison, which includes 128,133 units, revenues increased 5.8 percent, expenses increased 4.0 percent and NOI increased 7.0 percent. Portfolio Activity During the fourth quarter of 2006, the company acquired seven properties, consisting of 1,288 units, for an aggregate purchase price of $311.1 million at an average capitalization (cap) rate of 4.4 percent, and three land parcels for $40.9 million. Also during the quarter, the company sold, including its Lexford Housing Division, 295 properties, consisting of 28,947 units, for an aggregate sale price of $1.2 billion at an average cap rate of 7.3 percent generating an unlevered internal rate of return (IRR) of 14.1 percent. The average cap rate and IRR for the non-Lexford property sales were 6.1 percent and 10.1 percent, respectively. In addition, the company sold 240 condominium units for $45.3 million. During 2006, the company acquired 35 properties, consisting of 8,768 units, for an aggregate purchase price of $1.75 billion at an average cap rate of 4.9 percent, and nine land parcels for $134.4 million. During 2006, the company sold 335 properties, consisting of 39,608 units, for an aggregate sale price of $2.26 billion at an average cap rate of 6.4 percent generating an unlevered IRR of 13.1 percent. The average cap rate and IRR for the non-Lexford property sales were 5.5 percent and 11.9 percent, respectively. In addition, the company sold 1,069 condominium units for $216.0 million and two land parcels for $1.6 million. Lexford Housing Division Sale On October 5, 2006, Equity Residential completed the sale of its Lexford Housing Division, comprised of 289 properties consisting of 27,115 apartment units, for a cash purchase price of $1.086 billion.

Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. The April 2002 White Paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from FFO for previously depreciated operating properties only. Once the Company commences the conversion of units to condominiums, it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property. (2) The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company, because it is a recognized measure of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. FFO in and of itself does not represent net income or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO should not be exclusively considered as an alternative to net income or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The Company's calculation of FFO may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies. (3) Gain on sales of discontinued operations, net of minority interests, has been reduced by approximately $4.5 million in one- time accrued retention benefits for the year ended December 31, 2006, related to the previously announced October 5, 2006 closing of the Lexford Housing Division disposition.

Expected EPS is calculated on a basis consistent with actual EPS. Due to the uncertain timing and extent of property dispositions and the resulting gains/losses on sales, actual EPS could differ materially from expected EPS. (2) The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") defines funds from operations ("FFO") (April 2002 White Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. Expected FFO is calculated on a basis consistent with actual FFO.
