Exhibit 99.1 Equity Residential Reports First Quarter Results CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 1, 2007--Equity Residential (NYSE: EQR) today reported results for the quarter ended March 31, 2007. All per share results are reported on a fully diluted basis. "Our first quarter operating performance was in line with our expectations with very good occupancy levels across our largest markets and strong revenue growth despite working off of a very challenging comparison to first quarter 2006," said David J. Neithercut, Equity Residential's President and CEO. "We continue to see good job growth and limited new supply in many of our markets, reinforcing our belief that they will produce good results for the remainder of the year. As we head into our primary leasing season, however, we have recently begun to see certain markets experiencing somewhat slower sequential rental rate growth than we had hoped. Nevertheless, we still expect the portfolio to produce good full year revenue growth." First Quarter 2007 For the quarter ended March 31, 2007, the company reported earnings of $0.40 per share compared to $1.25 per share in the first quarter of 2006. The quarterly decrease is primarily attributable to $0.82 per share in higher gains on property sales in the first quarter of 2006. Funds from Operations (FFO) for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 were $0.55 per share compared to $0.56 per share in the same period of 2006. The quarterly decrease is primarily attributable to higher gains on condominium sales in the first quarter of 2006. The company's FFO of $0.55 per share for the quarter exceeded the guidance range of $0.48 to $0.52 per share provided by the company in its fourth quarter 2006 earnings release on February 6, 2007. The items describing the difference between actual FFO per share for the quarter and the midpoint of the company's original guidance range are listed on page 24 of this release. The difference was primarily due to changes in timing on certain anticipated income and expense items. The main items were: -- Certain expenses were postponed to future quarters in 2007 resulting in approximately $1.6 million less general and administrative expenses than projected; -- The company recorded a reduction to general and administrative expense of $1.6 million due to the successful resolution of a certain lawsuit in Florida resulting in the reversal of the majority of a previously established litigation reserve; -- Due to a delay in the timing of certain dispositions to future quarters in 2007, the company incurred approximately $4.9 million less than projected in prepayment penalties and write-offs of unamortized deferred financing costs in connection with debt extinguishments; and -- The company's condominium conversion business closed additional units in the first quarter that were originally anticipated to close in subsequent quarters, resulting in additional net income and FFO of approximately $2.0 million. "Same-Store" Results On a "same-store" first quarter to first quarter comparison, which includes 133,703 units, revenues increased 5.2 percent, expenses increased 5.2 percent and NOI increased 5.2 percent. The increase in same-store revenues, which came in as expected, was driven primarily by increases in average rental rates and a slight increase in occupancy. The increase in same-store expenses was slightly higher than expected. Certain maintenance related expenses were front loaded and should trend lower throughout the remainder of the year. In addition, the company incurred higher than anticipated weather related expenses in Denver and Washington, D.C. Acquisitions/Dispositions During the first quarter of 2007, the company acquired thirteen properties, consisting of 3,899 units, for an aggregate purchase price of $674.2 million at an average capitalization (cap) rate of 5.3 percent and three land parcels for $42.5 million. Also during the quarter, the company sold 12 properties, consisting of 3,711 units, for an aggregate sale price of $253.9 million at an average cap rate of 6.1 percent generating an unlevered internal rate of return (IRR) of 10.0 percent. In addition, the company sold 157 condominium units for $37.3 million. Share Repurchase During the first quarter of 2007, the company repurchased and retired 4,140,254 of its common shares at an average purchase price of $48.76 per share for an aggregate purchase of approximately $201.9 million. The company's Board of Trustees has authorized an increase of approximately $200 million in the company's share repurchase program, bringing the amount currently available under the plan to $500 million. "We were pleased to take advantage of the excellent opportunity that the recent pullback in Equity Residential's common share price created for us to buy our portfolio at a significant discount to the value of our assets. Our Board has given us authorization to increase the amount we have available and we will continue to create value for our shareholders by buying our own portfolio whenever an appropriate discount exists," said Mr. Neithercut. New Disclosure On pages 24 and 25 of this release, the company has provided new disclosure including: -- a reconciliation of guidance midpoint First Quarter 2007 FFO to actual First Quarter 2007 FFO; -- a breakout of items included in FFO in the First Quarters of both 2006 and 2007 that by their nature are not comparable from period to period; and -- additional assumptions used to create 2007 earnings guidance. Second Quarter 2007 Results Equity Residential expects to announce second quarter 2007 results on Tuesday, July 31, 2007 and host a conference call to discuss those results at Noon CT on Wednesday, August 1, 2007. Equity Residential is an S&P 500 company focused on the acquisition, development and management of high quality apartment properties in top U.S. growth markets.

Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. The April 2002 White Paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from FFO for previously depreciated operating properties only. Once the Company commences the conversion of units to condominiums, it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property. (2) The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company, because it is a recognized measure of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. FFO does not represent net income or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO should not be exclusively considered as an alternative to net income or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The Company's calculation of FFO may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies.

Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. Expected FFO is calculated on a basis consistent with actual FFO. (2)The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company, because it is a recognized measure of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. FFO does not represent net income or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO should not be exclusively considered as an alternative to net income or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The Company's calculation of FFO may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies. (3)Non-comparable items are those items included in FFO that by their nature are not comparable from period to period, such as net incremental gain on sales of condominium units, impairment charges, debt extinguishment costs and redemption premiums on Preferred Shares/Preference Interests. (4)Earnings per share ("EPS") represents net income per share calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Expected EPS is calculated on a basis consistent with actual EPS. Due to the uncertain timing and extent of property dispositions and the resulting gains/losses on sales, actual EPS could differ materially from expected EPS.
