EXHIBIT 99.1 Equity Residential Reports Second Quarter Results CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 31, 2007--Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR) today reported results for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2007. All per share results are reported on a fully diluted basis. "The first half of 2007 produced good operating results with same-store revenue growth of 4.8 percent and net operating income (NOI) growth of 5.4 percent," said David J. Neithercut, Equity Residential's President and CEO. "And we will put more money in the bank in the second half of the year than the first half of the year. But our revenue growth will slow in the second half of the year because we will not see the same pick up that we saw in the second half of 2006, caused primarily by markets negatively impacted by excessive condominium construction and/or reversion and high single family home inventories, specifically Florida, Phoenix, the Inland Empire and Washington, D.C. As a result, we have lowered our guidance for same-store performance, which should produce $0.05 per share less in Funds from Operations (FFO) than expected for the full year. However, we are leaving our full year FFO guidance range of $2.25 to $2.35 per share unchanged because lower than expected G&A costs and a land sale, which combined, will offset the same-store shortfall." Second Quarter 2007 For the quarter ended June 30, 2007, the company reported earnings of $0.95 per share compared to $0.51 per share in the second quarter of 2006. The increase is primarily attributable to higher gains on property sales in the second quarter of 2007. FFO for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 were $0.60 per share compared to $0.61 per share in the same period of 2006. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower gains on sales of condominium units and higher debt extinguishment costs in the second quarter of 2007 than in the second quarter of 2006, partially offset by higher gains on the sale of a land parcel in the second quarter of 2007. The company's FFO of $0.60 per share exceeded its second quarter guidance range of $0.54 to $0.58 per share primarily for the following reasons: -- A $4.5 million gain on the sale of a land parcel in New York City that had not been included in guidance; -- Approximately $3.0 million higher gains than expected from the company's condominium division; and -- Approximately $1.5 million lower than projected debt prepayment penalties and write-offs of unamortized financing costs. These and other items describing the difference between actual FFO per share for the quarter and the midpoint of the company's original guidance range are listed on page 26 of this release. Six Months Ended June 30, 2007 For the six months ended June 30, 2007, the company reported earnings of $1.35 per share compared to $1.76 per share in the same period of 2006. FFO for the six months ended June 30, 2007 were $1.15 per share compared to $1.17 per share in the same period of 2006. Same-Store Results On a same-store second quarter to second quarter comparison, revenues increased 4.3 percent, expenses increased 2.6 percent and NOI increased 5.4 percent. The increase in same-store revenues was driven primarily by increases in average rental rates and a slight increase in occupancy. On a same-store six-month to six-month comparison, revenues increased 4.8 percent, expenses increased 3.8 percent and NOI increased 5.4 percent. Acquisitions/Dispositions "Through the first half of the year we continued to see very stable pricing for property transactions with little or no movement in cap rates on both assets we were acquiring or selling. As a result, we were able to continue to exit non-core markets and increase our investments in our core markets at a 100 basis point cap rate spread. However, we are revising our acquisition and disposition targets for the full year to $1.75 billion each due to an expectation that the recent pull back in the debt markets will cause a reduction in transaction activity," said Mr. Neithercut. During the second quarter of 2007, the company acquired 15 properties, consisting of 2,310 apartment units, for an aggregate purchase price of $551.6 million at an average capitalization (cap) rate of 4.1 percent. Included in the acquisitions for the quarter were three rent stabilized properties on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. This $180.0 million portfolio was acquired at a cap rate of 2.7 percent and is projected to produce a year two yield in excess of 4.0 percent. Excluding these properties, the average cap rate would have been 4.8 percent for the quarter ended June 30, 2007. The company also acquired two land parcels for $23.0 million during the quarter. Also during the quarter, the company sold 25 properties, consisting of 6,307 apartment units, for an aggregate sale price of $536.7 million at an average cap rate of 5.7 percent generating an unlevered internal rate of return (IRR) of 11.8 percent. In addition, the company sold 226 condominium units for $65.8 million and one land parcel for $40.7 million. In the first six months of 2007, the company acquired 28 properties, consisting of 6,209 apartment units, for an aggregate purchase price of $1.2 billion at an average cap rate of 4.8 percent. Excluding the acquisition of three rent stabilized properties on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, the average cap rate would have been 5.2 percent for the six months ended June 30, 2007. The company also acquired five land parcels for $65.5 million during the first six months of 2007. During the six months ended June 30, 2007, the company sold 37 properties, consisting of 10,018 apartment units, for an aggregate sale price of $790.6 million at an average cap rate of 5.8 percent generating an unlevered IRR of 11.2 percent. In addition, the company sold 383 condominium units for $103.1 million and one land parcel for $40.7 million. Share Repurchase During the second quarter of 2007, the company repurchased and retired 14,319,952 of its common shares at an average price of $46.38 per share for an aggregate purchase of approximately $664.2 million. Through the first six months of 2007, the company repurchased and retired 18,460,206 of its common shares at an average price of $46.91 per share for an aggregate purchase of approximately $866.0 million. Since the end of the second quarter, the company has repurchased and retired 1,137,900 of its common shares at an average price of $45.35 per share for an aggregate purchase of approximately $51.6 million. The company currently has $284.2 million remaining under its share repurchase program. Preferred Share Redemption On July 16, 2007, the company redeemed its 8.60 percent Series D Preferred Shares at its cash liquidation value of $175.0 million plus accrued and unpaid dividends. As a result of this redemption, the company will record an expense of approximately $6.1 million, or approximately $0.02 per share, in the third quarter of 2007 for the write-off of the original issuance costs. Debt Offerings On June 4, 2007, the company issued $650.0 million of unsecured notes maturing June 15, 2017 and $350.0 million of unsecured notes maturing October 1, 2012. The all-in effective interest rates are 5.89 percent and 5.74 percent, respectively. Proceeds from the issuances were used to pay down the company's unsecured revolving credit facility. On July 19, 2007, the company issued $300.0 million of mortgage notes maturing February 1, 2019. The all-in effective interest rate is 6.0 percent. Proceeds from the issuance were used to pay down the company's unsecured revolving credit facility. Third Quarter 2007 Guidance The company's actual FFO of $0.60 per share for the second quarter of 2007 is higher than the guidance range of $0.54 to $0.58 per share projected for the third quarter of 2007 primarily as a result of the following items: -- Lower expected property NOI, which will be partially offset by lower debt extinguishment costs and higher interest and other income; -- Lower anticipated gains on sales of condos in the third quarter; -- The $6.1 million expense that the company will record in the third quarter of 2007 for the write-off of the original issuance costs related to the redemption of the Series D Preferred Shares; and -- The $4.5 million gain on the sale of the land parcel in New York City during the second quarter of 2007. Equity Residential expects to announce third quarter 2007 results on Tuesday, October 30, 2007 and host a conference call to discuss those results at 10:00 a.m. CT on Wednesday, October 31, 2007.

Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. The April 2002 White Paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from FFO for previously depreciated operating properties only. Once the Company commences the conversion of units to condominiums, it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property. FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units is calculated on a basis consistent with net income available to Common Shares and reflects adjustments to net income for preferred distributions and premiums on redemption of preferred shares in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The equity positions of various individuals and entities that contributed their properties to the Operating Partnership in exchange for OP Units are collectively referred to as the "Minority Interests - Operating Partnership". Subject to certain restrictions, the Minority Interests - Operating Partnership may exchange their OP Units for EQR Common Shares on a one-for-one basis. (2) The Company believes that FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company, because they are recognized measures of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units can help compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units do not represent net income, net income available to Common Shares or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units should not be exclusively considered as alternatives to net income, net income available to Common Shares or net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The Company's calculation of FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies.

Reconciliations of EPS to FFO for Pages 26 and 27 (Amounts in thousands except per share data) (All per share data is diluted) Expected Expected Expected Q2 2007 Q3 2007 2007 Amounts Per Share Per Share Per Share --------- --------- --------- --------- $1.79 to $3.35 to Expected EPS - Diluted (4) $306,700 $0.975 $1.83 $3.45 Add: Expected depreciation expense 154,530 0.492 0.52 2.05 Less: Expected net gain on sales (4) (283,985) (0.903) (1.77) (3.15) --------- --------- --------- --------- $0.54 to $2.25 to Expected FFO - Diluted (1) (2) $177,245 $0.564 $0.58 $2.35 ========= ========= ========= ========= Definitions and Footnotes for Pages 26 and 27 (1) The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") defines funds from operations ("FFO") (April 2002 White Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP")), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. The April 2002 White Paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from FFO for previously depreciated operating properties only. Once the Company commences the conversion of units to condominiums, it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property. FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units is calculated on a basis consistent with net income available to Common Shares and reflects adjustments to net income for preferred distributions and premiums on redemption of preferred shares in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The equity positions of various individuals and entities that contributed their properties to the Operating Partnership in exchange for OP Units are collectively referred to as the "Minority Interests - Operating Partnership". Subject to certain restrictions, the Minority Interests - Operating Partnership may exchange their OP Units for EQR Common Shares on a one-for-one basis. (2) The Company believes that FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company, because they are recognized measures of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units can help compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units do not represent net income, net income available to Common Shares or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units should not be exclusively considered as alternatives to net income, net income available to Common Shares or net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The Company's calculation of FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies. (3) Non-comparable items are those items included in FFO that by their nature are not comparable from period to period, such as net incremental gain on sales of condominium units, impairment charges, debt extinguishment costs and redemption premiums on Preferred Shares/Preference Interests. (4) Earnings per share ("EPS") represents net income per share calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Expected EPS is calculated on a basis consistent with actual EPS. Due to the uncertain timing and extent of property dispositions and the resulting gains/losses on sales, actual EPS could differ materially from expected EPS.
