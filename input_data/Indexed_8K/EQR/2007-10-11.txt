Item 2.03       Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation Under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
On October 5, 2007, ERP Operating Limited Partnership (the "Operating Partnership") entered into a new senior unsecured credit agreement for a $500 million term loan facility.  The full principal amount of the loan facility will be funded in a single borrowing no later than October 13, 2007 (subject to any increases in the loan facility as described below).  The Operating Partnership plans to use the proceeds from the loan facility to pay down a portion of the amount outstanding under the Operating Partnership's existing $1.5 billion long-term revolving credit facility (which will remain in place) and for general corporate purposes.  Equity Residential, the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, and Lexford Properties, L.P., a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, are guarantors of the Operating Partnership's obligations under the loan facility.  The loan facility is with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as syndication agent, Citicorp North America Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Regions Bank, The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC, and U.S. Bank National Association, as documentation agents, and a syndicate of other banks.
The new loan facility matures on October 5, 2010, subject to two one-year extension options exercisable by the Operating Partnership.  The interest rate on the unpaid balance under the new loan facility will generally be LIBOR plus a spread, which is dependent on the current credit rating of the Operating Partnership's long-term senior unsecured debt and is currently 42.5 basis points.  The Operating Partnership has the ability to increase its borrowings under the loan facility to a total of $750 million, provided one or more existing or new lenders are willing to provide such increased borrowings.  The loan facility does not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at the Operating Partnership's option without penalty or premium (other than certain fees with respect to Euro Dollar loans prepaid prior to the end of an interest period).  The covenants contained in the new loan facility are the same as those contained in the Operating Partnership's existing $1.5 billion long-term revolving credit facility.

SECTION 8.1         .  If on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period for any Euro-Dollar Borrowing:
Basis for Determining Interest Rate Inadequate or Unfair
(a)           the Administrative Agent determines in good faith that deposits in dollars (in the applicable amounts) are not being offered in the relevant market for such Interest Period, or
(b)           Banks having 50% or more of the aggregate amount of the Commitments advise the Administrative Agent that the Euro-Dollar Rate, as determined by the Administrative Agent will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to each such Bank of funding its Euro-Dollar Loans for such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Banks, whereupon until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligations of the Banks to make Euro-Dollar Loans shall be suspended.  In such event, unless the Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent at least two Business Days before the date of any Euro-Dollar Borrowing for which a Notice of Borrowing has previously been given that it elects not to borrow on such date, such Borrowing shall instead be made as a Base Rate Borrowing.  For purposes of Section 8.1(b), in determining whether the Euro-Dollar Rate, as determined by Administrative Agent, will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to any Bank of funding its Euro-Dollar Loans for such Interest Period, such determination will be based solely on the ability of such Bank to obtain matching funds in the London interbank market at a reasonably equivalent rate.
SECTION 8.2         .

Illegality
63
above to make Euro-Dollar Loans, shall be suspended.  With respect to Euro-Dollar Loans, before giving any notice to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section, such Bank shall designate a different Euro-Dollar Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice and will not, in the judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank.  If such Bank shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain and fund any of its outstanding Euro-Dollar Loans to maturity and shall so specify in such notice, the Borrower shall be deemed to have delivered a Notice of Interest Rate Election and such Euro-Dollar Loan shall be converted as of such date to a Base Rate Loan (without payment of any amounts that Borrower would otherwise be obligated to pay pursuant to Section 2.13 with respect to Loans converted pursuant to this Section 8.2) in an equal principal amount from such Bank (on which interest and principal shall be payable contemporaneously with the related Euro-Dollar Loans of the other Banks), and such Bank shall make such a Base Rate Loan.
If, at any time, it shall be unlawful for any Bank to make, maintain or fund its Euro-Dollar Loans, the Borrower shall have the right, upon five (5) Business Day's notice to the Administrative Agent, to either (x) cause a bank, reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, to offer to purchase the Commitment of such Bank for an amount equal to such Bank's outstanding Loans and all amounts due such Bank hereunder (including, without limitation, interest and all amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.13), and to become a Bank hereunder, or obtain the agreement of one or more existing Banks to offer to purchase the Commitment of such Bank for such amount, which offer such Bank is hereby required to accept, or (y) to repay in full all Loans then outstanding of such Bank, together with interest thereon and all other amounts due such Bank hereunder (including, without limitation, amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.13), upon which event, such Bank's Commitment shall be deemed to be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.11(e).  Any Bank subject to this paragraph shall retain the benefits of Sections 8.3, 8.4 and 9.3 for the period prior to such purchase or cancellation.
SECTION 8.3         .
Increased Cost and Reduced Return
(a)           If, on or after the date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) made after the Closing Date of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve (including, without limitation, any such requirement imposed by the Federal Reserve Board (but excluding with respect to any Euro-Dollar Loan any such requirement to the extent reflected in an applicable Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage)), special deposit,
64

(b)           If any Bank shall have reasonably determined that, after the date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change in any law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) made after the Closing Date of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on capital of such Bank (or its Parent) as a consequence of such Bank's obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Bank (or its Parent) could have achieved but for such adoption, change, request or directive (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount reasonably deemed by such Bank to be material, then from time to time, within 15 days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank (or its Parent) for such reduction to the extent such Bank generally imposes such additional amounts on other borrowers of such Bank in similar circumstances.
(c)           Each Bank will promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle such Bank to compensation pursuant to this Section and will designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the reasonable judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank.

65
notify Borrower of any such event within 90 days following the end of the month during which such event occurred, then Borrower's liability for any amounts described in this Section incurred by such Bank as a result of such event shall be limited to those attributable to the period occurring subsequent to the ninetieth (90th) day prior to the date upon which such Bank actually notified Borrower of the occurrence of such event.

SECTION 9.16       .
Bank's Failure to Fund
(a)           Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Bank prior to the date of any Borrowing that such Bank will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Bank's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Bank has made such share available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with subsection (b) of Section 2.4, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to Borrower on such date a corresponding amount.  If and to the extent that such Bank shall not have so made such share available to the Administrative Agent, such Bank and Borrower severally agree to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.4(c).  If such Bank shall repay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Bank's Loan included in such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement as of the date of such Borrowing.  Nothing contained in this Section or Section 2.4(c) shall be deemed to reduce the Commitment of any Bank or in any way affect the rights of Borrower with respect to any defaulting Bank or Administrative Agent.  The failure of any Bank to make available to the Administrative Agent such Bank's share of any Borrowing in accordance with Section 2.4(b) shall not relieve any other Bank of its obligations to fund its Commitment, in accordance with the provisions hereof.
(b)           If a Bank does not remit to Administrative Agent such Bank's Pro Rata Share of a Loan in accordance herewith, then neither Administrative Agent nor the
78
other Banks shall be required or obligated to fund such Bank's Pro Rata Share of such Loan.
(c)           As used herein, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:
(i)                    "" shall mean any Bank which (x) does not remit to the Administrative Agent such Bank's Pro Rata Share of a Loan in accordance herewith for a period of five (5) Business Days after notice of such failure from Administrative Agent, (y) shall otherwise fail to perform such Bank's obligations under the Loan Documents for a period of five (5) Business Days after notice of such failure from Administrative Agent, or (z) shall fail to pay the Administrative Agent or any other Bank, as the case may be, upon demand, such Bank's Pro Rata Share of any costs, expenses or disbursements incurred or made by the Administrative Agent and payable by such Bank pursuant to the terms of the Loan Documents for a period of five (5) Business Days after notice of such failure from Administrative Agent, and in all cases, such failure is not as a result of a good faith dispute as to whether such advance is properly required to be made pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, or as to whether such other performance or payment is properly required pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement.
Defaulting Bank
(ii)                   ""  means any Defaulting Bank which has not (x) fully cured each and every default on its part under the Loan Documents and (y) unconditionally tendered to the Administrative Agent such Defaulting Bank's Pro Rata Share of all costs, expenses and disbursements required to be paid or reimbursed pursuant to the terms of the Loan Documents.
Junior Creditor
(iii)                  "" means, as of any date, the receipt by the Banks who are not Junior Creditors of an amount of cash, in lawful currency of the United States, sufficient to indefeasibly pay in full all Senior Debt.
Payment in Full
(iv)                  "" means (x) collectively, any and all indebtedness, obligations and liabilities of the Borrower to the Banks who are not Junior Creditors, or any of them, from time to time, whether fixed or contingent, direct or indirect, joint or several, due or not due, liquidated or unliquidated, determined or undetermined, arising by contract, operation of law or otherwise, whether on open account or evidenced by one or more instruments, and whether for principal, premium, interest (including, without limitation, interest accruing after the filing of a petition initiating any proceeding referred to in Section 6.1(f) or (g)), reimbursement for fees, indemnities, costs, expenses or otherwise, which arise under, in connection with or in respect of the Loans or the Loan Documents, and (y) any and all deferrals, renewals, extensions and refundings of, or
Senior Debt
79
amendments, restatements, rearrangements, modifications or supplements to, any such indebtedness, obligation or liability.
(v)                   ""  means (x) any and all indebtedness, obligations and liabilities of Borrower to one or more Junior Creditors from time to time, whether fixed or contingent, direct or indirect, joint or several, due or not due, liquidated or unliquidated, determined or undetermined, arising by contract, operation of law or otherwise, whether on open account or evidenced by one or more instruments, and whether for principal, premium, interest (including, without limitation, interest accruing after the filing of a petition initiating any proceeding referred to in Section 6.1(f) or (g)), reimbursement for fees, indemnities, costs, expenses or otherwise, which arise under, in connection with or in respect of the Loans or the Loan Documents, and (y) any and all deferrals, renewals, extensions and refundings of, or amendments, restatements, rearrangements, modifications or supplements to, any such indebtedness, obligation or liability.
Subordinated Debt
(d)           Immediately upon a Bank's becoming a Junior Creditor, no Junior Creditor shall, prior to Payment in Full of all Senior Debt:
(i)            accelerate, demand payment of, sue upon, collect, or receive any payment upon, in any manner, or satisfy or otherwise discharge, any Subordinated Debt, whether for principal, interest or otherwise;
(ii)           take or enforce any Liens to secure Subordinated Debt or attach or levy upon any assets of Borrower to enforce any Subordinated Debt;
(iii)          enforce or apply any security for any Subordinated Debt; or
(iv)          incur any debt or liability, or the like, to, or receive any loan, return of capital, advance, gift or any other property from, the Borrower.
(e)           In the event of:
(i)                    any insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization, readjustment, composition or other similar proceeding relating to Borrower;
(ii)                   any liquidation, dissolution or other winding-up of the Borrower, voluntary or involuntary, whether or not involving insolvency, reorganization or bankruptcy proceedings;
80
(iii)                  any assignment by the Borrower for the benefit of creditors;
(iv)                  any sale or other transfer of all or substantially all assets of the Borrower; or
(v)                   any other marshaling of the assets of the Borrower;
each of the Banks shall first have received Payment in Full of all Senior Debt before any payment or distribution, whether in cash, securities or other property, shall be made in respect of or upon any Subordinated Debt.  Any payment or distribution, whether in cash, securities or other property that would otherwise be payable or deliverable in respect of Subordinated Debt to any Junior Creditor but for this Agreement shall be paid or delivered directly to the Administrative Agent for distribution to the Banks in accordance with this Agreement until Payment in Full of all Senior Debt.  If any Junior Creditor receives any such payment or distribution, it shall promptly pay over or deliver the same to the Administrative Agent for application in accordance with the preceding sentence.
(f)            Each Junior Creditor shall file in any bankruptcy or other proceeding of Borrower in which the filing of claims is required by law, all claims relating to Subordinated Debt that such Junior Creditor may have against Borrower and assign to the Banks who are not Junior Creditors all rights of such Junior Creditor thereunder.  If such Junior Creditor does not file any such claim prior to forty-five (45) days before the expiration of the time to file such claim, Administrative Agent, as attorney-in-fact for such Junior Creditor, is hereby irrevocably authorized to do so in the name of such Junior Creditor or, in Administrative Agent's sole discretion, to assign the claim to a nominee and to cause proof of claim to be filed in the name of such nominee.  The foregoing power of attorney is coupled with an interest and cannot be revoked.  The Administrative Agent shall, to the exclusion of each Junior Creditor, have the sole right, subject to Section 9.5 hereof, to accept or reject any plan proposed in any such proceeding and to take any other action that a party filing a claim is entitled to take.  In all such cases, whether in administration, bankruptcy or otherwise, the Person or Persons authorized to pay such claim shall pay to Administrative Agent the amount payable on such claim and, to the full extent necessary for that purpose, each Junior Creditor hereby transfers and assigns to the Administrative Agent all of the Junior Creditor's rights to any such payments or distributions to which Junior Creditor would otherwise be entitled.
(g)           (i)  If any payment or distribution of any character or any security, whether in cash, securities or other property, shall be received by any Junior Creditor in contravention of any of the terms hereof, such payment or distribution or security shall be received for the benefit of, and shall promptly be paid over or delivered and transferred to, Administrative Agent for application to the payment of all Senior Debt, to the extent
81
necessary to achieve Payment in Full.  In the event of the failure of any Junior Creditor to endorse or assign any such payment, distribution or security, Administrative Agent is hereby irrevocably authorized to endorse or assign the same as attorney-in-fact for such Junior Creditor.
(ii)  Each Junior Creditor shall take such action (including, without limitation, the execution and filing of a financing statement with respect to this Agreement and the execution, verification, delivery and filing of proofs of claim, consents, assignments or other instructions that Administrative Agent may require from time to time in order to prove or realize upon any rights or claims pertaining to Subordinated Debt or to effectuate the full benefit of the subordination contained herein) as may, in Administrative Agent's sole and absolute discretion, be necessary or desirable to assure the effectiveness of the subordination effected by this Agreement.
(h)           (i)  Each Bank that becomes a Junior Creditor understands and acknowledges by its execution hereof that each other Bank is entering into this Agreement and the other Loan Documents in reliance upon the absolute subordination in right of payment and in time of payment of Subordinated Debt to Senior Debt as set forth herein.
(ii)  Only upon the Payment in Full of all Senior Debt shall any Junior Creditor be subrogated to any remaining rights of the Banks which are not Defaulting Banks to receive payments or distributions of assets of the Borrower made on or applicable to any Senior Debt.
(iii)  Each Junior Creditor agrees that it will deliver all instruments or other writings evidencing any Subordinated Debt held by it to Administrative Agent, promptly after request therefor by the Administrative Agent.
(iv)  No Junior Creditor may at any time sell, assign or otherwise transfer any Subordinated Debt, or any portion thereof, including, without limitation, the granting of any Lien thereon, unless and until satisfaction of the requirements of Section 9.6 above and the proposed transferee shall have assumed in writing the obligation of the Junior Creditor to the Banks under this Agreement, in a form acceptable to the Administrative Agent.
(v)  If any of the Senior Debt should be invalidated, avoided or set aside, the subordination provided for herein nevertheless shall continue in full force and effect and, as between the Banks which are not Defaulting Banks and all Junior Creditors, shall be and be deemed to remain in full force and effect.
82
 
(vi)  Each Junior Creditor hereby irrevocably waives, in respect of Subordinated Debt, all rights (x) under Sections 361 through 365, 502(e) and 509 of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar sections hereafter in effect under any other Federal or state laws or legal or equitable principles relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganizations, liquidations or otherwise for the relief of debtors or protection of creditors), and (y) to seek or obtain conversion to a different type of proceeding or to seek or obtain dismissal of a proceeding, in each case in relation to a bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency or other proceeding under similar laws with respect to the Borrower.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Junior Creditor hereby specifically waives (A) the right to seek to give credit (secured or otherwise) to the Borrower in any way under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code unless the same is subordinated in all respects to Senior Debt in a manner acceptable to Administrative Agent in its sole and absolute discretion and (B) the right to receive any collateral security (including any "super priority" or equal or "priming" or replacement Lien) for any Subordinated Debt unless the Banks which are not Defaulting Banks have received a senior position acceptable to the Banks in their sole and absolute discretion to secure all Senior Debt (in the same collateral to the extent collateral is involved).
(i)                    (i)  In addition to and not in limitation of the subordination effected by this Section 9.16, the Administrative Agent and each of the Banks which are not Defaulting Banks may in their respective sole and absolute discretion also exercise any and all other rights and remedies available at law or in equity in respect of a Defaulting Bank; and
(ii)  The Administrative Agent shall give each of the Banks notice of the occurrence of a default under this Section 9.16 by a Defaulting Bank and if the Administrative Agent and/or one or more of the other Banks shall, at their option, fund any amounts required to be paid or advanced by a Defaulting Bank, the other Banks who have elected not to fund any portion of such amounts shall not be liable for any reimbursements to the Administrative Agent and/or to such other funding Banks.
(j)            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained or implied herein, a Defaulting Bank shall not be entitled to vote on any matter as to which a vote by the Banks is required hereunder, including, without limitation, any actions or consents on the part of the Administrative Agent as to which the approval or consent of all the Banks or the Required Banks is required under Article VIII, Section 9.5 or elsewhere, so long as such Bank is a Defaulting Bank; , , that in the case of any vote requiring the unanimous consent of the Banks, if all the Banks other than the Defaulting Bank shall have voted in accordance with each other, then the Defaulting Bank shall be deemed to have voted in accordance with such Banks.
provided
however
 
83
 
(k)           Each of the Administrative Agent and any one or more of the Banks which are not Defaulting Banks may, at their respective option, (i) advance to the Borrower such Bank's Pro Rata Share of the Loans not advanced by a Defaulting Bank in accordance with the Loan Documents, or (ii) pay to the Administrative Agent such Bank's Pro Rata Share of any costs, expenses or disbursements incurred or made by the Administrative Agent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement not theretofore paid by a Defaulting Bank.  Immediately upon the making of any such advance by the Administrative Agent or any one of the Banks, such Bank's Pro Rata Share and the Pro Rata Share of the Defaulting Bank shall be recalculated to reflect such advance.  All payments, repayments and other disbursements of funds by the Administrative Agent to Banks shall thereupon and, at all times thereafter be made in accordance with such Bank's recalculated Pro Rata Share unless and until a Defaulting Bank shall fully cure all defaults on the part of such Defaulting Bank under the Loan Documents or otherwise existing in respect of the Loans or this Agreement, at which time the Pro Rata Share of the Bank(s) which advanced sums on behalf of the Defaulting Bank and of the Defaulting Bank shall be restored to their original percentages.

No Bank shall have any interest in any amount paid over by the Administrative Agent to the trustee or trustees in respect of any Public Debt (or to the holders thereof) pursuant to the foregoing authorization.

It is agreed that the Guaranteed Obligations are primary and this Guaranty shall be enforceable against Guarantor and its successors and assigns without the necessity for any suit or proceeding of any kind or nature whatsoever brought by the Administrative Agent or any Bank against Borrower or its respective successors or assigns or any other party or against any security for the payment and performance of the Guaranteed Obligations and without the necessity of any notice of non-payment or non-observance or of any notice of acceptance of this Guaranty or of any notice or demand to which Guarantor might otherwise be entitled (including, without limitation, diligence, presentment, notice of maturity, extension of time, change in nature or form of the Guaranteed Obligations, acceptance of further security, release of further security, imposition or agreement arrived at as to the amount of or the terms of the Guaranteed Obligations, notice of adverse change in Borrower's financial condition and any other fact which might materially increase the risk to Guarantor), all of which Guarantor hereby expressly waives; and Guarantor hereby expressly agrees that the validity of this Guaranty and the obligations of Guarantor hereunder shall in no way be terminated, affected, diminished, modified or impaired by reason of the assertion of or the failure to assert by the Administrative Agent or any Bank against Borrower or its respective successors or assigns, any of the rights or remedies reserved to the Administrative Agent and the Banks pursuant to the provisions of the Loan Documents.  Guarantor agrees that any notice or directive given at any time to the Administrative Agent which is inconsistent with the waiver in the immediately preceding sentence shall be void and may be ignored by the Administrative Agent and the Banks, and, in addition, may not be pleaded or
2
introduced as evidence in any litigation relating to this Guaranty for the reason that such pleading or introduction would be at variance with the written terms of this Guaranty, unless the Administrative Agent and the Banks have specifically agreed otherwise in a writing, signed by a duly authorized officer.  Guarantor specifically acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing waivers are of the essence of this transaction and that, but for this Guaranty and such waivers, the Administrative Agent and the Banks would decline to execute the Loan Documents.
3.  Guarantor waives, and covenants and agrees that it will not at any time insist upon, plead or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any and all appraisal, valuation, stay, extension, marshalling-of-assets or redemption laws, or right of homestead or exemption, whether now or at any time hereafter in force, which may delay, prevent or otherwise affect the performance by Guarantor of its obligations under, or the enforcement by the Administrative Agent of, this Guaranty. Guarantor further covenants and agrees not to set up or claim any defense, counterclaim, offset, set-off or other objection of any kind to any action, suit or proceeding at law, in equity or otherwise, or to any demand or claim that may be instituted or made by the Administrative Agent other than the defense of the actual timely payment and performance by Borrower of the Guaranteed Obligations; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not be deemed a waiver of Guarantor's right to assert any compulsory counterclaim, if such counterclaim is compelled under local law or rule of procedure, nor shall the foregoing be deemed a waiver of Guarantor's right to assert any claim which would constitute a defense, setoff, counterclaim or crossclaim of any nature whatsoever against Administrative Agent or any Bank in any separate action or proceeding.  Guarantor represents, warrants and agrees that, as of the date hereof, its obligations under this Guaranty are not subject to any counterclaims, offsets or defenses against the Administrative Agent or any Bank of any kind.
4.  The provisions of this Guaranty are for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Banks and their successors and permitted assigns, and nothing herein contained shall impair as between Borrower and the Administrative Agent and the Banks the obligations of Borrower under the Loan Documents.
5.  This Guaranty shall be a continuing, irrevocable, unconditional and absolute guaranty and the liability of Guarantor hereunder shall in no way be terminated, affected, modified, impaired or diminished by reason of the happening, from time to time, of any of the following, although without notice or the further consent of Guarantor:
3
 
(a)           any assignment, amendment, modification or waiver of or change in any of the terms, covenants, conditions or provisions of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or the Loan Documents or the invalidity or unenforceability of any of the foregoing; or
(b)           any extension of time that may be granted by the Administrative Agent or any Bank to Borrower, any guarantor, or their respective successors or assigns, heirs, executors, administrators or personal representatives; or
(c)           any action which the Administrative Agent or any Bank may take or fail to take under or in respect of any of the Loan Documents or by reason of any waiver or, or failure to enforce any of the rights, remedies, powers or privileges available to the Administrative Agent and the Banks under this Guaranty or available to the Administrative Agent and the Banks at law, in equity or otherwise, or any action on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Bank granting indulgence or extension in any form whatsoever; or
(d)           any sale, exchange, release, or other disposition of any property pledged, mortgaged or conveyed, or any property in which the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks have been granted a lien or security interest to secure any indebtedness of Borrower to the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks or any impairment of or failure to perfect any security interests therein; or
(e)           any release of any person or entity who may be liable in any manner for the payment and collection of any amounts owed by Borrower to the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks; or
(f)            the application of any sums by whomsoever paid or however realized to any amounts owing by Borrower to the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks under the Loan Documents in such manner as the Administrative Agent shall determine in its sole discretion; or
(g)           Borrower's or any guarantor's voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, sale of all or substantially all of their respective assets and liabilities, appointment of a trustee, receiver, liquidator, sequestrator or conservator for all or any part of Borrower's or any guarantor's assets, insolvency, bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors,
4
reorganization, arrangement, composition or readjustment, or the commencement of other similar proceedings affecting Borrower or any guarantor or any of the assets of any of them, including, without limitation, (i) the release or discharge of Borrower or any guarantor from the payment and performance of their respective obligations under any of the Loan Documents by operation of law, or (ii) the impairment, limitation or modification of the liability of Borrower or any guarantor in bankruptcy, or of any remedy for the enforcement of the Guaranteed Obligations under any of the Loan Documents, or Guarantor's liability under this Guaranty, resulting from the operation of any present or future provisions of the Bankruptcy Code or other present or future federal, state or applicable statute or law or from the decision in any court; or
(h)           any improper disposition by Borrower of the proceeds of the Loans, it being acknowledged by Guarantor that the Administrative Agent or any Bank shall be entitled to honor any request made by Borrower for a disbursement of such proceeds and that neither the Administrative Agent nor any Bank shall have any obligation to see to the proper disposition by Borrower of such proceeds.
6.             Guarantor agrees that if at any time all or any part of any payment at any time received by the Administrative Agent or any Bank from Borrower or Guarantor or any other Person obligated in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations under or with respect to this Guaranty is or must be rescinded or returned by the Administrative Agent or any Bank for any reason whatsoever (including, without limitation, the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of Borrower or Guarantor or such other Person), then Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall, to the extent of the payment rescinded or returned, be deemed to have continued in existence notwithstanding such previous receipt by such party, and Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, as to such payment, as though such previous payment had never been made.
7.             Until this Guaranty is terminated pursuant to the terms hereof, Guarantor (i) shall have no right of subrogation against Borrower or any entity comprising same by reason of any payments or acts of performance by Guarantor in compliance with the obligations of Guarantor hereunder; (ii) waives any right to enforce any remedy which Guarantor now or hereafter shall have against Borrower or any entity comprising same by reason of any one or more payment or acts of performance in compliance with the obligations of Guarantor hereunder and (iii) from and after an Event of Default, subordinates any liability or indebtedness of Borrower
5
or any entity comprising same now or hereafter held by Guarantor or any affiliate of Guarantor to the obligations of Borrower under the Loan Documents. The foregoing, however, shall not be deemed in any way to limit any rights that Guarantor may have pursuant to the Agreement of Limited Partnership of Borrower or which it may have at law or in equity with respect to any other partners of Borrower.
8.             Guarantor represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and the Banks with the knowledge that the Administrative Agent and the Banks are relying upon the same, as follows:
(a)           as of the date hereof, Guarantor is the sole general partner of Borrower;
(b)           based upon such relationship, Guarantor has determined that it is in its best interests to enter into this Guaranty;
(c)           this Guaranty is necessary and convenient to the conduct, promotion and attainment of Guarantor's business, and is in furtherance of Guarantor's business purposes;
(d)           the benefits to be derived by Guarantor from Borrower's access to funds and other credit made possible by the Loan Documents are at least equal to the obligations undertaken pursuant to this Guaranty;
(e)           Guarantor is solvent and has full power and legal right to enter into this Guaranty and to perform its obligations under the terms hereof and (i) Guarantor is organized and validly existing under the laws of the State of Maryland, (ii) Guarantor has complied with all provisions of applicable law in connection with all aspects of this Guaranty, and (iii) the person executing this Guaranty has all the requisite power and authority to execute and deliver this Guaranty;
(f)            to the best of Guarantor's knowledge, there is no action, suit, proceeding, or investigation pending or threatened against or affecting Guarantor at law, in equity, in admiralty or before any arbitrator or any governmental department, commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality (domestic or foreign) which is likely to materially and adversely affect the property, assets or condition (financial or otherwise) of Guarantor or which is likely to materially and adversely impair the ability of Guarantor to perform its obligations under this Guaranty;
6
 
(g)           the execution and delivery of and the performance by Guarantor of its obligations under this Guaranty have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of Guarantor and do not (i) violate any provision of any law, rule, regulation (including, without limitation, Regulation U or X of the Federal Reserve Board of the United States), order, writ, judgment, decree, determination or award presently in effect having applicability to Guarantor or the organizational documents of Guarantor, the consequences of which violation would materially and adversely affect the property, assets or condition (financial or otherwise) of Guarantor or which is likely to materially and adversely impair the ability of Guarantor to perform its obligations under this Guaranty or (ii) violate or conflict with, result in a breach of or constitute (with due notice or lapse of time or both) a default under any indenture, agreement or other instrument to which Guarantor is a party, or by which Guarantor or any of its property is bound, the consequences of which violation, conflict, breach or default would materially and adversely affect the property, assets or condition (financial or otherwise) of Guarantor or which is likely to materially and adversely impair the ability of Guarantor to perform its obligations under this Guaranty;
(h)           this Guaranty has been duly executed by Guarantor and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Guarantor, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms except as enforceability may be limited by applicable insolvency, bankruptcy or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally or general principles of equity, whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law;
(i)            no authorization, consent, approval, license or formal exemption from, nor any filing, declaration or registration with, any Federal, state, local or foreign court, governmental agency or regulatory authority is required in connection with the making and performance by Guarantor of this Guaranty, except those which have already been obtained;
(j)            Guarantor is not an "investment company" as that term is defined in, nor is it otherwise subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended;
(k)           Guarantor is not engaged principally, or as one of its important activities, in the business of purchasing, carrying, or extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any margin stock (within the meaning of
7
Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States); and
(l)            All of the representations and warranties in the Credit Agreement concerning Guarantor are true and correct.
Guarantor covenants that it will comply or cause compliance with all covenants in the Credit Agreement which are applicable to it.
9.  Guarantor and the Administrative Agent each acknowledge and agree that this Guaranty is a guarantee of payment and performance and not of collection and enforcement in respect of any obligations which may accrue to the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks from Borrower under the provisions of any Loan Document.
10.  Subject to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, and in conjunction therewith, the Administrative Agent or any Bank may assign any or all of its rights under this Guaranty.  In the event of any such assignment, the Administrative Agent shall give Guarantor prompt notice of same.  If the Administrative Agent or any Bank elects to sell all the Loans or participations in the Loans and the Loan Documents, including this Guaranty, the Administrative Agent or any Bank may forward to each purchaser and prospective purchaser all documents and information relating to this Guaranty or to Guarantor, whether furnished by Borrower or Guarantor or otherwise, subject to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement.
11.  Guarantor agrees, upon the written request of the Administrative Agent, to execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent, from time to time, any modification or amendment hereto or any additional instruments or documents reasonably considered necessary by the Administrative Agent or its counsel to cause this Guaranty to be, become or remain valid and effective in accordance with its terms, provided, that any such modification, amendment, additional instrument or document shall not increase Guarantor's obligations or diminish its rights hereunder and shall be reasonably satisfactory as to form to Guarantor and to Guarantor's counsel.
12.  The representations and warranties of Guarantor set forth in this Guaranty shall survive until this Guaranty shall terminate in accordance with the terms hereof.
8
 
13.  This Guaranty contains the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements relating to such subject matter and may not be modified, amended, supplemented or discharged except by a written agreement signed by Guarantor and the Administrative Agent (acting with the requisite consent of the Banks as provided in the Credit Agreement).
14.  If all or any portion of any provision contained in this Guaranty shall be determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect for any reason, such provision or portion thereof shall be deemed stricken and severed from this Guaranty and the remaining provisions and portions thereof shall continue in full force and effect.
15.  This Guaranty may be executed in counterparts which together shall constitute the same instrument.
16.   All notices, requests and other communications to any party hereunder shall be in writing (including bank wire, facsimile transmission followed by telephonic confirmation or similar writing) and shall be addressed to such party at the address set forth below or to such other address as may be identified by any party in a written notice to the others:
9
 
 
Each such notice, request or other communication shall be effective (i) if given by facsimile transmission, when such facsimile is transmitted to the facsimile number specified in this Section and the appropriate facsimile confirmation is received, (ii) if given by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, with first class postage prepaid, addressed as aforesaid, upon receipt or refusal to accept delivery, (iii) if given by a nationally recognized overnight carrier, 24 hours after such communication is deposited with such carrier with postage prepaid for next day delivery, or (iv) if given by any other means, when delivered at the address specified in this Section.
17.  Any acknowledgment or new promise, whether by payment of principal or interest or otherwise by Borrower or Guarantor, with respect to the
10
Guaranteed Obligations shall, if the statute of limitations in favor of Guarantor against the Administrative Agent and the Banks shall have commenced to run, toll the running of such statute of limitations, and if the period of such statute of limitations shall have expired, prevent the operation of such statute of limitations.
18.  This Guaranty shall be binding upon Guarantor and its successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Banks and their successors and permitted assigns; provided, however, that the Guarantor may not assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of all of the Banks, and any attempted such assignment or transfer without such consent shall be null and void.
19.  The failure of the Administrative Agent to enforce any right or remedy hereunder, or promptly to enforce any such right or remedy, shall not constitute a waiver thereof, nor give rise to any estoppel against the Administrative Agent or any Bank, nor excuse Guarantor from its obligations hereunder.  Any waiver of any such right or remedy to be enforceable against the Administrative Agent and the Banks must be expressly set forth in a writing signed by the Administrative Agent (acting with the requisite consent of the Banks as provided in the Credit Agreement).
20.           (a)           THIS GUARANTY AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS.
(b)           Any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Guaranty and any action for enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof may be brought in the courts of the State of Illinois or of the United States of America for the Northern District of Illinois, and, by execution and delivery of this Guaranty, the Guarantor hereby accepts for itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and appellate courts from any thereof.  The Guarantor irrevocably consents to the service of process out of any of the aforementioned courts in any such action or proceeding by the mailing of copies thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to the Guarantor at its address for notices set forth herein.  The Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any of the aforesaid actions or proceedings arising out of or in connection with this Guaranty brought in the courts referred to above and hereby further irrevocably waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such
11
action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.  Nothing herein shall affect the right of the Administrative Agent to serve process in any other manner permitted by law or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against the Guarantor in any other jurisdiction.
(c)           GUARANTOR HEREBY WAIVES ITS RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY AND ALL CLAIMS OR CAUSES OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS GUARANTY.  IT IS HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGED BY GUARANTOR THAT THE WAIVER OF A JURY TRIAL IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE BANKS TO ACCEPT THIS GUARANTY AND THAT THE LOANS AND OTHER EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT MADE BY THE BANKS ARE MADE IN RELIANCE UPON SUCH WAIVER.  GUARANTOR FURTHER WARRANTS AND REPRESENTS THAT SUCH WAIVER HAS BEEN KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY MADE, FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL.  IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS GUARANTY MAY BE FILED BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT IN COURT AS A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A NON-JURY TRIAL.
(d)           Guarantor does hereby further covenant and agree to and with the Administrative Agent and the Banks that Guarantor may be joined in any action against Borrower in connection with the Loan Documents and that recovery may be had against Guarantor in such action or in any independent action against Guarantor (with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations), without the Administrative Agent and the Banks first pursuing or exhausting any remedy or claim against Borrower or its successors or assigns.  Guarantor also agrees that, in an action brought with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations in any jurisdiction, it shall be conclusively bound by the judgment in any such action by the Administrative Agent (wherever brought) against Borrower or its successors or assigns, as if Guarantor were a party to such action, even though Guarantor was not joined as a party in such action.
(e)           Guarantor agrees to pay all reasonable expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and disbursements) which may be incurred by the Administrative Agent or the Banks in connection with the enforcement of their rights under this Guaranty, whether or not suit is initiated.
21.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein (but subject to Section 6 hereof), this Guaranty shall terminate and be of no further force or effect upon the full performance and payment of the Guaranteed Obligations
12
hereunder.  Upon termination of this Guaranty in accordance with the terms of this Guaranty, the Administrative Agent promptly shall deliver to Guarantor such documents as Guarantor or Guarantor's counsel reasonably may request in order to evidence such termination.
22.  All of the Administrative Agent's and the Banks' rights and remedies under each of the Loan Documents or under this Guaranty are intended to be distinct, separate and cumulative and no such right or remedy therein or herein mentioned is intended to be in exclusion of or a waiver of any other right or remedy available to the Administrative Agent or any Bank.
23.  No claim may be made by Guarantor or any other Person acting by or through Guarantor against the Administrative Agent or any Bank or the affiliates, directors, officers, employees, attorneys or agent of any of them for any consequential or punitive damages in respect of any claim for breach of contract or any other theory of liability arising out of or related to the transactions contemplated by this Guaranty or by the other Loan Documents, or any act, omission or event occurring in connection therewith; and Guarantor hereby waives, releases and agrees not to sue upon any claim for any such damages, whether or not accrued and whether or not known or suspected to exist in its favor.
13
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed and delivered this Guaranty as of the date and year first above written.
