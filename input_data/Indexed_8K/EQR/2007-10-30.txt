Exhibit 99.1 Equity Residential Reports Third Quarter Results Announces Retirement of Chief Operating Officer Gerald A. Spector CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 30, 2007--Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR) today reported results for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2007. All per share results are reported on a fully diluted basis. "Third quarter operations were much as we expected as we continue to experience moderating yet solid market conditions," said David J. Neithercut, Equity Residential's President and CEO. "And while our quarterly results were affected by the markets which have been most negatively impacted by single family housing and condominium supply issues, our diversified portfolio delivered good overall revenue growth. For the full year we should produce same-store revenue growth of 4.25 percent and expect that 2008 could produce similar results." Third Quarter 2007 For the quarter ended September 30, 2007, the company reported earnings of $1.62 per share compared to $0.19 per share in the third quarter of 2006. The increase is primarily attributable to higher gains on property sales in the third quarter of 2007. Funds from Operations (FFO) for the quarter ended September 30, 2007 were $0.58 per share compared to $0.62 per share in the same period of 2006. The decrease is primarily the result of the following items: -- Lower net gains on sales of condominium units and land sales than in the third quarter of 2006; -- Higher interest expense due primarily to higher debt balances, partially offset by reduced share count from share repurchase; -- Lower interest and other income from items such as Rent.com proceeds and forfeited deposits received in the third quarter of 2006; and -- Lower property net operating income (NOI) primarily attributable to dilution from the Lexford sale in October 2006 and other property disposition activity throughout the past two years, which is only partially offset by NOI from new acquisitions and same-store NOI increases. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2007 For the nine months ended September 30, 2007, the company reported earnings of $2.93 per share compared to $1.95 per share in the same period of 2006. FFO for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 were $1.73 per share compared to $1.78 per share in the same period of 2006. Same-Store Results On a same-store third quarter to third quarter comparison, revenues increased 3.7 percent, expenses increased 1.1 percent and NOI increased 5.3 percent. The increase in same-store revenues was driven primarily by increases in average rental rates. On a same-store nine-month to nine-month comparison, revenues increased 4.4 percent, expenses increased 2.7 percent and NOI increased 5.5 percent. Acquisitions/Dispositions "We continue to see good pricing on assets we are selling in the markets we are exiting and are successfully executing on our portfolio transformation strategy," said Mr. Neithercut. "Having purchased $1.6 billion in assets through the first nine months of the year, we expect that our acquisitions volume will be negligible for the remainder of the year as we assess pricing trends in our target markets." During the third quarter of 2007, the company acquired six properties, consisting of 1,411 apartment units, for an aggregate purchase price of $393.7 million at an average capitalization (cap) rate of 4.8 percent. The company also acquired two land parcels for $83.4 million during the quarter. Also during the quarter, the company sold 29 properties, consisting of 9,663 apartment units, for an aggregate sale price of $957.8 million at an average cap rate of 5.3 percent generating an unlevered internal rate of return (IRR) of 11.2 percent. In addition, the company sold 169 condominium units for $45.2 million and one land parcel for $5.0 million. In the first nine months of 2007, the company acquired 34 properties, consisting of 7,620 apartment units, for an aggregate purchase price of $1.6 billion at an average cap rate of 4.8 percent. The company also acquired seven land parcels for $148.8 million during the first nine months of 2007. During the nine months ended September 30, 2007, the company sold 66 properties, consisting of 19,681 apartment units, for an aggregate sale price of $1.7 billion at an average cap rate of 5.6 percent generating an unlevered IRR of 11.2 percent. In addition, the company sold 552 condominium units for $148.2 million and two land parcels for $45.7 million. Share Repurchase During the third quarter of 2007, the company repurchased and retired 6,634,140 of its common shares at an average price of $40.82 per share for an aggregate purchase of approximately $270.8 million. Through the first nine months of 2007, the company repurchased and retired 25,094,346 of its common shares at an average price of $45.30 per share for an aggregate purchase of approximately $1.1 billion. The company has not repurchased any of its shares since the end of the third quarter and currently has authorization to repurchase an additional $65.0 million under its share repurchase program. Preferred Share Redemption On July 16, 2007, the company redeemed its 8.60 percent Series D Preferred Shares at its cash liquidation value of $175.0 million plus accrued and unpaid dividends. As a result of this redemption, the company recorded a non-cash expense of approximately $6.1 million, or approximately $0.02 per share, in the third quarter of 2007 for the write-off of the original issuance costs. Debt Offering On July 19, 2007, the company issued $300.0 million of mortgage notes maturing February 1, 2019. The all-in effective interest rate is 6.0 percent. Proceeds from the issuance were used to pay down the company's unsecured revolving credit facility. Unsecured Term Loan Facility On October 11, 2007, the company closed on a new $500.0 million senior unsecured credit facility. The new facility matures on October 5, 2010, subject to two one-year extension options exercisable by the company. The rate on the facility will generally be LIBOR plus a spread which is dependent on the current credit rating on the company's long-term senior unsecured debt and is currently 42.5 basis points. Proceeds from the issuance were used to pay down the company's unsecured revolving credit facility, which has approximately $1.36 billion available as of October 30, 2007. Retirement of Chief Operating Officer Gerald A. Spector The company also announced that Gerald A. "Gerry" Spector, Equity Residential's Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, after a 35 year career with Equity Residential and its predecessor companies, will retire effective December 31, 2007. Mr. Spector, 60, will continue to serve on the company's Board of Trustees in the role of Vice Chairman. The company will not name a successor. Instead Frederick C. Tuomi, the company's Executive Vice President and President of Property Management, and David S. Santee, the company's Executive Vice President of Operations, will continue to be responsible for day to day operations of the company's portfolio and all property management activities. Both executives, who had previously reported to Mr. Spector, will report directly to David J. Neithercut, Equity Residential's President and CEO. The company will not record any additional charges to either 2007 or 2008 earnings as a result of Mr. Spector's retirement. Mr. Tuomi, 52, joined Equity Residential in 1994 as Executive Vice President and President of Property Management. In this role, Mr. Tuomi has led the company's property management organization through the tremendous expansion of the company's portfolio and is responsible for the day to day operations of the company's portfolio of more than 154,000 apartment units. Mr. Tuomi began his career in the apartment industry in 1979. Mr. Santee, 48, has been the company's Executive Vice President - Property Operations since January 2007. In this role, he is responsible for the company's Revenue, Marketing, Information Technology, Facilities and Procurement groups. Mr. Santee joined Equity Residential in 1994 and has served in various senior management roles in property operations and management including serving as Executive Vice President of the company's Eastern Division with responsibility for the day-to-day operations of 70,000 apartment units. Mr. Santee began his career in the apartment industry in 1983. Mr. Spector said, "While it is never easy to step away from something you love, this change is a result of a long planned process that allows us to have our next generation of leaders take the helm. I have worked closely with Fred Tuomi and David Santee for years and am very proud of all that we have accomplished. I have great confidence in their ability to continue the work we have done together in driving our organization to leverage our state of the art operating platform across the portfolio. I look forward to continuing to make a contribution to Equity Residential by working with David Neithercut and our Board in creating value for our shareholders." "Gerry has been a great friend and mentor to me and the entire Equity Residential family for many years. He is the architect of our property management organization and led our operations through the tremendous growth and the major transformation of our portfolio. While we will miss our daily interactions with him, he will remain an important adviser to me and our board. As a testament to the terrific organization that Gerry built, we have two very talented executives with decades of experience to lead our property operations," said Mr. Neithercut.

Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. The April 2002 White Paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from FFO for previously depreciated operating properties only. Once the Company commences the conversion of units to condominiums, it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property. FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units is calculated on a basis consistent with net income available to Common Shares and reflects adjustments to net income for preferred distributions and premiums on redemption of preferred shares in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The equity positions of various individuals and entities that contributed their properties to the Operating Partnership in exchange for OP Units are collectively referred to as the "Minority Interests - Operating Partnership". Subject to certain restrictions, the Minority Interests - Operating Partnership may exchange their OP Units for EQR Common Shares on a one-for-one basis. (2) The Company believes that FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company, because they are recognized measures of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units can help compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units do not represent net income, net income available to Common Shares or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units should not be exclusively considered as alternatives to net income, net income available to Common Shares or net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The Company's calculation of FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies.

Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. The April 2002 White Paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from FFO for previously depreciated operating properties only. Once the Company commences the conversion of units to condominiums, it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property. FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units is calculated on a basis consistent with net income available to Common Shares and reflects adjustments to net income for preferred distributions and premiums on redemption of preferred shares in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The equity positions of various individuals and entities that contributed their properties to the Operating Partnership in exchange for OP Units are collectively referred to as the "Minority Interests - Operating Partnership". Subject to certain restrictions, the Minority Interests - Operating Partnership may exchange their OP Units for EQR Common Shares on a one-for-one basis. (2) The Company believes that FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company, because they are recognized measures of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units can help compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units do not represent net income, net income available to Common Shares or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units should not be exclusively considered as alternatives to net income, net income available to Common Shares or net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The Company's calculation of FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies. (3) Non-comparable items are those items included in FFO that by their nature are not comparable from period to period, such as net incremental gain on sales of condominium units, impairment charges, debt extinguishment costs and redemption premiums on Preferred Shares/Preference Interests. (4) Earnings represents net income per share calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Expected earnings is calculated on a basis consistent with actual earnings. Due to the uncertain timing and extent of property dispositions and the resulting gains/losses on sales, actual earnings could differ materially from expected earnings.
