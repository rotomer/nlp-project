Throughout 2007, Equity Residential, through its operating partnership, ERP Operating Limited Partnership (collectively with Equity Residential, the "Company"), acquired various real estate properties, including the Company's acquisitions of the properties known as the Florida Portfolio, Berkeley Portfolio, Teresina at Lomas Verdes, Upper West Side Portfolio and Greenwood Properties, (collectively the "Properties").  The Company is hereby filing certain financial information relating to the Properties (see Item 9.01(d) below) indicated under Rule 3-14 and Article 11 of Regulation S-X.
 
                                                       
The Properties were acquired from unrelated third parties.  After reasonable inquiry, the Company is not aware of any material factors relating to the operations of the Properties not otherwise disclosed that would cause the reported historical financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future operating results.
 
                                                       
Material factors considered in assessing the acquisition of the Properties included, but were not limited to, the opportunity to acquire high quality apartment properties in top United States growth markets and the following:
 
                 
The Florida Portfolio consists of six properties with 2,398 apartment units located throughout Florida. The properties consist of 2,426,168 net rentable square feet of space. The historical and expected future cash flows of the property are strong and stable and the properties have a collective occupancy percentage equal to 93.8%.  The Florida Portfolio was acquired on January 4, 2007 for a total purchase price of $404.0 million.
 
                 
The Berkeley Portfolio consists of seven high quality, mixed use properties in close proximity to the University of California, Berkeley.  The portfolio consists of 418 units, 255,764 of net rentable square feet of residential space and approximately 40,460 square feet of commercial space. The historical and expected future cash flows of the property are strong and stable and the properties have a collective occupancy percentage equal to 99.2%.  The Berkeley Portfolio was acquired on April 18, 2007 for a total purchase price of $145.9 million.
 
                 
Teresina at Lomas Verdes consists of 440 apartment units located in Chula Vista, California. The property consists of 430,945 net rentable square feet of space. The historical and expected future cash flows of the property are strong and stable and the property has an occupancy percentage equal to 94.9%.  Teresina at Lomas Verdes was acquired on April 25, 2007 for a purchase price of $90.3 million.
 
                 
The Upper West Side Portfolio consists of three high rise buildings located on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.  The portfolio consists of 479 units, 248,092 of net rentable square feet of residential space and approximately 16,690 square feet of commercial space. The historical and expected future cash flows of the properties are strong and stable and the properties have a collective occupancy percentage equal to 95.3%.  The Upper West Side Portfolio was acquired on June 12, 2007 for a total purchase price of $180.0 million.
 
                 
The Greenwood Properties consist of two properties with 557 apartment units located in Centennial, Colorado. The properties consist of 548,253 net rentable square feet of space. The historical and expected future cash flows of the property are strong and stable and the properties have a collective occupancy percentage equal to 95.7%.  The Greenwood Properties were acquired on July 27, 2007 for a total purchase price of $82.5 million.
 
 
                                                       
Based on the above factors, the historical financial statements included herein relating to the acquisitions have been audited for the Properties' most recent fiscal years.  In addition, the Properties are directly or indirectly owned by entities that elect or have elected to be treated as real estate investment trusts ("REIT's") for federal income tax purposes.  Therefore, a presentation of estimated taxable operating results is not applicable.

We have audited the accompanying statement of revenue and certain expenses of the Florida Portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2006. This statement is the responsibility of the management of the Florida Portfolio (the "Properties").  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on this statement based on our audit.
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the statement is free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Properties' internal control over financial reporting.  Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Properties' internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statement, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
The accompanying statement was prepared for the purpose of complying with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for inclusion in a Current Report on Form 8-K of Equity Residential and ERP Operating Limited Partnership, as described in Note 1, and is not intended to be a complete presentation of the Properties' revenue and expenses.
 
In our opinion, the statement referred to above presents fairly, in all material respects, the revenue and certain expenses of the Florida Portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

1. Basis of Presentation
 
On January 4, 2007, ERP Operating Limited Partnership (collectively with Equity Residential, its general partner, the "Company") indirectly acquired a portfolio of apartment buildings in Florida known as the Florida Portfolio (the "Properties").
 
The statement of revenue and certain expenses relate to the operations of the Florida Portfolio and were prepared for the purpose of complying with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Rule 3-14 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, the accompanying statement of revenue and certain expenses has been prepared using the accrual method of accounting, and certain expenses such as depreciation, amortization, income taxes, mortgage interest expense and entity expenses are not reflected in the statement of revenue and certain expenses, as required by Rule 3-14 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Consequently, the statement of revenue and certain expenses for the period presented is not representative of the actual operations for the period presented, as certain revenues and expenses which may not be in the proposed future operations of the Florida Portfolio have been excluded in accordance with Rule 3-14 of Regulation S-X.
 
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 
Revenue Recognition
 
The residential apartments are leased under operating leases with terms of generally one year or less.  Rental income is recognized as it is earned, which is not materially different than on a straight-line basis.
 
Repairs and Maintenance
 
Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred, while significant improvements, renovations and replacements are capitalized.
 
Estimates
 
The preparation of the statement in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
Advertising Costs
 
All advertising costs are expensed as incurred and included as operating expenses on the accompanying statement of revenue and certain expenses.  Advertising expenses were approximately $124,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Therefore, no pro forma adjustment is presented for the Florida Portfolio for the Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007.
