Exhibit 99.1
Equity Residential Reports 2007 Results
Same-Store NOI Increases 5.6% Provides Outlook for 2008
CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR) today reported results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2007 and provided its outlook for 2008 performance. All per share results are reported on a fully-diluted basis.
Across our core markets we see very little new supply being delivered, declining home ownership rates, continued significant premiums to own a home versus the cost to rent and a favorable demographic picture. While the weakening economy and slowing job growth give us good reason to be cautious as we enter 2008, our portfolio is currently 94.5 percent occupied. These factors lead us to believe that in 2008 we will produce same-store revenue growth of 3.0-4.0 percent, which, while not as strong as what we had anticipated ninety days ago, is good growth on a historical basis, said David J. Neithercut, Equity Residentials President and CEO.
Fourth Quarter 2007
For the quarter ended December 31, 2007, the company reported earnings of $0.44 per share compared to $1.57 per share in the fourth quarter of 2006. The decrease is primarily attributable to higher gains on property sales due to significantly greater property dispositions in the fourth quarter of 2006, partially offset by the $30.0 million impairment charge taken on the companys corporate housing business in the fourth quarter of 2006.
Funds from Operations (FFO) for the quarter ended December 31, 2007 were $0.67 per share compared to $0.49 per share in the same period of 2006. The companys FFO of $0.67 per share exceeded the guidance range of $0.59 to $0.62 per share provided by the company in its third quarter 2007 earnings release. The items describing the difference between actual FFO per share for the quarter and the midpoint of the companys guidance range for the quarter are listed on page 27 of this release. The difference is primarily a result of the following:
Higher property net operating income (NOI) as a result of higher than expected same-store NOI, slightly lower than expected non same-store NOI and approximately $11.5 million of insurance recoveries from property damage in prior years and certain reserve adjustments not included in same-store NOI;
The receipt of $4.1 million in December 2007 related to the settlement of insurance litigation claims from 2000 through 2002;
Income tax refunds of prior years taxes of approximately $6.1 million; and
Other items including lower interest expense.
The difference between the fourth quarter 2007 FFO of $0.67 per share and the fourth quarter 2006 FFO of $0.49 per share was primarily due to:
Higher same-store NOI of approximately $16.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2007;
Dilution from property transactions of approximately $8.0 million;
Lower preferred share distributions of approximately $4.0 million; and
A number of non-comparable items which are listed on page 27 of this release.
Year Ended December 31, 2007
For the year ended December 31, 2007, the company reported earnings of $3.39 per share compared to $3.50 per share for 2006.
FFO for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $2.39 per share compared to $2.27 per share for 2006.
Same-Store Results
On a same-store fourth quarter to fourth quarter comparison, which includes 123,639 apartment units, revenues increased 3.9 percent, expenses increased 0.3 percent and NOI increased 6.0 percent. The increase in same-store revenues was driven primarily by increases in average rental rates.
On a same-store year over year comparison, which includes 115,857 apartment units, revenues increased 4.3 percent, expenses increased 2.1 percent and NOI increased 5.6 percent.
Acquisitions/Dispositions
The strong pricing we realized on our property sales in late 2007 clearly demonstrates that Main Street continues to value multifamily assets significantly more than does Wall Street. In 2008, we will continue to take advantage of Main Streets demand for our non-core assets. However we expect continued difficulty justifying the acquisition of new assets while the disparity between property prices and our share price remains, said Mr. Neithercut.
During the fourth quarter of 2007, the company acquired two properties, consisting of 547 apartment units, for an aggregate purchase price of $67.0 million at an average capitalization (cap) rate of 6.3 percent. The company also acquired a land parcel for $64.0 million during the quarter.
Also during the quarter, the company sold seven properties, consisting of 1,882 apartment units, for an aggregate sale price of $172.9 million at an average cap rate of 5.8 percent generating an unlevered internal rate of return (IRR) of 10.3 percent. In addition, the company sold 65 condominium units for $16.0 million and air rights to a previously sold land parcel for $4.3 million.
During 2007, the company acquired 36 properties, consisting of 8,167 apartment units, for an aggregate purchase price of $1.7 billion at an average cap rate of 4.8 percent. The company also acquired eight land parcels for $212.8 million during 2007.
During 2007, the company sold 73 properties, consisting of 21,563 apartment units, for an aggregate sale price of $1.9 billion at an average cap rate of 5.6 percent generating an unlevered IRR of 11.1 percent. In addition, the company sold 617 condominium units for $164.2 million and two land parcels and air rights adjoining a land parcel for $50.0 million.
Share Repurchase
During the fourth quarter of 2007, the company repurchased and retired 2,390,000 of its common shares at an average price of $37.44 per share for an aggregate purchase of approximately $89.5 million.
During 2007, the company repurchased and retired 27,484,346 of its common shares at an average price of $44.62 per share for an aggregate purchase of approximately $1.2 billion.
Since the end of the fourth quarter, the company has repurchased and retired 100,000 of its common shares at an average price of $35.74 per share for an aggregate purchase of approximately $3.6 million. The company has authorization to repurchase an additional $472.0 million under its share repurchase program.
Unsecured Term Loan
On October 11, 2007, the company closed on a new $500.0 million senior unsecured term loan. The new loan matures on October 5, 2010, subject to two one-year extension options exercisable by the company. The rate on the loan will generally be LIBOR plus a spread which is dependent on the current credit rating on the companys long-term senior unsecured debt and is currently 42.5 basis points. Proceeds from the loan were used to pay down the companys unsecured revolving credit facility, which had approximately $1.3 billion available as of February 4, 2008.
First Quarter and Full Year 2008 Earnings Guidance
The company has established an FFO guidance range of $0.56 to $0.60 per share for the first quarter of 2008. The difference between the companys actual fourth quarter 2007 FFO of $0.67 per share to the midpoint of the first quarter 2008 FFO guidance range is primarily a result of the following items:
Lower first quarter same-store NOI of approximately $7.0 million. While revenues are expected to modestly increase sequentially, operating expenses, primarily utilities, will be higher consistent with the seasonality of the companys business;
Dilution of approximately $2.0 million resulting from property transactions in the first quarter of 2008;
Lower interest expense of approximately $5.0 million in the first quarter of 2008 due to lower rates;
Lower condominium income and interest income from 1031 accounts of approximately $4.0 million; and
The insurance recoveries and reserve adjustments, insurance settlement and income tax refunds, which are all described above, as well as other items listed on page 27 of this release, which are all non-comparable items recorded in the fourth quarter of 2007.
The company has established an FFO guidance range for full year 2008 of $2.45 to $2.60 per share. The assumptions used to determine this guidance range are listed on page 28 of this release.
The difference between the companys actual 2007 FFO of $2.39 per share and the midpoint of the companys 2008 FFO guidance range is attributable to the following factors:
Higher same-store NOI of approximately $30.0 to $50.0 million;
The positive impact of the lease up of development and former condominium properties of approximately $25.0 to $30.0 million;
Lower interest expense of approximately $10.0 million;
Lower preferred share distributions of approximately $9.0 million;
The reduced number of shares outstanding due to the companys share repurchase activity in 2007;
Non-comparable items that had an approximately $17.0 million positive effect in 2007;
Dilution from property sale and purchase activity of approximately $30.0 million;
Lower income from condominium activity of approximately $7.0 million; and
Lower interest income from 1031 accounts and other items amounting to approximately $12.0 million.
Please note that the reduced share count benefit of approximately $0.10 per share that the company anticipates for 2008 is entirely offset by increased interest expense (i.e. interest expense would have been approximately $40.0 million lower instead of approximately $10.0 million lower in 2008 if not for share buybacks in 2007.

Other risks and uncertainties are described under the heading Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and available on our website, www.equityresidential.com. Many of these uncertainties and risks are difficult to predict and beyond managements control. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, results or events.

Please visit the Investor Information section of the companys web site at www.equityresidential.com for the link.
A replay of the web cast will be available for two weeks at this site.
(1) The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") defines funds from operations ("FFO") (April 2002 White Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP")), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. The April 2002 White Paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from FFO for previously depreciated operating properties only. Once the Company commences the conversion of units to condominiums, it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property. FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units is calculated on a basis consistent with net income available to Common Shares and reflects adjustments to net income for preferred distributions and premiums on redemption of preferred shares in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The equity positions of various individuals and entities that contributed their properties to the Operating Partnership in exchange for OP Units are collectively referred to as the "Minority Interests - Operating Partnership". Subject to certain restrictions, the Minority Interests - Operating Partnership may exchange their OP Units for EQR Common Shares on a one-for-one basis.
(2) The Company believes that FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company, because they are recognized measures of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units can help compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units do not represent net income, net income available to Common Shares or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units should not be exclusively considered as alternatives to net income, net income available to Common Shares or net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The Company's calculation of FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies.
(1) Average rental rate is defined as total rental revenues divided by the weighted average occupied units for the month of December 2007.
(1) The Company's primary financial measure for evaluating each of its apartment communities is net operating income ("NOI").  NOI represents rental income less property and maintenance expense, real estate tax and insurance expense, and property management expense.
