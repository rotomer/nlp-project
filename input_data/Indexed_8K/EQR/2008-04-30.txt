Exhibit 99.1
Equity Residential Reports First Quarter Results
Same Store NOI Increases 4.7%
CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR) today reported results for the quarter ended March 31, 2008. All per share results are reported on a fully-diluted basis.
To date, despite a slowing economy and disappointing job numbers, apartment fundamentals remain fairly healthy across most of our markets. We have performed on plan through the first four months of the year and May appears likely to continue that trend. As we enter our primary leasing season 95% occupied, we remain confident that our 2008 operating performance will meet our original expectations, said David J. Neithercut, Equity Residentials President and CEO.
First Quarter 2008
For the quarter ended March 31, 2008, the company reported earnings of $0.51 per share compared to $0.40 per share in the first quarter of 2007. The increase is primarily attributable to higher income from continuing operations and higher gains on property sales.
Funds from Operations (FFO) for the quarter ended March 31, 2008 were $0.59 per share compared to $0.55 per share in the same period of 2007. The $0.04 per share increase in the first quarter of 2008 is due primarily to:
A net positive impact of approximately $0.02 per share from higher total net operating income (NOI) as a result of higher NOI from the companys same store portfolio and the lease up of development and other non-same store properties, partially offset by dilution from the companys 2007 and 2008 transaction activity;
A net positive impact of approximately $0.03 per share due primarily to lower floating rates of interest, higher capitalized interest and lower share count partially offset by the increased interest expense associated with the companys 2007 share buyback;
A positive impact of approximately $0.01 due to lower preferred share distributions; and
A reduction of approximately $0.02 per share from higher income taxes and a number of non-comparable items listed on page 23 of this release.
The difference between the companys first quarter 2008 FFO of $0.59 per share and the companys fourth quarter 2007 FFO of $0.67 per share is primarily attributable to the following:
Approximately $0.08 per share less in FFO in the first quarter of 2008 due to a number of one-time items that had a positive impact in the fourth quarter of 2007, including insurance recoveries and reserve adjustments, an insurance settlement and income tax refunds;
Approximately $0.01 per share less in FFO in the first quarter of 2008 due to slightly lower same store NOI and dilution from 2008 transactions activity partially offset by the positive impact of the lease up of development and other non-same store properties; and
Approximately $0.01 per share of higher FFO in the first quarter of 2008 due to lower interest expense from lower rates, partially offset by lower interest income on 1031 exchange accounts.
Same Store Results
On a same store first quarter to first quarter comparison, which includes 121,826 apartment units, revenues increased 3.5%, expenses increased 1.6% and NOI increased 4.7%. The increase in same store revenues was driven primarily by an increase in rental rates.
Acquisitions/Dispositions
During the first quarter of 2008, the company acquired two properties, consisting of 171 apartment units, for an aggregate purchase price of $41.9 million at an average capitalization (cap) rate of 5.0%.
Also during the quarter, the company sold 15 properties, consisting of 3,317 apartment units, for an aggregate sale price of $271.6 million at an average cap rate of 5.8% generating an unlevered internal rate of return (IRR) of 10.7%. In addition, the company sold 41 condominium units for $9.4 million.
Liquidity
On March 10, 2008, the company closed a $500 million Freddie Mac secured loan with an all-in effective interest rate of 5.48%. The company currently has approximately $1.4 billion available on its unsecured revolving credit facility and approximately $325 million of unrestricted cash. The companys liquidity is sufficient to retire all of its 2008 loan maturities as they come due. The company anticipates having approximately $1.0 billion of availability on its unsecured revolving credit facility at year end 2008.
Second Quarter 2008 Earnings Guidance
The company has established an FFO guidance range of $0.61 to $0.65 per share for the second quarter of 2008. The difference between the companys actual first quarter 2008 FFO of $0.59 per share and the midpoint of the second quarter 2008 guidance range is primarily a result of higher NOI from the companys same store properties as well as the continuing positive impact from the lease up of development and other non-same store properties offset by some transaction dilution in the second quarter of 2008.
