Exhibit 99.1
Equity Residential Reports Second Quarter Results
Same Store NOI Increases 4.9%
CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR) today reported results for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2008. All per share results are reported on a fully-diluted basis.
We are very pleased with our operating performance for the first half of the year with solid occupancy and good revenue growth across most of our major markets, said David J. Neithercut, Equity Residentials President and CEO. And we will produce good results for the year, with same store revenue growth of 3% to 3.5%, which is modestly short of our original expectations as many of our markets are feeling the impact of job losses due to a challenging economic environment.
Second Quarter 2008
For the quarter ended June 30, 2008, the company reported earnings of $0.47 per share compared to $0.95 per share in the second quarter of 2007. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower gains on property sales due to a lower volume of property sales in 2008.
Funds from Operations (FFO) for the quarter ended June 30, 2008 were $0.64 per share compared to $0.60 per share in the same period of 2007. The $0.04 per share increase in the second quarter of 2008 is due primarily to:
A net positive impact of approximately $0.03 per share from higher total net operating income (NOI) as a result of higher NOI from the companys same store portfolio and the lease up of development and other non-same store properties, partially offset by dilution from the companys 2007 and 2008 transaction activity;
A net cumulative positive impact on interest expense and preferred share distributions of approximately $0.08 per share due primarily to lower floating rates of interest, the use of sales proceeds to pay down debt, higher capitalized interest, lower debt extinguishment costs and lower share count, partially offset by the increased interest expense associated with the companys 2007 share buyback;
A negative impact of approximately $0.04 per share from the companys condominium operations; and
A negative impact of approximately $0.03 per share due to higher income taxes, no gains on land sales and certain other non-comparable items listed on page 24 of this release.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2008
For the six months ended June 30, 2008, the company reported earnings of $0.98 per share compared to $1.35 per share in the same period of 2007.
FFO for the six months ended June 30, 2008 were $1.23 per share compared to $1.15 per share in the same period of 2007.
Same Store Results
On a same store second quarter to second quarter comparison, which includes 123,246 apartment units, revenues increased 4.0%, expenses increased 2.4% and NOI increased 4.9%. The increase in same store revenues was driven primarily by an increase in average rental rate.
On a same store six-month to six-month comparison, which includes 119,546 apartment units, revenues increased 3.8%, expenses increased 2.0% and NOI increased 4.8%. The increase in same store revenues was driven primarily by an increase in average rental rate.
Acquisitions/Dispositions
During the second quarter of 2008, the company acquired four properties, consisting of 1,666 apartment units, for an aggregate purchase price of $295.0 million at an average capitalization (cap) rate of 6.0%. In addition, the company acquired an uncompleted development property for a purchase price of $31.7 million.
Also during the quarter, the company sold eight properties, consisting of 1,965 apartment units, for an aggregate sale price of $206.9 million at an average cap rate of 5.6% generating an unlevered internal rate of return (IRR) of 10.9%. In addition, the company sold 32 condominium units for an aggregate sale price of $6.1 million.
During the first six months of 2008, the company acquired six properties, consisting of 1,837 apartment units, for an aggregate purchase price of $336.9 million at an average cap rate of 5.9%, as well as an uncompleted development property for a purchase price of $31.7 million.
Also during the first six months of 2008, the company sold 23 properties, consisting of 5,282 apartment units, for an aggregate sale price of $478.5 million at an average cap rate of 5.7% generating an unlevered IRR of 10.7%. In addition, the company sold 73 condominium units for an aggregate sale price of $15.5 million.
Liquidity
The company recently agreed to borrow $550 million in a loan originated by Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) for repurchase by Fannie Mae (NYSE:FNM). This is a secured loan with an all-in effective interest rate of approximately 6%. The loan is interest only and matures in 11.5 years with the first 10.5 years fixed and the last year at a floating rate of interest. The funding is expected to occur in late August 2008. Equity Residential currently has approximately $1.4 billion available on its unsecured revolving credit facility and approximately $145 million of unrestricted cash. These existing funding sources, combined with the new Fannie Mae/Wells Fargo borrowing, give the company ample liquidity to meet its 2008 and 2009 funding requirements.
Third Quarter 2008 Earnings Guidance
The company has established an FFO guidance range of $0.61 to $0.65 per share for the third quarter of 2008. When compared to the second quarter 2008, the companys third quarter FFO results will reflect a continued contribution from good same store operating performance and be negatively impacted by approximately $0.01 per share in connection with the timing of its new secured loan from Fannie Mae.
Full Year 2008 Guidance
The company has revised its guidance for its full year 2008 same store operating performance, funds from operations results and transactions activities as well as other items listed on page 25 of this release. The changes to the full year same store and FFO guidance are listed below:
The companys full year 2008 FFO results will reflect a continued contribution from good same store operating performance and be negatively impacted by approximately $0.04 per share due to losses from its condominium conversion business and $0.02 per share from the timing of its new secured loan from Fannie Mae. As a result, the company anticipates FFO results at the midpoint of the revised guidance range.
Third Quarter 2008 Conference Call
Equity Residential expects to announce third quarter 2008 results on Wednesday, October 29, 2008 and host a conference call to discuss those results at 10:00 a.m. CT on Thursday, October 30, 2008.

A replay of the web cast will be available for two weeks at this site.
(1) The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") defines funds from operations ("FFO") (April 2002 White Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP")), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. The April 2002 White Paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from FFO for previously depreciated operating properties only. Once the Company commences the conversion of units to condominiums, it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property. FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units is calculated on a basis consistent with net income available to Common Shares and reflects adjustments to net income for preferred distributions and premiums on redemption of preferred shares in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The equity positions of various individuals and entities that contributed their properties to the Operating Partnership in exchange for OP Units are collectively referred to as the "Minority Interests - Operating Partnership". Subject to certain restrictions, the Minority Interests - Operating Partnership may exchange their OP Units for EQR Common Shares on a one-for-one basis.
(2) The Company believes that FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company, because they are recognized measures of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units can help compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units do not represent net income, net income available to Common Shares or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units should not be exclusively considered as alternatives to net income, net income available to Common Shares or net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The Company's calculation of FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies.

NOI represents rental income less property and maintenance expense, real estate tax and insurance expense, and property management expense.  The Company believes that NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the Company's apartment communities.
