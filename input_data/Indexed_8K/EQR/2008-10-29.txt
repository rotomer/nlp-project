Exhibit 99.1
Equity Residential Reports Third Quarter Results
Same Store NOI Increases 3.9%
CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 29, 2008--Equity Residential (NYSE: EQR) today reported results for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2008. All per share results are reported on a fully-diluted basis.
We are very pleased with our operating performance for the third quarter and the first nine months of the year as we have maintained strong occupancy and realized good revenue growth across most of our major markets, said David J. Neithercut, Equity Residentials President and CEO. However, our markets are currently experiencing significant headwinds due to the slowing economy and resulting job losses which will slow revenue growth, as we expected, in the fourth quarter and cause property fundamentals to further weaken in 2009.
Third Quarter 2008
For the quarter ended September 30, 2008, the company reported earnings of $0.64 per share compared to $1.62 per share in the third quarter of 2007. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower gains on property sales due to a lower volume of property sales in 2008.
Funds from Operations (FFO) for the quarter ended September 30, 2008 were $0.65 per share compared to $0.58 per share in the same period of 2007. The $0.07 per share increase in the third quarter of 2008 is due primarily to:
A positive impact of approximately $0.06 per share as a result of higher net operating income (NOI) from the companys same store portfolio and the lease up of development and other non-same store properties;
A negative impact of approximately $0.03 per share from dilution due to the companys decision to be a net seller of assets over the past several quarters;
A net cumulative positive impact on interest expense and preferred share distributions of approximately $0.05 per share due primarily to lower floating rates of interest and lower preferred share redemption costs;
A negative impact of approximately $0.02 per share from the companys condominium operations and impairment of halted condominium conversions; and
The net positive impact of $0.01 per share due to gain on a land sale and lower G&A expense offset by lower interest and other income and certain other non-comparable items listed on page 24 of this release.
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2008
For the nine months ended September 30, 2008, the company reported earnings of $1.62 per share compared to $2.93 per share in the same period of 2007.
FFO for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 were $1.88 per share compared to $1.73 per share in the same period of 2007.
Same Store Results
On a same store third quarter to third quarter comparison, which includes 122,380 apartment units, revenues increased 3.4%, expenses increased 2.6% and NOI increased 3.9%. The increase in same store revenues was driven primarily by an increase in average rental rates.
On a same store nine-month to nine-month comparison, which includes 115,713 apartment units, revenues increased 3.6%, expenses increased 2.1% and NOI increased 4.4%. The increase in same store revenues was driven primarily by an increase in average rental rates.
Acquisitions/Dispositions
During the third quarter of 2008, the company did not acquire any properties but sold 11 properties, consisting of 3,513 apartment units, for an aggregate sale price of $328.5 million at an average capitalization (cap) rate of 5.9% generating an unlevered internal rate of return (IRR) of 10.8%. In addition, the company sold 25 condominium units for an aggregate sale price of $6.1 million and one land parcel for $3.3 million.
During the first nine months of 2008, the company acquired six properties, consisting of 1,837 apartment units, for an aggregate purchase price of $336.9 million at an average cap rate of 5.9%, as well as an uncompleted development property for a purchase price of $31.7 million.
Also during the first nine months of 2008, the company sold 34 properties, consisting of 8,795 apartment units, for an aggregate sale price of $807.0 million at an average cap rate of 5.8% generating an unlevered IRR of 10.8%. In addition, the company sold 98 condominium units for an aggregate sale price of $21.6 million and one land parcel for $3.3 million.
Liquidity
On August 26, 2008 the company announced that it closed a $550 million secured loan originated by Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) for repurchase by Fannie Mae (NYSE: FNM). The loan is interest only and matures in 11.5 years with the first 10.5 years fixed and the last year at a floating rate of interest. The all-in effective interest rate is approximately 6%.
The company currently has approximately $450 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately $1.3 billion available on its unsecured revolving credit facility. The company anticipates having cash and cash equivalents of approximately $660 million and approximately $1.3 billion available on its unsecured revolving credit facility at December 31, 2008. Management believes that these existing funding sources will give the company sufficient liquidity to meet its future funding requirements.
Fourth Quarter 2008 Earnings Guidance
The company has established an FFO guidance range of $0.60 to $0.65 per share for the fourth quarter of 2008. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $0.02 per share higher in the quarter from what the company previously forecasted due to increased LIBOR and tax exempt floating rates of interest. Also, the company has greatly slowed its acquisition efforts while continuing to sell properties which has created substantial liquidity, but will also reduce expected NOI by approximately $0.02 per share in the fourth quarter. The company used a portion of that liquidity to purchase certain of its debt at a substantial discount to par which will add a previously unbudgeted $0.04 per share to its fourth quarter results.
Impact on 2009 Earnings from Adoption of FASB Staff Position APB 14-1
The company will provide guidance for 2009 performance in its fourth quarter 2008 earnings release in February 2009. At this time, it should be noted that the companys earnings will be reduced by $0.03 to $0.04 per share by the mandatory adoption of FASB Staff Position APB 14-1, which requires companies to expense certain implied costs of the option value related to convertible debt beginning January 1, 2009. The company expects that FFO will be reduced by a similar amount. This non-cash charge will have no material impact on the companys debt coverage ratios or debt covenants.

A replay of the web cast will be available for two weeks at this site.
(1) The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") defines funds from operations ("FFO") (April 2002 White Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP")), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis.  The April 2002 White Paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from FFO for previously depreciated operating properties only.  Once the Company commences the conversion of units to condominiums, it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property. FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units is calculated on a basis consistent with net income available to Common Shares and reflects adjustments to net income for preferred distributions and premiums on redemption of preferred shares in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The equity positions of various individuals and entities that contributed their properties to the Operating Partnership in exchange for OP Units are collectively referred to as the "Minority Interests - Operating Partnership". Subject to certain restrictions, the Minority Interests - Operating Partnership may exchange their OP Units for EQR Common Shares on a one-for-one basis.
(2) The Company believes that FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company, because they are recognized measures of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units can help compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to different companies.  FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units do not represent net income, net income available to Common Shares or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP.  Therefore, FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units should not be exclusively considered as alternatives to net income, net income available to Common Shares or net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity.  The Company's calculation of FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies.
(1) Average rental rate is defined as total rental revenues divided by the weighted average occupied units for the month of September 2008.
(1) Represents the acquisition of Mosaic at Metro in Hyattsville, Maryland. See the Consolidated Development Projects on page 20 for further information.
(1) The Company's primary financial measure for evaluating each of its apartment communities is net operating income ("NOI"). NOI represents rental income less property and maintenance expense, real estate tax and insurance expense, and property management expense. The Company believes that NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the Company's apartment communities.
(2) Average rental rate is defined as total rental revenues divided by the weighted average occupied units for the period.
(1) Net of the effect of any derivative instruments. Weighted average rates are for the nine months ended September 30, 2008.

(1) Net of the effect of any derivative instruments. Weighted average rates are as of September 30, 2008.
(2) Includes the Company's $500.0 million floating rate term loan facility, which matures on October 5, 2010, subject to two one-year extension options exercisable by the Company.
(3) Includes $650.0 million of 3.85% convertible unsecured debt with a final maturity of 2026. The notes are callable by the Company on or after August 18, 2011. The notes are putable by the holders on August 18, 2011, August 15, 2016 and August 15, 2021.
(1) $150.0 million in fair value interest rate swaps converts a portion of the 4.750% notes due June 15, 2009 to a floating interest rate. During the quarter ended September 30, 2008, the Company repurchased $28.5 million of these notes at a discount to par of approximately 0.9% and recognized a gain on early debt extinguishment of $0.3 million.
(2) Convertible notes mature on August 15, 2026. The notes are callable by the Company on or after August 18, 2011. The notes are putable by the holders on August 18, 2011, August 15, 2016 and August 15, 2021.
(3) Notes are private. All other unsecured debt is public.
