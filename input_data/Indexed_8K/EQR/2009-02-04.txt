Equity Residential Reports 2008 Results
Provides Outlook for 2009 Performance
CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 4, 2009--Equity Residential (NYSE: EQR) today reported results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2008. All per share results are reported on a fully-diluted basis.
Our 2008 operating results were in line with our expectations due mostly to strong property performance in the first nine months of the year since we did not begin to feel the full impact of the slowing economy and mounting job losses until later in the year, said David J. Neithercut, Equity Residentials President and CEO. 2009 will be a challenging year as job losses are expected to continue, further weakening pricing power across our markets. Looking longer term, however, we are excited about our prospects because there is virtually no new product in the development pipeline and the demographic picture is very favorable for apartment fundamentals.
Fourth Quarter 2008
For the fourth quarter 2008, the company reported a loss of $0.13 per share compared to earnings of $0.44 per share in the fourth quarter of 2007. The difference is primarily due to a previously announced development-related impairment charge of $116.4 million, or $0.40 per share, as well as lower gains from property sales caused by lower property sales volume in 2008.
Funds from Operations (FFO) for the quarter ended December 31, 2008 were $0.29 per share compared to $0.67 per share in the same period of 2007. The companys pre-impairment FFO was $0.69 per share, approximately $0.07 per share above the midpoint of the companys guidance range provided on October 29, 2008 and primarily attributable to the following:
Higher property net operating income (NOI) than budgeted of approximately $0.01 per share due to expense savings;
Debt extinguishment gains that were approximately $0.02 per share higher than the approximately $0.04 per share of gains the company had budgeted; and
Lower interest expense of approximately $0.01 per share due to lower floating rates than budgeted; and other items, including lower than budgeted prepayment penalties and income taxes, of approximately $0.03 per share.
Year Ended December 31, 2008
For the year ended December 31, 2008, the company reported earnings of $1.49 per share compared to $3.39 per share for 2007.
FFO for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $2.18 per share compared to $2.39 per share in the same period of 2007. The companys pre-impairment FFO for the full year was $2.58 per share.
Same Store Results
On a same store fourth quarter to fourth quarter comparison, which includes 123,543 apartment units, revenues increased 2.4%, expenses increased 1.8% and NOI increased 2.8%. The increase in same store revenues was driven primarily by an increase in average rental rates.
On a same store year over year comparison, which includes 115,051 apartment units, revenues increased 3.2%, expenses increased 2.2% and NOI increased 3.8%. The increase in same store revenues was driven primarily by an increase in average rental rates.
Acquisitions/Dispositions
During the fourth quarter 2008, the company acquired one property, consisting of 304 units, for a purchase price of $43.8 million at a stabilized capitalization (cap) rate of 5.6%. The company contracted in 2006 to purchase this recently completed Phoenix, Arizona property in a pre-sale arrangement.
Also during the quarter, the company sold seven properties, consisting of 1,332 apartment units, for an aggregate sale price of $89.7 million at an average cap rate of 6.7% generating an unlevered internal rate of return (IRR) of 10.3%. In addition, the company sold 32 condominium units for an aggregate sale price of $4.5 million.
During 2008, the company acquired seven properties, consisting of 2,141 apartment units, for an aggregate purchase price of $380.7 million at an average cap rate of 5.9%, as well as an uncompleted development property for a purchase price of $31.7 million.
Also during 2008, the company sold 41 properties, consisting of 10,127 apartment units, for an aggregate sale price of $896.7 million at an average cap rate of 5.9% generating an unlevered IRR of 10.6%. In addition, the company sold 130 condominium units for an aggregate sale price of $26.1 million and one land parcel for $3.3 million.
Liquidity
On December 23, 2008, the company announced that it closed a $543.0 million secured loan from Fannie Mae (NYSE: FNM). The loan is interest only and matures in eight years with the first seven years fixed and the last year at a floating rate of interest. The all-in effective interest rate is approximately 6%. Including the above mentioned loan, during 2008 the company borrowed approximately $1.6 billion in secured debt proceeds from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (NYSE: FRE) at a weighted average rate of approximately 5.7% for an average fixed rate term of approximately nine years.
The company used approximately $445.7 million in cash on hand from the secured loans referenced above to repurchase and retire approximately $464.4 million of various unsecured notes with maturities through 2011 both through open market transactions and a public tender. This activity included the companys repurchase of approximately $174.0 million of these notes through December 31, 2008 and approximately $290.4 million of these notes during 2009. In total, this resulted in debt extinguishment gains to the company of approximately $18.7 million, all of which were recognized in 2008. Details of these transactions can be found on page 17 of this release.
The agency loans and debt repurchases are a continuation of the companys strategy to proactively address its debt maturities and wholly-owned development funding needs. At December 31, 2008, the company had approximately $1.02 billion of unrestricted cash and federally insured investment deposits (approximately $129.0 million of which are classified as "Other assets" on the balance sheet) and approximately $1.3 billion available on its unsecured revolving credit facility. After the recent debt repurchases, the company currently has approximately $515.0 million of unrestricted cash and federally insured investment deposits and approximately $1.3 billion available on its unsecured revolving credit facility. The companys total outstanding indebtedness is currently approximately $10.2 billion. The company has sufficient liquidity, between its line of credit and cash on hand, to meet its funding needs into 2011.
First Quarter and Full Year 2009 Guidance
The company has established an FFO guidance range of $0.53 to $0.58 per share for the first quarter of 2009.
The difference between the companys pre-impairment fourth quarter 2008 FFO of $0.69 per share and the midpoint of the first quarter 2009 FFO guidance range is primarily a result of the following:
Lower same store NOI of approximately $0.06 per share;
Lower interest and other income in the first quarter of 2009 due to lower debt extinguishment gains. The company recorded debt extinguishment gains of approximately $0.06 per share in the fourth quarter 2008 and has no gains from debt extinguishment budgeted in the first quarter 2009; and
Higher interest expense of approximately $0.02 per share due to the company's $543.0 million loan from Fannie Mae discussed above.
The company has established an FFO guidance range of $2.00 to $2.30 per share for the full year 2009. The assumptions underlying this guidance can be found on page 26 of this release.
The difference between the companys pre-impairment full year 2008 FFO of $2.58 per share and the midpoint of the companys guidance range for full year 2009 FFO is primarily a result of the following:
Lower same store NOI of approximately $0.27 per share;
Dilution from planned 2009 property sale and purchase activity totaling approximately $0.06 per share;
Lower interest and other income of approximately $0.08 per share due primarily to the lower debt extinguishment gains mentioned above; and
Higher interest expense of approximately $0.02 per share due to the company's $543.0 million loan from Fannie Mae offset by lower floating interest rates.
