Exhibit 99.1
Equity Residential Reports First Quarter 2009 Results
CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 29, 2009--Equity Residential (NYSE: EQR) today reported results for the quarter ended March 31, 2009. All per share results are reported on a fully-diluted basis.
Our first quarter performance was in line with our expectations, with good overall occupancy across the country demonstrating continued demand for our apartments, said David J. Neithercut, Equity Residentials President and CEO. Although net effective new lease rents have decreased in our markets from a year ago, we are pleased to see these levels holding steady, on average, since the beginning of the year. Continuing job losses leave us cautious for the remainder of the year, yet we believe that steady rents and current occupancy of 94% position us well as we enter our primary leasing season.
First Quarter 2009
For the first quarter of 2009, the company reported earnings per share of $0.28 compared to earnings of $0.50 per share in the first quarter of 2008. The difference is primarily due to lower property sales gains due to lower property sales volume in 2009.
Funds from Operations (FFO) for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 were $0.57 per share compared to $0.58 per share in the same period of 2008. The difference is due primarily to:
A net negative impact of approximately $0.01 per share from lower total net operating income (NOI) from the companys same store portfolio and dilution from 2008 and 2009 transaction activity, partially offset by the positive impact of NOI from lease-up activity and property management expense savings;
A negative impact from higher interest expense of approximately $0.02 per share as a result of higher debt balances, lower capitalized interest and write offs of unamortized loan costs from the companys debt tender and debt repurchase activities, offset in part by lower floating rates of interest;
Higher interest and other income of approximately $0.01 per share as a result of gain from the companys debt repurchase activities; and
Lower general and administrative expenses of approximately $0.01 per share.
On January 1, 2009 the company adopted FASB Staff Position APB 14-1, which requires companies to expense certain implied costs of the option value related to convertible debt. As a result, the companys first quarter 2008 and 2009 FFO per share were both negatively impacted by $0.01 per share.
The difference between the companys first quarter 2009 FFO of $0.57 per share and the companys fourth quarter 2008 FFO of $0.27 per share (as restated for comparison purposes for the adoption of FASB Staff Position APB 14-1) is primarily attributable to the following:
Approximately $0.40 per share higher FFO in the first quarter due to the impairment charge on land held for development that the company recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008;
A negative impact of approximately $0.07 per share as a result of lower NOI from the companys same store portfolio and dilution from first quarter 2009 transaction activity;
A negative impact of approximately $0.06 per share from lower debt extinguishment gains in the first quarter of 2009;
A positive impact of approximately $0.02 per share as a result of lower rates of interest on the companys debt; and
A net positive impact of approximately $0.01 per share due to miscellaneous other activities, including lower general and administrative expenses and lower transaction expenses offset by higher income taxes.
Same Store Results
On a same store first quarter to first quarter comparison, which includes 123,120 apartment units, revenues decreased 0.2%, expenses increased 2.8% and NOI decreased 2.0%.
Acquisitions/Dispositions
During the first quarter of 2009, the company sold 11 consolidated properties, consisting of 1,531 apartment units, for an aggregate sale price of $139.6 million at an average capitalization (cap) rate of 7.1% generating an unlevered internal rate of return (IRR) of 11.0%.
The company acquired no properties during the first quarter of 2009.
Liquidity
During the first quarter of 2009, the company completed a public tender to repurchase and retire at par approximately $105.2 million of the principal amount of its 4.75% Notes due June 15, 2009 and approximately $185.2 of the million principal amount of its 6.95% Notes due March 2, 2011. Also during the first quarter, the company repurchased and retired approximately $17.5 million of the principal amount of its 3.85% Convertible Notes due August 15, 2026, resulting in debt extinguishment gains to the company of approximately $2.0 million. Details of these transactions can be found on page 15 of this release.
At March 31, 2009, the company had approximately $611 million of unrestricted cash or securities readily convertible to cash (including approximately $139 million of federally insured notes and deposits classified as Other assets and approximately $43 million of 1031 exchange proceeds classified as Deposits-restricted on the balance sheet) and approximately $1.31 billion available on its unsecured revolving credit facility. The company has access to this credit facility, well-priced secured debt, improving public debt markets and net transaction proceeds from its sale of non-core assets to meet its near and longer-term funding needs.
Second Quarter 2009 Guidance
The company has established an FFO guidance range of $0.53 to $0.58 per share for the second quarter of 2009. The difference between the companys actual first quarter 2009 FFO of $0.57 per share and the midpoint of the second quarter 2009 guidance range is primarily a result of lower total NOI partially offset by lower interest expense. The second quarter 2009 guidance midpoint assumes no additional gains from debt extinguishment.

Equity Residential expects to announce second quarter 2009 results on Wednesday, July 29, 2009 and host a conference call to discuss those results at 10:00 a.m. CT on Thursday, July 30, 2009.
