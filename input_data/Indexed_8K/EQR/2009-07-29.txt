Exhibit 99.1
Equity Residential Reports Second Quarter 2009 Results
Announces Expected Reduction of Common Share Annual Dividend to $1.35 per Share
CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 29, 2009--Equity Residential (NYSE: EQR) today reported results for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2009. All per share results are reported on a fully-diluted basis.
We are pleased to deliver better than expected second quarter results as well as forecast modestly higher same store net operating income for the year than we originally thought, said David J. Neithercut, Equity Residentials President and CEO. While lower operating expenses are the major contributor to our improved forecast, we are pleased that our revenue expectation for the year is essentially unchanged because our commitment to resident satisfaction is enabling us to retain existing residents at renewal rents higher than might have been expected in this extremely difficult economic climate.
Second Quarter 2009
For the second quarter of 2009, the company reported earnings per share of $0.35 compared to earnings of $0.46 per share in the second quarter of 2008. The difference is primarily due to lower gains from property sales caused by lower property sales volume in 2009 and lower property net operating income (NOI) and a development-related impairment charge, which are both discussed below.
Funds from Operations (FFO) for the quarter ended June 30, 2009 was $0.58 per share compared to $0.64 per share in the same period of 2008. The difference is due primarily to:
the net negative impact of approximately $0.05 per share from lower total NOI from the companys same store portfolio and dilution from 2008 and 2009 transaction activity, partially offset by the positive impact of NOI from lease-up activity;
the negative impact of approximately $0.04 per share from a non-cash charge of $11.1 million to reflect impairment in the value of a land parcel; and
the net positive impact of approximately $0.03 per share due to lower interest expense, higher interest and other income and certain other non-comparable items listed on page 23 of this release.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2009
For the six months ended June 30, 2009, the company reported earnings of $0.64 per share compared to $0.96 per share in the same period of 2008.
FFO for the six months ended June 30, 2009 was $1.16 per share compared to $1.22 per share in the same period of 2008.
Same Store Results
On a same store second quarter to second quarter comparison, which includes 121,256 apartment units, revenues decreased 2.4%, expenses decreased 0.6% and NOI decreased 3.4%. The revenue decrease was due to a 1.2% decrease in average rental rate and a 1.2% decrease in occupancy to 93.7%. The expense decrease was primarily due to a 2.8% decrease in utility expense and a 0.8% decrease in payroll.
On a same store six-month to six-month comparison, which includes 120,452 apartment units, revenues decreased 1.3%, expenses increased 1.1% and NOI decreased 2.8%.
Acquisitions/Dispositions
During the second quarter of 2009, the company sold 12 properties, consisting of 2,668 apartment units, for an aggregate sale price of $213.8 million at a weighted average capitalization (cap) rate of 7.6% generating an unlevered internal rate of return (IRR) of 9.7%. The company acquired no properties during the second quarter of 2009.
During the first six months of 2009, the company sold 23 consolidated properties, consisting of 4,199 apartment units, for an aggregate sale price of $353.4 million at a weighted average cap rate of 7.4% generating an unlevered IRR of 10.2%. The company acquired no properties during the first six months of 2009.
Liquidity
On June 29, 2009, the company closed a $500.0 million secured loan with Freddie Mac (NYSE: FRE), originated by Deutsche Bank Berkshire Mortgage. The loan is interest only and matures in eleven years with the first ten years fixed and the final year at a floating rate of interest. The loan, which is collateralized with thirteen assets in seven markets, has an all-in effective interest rate of approximately 5.6%. The closing of this loan continues the company's strategy of maintaining excellent liquidity and addressing funding obligations well before loan maturities.
The company currently has $565.0 million in unrestricted cash or securities readily convertible to cash, inclusive of the secured loan proceeds, and $1.35 billion available on its unsecured revolving credit facility. With current cash on hand, the company can meet all of its 2009 and 2010 debt maturities and development obligations. Inclusive of current cash on hand, the unsecured revolving credit facility and net disposition proceeds for 2009 as provided in current guidance, the company can meet all of its obligations through 2011.
Expected Dividend Reduction
The company expects to reduce its quarterly common share dividend, beginning with the dividend for the third quarter of 2009, from $0.4825 per share (an annual rate of $1.93 per share) to $0.3375 per share (an annual rate of $1.35 per share).
We expect to take this step as a result of reductions in our cash flow from ongoing operations and also to position the company to take advantage of opportunities that may lie ahead, said Mr. Neithercut.
Third Quarter 2009 Guidance
The company has established an FFO guidance range of $0.49 to $0.53 per share for the third quarter of 2009. The difference between the companys actual pre-impairment second quarter 2009 FFO of $0.62 per share and the midpoint of the range for the third quarter is primarily attributable to:
the negative impact of approximately $0.07 per share from lower NOI from the companys same store portfolio as well as dilution from 2009 transaction activity;
the negative impact of approximately $0.02 per share from increased interest expense due to higher debt balances as a result of the companys recent $500.0 million loan from Freddie Mac and lower capitalized interest due to reduced development activity; and
the negative impact of approximately $0.02 per share from lower interest and other income in the third quarter.
Full Year 2009 Guidance
The company has revised its guidance for its full year 2009 same store operating performance, funds from operations results and transactions activities as well as other items listed on page 24 of this release. The changes to the full year same store and FFO guidance are listed below:
The guidance midpoint for the companys full year 2009 FFO remains the same as the companys previous guidance due to higher than expected property NOI and higher interest and other income offset by the impairment charge. Annual interest expense is largely unchanged as higher expense due to the $500.0 million loan from Freddie Mac is offset by lower than anticipated rates on the companys floating rate debt.
