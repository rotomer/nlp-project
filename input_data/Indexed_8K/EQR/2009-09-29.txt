In connection with the commencement of a "continuous equity" offering under which Equity Residential, a Maryland real estate investment trust (the "Company"), may sell up to 17,000,000 common shares of beneficial interest, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Shares") from time to time during a three-year period in "at the market" offerings or certain other transactions (the "Offering"), the Company today filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") a prospectus supplement dated September 28, 2009 (the "Prospectus Supplement"). The Company may sell the Shares in amounts and at times to be determined by the Company from time to time, but has no obligation to sell any of the Shares in the Offering. Actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the Company from time to time, including (among others) market conditions, the trading price of the Company's common shares and determinations by the Company of the appropriate sources of funding for the Company.
The Offering will occur pursuant to three separate sales agency financing agreements (individually, a "Sales Agreement" and together, the "Sales Agreements") entered into by the Company and its operating partnership, ERP Operating Limited Partnership (the "Operating Partnership"), with each of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, as agents for the offer and sale of the Shares (individually, a "Sales Agent" and together, the "Sales Agents"). Each Sales Agreement has a three-year term and provides that the Company may offer and sell from time to time pursuant to the Sales Agreements up to 17,000,000 Shares during such three-year term through the Sales Agents. The Sales Agreements provide that each Sales Agent will be entitled to compensation not to exceed 2.0% of the gross sales price per share for any of the Shares sold under the relevant Sales Agreement.
Sales of the Shares, if any, under the Sales Agreements may be made in transactions that are deemed to be "at-the-market offerings" as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including sales made directly on the New York Stock Exchange or sales made to or through a market maker other than on an exchange, as well as in negotiated or other transactions described in the Prospectus Supplement. The Company has no obligation to sell any of the Shares in the Offering, and may at any time suspend solicitation and offers under the Sales Agreements or terminate the Sales Agreements.
The Shares will be issued pursuant to the Prospectus Supplement and the Company's automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-156156) filed on December 16, 2008 with the SEC. This Current Report shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration of qualification under the securities laws of any such state.
The Sales Agreements are filed as Exhibits 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 to this Current Report. The description of the Sales Agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Sales Agreements filed herewith as exhibits to the Current Report.
 
On September 29, 2009, the Company announced via press release that it has filed the Prospectus Supplement with the SEC and entered into three separate Sales Agreements with the Sale Agents for the Offering. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
(d) Exhibits.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Indemnification by the Transaction Entities
(i)        against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any
 
amendment thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Prospectus Supplement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or the omission, or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
(ii)        against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation or of any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, provided that (subject to Section 6.03 below) any such settlement is effected with the written consent of EQR; and
(iii)        against any and all expense whatsoever as incurred (including, without limitation, the fees and other charges of counsel chosen by you) reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above;
, , that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense arises out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Prospectus Supplement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to EQR by Merrill Lynch expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Prospectus Supplement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act.
provided

by Merrill Lynch expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Prospectus Supplement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act.
Section 6.03    .  (a)  Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6.01 above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by Merrill Lynch, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6.02 above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by EQR. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under Section 6.01, Section 6.02 or Section 6.04 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings
(b)        If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6.01(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.
Section 6.04    .  If the indemnification provided for in Section 6.01 and Section 6.02 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect benefits received by EQR, on the one hand, and Merrill Lynch, on the other
Contribution
 
hand, from the offering of the Program Shares to which such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses relate or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of EQR, on the one hand, and of Merrill Lynch, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by EQR on the one hand and Merrill Lynch on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of Program Shares (before deducting expenses) received by EQR bear to the total commissions received by Merrill Lynch.
The relative fault of EQR, on the one hand, and Merrill Lynch, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by EQR or by Merrill Lynch and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
EQR and Merrill Lynch agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 6.04 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 6.04. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 6.04 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6.04, Merrill Lynch shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Program Shares sold by it were sold to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which Merrill Lynch has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
For purposes of this Section 6.04, each person, if any, who controls Merrill Lynch within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as Merrill Lynch, and each trustee, each officer of EQR who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls EQR or ERP within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as EQR.

Term
Section 7.02    .  Merrill Lynch may, in its sole discretion at any time, terminate the right of EQR to effect any Issuances under this Agreement, but any such termination shall not affect the settlement of any sales of Issuance Shares made pursuant to any Issuance Notice given prior to receipt by the applicable party of notice of such termination.
Termination by Merrill Lynch
Section 7.03    .  EQR may, in its sole discretion at any time, terminate this Agreement, but any such termination shall not affect the settlement of any sales of Issuance Shares made pursuant to any Issuance Notice give prior to receipt by the applicable party of notice of such termination.

If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Article VII, such termination shall be without liability of any party hereto to any other party hereto except as provided in Section 9.02 and for EQR's obligations in respect of all prior Issuance Notices, and provided further that in any case the provisions of Article VI, Article VIII and Article IX shall survive termination of this Agreement without limitation.
Liability; Provisions that Survive Termination

Issuance Notice
(b)        .  An Issuance Notice shall be deemed delivered on the Trading Day that it is received by facsimile or otherwise (and EQR confirms such delivery by e-mail notice or by telephone (including voicemail message)) by JPMorgan. No Issuance Notice may be delivered other than on a Trading Day during the Commitment Period.
Delivery of Issuance Notice
(c)        .  JPMorgan shall not sell Program Shares below the Floor Price during any Selling Period and such Floor Price may be adjusted by EQR at any time during any Selling Period upon notice to JPMorgan and confirmation to EQR.

Trading Guidelines
 
Section 2.04    .  Subject to the provisions of Article V, on or before each Settlement Date, EQR will, or will cause its transfer agent to, electronically transfer the applicable Issuance Shares that have been sold by crediting JPMorgan or its designee's account at the Depository Trust Company through its Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian (DWAC) System, or by such other means of delivery as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties hereto and, upon receipt of such Issuance Shares, which in all cases shall be freely tradeable, transferable, registered shares in good deliverable form, JPMorgan will deliver the related Issuance Price in same day funds delivered to an account designated by EQR prior to the Settlement Date. If EQR defaults in its obligation to deliver Issuance Shares on a Settlement Date, EQR agrees that it will (i) hold JPMorgan harmless against any loss, claim, damage or expense (including, without limitation, penalties, interest and reasonable legal fees and expenses), as incurred, arising out of or in connection with such default by EQR, and (ii) pay to JPMorgan any Selling Commission to which it would otherwise have been entitled absent such default.

Settlements
Section 2.05    .  Other than the press release to be issued by EQR on the date hereof and filed as a free writing prospectus, a copy of which has been provided to JPMorgan, neither EQR nor JPMorgan has prepared, used, referred to or distributed, or will prepare, use, refer to or distribute, without the other party's prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, any "written communication" which constitutes a "free writing prospectus" as such terms are defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act with respect to the offering of Program Shares contemplated by this Agreement.
Use of Free Writing Prospectus
Section 2.06    .  EQR agrees that any offer to sell, any solicitation of an offer to buy, or any sales of Program Shares or any other equity security of EQR shall only be effected by or through only one of JPMorgan or the Alternative Sales Agents on any single given day, but in no event by more than one, and EQR shall in no event request that JPMorgan and any other Alternative Sales Agent sell Program Shares on the same day.
Alternative Sales Agents
Section 2.07    .  If any party believes that the exemptive provisions set forth in Rule 101(c)(1) of Regulation M under the Exchange Act (applicable to securities with an average daily trading volume of $1,000,000 that are issued by an issuer whose common equity securities have a public float value of at least $150,000,000) are not satisfied with respect to EQR or the Program Shares, it shall promptly notify the other party and sales of Program Shares under the Sales Agency Agreements shall be suspended until that or other exemptive provisions have been satisfied in the reasonable judgment of all parties.
Exemption from Regulation M
Section 2.08    .  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in the event EQR engages JPMorgan for a sale of Program Shares that would constitute a "distribution" within the meaning of Rule 100 of Regulation M under the Exchange Act, EQR and JPMorgan will agree to compensation that is customary for JPMorgan with respect to such transactions.

JPMorgan agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each of EQR and ERP, and each person, if any, who controls EQR or ERP within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and any trustee, director, officer, employee or affiliate thereof, against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section 6.02, as incurred; but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Prospectus Supplement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, in reliance upon, and in conformity with, written information furnished to EQR by JPMorgan expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Prospectus Supplement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act.
Indemnification by JPMorgan
Section 6.03    .  (a) Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action
Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings
 
commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6.01 above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by JPMorgan, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6.02 above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by EQR. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under Section 6.01, Section 6.02 or Section 6.04 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(b)        If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6.01(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.
Section 6.04    .  If the indemnification provided for in Section 6.01 and Section 6.02 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect benefits received by EQR, on the one hand, and JPMorgan, on the other hand, from the offering of the Program Shares to which such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses relate or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of EQR, on the one hand, and of JPMorgan, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by EQR on the one hand and JPMorgan on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of Program Shares (before deducting expenses) received by EQR bear to the total commissions received by JPMorgan.
Contribution
 
The relative fault of EQR, on the one hand, and JPMorgan, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by EQR or by JPMorgan and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
EQR and JPMorgan agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 6.04 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 6.04. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 6.04 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6.04, JPMorgan shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Program Shares sold by it were sold to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which JPMorgan has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
For purposes of this Section 6.04, each person, if any, who controls JPMorgan within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as JPMorgan, and each trustee, each officer of EQR who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls EQR or ERP within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as EQR.

(i)        against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue
 
statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Prospectus Supplement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or the omission, or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
(ii)        against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation or of any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, provided that (subject to Section 6.03 below) any such settlement is effected with the written consent of EQR; and
(iii)        against any and all expense whatsoever as incurred (including, without limitation, the fees and other charges of counsel chosen by you) reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above;
, , that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense arises out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Prospectus Supplement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to EQR by Morgan Stanley expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Prospectus Supplement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act.
provided
however
Section 6.02    .  Morgan Stanley agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each of EQR and ERP, and each person, if any, who controls EQR or ERP within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and any trustee, director, officer, employee or affiliate thereof, against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section 6.02, as incurred; but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Prospectus Supplement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under
Indemnification by Morgan Stanley
 
the Securities Act, in reliance upon, and in conformity with, written information furnished to EQR by Morgan Stanley expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Prospectus Supplement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act.
Section 6.03    .  (a) Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6.01 above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by Morgan Stanley, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6.02 above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by EQR. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under Section 6.01, Section 6.02 or Section 6.04 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings
(b)        If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6.01(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.
Section 6.04    .  If the indemnification provided for in Section 6.01 and Section 6.02 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is
Contribution
 
appropriate to reflect benefits received by EQR, on the one hand, and Morgan Stanley, on the other hand, from the offering of the Program Shares to which such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses relate or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of EQR, on the one hand, and of Morgan Stanley, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by EQR on the one hand and Morgan Stanley on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of Program Shares (before deducting expenses) received by EQR bear to the total commissions received by Morgan Stanley.
The relative fault of EQR, on the one hand, and Morgan Stanley, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by EQR or by Morgan Stanley and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
EQR and Morgan Stanley agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 6.04 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 6.04. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 6.04 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6.04, Morgan Stanley shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Program Shares sold by it were sold to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which Morgan Stanley has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
For purposes of this Section 6.04, each person, if any, who controls Morgan Stanley within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as Morgan Stanley, and each trustee, each officer of EQR who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls EQR or ERP within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as EQR.
 
Section 7.01    .  Subject to the provisions of this Article VII, the term of this Agreement shall run until the end of the Commitment Period.
Term
Section 7.02    .  Morgan Stanley may, in its sole discretion at any time, terminate the right of EQR to effect any Issuances under this Agreement, but any such termination shall not affect the settlement of any sales of Issuance Shares made pursuant to any Issuance Notice given prior to receipt by the applicable party of notice of such termination.
Termination by Morgan Stanley
Section 7.03    .  EQR may, in its sole discretion at any time, terminate this Agreement, but any such termination shall not affect the settlement of any sales of Issuance Shares made pursuant to any Issuance Notice give prior to receipt by the applicable party of notice of such termination.
Termination by EQR
Section 7.04    .  If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Article VII, such termination shall be without liability of any party hereto to any other party hereto except as provided in Section 9.02 and for EQR's obligations in respect of all prior Issuance Notices, and provided further that in any case the provisions of Article VI, Article VIII and Article IX shall survive termination of this Agreement without limitation.
Liability; Provisions that Survive Termination

Section 9.01    .  EQR may issue a press release describing the material terms of the transactions contemplated hereby as soon as practicable following the Closing Date, and may file with the Commission a Current Report on Form 8-K describing the material terms of the transactions contemplated hereby, and EQR shall consult with Morgan Stanley prior to making such disclosures, and the parties shall use all commercially reasonable efforts, acting in good faith, to agree upon a text for such disclosures that is reasonably satisfactory to all parties.

Section 9.02    .

We have examined and relied upon originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such agreements, instruments, certificates, records and other documents as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purpose of rendering the opinions set forth this opinion letter.
In our examination, we have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies or by facsimile or other means of electronic transmission or which we obtained from the Commission's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system ("") or other sites on the internet, and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. As to facts and other matters relevant to the opinions expressed herein, we have relied without independent investigation or verification upon, and assumed the accuracy and completeness of, (a) certificates, letters and oral and written statements and representations of public officials, officers and other representatives of the Company, accountants for the Company, and others, and (b) the representations and warranties in the Sales Agency Financing Agreements.
EDGAR
Based on and subject to the foregoing and the other limitations, qualifications, exceptions and assumptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that:
1        The Shares have been duly authorized by the Company for issuance and sale pursuant to the Sales Agency Financing Agreements.
2        When (i) the purchase price or prices for the Shares and the number of the Shares (in any case not to exceed 17,000,000 in the aggregate) to be offered and sold from time to time have been duly established and approved by resolutions duly adopted by the Company's board of trustees or a duly authorized committee thereof (the "") and agreed upon by the Company and the respective purchasers of the Shares, and (ii) the Shares have been issued and delivered by the Company against payment of such purchase price or prices, as the case may be, in accordance with the relevant Sales Agency Financing Agreement, after deduction from such purchase price or prices of the Agent's commission and such other amounts, if any, as may be deducted therefrom in accordance with such Sales Agency Financing Agreement and resolutions duly adopted by the Board, the Shares will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable; , that (A) the purchase price per Share paid by purchasers is equal to or in excess of the par value per Common Share and in excess of any minimum purchase price, and within any other parameters, established by the Board and (B) the aggregate number of Shares issued and issuable pursuant to the Sales Agency Financing Agreements, when taken together with the other issued and outstanding Common Shares (including any treasury shares), does not exceed the number of authorized Common Shares set forth in the Articles of Restatement of Declaration of Trust of the Company.
Board

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
NEWS RELEASE -
 
SEPTEMBER 29, 2009
Equity Residential (NYSE: EQR), today announced that the company has created an At-The-Market (ATM) share offering program through which it could sell up to 17 million common shares. The shares would be offered through BofA Merrill Lynch, J.P. Morgan and Morgan Stanley, who will be acting as sales agents.
Chicago, IL  September 29, 2009 -
"With more than $800 million of cash, $1.36 billion of availability under our credit facility and the continued ability to sell non-core assets, we see no immediate need to sell common shares," said David J. Neithercut, Equity Residential's President and CEO. "This program will, however, allow us to quickly access the equity market should that capital be necessary to fund future investment opportunities."
The ATM program would allow the company to sell up to 17 million common shares from time to time through the sales agents for a 36-month period. The sales, if any, would be made in "at the market" offerings as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act. In addition, the common shares may be offered and sold through privately negotiated transactions. The company intends to use the proceeds from any offering for working capital and general company purposes including, without limitation, the acquisition or development of multifamily properties as suitable opportunities arise and the reduction of debt.
The company has filed a registration statement (including a prospectus) with the SEC for the offering of common shares described in this communication. Before you invest, you should read the prospectus in that registration statement and other documents the company has filed with the SEC for more complete information about the company and this offering.
