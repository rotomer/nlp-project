Equity Residential Reports 2009 Results
Provides Outlook for 2010 Performance
CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 3, 2010--Equity Residential (NYSE: EQR) today reported results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2009. All per share results are reported on a fully-diluted basis.
2009 was a difficult year for our national economy, the apartment business and for Equity Residential, said David J. Neithercut, Equity Residentials President and CEO. However, despite the highest unemployment levels in recent history, our same store revenues were down only 2.9% for the year, which is a credit to our people, our properties and our platform. We are excited about our prospects as fundamentals improve in the year ahead.
Fourth Quarter 2009
For the fourth quarter of 2009, the company reported earnings of $0.15 per share compared to a loss of $0.15 per share in the fourth quarter of 2008. The difference is primarily due to the fourth quarter 2008 impairment charge on various land parcels of $116.4 million, or $0.40 per share, partially offset by the $18.5 million, or $0.06 per share, debt extinguishment gain in the same period and the previously announced charges of approximately $24.9 million, or $0.09 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2009 related to the tender offers for certain of the companys notes.
FFO (funds from operations) for the quarter ended December 31, 2009 was $0.43 per share compared to $0.27 per share in the same period of 2008. Excluding the tender offer related charge, the companys fourth quarter 2009 FFO was $0.52 per share.
Excluding the one-time items discussed above, the difference between the companys fourth quarter 2009 FFO of $0.52 per share and the fourth quarter 2008 FFO of $0.61 per share is primarily due to the negative impact of:
approximately $0.06 per share from lower net operating income (NOI) from the companys same store portfolio; and
approximately $0.04 per share from dilution from the companys 2008 and 2009 transaction activity, partially offset by the positive impact of NOI from lease-up activity.
Year Ended December 31, 2009
For the year ended December 31, 2009, the company reported earnings of $1.27 per share compared to $1.46 per share for 2008.
FFO for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $2.12 per share compared to $2.13 per share in the same period of 2008.
Same Store Results
On a same store fourth quarter to fourth quarter comparison, which includes 117,683 apartment units, revenues decreased 4.7%, expenses decreased 1.9% and NOI decreased 6.3%. The decrease in same store revenues was primarily driven by a 4.5% decrease in average rental rates. The decrease in same store expenses was primarily driven by decreases in real estate taxes and payroll.
On a same store year over year comparison, which includes 113,598 apartment units, revenues decreased 2.9%, expenses decreased 0.1% and NOI decreased 4.6%. The decrease in same store revenues was due to a 2.2% decrease in average rental rates and a 0.7% decrease in average occupancy to 93.8%.
Acquisitions/Dispositions
During the fourth quarter and for the full year 2009, the company acquired two properties, consisting of 566 units, for an aggregate purchase price of $145.0 million at a weighted average capitalization (cap) rate of 5.9%, as well as a long-term leasehold interest in a land parcel located in Manhattan for a purchase price of $11.5 million.
Since the end of 2009, the company acquired five properties, consisting of 1,174 units, for an aggregate purchase price of $495.6 million at a weighted average cap rate of 5.7%. This includes the acquisition of the two properties located in Manhattan which was previously announced on February 1, 2010.
We have been very patient for the last several years, waiting for the right opportunities to acquire assets and grow our portfolio in core markets, said Mr. Neithercut. We have recently been presented with such opportunities and are delighted to have acquired several extremely well located, premier assets at significant discounts to replacement cost. Our access to capital and our ability to execute large, complex transactions will be competitive advantages in 2010.
During the fourth quarter of 2009, the company sold seven consolidated properties, consisting of 2,236 apartment units, for an aggregate sale price of $170.7 million at a weighted average cap rate of 7.8% generating an unlevered internal rate of return (IRR) of 10.6%.
During 2009, the company sold 54 consolidated properties, consisting of 11,055 apartment units, for an aggregate sale price of $905.2 million at a weighted average cap rate of 7.6% generating an unlevered IRR of 9.9%.
Debt Tender Offer Results
During the fourth quarter of 2009, the company purchased approximately $344.3 million of certain of its non-exchangeable and exchangeable notes in a debt tender offer. The aggregate consideration for the notes accepted for purchase was approximately $366.2 million. These purchases are described in more detail in the supplemental information on page 17 of this press release.
At-The-Market (ATM) Share Offering Program
During the fourth quarter of 2009, the company issued approximately 3.5 million common shares at an average price of $35.38 per share for total consideration of approximately $123.7 million. In addition, during the first quarter of 2010, the company has issued approximately 1.1 million common shares at an average price of $33.87 per share for total consideration of approximately $35.8 million. Cumulative to date, the company has issued approximately 4.6 million common shares at an average price of $35.03 per share for total consideration of approximately $159.5 million under this program.
First Quarter and Full Year 2010 Guidance
The company has established an FFO guidance range of $0.48 to $0.52 per share for the first quarter of 2010. The difference between the companys fourth-quarter 2009 FFO of $0.52 per share, excluding the tender offer related charge, and the midpoint of the first quarter 2010 FFO guidance range is primarily the result of the following:
the negative impact from lower same store NOI of approximately $0.03 per share sequentially from the fourth quarter to the first quarter; and
the positive impact of lower interest expense of approximately $0.01 per share.
The company has established an FFO guidance range of $1.95 to $2.15 per share for the full year 2010. The assumptions underlying this guidance can be found on page 25 of this release. The difference between the companys full-year 2009 FFO of $2.21 per share, excluding the tender offer related charge, and the midpoint of the companys guidance range for full year 2010 FFO is primarily the result of:
the negative impact of lower same store NOI of approximately $0.16 per share year over year;
the negative impact of net dilution from 2009 and 2010 transaction activity of approximately $0.11 per share;
the positive impact of approximately $0.09 per share from the lease up of development properties; and
the positive impact of approximately $0.03 per share from lower interest expense.
