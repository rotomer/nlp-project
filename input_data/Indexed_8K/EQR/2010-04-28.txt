Equity Residential Reports First Quarter 2010 Results
Same Store Revenues Exceeding Companys Expectations
CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 28, 2010--Equity Residential (NYSE: EQR) today reported results for the quarter ended March 31, 2010. All per share results are reported on a fully-diluted basis.
We are very pleased with our same store revenue results for the quarter and encouraged by the improving fundamentals we are seeing across all of our markets, said David J. Neithercut, Equity Residentials President and CEO. If these trends continue, we expect sequential same store revenues to be positive as soon as the second quarter and we should achieve both same store revenue and FFO (funds from operations) results for the year at the upper end of our guidance ranges.
First Quarter 2010
For the first quarter of 2010, the company reported earnings of $0.18 per share compared to $0.28 per share in the first quarter of 2009.
FFO for the quarter ended March 31, 2010 was $0.51 per share excluding the negative impact of property acquisition costs previously budgeted to occur in the second quarter and unexpected storm related costs as a result of severe snow on the East Coast and heavy rains in California and Arizona. Reported FFO for the period including these items was $0.49 per share.
The difference between the companys first quarter 2010 FFO of $0.49 per share and the first quarter 2009 FFO of $0.57 per share is primarily due to:
a negative impact of approximately $0.09 per share from lower total property net operating income (NOI) driven by lower same store NOI, inclusive of the impact of the unexpected storm related costs mentioned above, and dilution from the companys 2009 transaction activity partially offset by the positive impact of NOI from lease-up activity;
a negative impact of approximately $0.02 per share from accelerated property acquisition and other miscellaneous costs; and
a positive impact of approximately $0.03 per share from lower total interest expense as a result of the companys debt tenders in 2009.
Same Store Results
On a same store first quarter to first quarter comparison, which includes 117,512 apartment units, revenues decreased 2.9%, expenses increased 1.5% and NOI decreased 5.6%. Same store revenue results were impacted by the following, all of which were better than company expectations:
a 100 basis point increase in occupancy to 94.7%;
a 170 basis point decrease in turnover;
the spread between expiring lease rates and net effective new lease rates was less than expected, in part, because some markets turned positive; and
renewal lease rate increases across the companys portfolio.
Acquisitions/Dispositions
During the first quarter of 2010, the company acquired six properties, consisting of 1,467 apartment units, for an aggregate purchase price of $639.3 million at an average capitalization (cap) rate of 5.6% and one land parcel, located adjacent to one of the companys properties in Arlington, Virginia, for approximately $12.0 million.
Since the end of the first quarter, the company acquired one property, the previously announced acquisition of 425 Mass in Washington, D.C., for a purchase price of approximately $166.8 million.
During the first quarter of 2010, the company sold eight consolidated properties, consisting of 2,011 apartment units, for an aggregate sale price of $145.9 million at an average cap rate of 7.5% generating an unlevered internal rate of return (IRR) of 9.4%. The company has not sold any properties since the end of the first quarter.
At-The-Market (ATM) Share Offering Program
During the first quarter of 2010, the company issued approximately 1.1 million common shares at an average price of $33.87 per share for total consideration of approximately $35.8 million under its ATM Share Offering Program. The company has approximately 12.4 million shares available for issuance under this program and has not issued any such shares since January 14, 2010.
Second Quarter 2010 Guidance
The company has established an FFO guidance range of $0.53 to $0.57 per share for the second quarter of 2010. The primary drivers of the difference between the companys first quarter 2010 actual FFO of $0.49 per share and the midpoint of the second quarter 2010 guidance range of $0.55 per share are:
a positive impact of approximately $0.03 per share from same store NOI;
a positive impact of approximately $0.02 per share from 2010 acquisitions and lease up activity; and
a positive impact of approximately $0.01 per share from the timing of property acquisition costs.
