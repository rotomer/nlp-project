Equity Residential Reports Second Quarter 2010 Results
Improving Revenue Results in Increased Guidance for 2010
CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 28, 2010--Equity Residential (NYSE: EQR) today reported results for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2010. All per share results are reported on a fully-diluted basis.
We are pleased that the strong and broad based recovery in apartment fundamentals that began earlier this year has continued through our primary leasing season, said David J. Neithercut, Equity Residentials President and CEO. With strong occupancy, little new supply and favorable demographics, we expect top line growth for years to come. Obviously, the rate of that growth is highly dependent on employment growth.
Second Quarter 2010
The company reported solid results for the quarter with FFO (funds from operations) that exceeded the high end of the companys guidance range. In addition, same store sequential revenues turned positive for the first time in six quarters and the company expects that in the third quarter, same store quarter over quarter revenues and NOI (net operating income) will turn positive.
For the second quarter of 2010, the company reported earnings of $0.02 per share compared to the pre-impairment $0.39 per share in the second quarter of 2009. The difference is due primarily to lower gains from property sales in 2010.
FFO for the quarter ended June 30, 2010 was $0.58 per share compared to the pre-impairment $0.62 per share for the same period of 2009. The difference is due primarily to:
the negative impact of approximately $0.03 per share from lower NOI from the companys same store portfolio;
the negative impact of approximately $0.05 per share of dilution from the companys 2009 transaction activity, partially offset by accretion of $0.02 per share of NOI from the companys 2010 transaction activity;
the positive impact of approximately $0.03 per share of NOI from lease-up activity; and
the negative impact of approximately $0.01 per share from lower interest and other income.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2010
For the six months ended June 30, 2010, the company reported earnings of $0.21 per share compared to $0.64 per share in the same period of 2009.
FFO for the six months ended June 30, 2010 was $1.07 per share compared to $1.16 per share in the same period of 2009.
Same Store Results
On a same store second quarter to second quarter comparison, which includes 117,349 apartment units, revenues decreased 1.2%, expenses increased 1.5% and NOI decreased 2.9%.
On a same store sequential first quarter to second quarter comparison, which includes 119,806 apartment units, revenues increased 1.3%, expenses decreased 4.3% and NOI increased 5.1%.
On a same store six-month to six-month comparison, which includes 117,349 apartment units, revenues decreased 2.1%, expenses increased 1.5% and NOI decreased 4.2%.
Acquisitions/Dispositions
During the second quarter of 2010, the company acquired two properties, consisting of 742 apartment units, for an aggregate purchase price of $210.1 million: a 183-unit property in Fullerton, CA for a purchase price of $43.3 million at a capitalization (cap) rate of 5.7%; and as previously announced, 425 Mass in Washington, D.C., consisting of 559 units, for a purchase price of $166.8 million. 425 Mass was unoccupied on the purchase date and the company expects a stabilized yield of 8.5% in the third year of ownership. As of June 30, 2010, the property was 30% leased. The company did not sell any consolidated properties during the quarter.
During the first six months of 2010, the company acquired eight properties, consisting of 2,209 apartment units, for an aggregate purchase price of $849.4 million. The weighted average cap rate on these acquisitions excluding the 425 Mass purchase was 5.6%. Also during the first six months of 2010, the company sold eight consolidated properties, consisting of 2,011 apartment units, for an aggregate sale price of $145.9 million at a weighted average cap rate of 7.5% generating an unlevered internal rate of return (IRR) of 9.4%.
Prospect Towers
On July 16, 2010, a portion of the garage at a company owned property in Hackensack, NJ collapsed. There were no injuries as a result and an investigation as to the cause is ongoing. The property, known as Prospect Towers, includes a 203-unit, mid-rise building in which residents remain in occupancy and a 157-unit, 18-story high-rise building that will be unavailable for occupancy until mid-November while electrical, water and life safety systems are restored. The company currently estimates that the costs (both expensed and capitalized), including providing for our residents interim needs, lost revenue and garage reconstruction, will be approximately $12 million, after insurance reimbursements of $8 million. The company estimates a negative impact on FFO of approximately $0.02 per share for the third quarter 2010 and $0.03 per share for the full year 2010, which are included in the revised guidance ranges provided in this press release.
At-The-Market (ATM) Share Offering Program
During the second quarter of 2010, the company did not issue any common shares under its ATM Share Offering Program. The company has approximately 12.4 million shares available for issuance under this program and has not issued any such shares since January 14, 2010.
Debt Offering
On July 15, 2010, the company closed on a $600.0 million unsecured notes offering maturing July 15, 2020 with a coupon rate of 4.75% and an all-in effective interest rate of 5.09% including the effect of fees and the termination of certain interest rate hedges. Proceeds from the issuance are being used to pay down the companys unsecured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes.
Third Quarter 2010 Guidance
The company has established an FFO guidance range of $0.51 to $0.55 per share for the third quarter of 2010. The difference between the companys actual second quarter 2010 FFO of $0.58 per share and the midpoint of the range for the third quarter is primarily attributable to:
the positive impact of $0.02 per share from higher NOI from same store and lease-up properties;
the negative impact of $0.03 per share from higher interest expense primarily from the unsecured debt offering and a prepayment penalty on an expected disposition;
the negative impact of $0.02 per share from the costs associated with Prospect Towers; and
the negative impact of $0.02 per share from lower interest and other income and increased other expenses.
Full Year 2010 Guidance
The company has revised its guidance for its full year 2010 same store operating performance and FFO results as well as other items listed on page 25 of this release. The changes to the full year same store and FFO guidance are listed below:
The difference between the midpoint of the previous FFO guidance range and the midpoint of the revised guidance range is due primarily to:
the positive impact of $0.13 per share from higher NOI from same store and lease-up properties;
the positive impact of $0.04 per share from 2010 transaction activity and timing;
the negative impact of $0.03 per share from higher interest expense primarily from the unsecured debt offering; and
the negative impact of $0.03 per share from the costs associated with Prospect Towers offset by a positive $0.01 per share of higher interest and other income.

Equity Residential expects to announce third quarter 2010 results on Wednesday, October 27, 2010 and host a conference call to discuss those results at 10:00 a.m. CT on Thursday, October 28, 2010.

(1) The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") defines funds from operations ("FFO") (April 2002 White Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP")), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. The April 2002 White Paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from FFO for previously depreciated operating properties only. Once the Company commences the conversion of units to condominiums, it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property. FFO available to Common Shares and Units is calculated on a basis consistent with net income available to Common Shares and reflects adjustments to net income for preferred distributions and premiums on redemption of preferred shares in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The equity positions of various individuals and entities that contributed their properties to the Operating Partnership in exchange for OP Units are collectively referred to as the "Noncontrolling Interests - Operating Partnership". Subject to certain restrictions, the Noncontrolling Interests - Operating Partnership may exchange their OP Units for EQR Common Shares on a one-for-one basis.
(2) The Company believes that FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and Units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company, because they are recognized measures of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and Units can help compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and Units do not represent net income, net income available to Common Shares or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and Units should not be exclusively considered as alternatives to net income, net income available to Common Shares or net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The Company's calculation of FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and Units may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies.
