ITEM 8.01 Other Events
     Equity Residential (the "Company") is re-issuing in an updated format its historical financial statements to satisfy SEC requirements as they relate to discontinued operations.
     The results of operations of the Company's consolidated properties that were sold during the first six months of 2010 were reported as a component of discontinued operations for each period presented (including the comparable period of the prior year) in the Company's second quarter 2010 quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August 5, 2010. Under SEC requirements, the same reclassification as discontinued operations is required for previously issued annual financial statements for each of the three years shown in the Company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K, if those financial statements are incorporated by reference in subsequent filings with the SEC made under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, even though those financial statements relate to periods prior to the sale date.
     The aforementioned reclassification has no effect on the Company's previously reported net income, net income available to Common Shares, funds from operations ("FFO") or FFO available to Common Shares and Units.
     This report on Form 8-K updates Items 6, 7, 8 and 15 (Exhibit 12 only) of the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 to reclassify those properties sold during the first six months of 2010 as a component of discontinued operations for each period presented in the annual report. Exhibit 12 also reflects certain interim information for the six months ended June 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. All other items of the Company's Form 10-K remain unchanged. No attempt has been made to update matters in the Form 10-K except to the extent expressly provided above.
ITEM 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Overview
          Equity Residential ("EQR"), a Maryland real estate investment trust ("REIT") formed in March 1993, is an S&P 500 company focused on the acquisition, development and management of high quality apartment properties in top United States growth markets. EQR has elected to be taxed as a REIT.
          The Company is one of the largest publicly traded real estate companies and is the largest publicly traded owner of multifamily properties in the United States (based on the aggregate market value of its outstanding Common Shares, the number of apartment units wholly owned and total revenues earned). The Company's corporate headquarters are located in Chicago, Illinois and the Company also operates property management offices throughout the United States. As of December 31, 2009, the Company has approximately 4,100 employees who provide real estate operations, leasing, legal, financial, accounting, acquisition, disposition, development and other support functions.
          EQR is the general partner of, and as of December 31, 2009 owned an approximate 95.2% ownership interest in, ERP Operating Limited Partnership, an Illinois limited partnership (the "Operating Partnership"). The Company is structured as an umbrella partnership REIT ("UPREIT") under which all property ownership and related business operations are conducted through the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. References to the "Company" include EQR, the Operating Partnership and those entities owned or controlled by the Operating Partnership and/or EQR.
          
Business Objectives and Operating Strategies
          The Company seeks to maximize current income, capital appreciation of each property and the total return for its shareholders. The Company's strategy for accomplishing these objectives includes:
 
          
Acquisition, Development and Disposition Strategies
          The Company anticipates that future property acquisitions, developments and dispositions will occur within the United States. Acquisitions and developments may be financed from various sources of capital, which may include retained cash flow, issuance of additional equity and debt securities, sales of properties, joint venture agreements and collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings. In addition, the Company may acquire properties in transactions that include the issuance of limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership ("OP Units") as consideration for the acquired properties. Such transactions may, in certain circumstances, enable the sellers to defer, in whole or in part, the recognition of taxable income or gain that might otherwise result from the sales. EQR may also acquire land parcels to hold and/or sell based on market opportunities.
          When evaluating potential acquisitions, developments and dispositions, the Company generally considers the following factors:
          The Company generally reinvests the proceeds received from property dispositions primarily to achieve its acquisition, development and rehab strategies and at times to fund its debt maturities and debt and equity repurchase activities. In addition, when feasible, the Company may structure these transactions as tax-deferred exchanges.
          
Current Environment
          The slowdown in the economy, which accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2008 and continued into 2009, coupled with continued job losses and/or lack of job growth leads us to be cautious regarding expected performance for 2010. Since the fourth quarter of 2008 and continuing into the fourth quarter of 2009, our revenue has declined in comparison to the prior year in most of our major markets as the economic slowdown continues to impact existing and
 
prospective residents. Markets with little employment loss have performed better than markets with larger employment issues. Although all of our markets experienced job losses in 2009, the pace of those losses appears to have begun to slow. While the job market is likely to remain weak in 2010, beginning late in the fourth quarter of 2009, household spending was reported to have increased and the deterioration in the labor market showed signs of abating. Despite a generally improving credit environment and better general economic conditions, the Company may continue to experience a period of declining revenues, which would adversely impact the Company's results of operations. The vast majority of our leases are for terms of 12 months or less. As a result, we quickly feel the impact of an economic downturn which limits our ability to raise rents or causes us to lower rents on turnover units and lease renewals. During late 2008 and early 2009, our rental rates declined on average between 9% and 10% for new residents but on average less than 1% for renewing residents. Rental rates have not declined, on average, since the first quarter of 2009 and began to show improvement in the latter part of the year. However, since our rental rates increased during most of 2008, our quarter over quarter revenue declines worsened each quarter in 2009 as compared to 2008. Quarter over quarter revenue declines are expected to continue in 2010 (although they should be less negative in 2010 vs. 2009 than when comparing 2009 vs. 2008). Given the roll-down in lease rates that occurred throughout 2009, the full year comparison to 2010 will continue to show declining revenue even if quarter over quarter revenue improvement begins in the second half of 2010. Our revenues are also impacted by our resident turnover rates, which have generally declined, and our occupancy rates, which began to rise in the fourth quarter of 2009. After three consecutive years of excellent expense control (same store expenses declined 0.1% between 2009 and 2008 and grew 2.2% between 2008 and 2007 and 2.1% between 2007 and 2006), the Company anticipates that 2010 same store expenses will increase between 1.0% and 2.0% primarily due to cost pressures from non-controllable areas such as real estate taxes and utilities. The combination of expected declines in revenues and moderately increasing expense levels will have a negative impact on the Company's results of operations for 2010.
          The strained credit environment has negatively impacted the availability and pricing of debt capital. However, during this time, the multifamily residential sector has benefited from the continued liquidity provided by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. A vast majority of the properties we sold in 2008 and 2009 were financed for the purchaser by one of these agencies. Furthermore, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac provided us with approximately $1.6 billion of secured mortgage financing in 2008 and $500.0 million in 2009 at attractive rates when compared to other sources of credit at that time. While unsecured credit markets improved in the latter part of 2009 and the Company currently has unsecured lending options available to it at attractive rates, should the agencies discontinue providing liquidity to our sector, have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded or reorganized by the government, it would significantly reduce our access to debt capital and/or increase borrowing costs and would significantly reduce our sales of assets.
          In response to the recession and liquidity issues prevalent in the debt markets, we took a number of steps to better position ourselves. In early 2008, we began pre-funding our maturing debt obligations with approximately $1.6 billion in secured mortgage financing obtained from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. We also significantly reduced our acquisition activity. During the second half of 2008 and through the fourth quarter of 2009, we only acquired four properties (one of which was the buyout of our partner in an unconsolidated asset) and a long-term leasehold interest in a land parcel while we continued selling non-core assets. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company sold 60 properties consisting of 12,489 units for $1.0 billion, as well as 62 condominium units for $12.0 million. The Company acquired two properties consisting of 566 units for $145.0 million, one previously unconsolidated property consisting of 250 units for $18.5 million from its institutional joint venture partner and a long-term leasehold interest in a land parcel for $11.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. While we believe these sales of non-core assets better positions us for future success, they have resulted and will continue to result in dilution, particularly when the net sales proceeds are initially not reinvested in activities generating equivalent income such as acquisition of rental properties or repayment of debt. Additionally, we have significantly reduced our development activities, starting only two new projects in the first half of 2008 and none in the second half of the year or during 2009. We also reduced the number of planned development projects we will undertake in the future and took a $116.4 million impairment charge in 2008 to reduce the value of five assets that we no longer plan on pursuing. We took an additional $11.1 million impairment charge in 2009 to reduce the value of one asset. The Company reduced its quarterly common share dividend beginning with the dividend for the third quarter of 2009, from $0.4825 per share (an annual rate of $1.93 per share) to $0.3375 per share (an annual rate of $1.35 per share).
          The credit environment improved throughout mid and late 2009 and we currently have access to multiple sources of capital allowing us a less cautious posture with respect to pre-funding our maturing debt obligations. As a result of the improved credit environment, in late 2009, we utilized $366.2 million of cash on hand to repurchase certain unsecured notes and convertible notes in public tender offers. Concurrently, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2009, we began to see an increase in the availability of attractive acquisition opportunities. We expect to revert from a net seller of assets during 2009 to a net buyer of assets in 2010. During 2010, we expect that property dispositions will be more a funding source for attractive acquisition opportunities that we may identify than for providing needed capital to protect the Company's
 
financial position. Our access to capital and our ability to execute large, complex transactions should be competitive advantages in 2010. However, should a double-dip recession materialize or credit/equity markets deteriorate, we may seek to take steps similar to what we did in 2008 and early 2009 to increase liquidity and better position ourselves.
          Our specific current expectations regarding our results for 2010 and certain items that will affect them are set forth under Results of Operations below.
          We believe that cash and cash equivalents, securities readily convertible to cash, current availability on our revolving credit facility and disposition proceeds for 2010 will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our funding obligations relating to asset acquisitions, debt retirement and existing development projects through 2010. We expect that our remaining longer-term funding requirements will be met through some combination of new borrowings, equity issuances (including the Company's ATM share offering program), property dispositions and cash generated from operations.
          Despite the challenging conditions noted above, we believe that the Company is well-positioned notwithstanding the slow economic recovery. Our properties are geographically diverse and were approximately 94% occupied as of December 31, 2009, little new multifamily rental supply has been added to most of our markets and the long-term demographic picture is positive.
          We believe we are well-positioned with a strong balance sheet and sufficient liquidity to cover debt maturities and development fundings in the near term, which should allow us to take advantage of investment opportunities in the future. When economic conditions improve, the short-term nature of our leases and the limited supply of new rental housing being constructed should allow us to quickly realize revenue growth and improvement in our operating results.
Results of Operations
          In conjunction with our business objectives and operating strategy, the Company continued to invest or recycle its capital investment in apartment properties located in strategically targeted markets during the years ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008. In summary, we:
          Year Ended December 31, 2009:
          Year Ended December 31, 2008:
          The Company's primary financial measure for evaluating each of its apartment communities is net operating income ("NOI"). NOI represents rental income less property and maintenance expense, real estate tax and insurance expense and property management expense. The Company believes that NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the Company's apartment communities.
          Properties that the Company owned for all of both 2009 and 2008 (the "2009 Same Store Properties"), which represented 113,598 units, impacted the Company's results of operations. Properties that the Company owned for all of
 
both 2008 and 2007 (the "2008 Same Store Properties"), which represented 115,051 units, also impacted the Company's results of operations. Both the 2009 Same Store Properties and 2008 Same Store Properties are discussed in the following paragraphs.
          The Company's acquisition, disposition and completed development activities also impacted overall results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Dilution, as a result of the Company's net asset sales, negatively impacts property net operating income. The impacts of these activities are discussed in greater detail in the following paragraphs.
          
Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2009 to the year ended December 31, 2008
          For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company reported diluted earnings per share of $1.27 compared to $1.46 per share for the year ended December 31, 2008. The difference is primarily due to the following:
          For the year ended December 31, 2009, income from continuing operations increased approximately $41.5 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in continuing operations is discussed below.
          Revenues from the 2009 Same Store Properties decreased $52.4 million primarily as a result of a decrease in average rental rates charged to residents and a decrease in occupancy. Expenses from the 2009 Same Store Properties decreased $0.8 million primarily due to lower property management costs, partially offset by higher real estate taxes and utility costs. The following tables provide comparative same store results and statistics for the 2009 Same Store Properties:
 
          The following table provides comparative same store operating expenses for the 2009 Same Store Properties:
 
 
          The following table presents a reconciliation of operating income per the consolidated statements of operations included in the original Form 10-K to NOI for the 2009 Same Store Properties (table has not been updated to reflect discontinued operations treatment for properties sold in the first six months of 2010).
          For properties that the Company acquired prior to January 1, 2009 and expects to continue to own through December 31, 2010, the Company anticipates the following same store results for the full year ending December 31, 2010:
 
          These 2010 assumptions are based on current expectations and are forward-looking.
          Non-same store operating results increased approximately $34.3 million or 79.4% and consist primarily of properties acquired in calendar years 2008 and 2009, as well as operations from the Company's completed development properties and corporate housing business. While the operations of the non-same store assets have been negatively impacted during the year ended December 31, 2009 similar to the same store assets, the non-same store assets have contributed a greater percentage of total NOI to the Company's overall operating results primarily due to increasing occupancy for properties in lease-up and a longer ownership period in 2009 than 2008. This increase primarily resulted from:
          See also Note 20 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding the Company's segment disclosures.
          Fee and asset management revenues, net of fee and asset management expenses, increased approximately $0.1 million or 3.4% primarily due to an increase in revenue earned on management of the Company's military housing ventures at Fort Lewis and McChord Air Force Base, as well as a decrease in asset management expenses. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company managed 12,681 units and 14,485 units, respectively, primarily for unconsolidated entities and its military housing ventures at Fort Lewis and McChord.
          Property management expenses from continuing operations include off-site expenses associated with the self-management of the Company's properties as well as management fees paid to any third party management companies. These expenses decreased approximately $5.1 million or 6.7%. This decrease is primarily attributable to lower overall payroll-related costs as a result of a decrease in the number of properties in the Company's portfolio, as well as decreases in temporary help/contractors, telecommunications and travel expenses.
          Depreciation expense from continuing operations, which includes depreciation on non-real estate assets, increased approximately $22.8 million or 4.1% primarily as a result of additional depreciation expense on properties acquired in 2008 and 2009, development properties placed in service and capital expenditures for all properties owned.
          General and administrative expenses from continuing operations, which include corporate operating expenses, decreased approximately $6.0 million or 13.3% primarily due to lower overall payroll-related costs as a result of a decrease in the number of properties in the Company's portfolio, as well as a $2.9 million decrease in severance related costs in 2009 and a decrease in tax consulting costs. The Company anticipates that general and administrative expenses will approximate $38.0 million to $40.0 million for the year ending December 31, 2010. The above assumption is based on current expectations and is forward-looking.
          Impairment from continuing operations decreased approximately $105.3 million due to an $11.1 million impairment charge taken during 2009 on a land parcel held for development compared to a $116.4 million impairment charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2008 on land held for development related to five potential development projects that are no longer being pursued. See Note 19 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
          Interest and other income from continuing operations decreased approximately $16.8 million or 50.2% primarily as a result of an $18.7 million gain recognized during 2008 related to the partial debt extinguishment of the Company's notes compared to a $4.5 million gain recognized in 2009 (see Note 9). In addition, interest earned on cash and cash equivalents decreased due to a decrease in interest rates and because the Company received less insurance/litigation settlement proceeds and forfeited deposits in 2009, partially offset by a $4.9 million gain on the sale of investment securities realized in 2009. The Company anticipates that interest and other income will approximate $1.0 million to $3.0 million for the year ending December 31, 2010. The above assumption is based on current expectations and is forward-looking.
 
          Other expenses from continuing operations increased approximately $0.7 million or 12.6% primarily due to an increase in transaction costs incurred in conjunction with the Company's acquisition of two properties consisting of 566 units from unaffiliated parties, as well as expensing transaction costs associated with the Company's acquisition of all of its partners' interests in five previously partially owned properties consisting of 1,587 units in 2009. This was partially offset by a decrease in pursuit cost write-offs as a result of the Company's decision to significantly reduce its development activities in 2009. The Company anticipates that other expenses will approximate $9.0 million to $12.0 million for the year ending December 31, 2010. The above assumption is based on current expectations and is forward-looking.
          Interest expense from continuing operations, including amortization of deferred financing costs, increased approximately $17.3 million or 3.5% primarily as a result of an increase in debt extinguishment costs and lower capitalized interest. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company capitalized interest costs of approximately $34.9 million as compared to $60.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. This capitalization of interest primarily relates to consolidated projects under development. The effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended December 31, 2009 was 5.62% as compared to 5.56% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The Company anticipates that interest expense will approximate $466.0 million to $476.0 million for the year ending December 31, 2010. The above assumption is based on current expectations and is forward-looking.
          Income and other tax expense from continuing operations decreased approximately $2.5 million or 46.9% primarily due to a change in the estimate for Texas state taxes and lower overall state income taxes, partially offset by an increase in business taxes for Washington, D.C. The Company anticipates that income and other tax expense will approximate $1.0 million to $2.0 million for the year ending December 31, 2010. The above assumption is based on current expectations and is forward-looking.
          Loss from investments in unconsolidated entities increased approximately $2.7 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily due to the Company's $1.8 million share of defeasance costs incurred in conjunction with the extinguishment of cross-collateralized mortgage debt on one of the Company's partially owned unconsolidated joint ventures as well as a decline in the operating performance of these properties.
          Net gain on sales of unconsolidated entities increased approximately $7.8 million as the Company sold seven unconsolidated properties in 2009 (inclusive of the one property where the Company acquired its partner's interest) compared to three unconsolidated properties in 2008.
          Net gain on sales of land parcels decreased approximately $3.0 million due to the sale of vacant land located in Florida during the year ended December 31, 2008 versus no land sales in 2009.
          Discontinued operations, net decreased approximately $95.9 million or 21.0% between the periods under comparison. This decrease is primarily due to lower gains from property sales during the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 and the operations of those properties. In addition, properties sold in 2009 reflect operations for a partial period in 2009 in contrast to a full period in 2008. See Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
          
Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2008 to the year ended December 31, 2007
          For the year ended December 31, 2008, loss from continuing operations increased approximately $34.5 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in continuing operations is discussed below.
          Revenues from the 2008 Same Store Properties increased $53.8 million primarily as a result of higher rental rates charged to residents. Expenses from the 2008 Same Store Properties increased $13.5 million primarily due to higher real estate taxes, utility costs and payroll. The following tables provide comparative same store results and statistics for the 2008 Same Store Properties:
 
 
          Non-same store operating results increased approximately $66.1 million or 79.8% and consist primarily of properties acquired in calendar years 2008 and 2007, as well as operations from completed development properties and our corporate housing business.
          See also Note 20 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding the Company's segment disclosures.
          Fee and asset management revenues, net of fee and asset management expenses, increased approximately $2.0 million primarily due to an increase in revenue earned on management of the Company's military housing venture at Fort Lewis along with the addition of McChord Air Force Base, as well as a decrease in asset management expenses. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company managed 14,485 units and 14,472 units, respectively, primarily for unconsolidated entities and its military housing ventures at Fort Lewis and McChord.
          Property management expenses from continuing operations include off-site expenses associated with the self-management of the Company's properties as well as management fees paid to any third party management companies. These expenses decreased approximately $10.4 million or 11.9%. This decrease is primarily attributable to lower overall payroll-related costs as a result of a decrease in the number of properties in the Company's portfolio, as well as a decrease in legal and professional fees.
          Depreciation expense from continuing operations, which includes depreciation on non-real estate assets, increased approximately $28.1 million or 5.4% primarily as a result of additional depreciation expense on properties acquired in 2007 and 2008 and capital expenditures for all properties owned.
          General and administrative expenses from continuing operations, which include corporate operating expenses, decreased approximately $1.8 million or 3.9% primarily as a result of a $2.2 million decrease in profit sharing expense and lower overall payroll-related costs, partially offset by an increase in legal and professional fees due to a $1.7 million expense recovery recorded for the year ended December 31, 2007 related to a certain lawsuit in Florida (see Note 21).
          Impairment from continuing operations increased approximately $116.4 million due to an impairment charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2008 on land held for development related to five potential development projects that will no longer be pursued. See Note 19 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
          Interest and other income from continuing operations increased approximately $13.5 million or 67.3% primarily as a result of an $18.7 million gain recognized during the year ended December 31, 2008 related to the partial debt extinguishment of the Company's June 2009 and August 2026 public notes (see Note 9), as well as an increase in short-term investments. This was partially offset by a $7.3 million decrease in interest earned on 1031 exchange and earnest money deposits due primarily to the decline in the Company's transaction activities.
          Other expenses from continuing operations increased approximately $3.9 million primarily due to an increase in the write-off of various pursuit and out-of-pocket costs for terminated development transactions and halted condominium conversion properties during 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007.
          Interest expense from continuing operations, including amortization of deferred financing costs, decreased
 
approximately $0.1 million as a result of lower overall effective interest rates and a reduction in debt extinguishment costs, offset by higher overall debt levels outstanding due to the Company's 2007 share repurchase activity and its pre-funding of its 2008 and 2009 debt maturities. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company capitalized interest costs of approximately $60.1 million as compared to $45.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. This capitalization of interest primarily relates to consolidated projects under development. The effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 5.56% as compared to 5.96% for the year ended December 31, 2007.
          Income and other tax expense from continuing operations increased approximately $2.8 million primarily due to a change in the estimate for Texas state taxes and an increase in franchise taxes.
          Loss from investments in unconsolidated entities increased approximately $0.4 million between the periods under comparison. This increase is primarily due to income received in 2007 from the sale of the Company's 7.075% ownership interest in Wellsford Park Highlands Corporation, an entity which owns a condominium development in Denver, Colorado.
          Net gain on sales of unconsolidated entities increased approximately $0.2 million primarily due to a $2.9 million gain on the sale of three unconsolidated institutional joint venture properties realized in 2008 compared to a gain of $2.6 million realized in 2007 on the sale of one property.
          Net gain on sales of land parcels decreased approximately $3.4 million primarily as a result of higher net gains realized in 2007 on the sale of two land parcels compared to the net gain realized in 2008 on the sale of one land parcel.
          Discontinued operations, net decreased approximately $576.5 million or 55.7% between the periods under comparison. This decrease is primarily due to a significant decrease in the number of properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the same period in 2007, as well as the mix of properties sold in each year. See Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
For the Year Ended December 31, 2009
          As of January 1, 2009, the Company had approximately $890.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and $1.29 billion available under its revolving credit facility (net of $130.0 million which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and $75.0 million which had been committed by a now bankrupt financial institution and is not available for borrowing). After taking into effect the various transactions discussed in the following paragraphs and the net cash provided by operating activities, the Company's cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2009 was approximately $193.3 million, its restricted 1031 exchange proceeds totaled $244.3 million and the amount available on the Company's revolving credit facility was $1.37 billion (net of $56.7 million which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and net of the $75.0 million discussed above). In 2008, the Company built a significant cash and cash equivalents balance as a direct result of its decision to pre-fund its 2008 and 2009 debt maturities with the closing of three secured mortgage loan pools totaling $1.6 billion. The decline in the Company's cash and cash equivalents balance since December 31, 2008 is a direct result of the application of the pre-funded cash on hand towards the Company's debt maturity, tender and repurchase activities, partially offset by the closing of a $500.0 million secured mortgage loan pool during 2009. See Notes 8 through 10 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
          During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company generated proceeds from various transactions, which included the following:
 
          In September 2009, the Company announced the creation of an At-The-Market ("ATM") share offering program which would allow the Company to sell up to 17.0 million Common Shares from time to time over the next three years into the existing trading market at current market prices as well as through negotiated transactions. The Company may, but shall have no obligation to, sell Common Shares through the ATM share offering program in amounts and at times to be determined by the Company. Actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the Company from time to time, including (among others) market conditions, the trading price of the Company's Common Shares and determinations of the appropriate sources of funding for the Company. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company issued approximately 3.5 million Common Shares at an average price of $35.38 per share for total consideration of approximately $123.7 million through the ATM share offering program. In addition, during the first quarter of 2010 through February 19, 2010, the Company has issued approximately 1.1 million Common Shares at an average price of $33.87 per share for total consideration of approximately $35.8 million. Cumulative to date, the Company has issued approximately 4.6 million Common Shares at an average price of $35.03 for total consideration of approximately $159.5 million. As of February 19, 2010, the Company had 12.4 million Common Shares remaining available for issuance under the ATM program.
          Depending on its analysis of market prices, economic conditions, and other opportunities for the investment of available capital, the Company may repurchase its Common Shares pursuant to its existing share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Trustees. The Company repurchased $1.1 million (47,450 shares at an average price per share of $23.69) of its Common Shares during the year ended December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had authorization to repurchase an additional $466.5 million of its shares. See Note 3 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
          Depending on its analysis of prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors, the Company may from time to time seek to repurchase and retire its outstanding debt in open market or privately negotiated transactions.
          The Company's total debt summary and debt maturity schedules as of December 31, 2009 are as follows:
 
 
Note: The Company capitalized interest of approximately $34.9 million and $60.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
 
          The following table provides a summary of the Company's unsecured debt as of December 31, 2009:
 
 
          As of February 25, 2010, an unlimited amount of debt securities remains available for issuance by the Operating Partnership under a registration statement that became automatically effective upon filing with the SEC in December 2008 (under SEC regulations enacted in 2005, the registration statement automatically expires on December 21, 2011 and does not contain a maximum issuance amount). As of February 25, 2010, an unlimited amount of equity
 
securities remains available for issuance by the Company under a registration statement the SEC declared effective in December 2008 (under SEC regulations enacted in 2005, the registration statement automatically expires on December 15, 2011 and does not contain a maximum issuance amount).
          The Company's "Consolidated Debt-to-Total Market Capitalization Ratio" as of December 31, 2009 is presented in the following table. The Company calculates the equity component of its market capitalization as the sum of (i) the total outstanding Common Shares and assumed conversion of all Units at the equivalent market value of the closing price of the Company's Common Shares on the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) the "Common Share Equivalent" of all convertible preferred shares; and (iii) the liquidation value of all perpetual preferred shares outstanding.
          The Company generally expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements, including capital expenditures related to maintaining its existing properties and certain scheduled unsecured note and mortgage note repayments, through its working capital, net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under its revolving credit facility. Under normal operating conditions, the Company considers its cash provided by operating activities to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payments of distributions. However, there may be times when the Company experiences shortfalls in its coverage of distributions, which may cause the Company to consider reducing its distributions and/or using the proceeds from property dispositions or additional financing transactions to make up the difference. Should these shortfalls occur for lengthy periods of time or be material in nature, the Company's financial condition may be adversely affected and it may not be able to maintain its current distribution levels. The Company reduced its quarterly common share dividend beginning with the dividend for the third quarter of 2009, from $0.4825
 
per share (an annual rate of $1.93 per share) to $0.3375 per share (an annual rate of $1.35 per share). The Company believes that its expected 2010 operating cash flow is sufficient to cover capital expenditures and distributions.
          The Company also expects to meet its long-term liquidity requirements, such as scheduled unsecured note and mortgage debt maturities, property acquisitions, financing of construction and development activities and capital improvements through the issuance of secured and unsecured debt and equity securities, including additional OP Units, and proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties as well as joint ventures. In addition, the Company has significant unencumbered properties available to secure additional mortgage borrowings in the event that the public capital markets are unavailable or the cost of alternative sources of capital is too high. The fair value of and cash flow from these unencumbered properties are in excess of the requirements the Company must maintain in order to comply with covenants under its unsecured notes and line of credit. Of the $18.5 billion in investment in real estate on the Company's balance sheet at December 31, 2009, $11.2 billion or 60.9%, was unencumbered. However, there can be no assurances that these sources of capital will be available to the Company in the future on acceptable terms or otherwise.
          As of the date of this filing, the Operating Partnership's senior debt credit ratings from Standard & Poors ("S&P"), Moody's and Fitch are BBB+, Baal and A-, respectively. As of the date of this filing, the Company's preferred equity ratings from S&P, Moody's and Fitch are BBB-, Baa2 and BBB, respectively. During the third quarter of 2009, Moody's and Fitch placed both the Company and the Operating Partnership on negative outlook.
          The Operating Partnership has a $1.5 billion long-term revolving credit facility with available borrowings as of February 19, 2010 of $1.36 billion (net of $65.2 million which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and net of a $75.0 million commitment from a now bankrupt financial institution) that matures in February 2012 (See Note 10 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion). This facility may, among other potential uses, be used to fund property acquisitions, costs for certain properties under development and short-term liquidity requirements. As of February 19, 2010, $180.0 million was outstanding under this facility. The Company expects to repay essentially all of the outstanding balance under the line as dispositions close and restricted 1031 proceeds are released from escrow.
          See Note 21 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the events which occurred subsequent to December 31, 2009.
          
Capitalization of Fixed Assets and Improvements to Real Estate
          Our policy with respect to capital expenditures is generally to capitalize expenditures that improve the value of the property or extend the useful life of the component asset of the property. We track improvements to real estate in two major categories and several subcategories:
          All replacements are depreciated over a five-year estimated useful life. We expense as incurred all make-ready maintenance and turnover costs such as cleaning, interior painting of individual units and the repair of any replacement item noted above.
          All building improvements are depreciated over a five to ten-year estimated useful life. We capitalize building
 
improvements and upgrades only if the item: (i) exceeds $2,500 (selected projects must exceed $10,000); (ii) extends the useful life of the asset; and (iii) improves the value of the asset.
          For the year ended December 31, 2009, our actual improvements to real estate totaled approximately $123.9 million. This includes the following (amounts in thousands except for unit and per unit amounts):
 
          For the year ended December 31, 2008, our actual improvements to real estate totaled approximately $169.8 million. This includes the following (amounts in thousands except for unit and per unit amounts):
 
          The Company incurred less in capital expenditures in 2009 primarily due to continued efforts to limit the scope of projects and greater cost controls on vendors. For 2010, the Company estimates that it will spend approximately $1,075 per unit of capital expenditures for its same store properties inclusive of unit renovation/rehab costs, or $825 per unit excluding unit renovation/rehab costs. The above assumptions are based on current expectations and are forward-looking.
          During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company's total non-real estate capital additions, such as computer software, computer equipment, and furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements to the Company's
 
property management offices and its corporate offices, were approximately $2.0 million. The Company expects to fund approximately $1.6 million in total additions to non-real estate property in 2010. The above assumption is based on current expectations and is forward-looking.
          Improvements to real estate and additions to non-real estate property are generally funded from net cash provided by operating activities and from investment cash flow.
          
Derivative Instruments
          In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes. The Company seeks to limit these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments.
          The Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors. When viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge, the Company has not sustained a material loss from these instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives it currently has in place.
          See Note 11 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments at December 31, 2009.
          
Other
          Total distributions paid in January 2010 amounted to $100.7 million (excluding distributions on Partially Owned Properties), which included certain distributions declared during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2009.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations
          The Company has co-invested in various properties that are unconsolidated and accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Management does not believe these investments have a materially different impact upon the Company's liquidity, cash flows, capital resources, credit or market risk than its property management and ownership activities. During 2000 and 2001, the Company entered into institutional ventures with an unaffiliated partner. At the respective closing dates, the Company sold and/or contributed 45 properties containing 10,846 units to these ventures and retained a 25% ownership interest in the ventures. The Company's joint venture partner contributed cash equal to 75% of the agreed-upon equity value of the properties comprising the ventures, which was then distributed to the Company. The Company's strategy with respect to these ventures was to reduce its concentration of properties in a variety of markets. The Company sold seven properties consisting of 1,684 units (including one property containing 250 units which was acquired by the Company), three properties consisting of 670 units and one property consisting of 400 units during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company and its joint venture partner currently intend to wind up these investments over the next few years by selling the related assets, which may involve refinancing the assets as a majority of the debt encumbering them matures in 2010 and early 2011. The Company cannot estimate what, if any, profit it will receive from these dispositions or if the Company will in fact receive its equity back.
          As of December 31, 2009, the Company has four projects totaling 1,700 units in various stages of development with estimated completion dates ranging through June 30, 2011. The development agreements currently in place are discussed in detail in Note 18 of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
          See also Notes 2 and 6 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding the Company's investments in partially owned entities.
          The following table summarizes the Company's contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter as of December 31, 2009:
 
 
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
          The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, resulting in different financial results or different presentation of our financial statements.
          The Company's significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended December 31, 2009 and are consistent with the year ended December 31, 2008, except with respect to noncontrolling interests and convertible debt as further described in Note 2.
          The Company has identified five significant accounting policies as critical accounting policies. These critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant judgments and estimates. With respect to these critical accounting policies, management believes that the application of judgments and estimates is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented. The five critical accounting policies are:
          
Acquisition of Investment Properties
          The Company allocates the purchase price of properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, the Company utilizes a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property, our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data. The Company also considers information obtained about each property as a result of its pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired.
          
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
          The Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets, including its investments in real estate, for indicators of permanent impairment. The judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance, market conditions and legal and environmental concerns, as well as the Company's ability to hold and its intent with regard to each asset. Future events could occur which would cause the Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted.
 
          
Depreciation of Investment in Real Estate
          The Company depreciates the building component of its investment in real estate over a 30-year estimated useful life, building improvements over a 5-year to 10-year estimated useful life and both the furniture, fixtures and equipment and replacements components over a 5-year estimated useful life, all of which are judgmental determinations.
          
Cost Capitalization
          See the Capitalization of Fixed Assets and Improvements to Real Estate section for a discussion of the Company's policy with respect to capitalization vs. expensing of fixed asset/repair and maintenance costs. In addition, the Company capitalizes the payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on the supervision of major capital and/or renovation projects. These costs are reflected on the balance sheet as an increase to depreciable property.
          For all development projects, the Company uses its professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred. The Company capitalizes interest, real estate taxes and insurance and payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on development activities, with capitalization ceasing no later than 90 days following issuance of the certificate of occupancy. These costs are reflected on the balance sheet as construction-in-progress for each specific property. The Company expenses as incurred all payroll costs of on-site employees working directly at our properties, except as noted above on our development properties prior to certificate of occupancy issuance and on specific major renovations at selected properties when additional incremental employees are hired.
          
Fair Value of Financial Instruments, Including Derivative Instruments
          The valuation of financial instruments requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments. The Company, where possible, bases the fair values of its financial instruments, including its derivative instruments, on listed market prices and third party quotes. Where these are not available, the Company bases its estimates on current instruments with similar terms and maturities or on other factors relevant to the financial instruments.
Funds From Operations
          For the year ended December 31, 2009, Funds From Operations ("FFO") available to Common Shares and Units decreased $2.9 million, or 0.5%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2008, FFO available to Common Shares and Units decreased $95.0 million, or 13.3%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007.
          The following is a reconciliation of net income to FFO available to Common Shares and Units for each of the five years ended December 31, 2009:

To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders Equity Residential
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Equity Residential (the "Company") as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index to the consolidated financial statements and schedule. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Equity Residential at December 31, 2009 and 2008 and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, Equity Residential changed its method of accounting for convertible debt instruments and noncontrolling interests upon the adoption of new accounting pronouncements, effective January 1, 2009 and applied retrospectively.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Equity Residential's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 25, 2010 (not provided herein) expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Chicago, Illinois February 25, 2010, except for Notes 12, 13 and 20, as to which the date is September 14, 2010
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Business
     Equity Residential ("EQR"), a Maryland real estate investment trust ("REIT") formed in March 1993, is an S&P 500 company focused on the acquisition, development and management of high quality apartment properties in top United States growth markets. EQR has elected to be taxed as a REIT.
     EQR is the general partner of, and as of December 31, 2009 owned an approximate 95.2% ownership interest in, ERP Operating Limited Partnership, an Illinois limited partnership (the "Operating Partnership"). The Company is structured as an umbrella partnership REIT ("UPREIT") under which all property ownership and related business operations are conducted through the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. References to the "Company" include EQR, the Operating Partnership and those entities owned or controlled by the Operating Partnership and/or EQR.
     As of December 31, 2009, the Company, directly or indirectly through investments in title holding entities, owned all or a portion of 495 properties in 23 states and the District of Columbia consisting of 137,007 units. The ownership breakdown includes (table does not include various uncompleted development properties):
     The "Wholly Owned Properties" are accounted for under the consolidation method of accounting. The Company beneficially owns 100% fee simple title to 429 of the 432 Wholly Owned Properties and all but one of its wholly owned development properties and land parcels. The Company owns the building and improvements and leases the land underlying the improvements under long-term ground leases that expire in 2026, 2077 and 2101 for the three operating properties, respectively, and 2104 for one land parcel. These properties are consolidated and reflected as real estate assets while the ground leases are accounted for as operating leases.
     The "Partially Owned Properties  Consolidated" are controlled by the Company but have partners with noncontrolling interests and are accounted for under the consolidation method of accounting. The "Partially Owned Properties  Unconsolidated" are partially owned but not controlled by the Company and consist of investments in partnership interests that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The "Military Housing" properties consist of investments in limited liability companies that, as a result of the terms of the operating agreements, are accounted for as management contract rights with all fees recognized as fee and asset management revenue.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
     Due to the Company's ability as general partner to control either through ownership or by contract the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries, other than entities that own controlling interests in the Partially Owned Properties  Unconsolidated and certain other entities in which the Company has investments, the Operating Partnership and each such subsidiary has been consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes. The consolidated financial statements also include all variable interest entities for which the Company is the primary beneficiary.
Real Estate Assets and Depreciation of Investment in Real Estate
     Effective for business combinations on or after January 1, 2009, an acquiring entity is required to recognize all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition-date fair value with limited exceptions. In addition, an acquiring entity is required to expense acquisition-related costs as incurred (amounts are included in the other expenses line item in the consolidated statements of operations), value noncontrolling interests at fair value at the acquisition date and expense restructuring costs associated with an acquired business. Due to the Company's limited acquisition activities in 2009, this has not had a material effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial position. Should the Company increase its acquisition activities, the effect could become material.
 
     The Company allocates the purchase price of properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, the Company utilizes a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property, our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data. The Company also considers information obtained about each property as a result of its pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired. The Company allocates the purchase price of acquired real estate to various components as follows:
     Replacements inside a unit such as appliances and carpeting are depreciated over a five-year estimated useful life. Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred and significant renovations and improvements that improve and/or extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized over their estimated useful life, generally five to ten years. Initial direct leasing costs are expensed as incurred as such expense approximates the deferral and amortization of initial direct leasing costs over the lease terms. Property sales or dispositions are recorded when title transfers to unrelated third parties, contingencies have been removed and sufficient cash consideration has been received by the Company. Upon disposition, the related costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts. Any gain or loss on sale is recognized in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
     The Company classifies real estate assets as real estate held for disposition when it is certain a property will be disposed of (see further discussion below).
     The Company classifies properties under development and/or expansion and properties in the lease-up phase (including land) as construction-in-progress until construction has been completed and all certificates of occupancy permits have been obtained.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
     The Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets, including its investments in real estate, for indicators of permanent impairment. The judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance, market conditions and legal and environmental concerns, as well as the Company's ability to hold and its intent with regard to each asset. Future events could occur which would cause the Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted.
     For long-lived assets to be held and used, the Company compares the expected future undiscounted cash flows for the long-lived asset against the carrying amount of that asset. If the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, the Company further analyzes each individual asset for other temporary or permanent indicators of impairment. An impairment loss would be recorded for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying amount of the asset if the Company deems this difference to be permanent.
     For long-lived assets to be disposed of, an impairment loss is recognized when the estimated fair value of the asset, less the estimated cost to sell, is less than the carrying amount of the asset measured at the time that the Company has determined it will sell the asset. Long-lived assets held for disposition and the related liabilities are separately reported, with the long-lived assets reported at the lower of their carrying amounts or their estimated fair values, less their costs to sell, and are not depreciated after reclassification to real estate held for disposition.
 
Cost Capitalization
     See the section for a discussion of the Company's policy with respect to capitalization vs. expensing of fixed asset/repair and maintenance costs. In addition, the Company capitalizes the payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on the supervision of major capital and/or renovation projects. These costs are reflected on the balance sheet as an increase to depreciable property.
Real Estate Assets and Depreciation of Investment in Real Estate
     For all development projects, the Company uses its professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred. The Company capitalizes interest, real estate taxes and insurance and payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on development activities, with capitalization ceasing no later than 90 days following issuance of the certificate of occupancy. These costs are reflected on the balance sheet as construction-in-progress for each specific property. The Company expenses as incurred all payroll costs of on-site employees working directly at our properties, except as noted above on our development properties prior to certificate of occupancy issuance and on specific major renovations at selected properties when additional incremental employees are hired.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
     The Company considers all demand deposits, money market accounts and investments in certificates of deposit and repurchase agreements purchased with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions. The combined account balances at one or more institutions typically exceed the Federal Depository Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") insurance coverage, and, as a result, there is a concentration of credit risk related to amounts on deposit in excess of FDIC insurance coverage. The Company believes that the risk is not significant, as the Company does not anticipate the financial institutions' non-performance.
Investment Securities
     Investment securities are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. These securities are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at amortized cost if management has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Otherwise, the securities are classified as available-for-sale and carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of shareholders' equity.
Deferred Financing Costs
     Deferred financing costs include fees and costs incurred to obtain the Company's lines of credit and long-term financings. These costs are amortized over the terms of the related debt. Unamortized financing costs are written off when debt is retired before the maturity date. The accumulated amortization of such deferred financing costs was $34.6 million and $31.4 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments, Including Derivative Instruments
     The valuation of financial instruments requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments. The Company, where possible, bases the fair values of its financial instruments, including its derivative instruments, on listed market prices and third party quotes. Where these are not available, the Company bases its estimates on current instruments with similar terms and maturities or on other factors relevant to the financial instruments.
     In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes. The Company seeks to limit these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments.
     The Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors. When viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge, the Company has not sustained a material loss from these instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives.
     The Company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measures those instruments at fair value. In addition, fair value adjustments will affect either shareholders' equity or net
 
income depending on whether the derivative instruments qualify as a hedge for accounting purposes and, if so, the nature of the hedging activity. When the terms of an underlying transaction are modified, or when the underlying transaction is terminated or completed, all changes in the fair value of the instrument are marked-to-market with changes in value included in net income each period until the instrument matures. Any derivative instrument used for risk management that does not meet the hedging criteria is marked-to-market each period. The Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
Revenue Recognition
     Rental income attributable to residential leases is recorded on a straight-line basis, which is not materially different than if it were recorded when due from residents and recognized monthly as it was earned. Leases entered into between a resident and a property for the rental of an apartment unit are generally year-to-year, renewable upon consent of both parties on an annual or monthly basis. Fee and asset management revenue and interest income are recorded on an accrual basis.
Share-Based Compensation
     The Company expenses share-based compensation such as restricted shares and share options. The fair value of the option grants are recognized over the vesting period of the options. The fair value for the Company's share options was estimated at the time the share options were granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:
 
     The valuation method and assumptions are the same as those the Company used in accounting for option expense in its consolidated financial statements. The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. This model is only one method of valuing options and the Company's use of this model should not be interpreted as an endorsement of its accuracy. Because the Company's share options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management's opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its share options and the actual value of the options may be significantly different.
Income and Other Taxes
     Due to the structure of the Company as a REIT and the nature of the operations of its operating properties, no provision for federal income taxes has been made at the EQR level. Historically, the Company has generally only incurred certain state and local income, excise and franchise taxes. The Company has elected Taxable REIT Subsidiary ("TRS") status for certain of its corporate subsidiaries, primarily those entities engaged in condominium conversion and corporate housing activities and as a result, these entities will incur both federal and state income taxes on any taxable income of such entities after consideration of any net operating losses.
 
     Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. These assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates for which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effects of deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized in earnings in the period enacted. The Company's deferred tax assets are generally the result of tax affected amortization of goodwill, differing depreciable lives on capitalized assets and the timing of expense recognition for certain accrued liabilities. As of December 31, 2009, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of approximately $42.5 million, which is fully offset by a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty in forecasting future TRS taxable income.
     The Company provided for income, franchise and excise taxes allocated as follows in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 (amounts in thousands):
 
     The Company's TRS' carried back approximately $7.3 million and $13.9 million of net operating losses ("NOL") during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and none were carried back in 2009. The Company's TRS' have approximately $46.7 million of NOL carryforwards available as of January 1, 2010 that will expire in 2028 and 2029.
     During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company's tax treatment of dividends and distributions were as follows:
     The cost of land and depreciable property, net of accumulated depreciation, for federal income tax purposes as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 was approximately $10.4 billion and $10.7 billion, respectively.
Noncontrolling Interests
     Effective January 1, 2009, a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary (minority interest) is in most cases an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent company's equity. In addition, consolidated net income is required to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest and the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interest are required to be disclosed on the face of the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Other than modifications to allocations and presentation, this does not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial position. See Note 3 for further discussion.
     Operating Partnership: Net income is allocated to noncontrolling interests based on their respective ownership
 
percentage of the Operating Partnership. The ownership percentage is calculated by dividing the number of units of limited partnership interest ("OP Units") held by the noncontrolling interests by the total OP Units held by the noncontrolling interests and EQR. Issuance of additional common shares of beneficial interest, $0.01 par value per share (the "Common Shares"), and OP Units changes the ownership interests of both the noncontrolling interests and EQR. Such transactions and the related proceeds are treated as capital transactions.
     Partially Owned Properties: The Company reflects noncontrolling interests in partially owned properties on the balance sheet for the portion of properties consolidated by the Company that are not wholly owned by the Company. The earnings or losses from those properties attributable to the noncontrolling interests are reflected as noncontrolling interests in partially owned properties in the consolidated statements of operations.
     Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership: The Company classifies Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership in the mezzanine section of the balance sheet for the portion of OP Units that the Company is required, either by contract or securities law, to deliver registered EQR Common Shares to the exchanging OP Unit holder. The redeemable noncontrolling interest units are adjusted to the greater of carrying value or fair market value based on the Common Share price of EQR at the end of each respective reporting period.
Use of Estimates
     In preparation of the Company's financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Reclassifications
     Certain reclassifications considered necessary for a fair presentation have been made to the prior period financial statements in order to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications have not changed the results of operations or equity.
Other
     In June 2009, the FASB issued , which superseded all then-existing non-SEC accounting and reporting standards and became the source of authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by non-governmental entities. The Company adopted the codification as required, effective for the quarter ended September 30, 2009. The adoption of the codification has no impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial position but changed the way we refer to accounting literature in reports beginning with the quarter ended September 30, 2009.
The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
     Effective December 31, 2008, public companies were required to provide additional disclosures about transfers of financial assets. In addition, public enterprises, including sponsors that have a variable interest in a Variable Interest Entity ("VIE"), were required to provide additional disclosures about their involvement with VIEs. For the Company, this includes only its development partnerships as the Company provides substantially all of the capital for these ventures (other than third party mortgage debt, if any). These requirements affected only disclosures and had no impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial position.
     Effective January 1, 2010, companies will be required to provide more information about transfers of financial assets, including securitization transactions and where companies have continuing exposure to the risks related to transferred financial assets. The concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity will be eliminated, the requirements for derecognizing financial assets will change and additional disclosures will be required. The Company does not expect this will have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial position.
     Effective January 1, 2010, the way in which a company determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting (or similar) rights should be consolidated will change. The determination of whether a company is required to consolidate an entity will be based on, among other things, an entity's purpose and design and a company's ability to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance. The Company does not expect this will have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial position.
 
     The Company is required to make certain disclosures regarding noncontrolling interests in consolidated limited-life subsidiaries. The Company is presently the controlling partner in various consolidated partnerships consisting of 27 properties and 5,530 units and various uncompleted development properties having a noncontrolling interest book value of $11.1 million at December 31, 2009. Some of these partnership agreements contain provisions that require the partnerships to be liquidated through the sale of their assets upon reaching a date specified in each respective partnership agreement. The Company, as controlling partner, has an obligation to cause the property owning partnerships to distribute the proceeds of liquidation to the Noncontrolling Interests in these Partially Owned Properties only to the extent that the net proceeds received by the partnerships from the sale of their assets warrant a distribution based on the partnership agreements. As of December 31, 2009, the Company estimates the value of Noncontrolling Interest distributions would have been approximately $45.5 million ("Settlement Value") had the partnerships been liquidated. This Settlement Value is based on estimated third party consideration realized by the partnerships upon disposition of the Partially Owned Properties and is net of all other assets and liabilities, including yield maintenance on the mortgages encumbering the properties, that would have been due on December 31, 2009 had those mortgages been prepaid. Due to, among other things, the inherent uncertainty in the sale of real estate assets, the amount of any potential distribution to the Noncontrolling Interests in the Company's Partially Owned Properties is subject to change. To the extent that the partnerships' underlying assets are worth less than the underlying liabilities, the Company has no obligation to remit any consideration to the Noncontrolling Interests in these Partially Owned Properties.
     Effective January 1, 2008, the rules governing fair value measurements changed. These rules established a comprehensive framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and required expanded disclosures about fair value measurements. This did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial position. See Note 11 for further discussion.
     Effective January 1, 2008, companies were permitted to elect a "Fair Value Option" under which a company may irrevocably elect fair value as the initial and subsequent measurement attribute for certain financial instruments. The Fair Value Option is available on a contract-by-contract basis with changes in fair value recognized in earnings as those changes occur. The Company has not adopted this optional standard.
     Effective for the quarter ended June 30, 2009, disclosures about fair value of financial instruments are required for interim reporting periods in summarized financial information for publicly traded companies as well as in annual financial statements. This does not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial position. See Note 11 for further discussion.
     Effective January 1, 2010, companies will be required to discuss the reasons for transfers into or out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and, if significant, disclose these transfers on a gross basis. Companies will also be required to disclose significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 and the reasons for these transfers. In addition, companies should provide fair value disclosures by each class rather than major category of assets and liabilities as well as the valuation techniques and inputs used in determining the fair value of assets or liabilities classified as Level 2 or 3. The Company does not expect this will have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial position.
     Effective January 1, 2011, companies will be required to separately disclose purchases, sales, issuances and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of recurring Level 3 measurements. The Company does not expect this will have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial position.
     Effective January 1, 2009, in an effort to improve financial standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities, companies are required to enhance disclosures to enable investors to better understand their effects on an entity's financial position, financial performance and cash flows. Among other requirements, entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about: (1) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments; (2) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for; and (3) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity's financial position, financial performance and cash flows. Other than the enhanced disclosure requirements, this does not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. See Note 11 for further discussion.
     Effective for the quarter ended June 30, 2009, companies are required to disclose the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events in accordance with general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. For public companies, this is the date the financial statements are issued. This does not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial position.
 
     Effective January 1, 2009, issuers of certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash on conversion are required to separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects each issuer's nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. As the Company is required to apply this retrospectively, the accounting for the Operating Partnership's $650.0 million ($482.5 million outstanding at December 31, 2009) 3.85% convertible unsecured notes that were issued in August 2006 and mature in August 2026 is affected. The Company recognized $20.6 million, $24.4 million and $25.0 million in interest expense related to the stated coupon of 3.85% for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The amount of the conversion option as of the date of issuance calculated by the Company using a 5.80% effective interest rate was $44.3 million and is being amortized to interest expense over the expected life of the convertible notes (through the first put date on August 18, 2011). Total amortization of the cash discount and conversion option discount on the unsecured notes resulted in a reduction to earnings of approximately $10.6 million or $0.04 per share for the year ended December 31, 2009 and is anticipated to result in a reduction to earnings of approximately $7.8 million or $0.03 per share for the year ended December 31, 2010 assuming the Company does not repurchase any additional amounts of this debt. In addition, the Company decreased the January 1, 2009 balance of retained earnings by $27.0 million, decreased the January 1, 2009 balance of notes by $17.3 million and increased the January 1, 2009 balance of paid in capital by $44.3 million. Due to the required retrospective application, it resulted in a reduction to earnings of approximately $13.3 million or $0.05 per share for the year ended December 31, 2008 and approximately $10.1 million or $0.04 per share for the year ended December 31, 2007. The carrying amount of the conversion option remaining in paid in capital was $44.3 million at both December 31, 2009 and 2008. The unamortized cash and conversion option discounts totaled $12.8 million and $23.4 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
3. Equity and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests
     The following tables present the changes in the Company's issued and outstanding Common Shares and "Units" (which includes OP Units and Long-Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP") Units) for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007:
 
     As of December 31, 2009, an unlimited amount of equity securities remains available for issuance by the Company under a registration statement the SEC declared effective in December 2008 (under SEC regulations enacted in 2005, the registration statement automatically expires on December 15, 2011 and does not contain a maximum issuance amount).
     In September 2009, the Company announced the creation of an At-The-Market ("ATM") share offering program which would allow the Company to sell up to 17.0 million Common Shares from time to time over the next three years into the existing trading market at current market prices as well as through negotiated transactions. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company issued approximately 3.5 million Common Shares at an average price of $35.38 per share for total consideration of approximately $123.7 million through the ATM program. As of December 31, 2009, transactions to issue approximately 1.1 million of the 3.5 million Common Shares had not yet settled. As of December 31, 2009, the Company has increased the number of Common Shares issued and outstanding by this amount and recorded a receivable of approximately $37.6 million included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. EQR has authorization to issue an additional 13.5 million of its shares as of December 31, 2009.
     During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Board of Trustees approved increases totaling $1.2 billion to the Company's authorized share repurchase program. Considering the additional authorizations and the repurchase activity for the year ended December 31, 2009, EQR has authorization to repurchase an additional $466.5 million of its shares as of December 31, 2009.
     During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company repurchased 47,450 of its Common Shares at an average price of $23.69 per share for total consideration of $1.1 million. These shares were retired subsequent to the
 
repurchases. All of the shares repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2009 were repurchased from employees at the then current market prices to cover the minimum statutory tax withholding obligations related to the vesting of employees' restricted shares.
     During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company repurchased 220,085 of its Common Shares at an average price of $35.93 per share for total consideration of $7.9 million. These shares were retired subsequent to the repurchases. Of the total shares repurchased, 120,085 shares were repurchased from employees at an average price of $36.10 per share (the average of the then current market prices) to cover the minimum statutory tax withholding obligations related to the vesting of employees' restricted shares. The remaining 100,000 shares were repurchased in the open market at an average price of $35.74 per share. The Company also funded $4.6 million in January 2008 for the settlement of 125,000 Common Shares that were repurchased in December 2007 and recorded as other liabilities at December 31, 2007.
     During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company repurchased 27,484,346 of its Common Shares at an average price of $44.62 per share for total consideration of $1.2 billion. These shares were retired subsequent to the repurchases. Of the total shares repurchased, 84,046 shares were repurchased from employees at an average price of $53.85 per share (the average of the then current market prices) to cover the minimum statutory tax withholding obligations related to the vesting of employees' restricted shares. The remaining 27,400,300 shares were repurchased in the open market at an average price of $44.59 per share. As of December 31, 2007, transactions to repurchase 125,000 of the 27,484,346 Common Shares had not yet settled. As of December 31, 2007, the Company has reduced the number of Common Shares issued and outstanding by this amount and recorded a liability of $4.6 million included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
     The equity positions of various individuals and entities that contributed their properties to the Operating Partnership in exchange for OP Units, as well as the equity positions of the holders of LTIP Units, are collectively referred to as the "Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership". Subject to certain exceptions (including the "book-up" requirements of LTIP Units), the Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership may exchange their Units with EQR for EQR Common Shares on a one-for-one basis. The carrying value of the Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership is based on the proportional relationship between the carrying values of equity associated with EQR's Common Shares relative to that of the Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership. Net income is allocated to the Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership based on the weighted average ownership percentage during the period.
     A portion of the Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership Units are classified as mezzanine equity as they do not meet the requirements for permanent equity classification. The Operating Partnership has the right but not the obligation to make a cash payment to any and all holders of Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership Units requesting an exchange from EQR. Once the Operating Partnership elects not to redeem the Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership Units for cash, EQR is obligated to deliver EQR Common Shares to the exchanging holder of the Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership Units. If EQR is required, either by contract or securities law, to deliver registered EQR Common Shares, such Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership are differentiated and referred to as "Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership". Instruments that require settlement in registered shares can not be classified in permanent equity as it is not always completely within an issuer's control to deliver registered shares. Therefore, settlement in cash is assumed and that responsibility for settlement in cash is deemed to fall to the Operating Partnership as the primary source of cash for EQR, resulting in presentation in the mezzanine section of the balance sheet. The Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership are adjusted to the greater of carrying value or fair market value based on the Common Share price of EQR at the end of each respective reporting period. EQR has the ability to deliver unregistered EQR Common Shares for the remaining portion of the Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership Units that are classified in permanent equity at December 31, 2009 and 2008.
     The carrying value of the Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership is allocated based on the number of Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership Units in proportion to the number of Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership Units in total. Such percentage of the total carrying value of Units which is ascribed to the Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership is then adjusted to the greater of carrying value or fair market value as described above. As of December 31, 2009, the Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership have a redemption value of approximately $258.3 million, which represents the value of EQR Common Shares that would be issued in exchange with the Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership Units.
 
     The following table presents the changes in the redemption value of the Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively (amounts in thousands):
     Net proceeds from the Company's Common Share and Preferred Share (see definition below) offerings are contributed by the Company to the Operating Partnership. In return for those contributions, EQR receives a number of OP Units in the Operating Partnership equal to the number of Common Shares it has issued in the equity offering (or in the case of a preferred equity offering, a number of preference units in the Operating Partnership equal in number and having the same terms as the Preferred Shares issued in the equity offering). As a result, the net offering proceeds from Common Shares and Preferred Shares are allocated between shareholders' equity and Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership to account for the change in their respective percentage ownership of the underlying equity of the Operating Partnership.
     The Company's declaration of trust authorizes the Company to issue up to 100,000,000 preferred shares of beneficial interest, $0.01 par value per share (the "Preferred Shares"), with specific rights, preferences and other attributes as the Board of Trustees may determine, which may include preferences, powers and rights that are senior to the rights of holders of the Company's Common Shares.
     The following table presents the Company's issued and outstanding Preferred Shares as of December 31, 2009 and 2008:
 
 
     During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company redeemed for cash all 700,000 shares of its 8.60% Series D Preferred Shares with a liquidation value of $175.0 million. The Company recorded the write-off of approximately $6.1 million in original issuance costs as a premium on redemption of Preferred Shares in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
     During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company issued an irrevocable notice to redeem for cash all 230,000 units of its 7.625% Series J Preference Interests with a liquidation value of $11.5 million. This notice triggered the holder's accelerated conversion right, which they exercised. As a result, the 230,000 units were converted into 324,484 Common Shares.
     The following table presents the Operating Partnership's issued and outstanding Junior Convertible Preference Units (the "Junior Preference Units") as of December 31, 2009 and 2008:
 
     During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company acquired all of its partners' interests in five partially owned properties consisting of 1,587 units for $9.2 million. In addition, the Company also acquired a portion of the outside partner interests in two partially owned properties, one funded using cash of $2.1 million and the other funded through the issuance of 32,061 OP Units valued at $0.8 million. In conjunction with these transactions, the Company reduced paid in capital by $1.5 million and Noncontrolling Interests  Partially Owned Properties by $11.7 million.
     During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company acquired all of its partners' interests in one partially owned property consisting of 144 units for $5.9 million and three partially owned land parcels for $1.6 million. In addition, the Company made an additional payment of $1.3 million related to an April 2006 acquisition of a partner's interest in a now wholly owned property, partially funded through the issuance of 19,017 OP Units valued at $0.8 million.
4. Real Estate
     The following table summarizes the carrying amounts for the Company's investment in real estate (at cost) as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 (amounts in thousands):
 
     During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company acquired the entire equity interest in the following from unaffiliated parties (purchase price in thousands):
     The Company also acquired the 75% equity interest in one previously unconsolidated property it did not already own consisting of 250 units with a gross sales price of $18.5 million from its institutional joint venture partner.
     During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company acquired the entire equity interest in the following from unaffiliated parties (purchase price in thousands):
 
     During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company disposed of the following to unaffiliated parties (sales price in thousands):
 
 
     The Company recognized a net gain on sales of discontinued operations of approximately $335.3 million and a net gain on sales of unconsolidated entities of approximately $10.7 million on the above sales.
     During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company disposed of the following to unaffiliated parties (sales price in thousands):
 
     The Company recognized a net gain on sales of discontinued operations of approximately $392.9 million, a net gain on sales of unconsolidated entities of approximately $2.9 million and a net gain on sales of land parcels of approximately $3.0 million on the above sales.

9. Notes
     The following tables summarize the Company's unsecured note balances and certain interest rate and maturity date information as of and for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively:
 
 
     The Company's unsecured public debt contains certain financial and operating covenants including, among other things, maintenance of certain financial ratios. The Company was in compliance with its unsecured public debt covenants for both the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008.
     As of December 31, 2009, an unlimited amount of debt securities remains available for issuance by the Operating Partnership under a registration statement that became automatically effective upon filing with the SEC in December 2008 (under SEC regulations enacted in 2005, the registration statement automatically expires on December 21, 2011 and does not contain a maximum issuance amount).
     During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company:
 
     During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company:
     On October 11, 2007, the Operating Partnership closed on a $500.0 million senior unsecured term loan. The loan matures on October 5, 2010, subject to two one-year extension options exercisable by the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership has the ability to increase available borrowings by an additional $250.0 million under certain circumstances. Advances under the loan bear interest at variable rates based upon LIBOR plus a spread (currently 0.50%) dependent upon the current credit rating on the Operating Partnership's long-term senior unsecured debt. EQR has guaranteed the Operating Partnership's term loan up to the maximum amount and for the full term of the loan.
     On August 23, 2006, the Operating Partnership issued $650.0 million of exchangeable senior notes that mature on August 15, 2026. Following the repurchases discussed above, the notes had a face value of $482.5 million at December 31, 2009. The notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.85%. The notes are exchangeable into EQR Common Shares, at the option of the holders, under specific circumstances or on or after August 15, 2025, at an initial exchange rate of 16.3934 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes (equivalent to an initial exchange price of $61.00 per share). The initial exchange rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, including upon an increase in the Company's dividend rate. Upon an exchange of the notes, the Operating Partnership will settle any amounts up to the principal amount of the notes in cash and the remaining exchange value, if any, will be settled, at the Operating Partnership's option, in cash, EQR Common Shares or a combination of both. See Note 2 for more information on the change in the recognition of interest expense for the exchangeable senior notes.
     On or after August 18, 2011, the Operating Partnership may redeem the notes at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Upon notice of redemption by the Operating Partnership, the holders may elect to exercise their exchange rights. In addition, on August 18, 2011, August 15, 2016 and August 15, 2021 or following the occurrence of certain change in control transactions prior to August 18, 2011, note holders may require the Operating Partnership to repurchase the notes for an amount equal to the principal amount of the notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon.
     Note holders may also require an exchange of the notes should the closing sale price of Common Shares exceed 130% of the exchange price for a certain period of time or should the trading price on the notes be less than 98% of the product of the closing sales price of Common Shares multiplied by the applicable exchange rate for a certain period of time.
     Aggregate payments of principal on unsecured notes payable for each of the next five years and thereafter are as follows (amounts in thousands):
 
 
10. Lines of Credit
     The Operating Partnership has a $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility maturing on February 28, 2012, with the ability to increase available borrowings by an additional $500.0 million by adding additional banks to the facility or obtaining the agreement of existing banks to increase their commitments. Advances under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates based upon LIBOR at various interest periods plus a spread (currently 0.50%) dependent upon the Operating Partnership's credit rating or based on bids received from the lending group. EQR has guaranteed the Operating Partnership's credit facility up to the maximum amount and for the full term of the facility.
     During the year ended December 31, 2008, one of the providers of the Operating Partnership's unsecured revolving credit facility declared bankruptcy. Under the existing terms of the credit facility, the provider's share is up to $75.0 million of potential borrowings. As a result, the Operating Partnership's borrowing capacity under the unsecured revolving credit facility has, in essence, been permanently reduced to $1.425 billion of potential borrowings. The obligation to fund by all of the other providers has not changed.
     As of December 31, 2009, the amount available on the credit facility was $1.37 billion (net of $56.7 million which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and net of the $75.0 million discussed above). The Company did not draw and had no balance outstanding on its revolving credit facility at any time during the year ended December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2008, the amount available on the credit facility was $1.29 billion (net of $130.0 million which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and net of the $75.0 million discussed above). During the year ended December 31, 2008, the weighted average interest rate was 4.31%.
11. Derivative and Other Fair Value Instruments
     The valuation of financial instruments requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments. The Company, where possible, bases the fair values of its financial instruments, including its derivative instruments, on listed market prices and third party quotes. Where these are not available, the Company bases its estimates on current instruments with similar terms and maturities or on other factors relevant to the financial instruments.
     The carrying values of the Company's mortgage notes payable and unsecured notes were approximately $4.8 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2009. The fair values of the Company's mortgage notes payable and unsecured notes were approximately $4.6 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2009. The carrying values of the Company's mortgage notes payable and unsecured notes were approximately $5.0 billion and $5.4 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2008. The fair values of the Company's mortgage notes payable and unsecured notes were approximately $5.0 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2008. The fair values of the Company's financial instruments, other than mortgage notes payable, unsecured notes, derivative instruments and investment securities, including cash and cash equivalents, lines of credit and other financial instruments, approximate their carrying or contract values.
     In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes. The Company seeks to limit these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments.
     The following table summarizes the Company's consolidated derivative instruments at December 31, 2009 (dollar amounts are in thousands):
 
 
     The following tables provide the location of the Company's derivative instruments within the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and their fair market values as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively (amounts in thousands):
     The following tables provide a summary of the effect of fair value hedges on the Company's accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively (amounts in thousands):
 
     The following tables provide a summary of the effect of cash flow hedges on the Company's accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively (amounts in thousands):
     As of December 31, 2009, there were approximately $4.2 million in deferred gains, net, included in accumulated other comprehensive income. Based on the estimated fair values of the net derivative instruments at December 31, 2009, the Company may recognize an estimated $5.8 million of accumulated other comprehensive income as additional interest expense during the year ending December 31, 2010.
     In January 2009, the Company received approximately $0.4 million to terminate a fair value hedge of interest rates in conjunction with the public tender of the Company's 4.75% fixed rate public notes due June 15, 2009. Approximately $0.2 million of the settlement received was deferred and recognized as a reduction of interest expense through the maturity on June 15, 2009.
     In April and May 2009, the Company received approximately $10.8 million to terminate six treasury locks in conjunction with the issuance of a $500.0 million 11-year mortgage loan. The entire amount was deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and is recognized as a reduction of interest expense over the first ten years of the mortgage loan.
     In February 2008, the Company paid approximately $13.2 million to terminate three forward starting swaps in conjunction with the issuance of a $500.0 million 11.5-year mortgage loan. The entire amount was deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and is recognized as an increase to interest expense over the first ten years of the mortgage loan.
     In November 2008, the Company paid approximately $13.5 million to terminate six forward starting swaps in conjunction with the issuance of a $543.0 million 8-year mortgage loan. Approximately $13.1 million of the settlement payment was deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and is recognized as an increase to interest expense over the life of the underlying hedged item.
     The Company has invested in various investment securities in an effort to increase the amounts earned on the
 
significant amount of unrestricted cash on hand throughout 2008 and 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company sold a majority of its investment securities, receiving proceeds of approximately $215.8 million, and recorded a $4.9 million realized gain on sale (specific identification) which is included in interest and other income. The following tables set forth the maturity, amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses, book/fair value and interest and other income of the various investment securities held as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively (amounts in thousands):
     A three-level valuation hierarchy exists for disclosure of fair value measurements. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. A financial instrument's categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels are defined as follows:
     The Company's derivative positions are valued using models developed by the respective counterparty as well as models developed internally by the Company that use as their basis readily observable market parameters (such as forward yield curves and credit default swap data) and are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. In addition, employee holdings other than EQR Common Shares within the supplemental executive retirement plan (the "SERP") have a fair value of $61.1 million as of December 31, 2009 and are included in other assets and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. These SERP investments are valued using quoted market prices for identical assets and are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.
 
     The Company's investment securities are valued using quoted market prices or readily available market interest rate data. The quoted market prices are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy and the market interest rate data are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership are valued using the quoted market price of EQR Common Shares and are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.
     The Company's real estate asset impairment charge was the result of an analysis of the parcel's fair value (determined using internally developed models that were based on market assumptions and comparable sales data) (Level 3) compared to its current capitalized carrying value. The valuation technique used to measure fair value is consistent with how similar assets were measured in prior periods. See Note 19 for further discussion.
12. Earnings Per Share
     The following tables set forth the computation of net income per share  basic and net income per share  diluted (amounts in thousands except per share amounts):
 
Potential common shares issuable from the assumed conversion of OP Units and the exercise/vesting of long-term compensation award shares/units are automatically anti-dilutive and therefore excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation as the Company had a loss from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
 
Convertible preferred shares/units that could be converted into 402,501, 427,090 and 652,534 weighted average Common Shares for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, were outstanding but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effects would be anti-dilutive. In addition, the effect of the Common Shares that could ultimately be issued upon the conversion/exchange of the Operating Partnership's $650.0 million ($482.5 million outstanding at December 31, 2009) exchangeable senior notes was not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effects would be anti-dilutive.
For additional disclosures regarding the employee share options and restricted shares, see Notes 2 and 14.
13. Discontinued Operations
     The Company has presented separately as discontinued operations in all periods the results of operations for all consolidated assets disposed of, all operations related to active condominium conversion properties effective upon their respective transfer into a TRS and all properties held for sale, if any. Results are reflective of dispositions through June 30, 2010.
     The components of discontinued operations are outlined below and include the results of operations for the respective periods that the Company owned such assets during each of the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 (amounts in thousands).
 
     For the properties sold during 2009 and the first six months of 2010 (excluding condominium conversion properties), the investment in real estate, net of accumulated depreciation, and the mortgage notes payable balances at December 31, 2008 were $662.2 million and $38.9 million, respectively. For the properties sold during the first six months of 2010 (excluding condominium conversion properties), the investment in real estate, net of accumulated depreciation, and the mortgage notes payable balances at December 31, 2009 were $85.3 million and $40.0 million, respectively.
 
     The net real estate basis of the Company's active condominium conversion properties owned by the TRS and included in discontinued operations (excludes the Company's halted conversions as they are now held for use), which were included in investment in real estate, net in the consolidated balance sheets, was $11.8 million and $24.1 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
14. Share Incentive Plans
     On May 15, 2002, the shareholders of EQR approved the Company's 2002 Share Incentive Plan. The maximum aggregate number of awards that may be granted under this plan may not exceed 7.5% of the Company's outstanding Common Shares calculated on a "fully diluted" basis and determined annually on the first day of each calendar year. As of January 1, 2010, this amount equaled 22,091,629, of which 6,295,992 shares were available for future issuance. No awards may be granted under the 2002 Share Incentive Plan, as restated, after February 20, 2012.
     Pursuant to the 2002 Share Incentive Plan, as restated, and the Amended and Restated 1993 Share Option and Share Award Plan, as amended (collectively the "Share Incentive Plans"), officers, trustees and key employees of the Company may be granted share options to acquire Common Shares ("Options") including non-qualified share options ("NQSOs"), incentive share options ("ISOs") and share appreciation rights ("SARs"), or may be granted restricted or non-restricted shares, subject to conditions and restrictions as described in the Share Incentive Plans. In addition, each year prior to 2007, certain executive officers of the Company participated in the Company's performance-based restricted share plan. Effective January 1, 2007, the Company elected to discontinue the award of new performance-based award grants. Options, SARs, restricted shares, performance shares and LTIP Units (see discussion below) are sometimes collectively referred to herein as "Awards".
     The Options are generally granted at the fair market value of the Company's Common Shares at the date of grant, vest in three equal installments over a three-year period, are exercisable upon vesting and expire ten years from the date of grant. The exercise price for all Options under the Share Incentive Plans is equal to the fair market value of the underlying Common Shares at the time the Option is granted. Options exercised result in new Common Shares being issued on the open market. The Amended and Restated 1993 Share Option and Share Award Plan, as amended, will terminate at such time as all outstanding Awards have expired or have been exercised/vested. The Board of Trustees may at any time amend or terminate the Share Incentive Plans, but termination will not affect Awards previously granted. Any Options which had vested prior to such a termination would remain exercisable by the holder.
     Restricted shares that have been awarded through December 31, 2009 generally vest three years from the award date. In addition, the Company's unvested restricted shareholders have the same voting rights as any other Common Share holder. During the three-year period of restriction, the Company's unvested restricted shareholders receive quarterly dividend payments on their shares at the same rate and on the same date as any other Common Share holder. As a result, dividends paid on unvested restricted shares are included as a component of retained earnings and have not been considered in reducing net income available to Common Shares in a manner similar to the Company's preferred share dividends for the earnings per share calculation. If employment is terminated prior to the lapsing of the restriction, the shares are generally canceled.
     In December 2008, the Company's 2002 Share Incentive Plan was amended to allow for the issuance of long-term incentive plan units ("LTIP Units") to officers of the Company as an alternative to the Company's restricted shares. LTIP Units are a class of partnership interests that under certain conditions, including vesting, are convertible by the holder into an equal number of OP Units, which are redeemable by the holder for EQR Common Shares on a one-for-one basis or the cash value of such shares at the option of the Company. In connection with the February 2009 grant of long-term incentive compensation for services provided during 2008, officers of the Company were allowed to choose, on a one-for-one basis, between restricted shares and LTIP Units. Similar to restricted shares, LTIP Units generally vest three years from the award date. In addition, LTIP Unit holders receive quarterly dividend payments on their LTIP Units at the same rate and on the same date as any other OP Unit holder. As a result, dividends paid on LTIP Units are included as a component of Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership and have not been considered in reducing net income available to Common Shares in a manner similar to the Company's preferred share dividends for the earnings per share calculation. If employment is terminated prior to vesting, the LTIP Units are generally canceled. An LTIP Unit will automatically convert to an OP Unit when the capital account of each LTIP Unit increases ("books-up") to a specified target. If the capital target is not attained within ten years following the date of issuance, the LTIP Unit will automatically be canceled and no compensation will be payable to the holder of such canceled LTIP Unit.
     The Company's Share Incentive Plans provide for certain benefits upon retirement at or after age 62. As of November 4, 2008, but effective as of January 1, 2009, the Company changed the definition of retirement for employees (including all officers but not non-employee members of the Company's Board of Trustees) under its Share
 
Incentive Plans. For employees hired prior to January 1, 2009, retirement generally will mean the termination of employment (other than for cause): (i) on or after age 62; or (ii) prior to age 62 after meeting the requirements of the Rule of 70 (described below). For employees hired after January 1, 2009, retirement generally will mean the termination of employment (other than for cause) after meeting the requirements of the Rule of 70.
     The Rule of 70 is met when an employee's years of service with the Company (which must be at least 15 years) plus his or her age (which must be at least 55 years) on the date of termination equals or exceeds 70 years. In addition, the employee must give the Company at least 6 months' advance written notice of his or her intention to retire and sign a release upon termination of employment, releasing the Company from customary claims and agreeing to ongoing non-competition and employee non-solicitation provisions. John Powers, Executive Vice President  Human Resources, became eligible for retirement in 2009 as he turned 62. Frederick C. Tuomi, President  Property Management, became eligible for retirement under the Rule of 70 in 2009. The following executive officers of the Company will become eligible for retirement under the Rule of 70 in the next two years: Bruce C. Strohm, Executive Vice President and General Counsel  2010 and David J. Neithercut, Chief Executive Officer and President  2011.
     For employees hired prior to January 1, 2009, who retire at or after age 62, such employee's unvested restricted shares and share options would immediately vest, and share options would continue to be exercisable for the balance of the applicable ten-year option period, as was provided under the Share Incentive Plans prior to the adoption of the Rule of 70. For all other employees (those hired after January 1, 2009 and those hired before such date who choose to retire prior to age 62), upon such retirement under the new definition of retirement of employees, such employee's unvested restricted shares and share options would continue to vest per the original vesting schedule (subject to immediate vesting upon the occurrence of a subsequent change in control of the Company or the employee's death), and options would continue to be exercisable for the balance of the applicable ten-year option period, subject to the employee's compliance with the non-competition and employee non-solicitation provisions. If an employee violates these provisions after such retirement, all unvested restricted shares and unvested and vested share options at the time of the violation would be void, unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Trustees.
     The following tables summarize compensation information regarding the performance shares, restricted shares, LTIP Units, share options and Employee Share Purchase Plan ("ESPP") for the three years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 (amounts in thousands):
 
     Compensation expense is generally recognized for Awards as follows:
     The Company accelerates the recognition of compensation expense for all Awards for those individuals approaching or meeting the retirement age criteria discussed above. The total compensation expense related to Awards not yet vested at December 31, 2009 is $18.7 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average term of 1.3 years.
     See Note 2 for additional information regarding the Company's share-based compensation.
     The table below summarizes the Award activity of the Share Incentive Plans for the three years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007:
 
 
     The following table summarizes information regarding options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2009:
 
Note: The aggregate intrinsic values in Notes (1) and (2) above were both calculated as the excess, if any, between the Company's closing share price of $33.78 per share on December 31, 2009 and the strike price of the underlying awards.
     As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, 7,522,344 Options (with a weighted average exercise price of $31.58) and 7,000,222 Options (with a weighted average exercise price of $28.45) were exercisable, respectively.
15. Employee Plans
     The Company established an Employee Share Purchase Plan to provide each employee and trustee the ability to annually acquire up to $100,000 of Common Shares of the Company. In 2003, the Company's shareholders approved an increase in the aggregate number of Common Shares available under the ESPP to 7,000,000 (from 2,000,000). The Company has 3,561,333 Common Shares available for purchase under the ESPP at December 31, 2009. The Common Shares may be purchased quarterly at a price equal to 85% of the lesser of: (a) the closing price for a share on the last day of such quarter; and (b) the greater of: (i) the closing price for a share on the first day of such quarter, and (ii) the average closing price for a share for all the business days in the quarter. The following table summarizes information regarding the Common Shares issued under the ESPP:
     The Company established a defined contribution plan (the "401(k) Plan") to provide retirement benefits for employees that meet minimum employment criteria. The Company matches dollar for dollar up to the first 3% of eligible compensation that a participant contributes to the 401(k) Plan. Participants are vested in the Company's contributions over five years. The Company recognized an expense in the amount of $3.5 million, $3.8 million and $4.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
 
     The Company may also elect to make an annual discretionary profit-sharing contribution as a percentage of each individual employee's eligible compensation under the 401(k) Plan. The Company did not make a contribution for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 and as such, no expense was recognized in either year. The Company recognized an expense of approximately $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.
     The Company established a supplemental executive retirement plan (the "SERP") to provide certain officers and trustees an opportunity to defer a portion of their eligible compensation in order to save for retirement. The SERP is restricted to investments in Company Common Shares, certain marketable securities that have been specifically approved and cash equivalents. The deferred compensation liability represented in the SERP and the securities issued to fund such deferred compensation liability are consolidated by the Company and carried on the Company's balance sheet, and the Company's Common Shares held in the SERP are accounted for as a reduction to paid in capital.
16. Distribution Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan
     On November 3, 1997, the Company filed with the SEC a Form S-3 Registration Statement to register 14,000,000 Common Shares pursuant to a Distribution Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan (the "DRIP Plan"). The registration statement was declared effective on November 25, 1997. The remaining shares available for issuance under the 1997 registration lapsed in December 2008.
     On December 16, 2008, the Company filed with the SEC a Form S-3 Registration Statement to register 5,000,000 Common Shares under the DRIP Plan. The registration statement was automatically declared effective the same day and expires at the earlier of the date in which all 5,000,000 shares have been issued or December 15, 2011. The Company has 4,932,533 Common Shares available for issuance under the DRIP Plan at December 31, 2009.
     The DRIP Plan provides holders of record and beneficial owners of Common Shares and Preferred Shares with a simple and convenient method of investing cash distributions in additional Common Shares (which is referred to herein as the "Dividend Reinvestment  DRIP Plan"). Common Shares may also be purchased on a monthly basis with optional cash payments made by participants in the DRIP Plan and interested new investors, not currently shareholders of the Company, at the market price of the Common Shares less a discount ranging between 0% and 5%, as determined in accordance with the DRIP Plan (which is referred to herein as the "Share Purchase  DRIP Plan"). Common Shares purchased under the DRIP Plan may, at the option of the Company, be directly issued by the Company or purchased by the Company's transfer agent in the open market using participants' funds.
17. Transactions with Related Parties
     The Company provided asset and property management services to certain related entities for properties not owned by the Company, which terminated in December 2008. Fees received for providing such services were approximately $0.3 million for both the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007.
     The Company leases its corporate headquarters from an entity controlled by EQR's Chairman of the Board of Trustees. The lease terminates on July 31, 2011. Amounts incurred for such office space for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, were approximately $3.0 million, $2.9 million and $2.9 million. The Company believes these amounts equal market rates for such rental space.
18. Commitments and Contingencies
     The Company, as an owner of real estate, is subject to various Federal, state and local environmental laws. Compliance by the Company with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on the Company. However, the Company cannot predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations on its current properties or on properties that it may acquire in the future.
     The Company is party to a housing discrimination lawsuit brought by a non-profit civil rights organization in April 2006 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The suit alleges that the Company designed and built approximately 300 of its properties in violation of the accessibility requirements of the Fair Housing Act and Americans With Disabilities Act. The suit seeks actual and punitive damages, injunctive relief (including modification of non-compliant properties), costs and attorneys' fees. The Company believes it has a number of viable defenses, including that a majority of the named properties were completed before the operative dates of the statutes in question and/or were not designed or built by the Company. Accordingly, the Company is defending the suit vigorously. Due to the pendency of the Company's defenses and the uncertainty of many other critical factual and legal issues, it is not possible to determine or predict the
 
outcome of the suit and as a result, no amounts have been accrued at December 31, 2009. While no assurances can be given, the Company does not believe that the suit, if adversely determined, would have a material adverse effect on the Company.
     The Company does not believe there is any other litigation pending or threatened against it that, individually or in the aggregate, may reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company.
     The Company has established a reserve and recorded a corresponding reduction to its net gain on sales of discontinued operations related to potential liabilities associated with its condominium conversion activities. The reserve covers potential product liability related to each conversion. The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of the reserve and makes adjustments as necessary. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company recorded additional reserves of approximately $3.3 million (primarily related to an insurance settlement), paid approximately $4.7 million in claims and released approximately $2.2 million of remaining reserves for settled claims. As a result, the Company had total reserves of approximately $6.7 million at December 31, 2009. While no assurances can be given, the Company does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these potential liabilities, if adversely determined, would have a material adverse effect on the Company.
     As of December 31, 2009, the Company has four projects totaling 1,700 units in various stages of development with estimated completion dates ranging through June 30, 2011. Some of the projects are developed solely by the Company, while others are co-developed with various third party development partners. The development venture agreements with partners are primarily deal-specific, with differing terms regarding profit-sharing, equity contributions, returns on investment, buy-sell agreements and other customary provisions. The partner is most often the "general" or "managing" partner of the development venture. The typical buy-sell arrangements contain appraisal rights and provisions that provide the right, but not the obligation, for the Company to acquire the partner's interest in the project at fair market value upon the expiration of a negotiated time period (typically two to five years after substantial completion of the project).
     During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, total operating lease payments incurred for office space, including a portion of real estate taxes, insurance, repairs and utilities, and including rent due under three ground leases, aggregated $8.4 million, $8.3 million and $7.6 million, respectively.
     The Company has entered into a retirement benefits agreement with its Chairman of the Board of Trustees and deferred compensation agreements with its Vice Chairman and two former chief executive officers. During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2007, the Company recognized compensation expense of $1.2 million and $0.7 million, respectively, related to these agreements. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reduced compensation expense by $0.4 million related to these agreements.
     The following table summarizes the Company's contractual obligations for minimum rent payments under operating leases and deferred compensation for the next five years and thereafter as of December 31, 2009:
 
19. Impairment and Other Expenses
     During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company recorded an approximate $11.1 million non-cash asset impairment charge on a parcel of land held for development. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company recorded approximately $116.4 million of non-cash asset impairment charges on land held for development related to five potential development projects that will no longer be pursued. These charges were the result of an analysis of each parcel's estimated fair value (determined using internally developed models based on market assumptions and comparable sales data) compared to its current capitalized carrying value and management's decision to reduce the number of planned development projects the Company will undertake.
 
     During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company incurred charges of $6.5 million, $5.8 million and $1.8 million, respectively, related to the write-off of various pursuit and out-of-pocket costs for terminated acquisition, disposition (including halted condominium conversions) and development transactions and related to transaction closing costs, such as survey, title and legal fees, on the acquisition of operating properties and are included in other expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
20. Reportable Segments
     Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by senior management. Senior management decides how resources are allocated and assesses performance on a monthly basis.
     The Company's primary business is owning, managing and operating multifamily residential properties, which includes the generation of rental and other related income through the leasing of apartment units to residents. Senior management evaluates the performance of each of our apartment communities individually and geographically, and both on a same store and non-same store basis; however, each of our apartment communities generally has similar economic characteristics, residents, products and services. The Company's operating segments have been aggregated by geography in a manner identical to that which is provided to its chief operating decision maker.
     The Company's fee and asset management, development (including its partially owned properties), condominium conversion and corporate housing (Equity Corporate Housing or "ECH") activities are immaterial and do not individually meet the threshold requirements of a reportable segment and as such, have been aggregated in the "Other" segment in the tables presented below.
     All revenues are from external customers and there is no customer who contributed 10% or more of the Company's total revenues during the three years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, or 2007.
     The primary financial measure for the Company's rental real estate properties is net operating income ("NOI"), which represents rental income less: 1) property and maintenance expense; 2) real estate taxes and insurance expense; and 3) property management expense (all as reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations). The Company believes that NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the Company's apartment communities. Current year NOI is compared to prior year NOI and current year budgeted NOI as a measure of financial performance. The following tables present NOI for each segment from our rental real estate specific to continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, as well as total assets for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively (amounts in thousands):
