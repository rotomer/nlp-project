Morgan Securities LLC and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated as sales agents (individually, a "Sales Agent" and together, the "Sales Agents"), with respect to the issuance and sale of up to 10,000,000 common shares of beneficial interest, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Shares") from time to time during a three-year period in "at the market" offerings or certain other transactions (the "Offering"). The Sales Agreements provide that each Sales Agent will be entitled to compensation not to exceed 2.0% of the gross sales price per share for any of the Shares sold under the relevant Sales Agreement.
     The Sales Agreements entered into with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated amend, restate and supersede the sales agency financing agreements that the Company and the Operating Partnership entered into with such Sales Agents on September 28, 2009. The 10,000,000 shares that may be sold in the Offering include 4,312,522 Shares that remain unsold under such prior sales agency financing agreements.
     The Shares will be issued pursuant to the prospectus supplement filed February 3, 2011 and the Company's automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-156156) filed on December 16, 2008 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This Current Report shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state.
     The Sales Agreements are filed as Exhibits 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4 to this Current Report. The description of the Sales Agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Sales Agreements filed herewith as exhibits to the Current Report.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, EQR may issue Program Shares through Merrill Lynch and Merrill Lynch shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell Program Shares, up to the Maximum Program Amount, based on and in accordance with such number of Issuance Notices as EQR in its sole discretion shall choose to deliver during the Commitment Period until the number of the Program Shares sold under the Sales Agency Agreements equals the Maximum Program Amount or this Agreement is otherwise terminated. Subject to the foregoing and the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, upon the delivery of an Issuance Notice, and unless the sale of the Issuance Shares described therein has been suspended, cancelled or otherwise terminated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, Merrill Lynch will use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices to sell such Issuance Shares up to the amount specified into the Principal Market, and otherwise in accordance with the terms of such Issuance Notice.

Each of the Transaction Entities acknowledges and agrees that (i) there can be no assurance that Merrill Lynch will be successful in selling Issuance Shares and (ii) Merrill Lynch will incur no liability or obligation to the Transaction Entities or any other Person if it does not sell Issuance Shares for any reason other than a failure by Merrill Lynch to use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices to sell such Issuance Shares as required under this Section 2.01.

          (a) . On any Trading Day during the Commitment Period, EQR may deliver an Issuance Notice to Merrill Lynch, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 5.01 and 5.02; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (1) Merrill Lynch shall not be obligated to sell on any Trading Day a number of Issuance Shares in excess of 25% of the Average Daily Trading Volume of Common Shares on the Principal Exchange without the prior written consent of Merrill Lynch, which may be withheld in Merrill Lynch's sole discretion, and (2) Merrill Lynch shall have no further obligations with respect to any Issuance Notice if and to the extent the number of the Issuance Shares sold pursuant thereto, together with the aggregate number of the Program Shares previously sold under the Sales Agency Agreements, shall exceed the Maximum Program Amount. EQR shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to amend at any time and from time to time any Issuance Notice; provided, however, that EQR may not amend the Issuance Amount if such amended Issuance Amount is less than the Actual Sold Amount as of the date of such amendment.
Issuance Notice
          (b) . An Issuance Notice shall be deemed delivered on the Trading Day that it is received by facsimile or otherwise (and EQR confirms such delivery by e-mail notice or by telephone (including voicemail message)) by Merrill Lynch. No Issuance Notice may be delivered other than on a Trading Day during the Commitment Period.
Delivery of Issuance Notice
          (c) . Merrill Lynch shall not sell Program Shares below the Floor Price during any Selling Period and such Floor Price may be adjusted by EQR at any time during any Selling Period upon notice to Merrill Lynch and confirmation to EQR.

Determination of Issuance Shares to be Sold
          (e) .

Trading Guidelines
     Section 2.04 . Subject to the provisions of Article V, on or before each Settlement Date, EQR will, or will cause its transfer agent to, electronically transfer the applicable Issuance Shares that have been sold by crediting Merrill Lynch or its designee's account at the Depository Trust Company through its Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian (DWAC) System, or by such other means of delivery as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties hereto and, upon
Settlements
 
receipt of such Issuance Shares, which in all cases shall be freely tradeable, transferable, registered shares in good deliverable form, Merrill Lynch will deliver the related Issuance Price in same day funds delivered to an account designated by EQR prior to the Settlement Date. If EQR defaults in its obligation to deliver Issuance Shares on a Settlement Date, EQR agrees that it will (i) hold Merrill Lynch harmless against any loss, claim, damage or expense (including, without limitation, penalties, interest and reasonable legal fees and expenses), as incurred, arising out of or in connection with such default by EQR, and (ii) pay to Merrill Lynch any Selling Commission to which it would otherwise have been entitled absent such default. The parties acknowledge and agree that, in performing its obligations under this Agreement, Merrill Lynch may borrow Common Shares from stock lenders, and may use the Issuance Shares to settle or close out such borrowings.
     Section 2.05 . Other than the press release to be issued by EQR on the date hereof and filed as a free writing prospectus, a copy of which has been provided to Merrill Lynch, neither EQR nor Merrill Lynch has prepared, used, referred to or distributed, or will prepare, use, refer to or distribute, without the other party's prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, any "written communication" which constitutes a "free writing prospectus" as such terms are defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act with respect to the offering of Program Shares contemplated by this Agreement.
Use of Free Writing Prospectus
     Section 2.06 . EQR agrees that any offer to sell, any solicitation of an offer to buy, or any sales of Program Shares or any other equity security of EQR shall only be effected by or through only one of Merrill Lynch or the Alternative Sales Agents on any single given day, but in no event by more than one, and EQR shall in no event request that Merrill Lynch and any other Alternative Sales Agent sell Program Shares on the same day.
Alternative Sales Agents
     Section 2.07 . If any party believes that the exemptive provisions set forth in Rule 101(c)(1) of Regulation M under the Exchange Act (applicable to securities with an average daily trading volume of $1,000,000 that are issued by an issuer whose common equity securities have a public float value of at least $150,000,000) are not satisfied with respect to EQR or the Program Shares, it shall promptly notify the other party and sales of Program Shares under the Sales Agency Agreements shall be suspended until that or other exemptive provisions have been satisfied in the reasonable judgment of all parties.
Exemption from Regulation M
     Section 2.08 . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in the event EQR engages Merrill Lynch for a sale of Program Shares that would constitute a "distribution" within the meaning of Rule 100 of Regulation M under the Exchange Act, EQR and Merrill Lynch will agree to compensation that is customary for Merrill Lynch with respect to such transactions.
Distributions under Regulation M
     Section 2.09 . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Merrill Lynch shall not be obligated to sell any Program Shares hereunder during (i) any period in which it reasonably believes that EQR is, or could be deemed to be, in possession of material non-public information or (ii) during the fourteen (14) calendar days prior to any public announcement or release disclosing EQR's results of operations or financial condition for a completed quarterly or annual fiscal period.

In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6.01 above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by Merrill Lynch, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6.02 above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by EQR. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances.

          (b) If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6.01(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.
     Section 6.04 . If the indemnification provided for in Section 6.01 and Section 6.02 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect benefits received by EQR, on the one hand, and Merrill Lynch, on the other hand, from the offering of the Program Shares to which such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses relate or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of EQR, on the one hand, and of Merrill Lynch, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by EQR on the one hand and Merrill Lynch on the other shall be deemed to be in the same
Contribution
 
proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of Program Shares (before deducting expenses) received by EQR bear to the total commissions received by Merrill Lynch.
     The relative fault of EQR, on the one hand, and Merrill Lynch, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by EQR or by Merrill Lynch and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.

The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 6.04 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
     Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6.04, Merrill Lynch shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Program Shares sold by it were sold to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which Merrill Lynch has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
     No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
     For purposes of this Section 6.04, each person, if any, who controls Merrill Lynch within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as Merrill Lynch, and each trustee, each officer of EQR who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls EQR or ERP within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as EQR.
     Section 7.01 . Subject to the provisions of this Article VII, the term of this Agreement shall run until the end of the Commitment Period.
Term
     Section 7.02 . Merrill Lynch may, in its sole discretion at any time, terminate the right of EQR to effect any Issuances under this Agreement, but any such

     Section 7.03 . EQR may, in its sole discretion at any time, terminate this Agreement, but any such termination shall not affect the settlement of any sales of Issuance Shares made pursuant to any Issuance Notice give prior to receipt by the applicable party of notice of such termination.

If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Article VII, such termination shall be without liability of any party hereto to any other party hereto except as provided in Section 9.02 and for EQR's obligations in respect of all prior Issuance Notices, and provided further that in any case the provisions of Article VI, Article VIII and Article IX shall survive termination of this Agreement without limitation.

Board
provided
     8. The Registration Statement became effective under the 1933 Act; the Prospectus has been filed pursuant to the 1933 Act Regulations; and, to our knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued under the 1933 Act and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending by the Commission.
     9. The Registration Statement, as of the date it first became effective, and the Prospectus, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, each appeared on its face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the applicable requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations for registration statements on Form S-3 or related prospectuses, as the case may be, except in each case that we express no opinion in this paragraph 9 with respect to (i) financial statements and schedules and other financial or statistical data derived from financial statements included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom and (ii) the Incorporated Documents.
     10. The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, at the respective times such documents were filed with the Commission, each appeared on its

     11. The statements set forth in the Base Prospectus under the heading "Description of Securities  Description of Shares of Beneficial Interest  Common Shares," to the extent such statements purport to describe certain provisions of the Common Shares as set forth in the Articles of Restatement of Declaration of Trust of the Company as currently in effect, accurately describe such provisions in all material respects, except that, we express no opinion in this paragraph 11 to the effect that any Common Shares will be duly authorized, fully paid and nonassessable.

The execution, delivery and performance by each of the Company and the Operating Partnership of each of the Sales Agency Financing Agreements and the consummation by each of the Company and the Operating Partnership of the transactions contemplated thereby (i) do not violate any provision of Applicable Laws, and (ii) do not violate any provision of the Articles of Restatement of Declaration of Trust of the Company or the Seventh Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company or any provision of the Certificate of Limited Partnership of the Operating Partnership or the Sixth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Operating Partnership, that the Shares are issued and sold in accordance with the proviso to the second sentence of paragraph 7 above, and except that we express no opinion with respect to any indemnification or contribution provisions contained in any of the Sales Agency Financing Agreements.
provided
     13. The Company is not required to be registered as an "investment company" within the meaning of the 1940 Act.
     In acting as counsel to the Company in connection with the offer and sale of the Shares, we have participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, representatives of the independent public accountants for the Company and your representatives and counsel, at which conferences certain contents of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and related matters were discussed.

     (A) the Registration Statement (including the information in the Prospectus that was omitted from the Registration Statement at the time it first became effective but that is deemed, pursuant to Rule 430B(f) of the 1933 Act Regulations, to be part of and included in the Registration Statement), as of the date of the Sales Agency Financing Agreements and at the date
 
hereof, included or includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; or
     (B) the Prospectus, as of the date hereof, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
except in each case that we express no belief and make no statement with respect to financial statements and schedules and other financial or statistical data derived from the financial statements included or incorporated by reference in or omitted from the Registration Statement or the Prospectus.
     The foregoing opinions and other statements are subject to the following qualifications, exceptions, assumptions and limitations:
     A. The foregoing opinions and other statements are limited to matters arising under the federal laws of the United States of America, the laws of the State of Illinois, the laws of the State of New York and Title 8.

     B. In rendering our opinion set forth in paragraphs 1 and 2 above, we have relied solely upon a certificate or certificates, as the case may be, of a governmental authority or official dated on or about the date hereof.
     C. In rendering our opinion set forth in paragraph 8 above with respect to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement and the filing of the Prospectus, we have relied upon our review of the EDGAR website. In rendering our opinion set forth in paragraph 8 above with respect to the absence of stop orders or proceedings, we have relied solely upon the oral advice of the staff of the Commission via a telephonic call on the date hereof.

Parrell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, and Bruce C. Strohm, Executive Vice President and General Counsel of the Company.
     E. Any opinion or statement herein which is expressed to be "to our knowledge" or is otherwise qualified by words of like import means that the lawyers currently practicing law with the Firm who have had active involvement in representing the Company in connection with the issuance and sale of the Shares and our lawyers who have principal responsibility for representing the Company on other matters in areas relevant to the opinions being rendered or the statements being made, have no current conscious awareness of any facts or information contrary to such opinion or statement. Except to the extent expressly set forth in this letter, we have not undertaken any independent investigation to determine the existence or absence of any fact, and no inference
 
as to our knowledge of the existence or absence of any fact should be drawn from our representation of the Company or the rendering of this letter.
     The opinions expressed and the statements made herein are expressed and made on the date hereof and we assume no obligation to advise you of changes in law, fact or other circumstances (or the effect thereof on such opinions or statements) that may come to our attention after such time.

     1. To my knowledge, each of the Company and the Operating Partnership is duly qualified and in good standing and authorized to transact business in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

     4. To my knowledge, there are no (A) legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened which are required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, other than those disclosed therein, or (B) statutes, regulations, contracts, indentures, mortgages, loan agreements, notes, leases, instruments or other documents that are required to be described in the Prospectus or to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement that are not described or filed as required.

     (iii) against any and all expense whatsoever as incurred (including, without limitation, the fees and other charges of counsel chosen by you) reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above;
, , that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense arises out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Prospectus Supplement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to EQR by BNYMCM expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), the Prospectus (or any amendment or

     Section 6.02 . BNYMCM agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each of EQR and ERP, and each person, if any, who controls EQR or ERP within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and any trustee, director, officer, employee or affiliate thereof, against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section 6.02, as incurred; but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Prospectus Supplement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, in reliance upon, and in conformity with, written information furnished to EQR by BNYMCM expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Prospectus Supplement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act.
Indemnification by BNYMCM
     Section 6.03 . (a) Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6.01 above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by BNYMCM, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6.02 above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by EQR. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under Section 6.01, Section 6.02 or Section 6.04 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings
          (b) If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6.01(ii)
 
effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.
     Section 6.04 . If the indemnification provided for in Section 6.01 and Section 6.02 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect benefits received by EQR, on the one hand, and BNYMCM, on the other hand, from the offering of the Program Shares to which such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses relate or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of EQR, on the one hand, and of BNYMCM, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by EQR on the one hand and BNYMCM on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of Program Shares (before deducting expenses) received by EQR bear to the total commissions received by BNYMCM.
Contribution
     The relative fault of EQR, on the one hand, and BNYMCM, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by EQR or by BNYMCM and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     EQR and BNYMCM agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 6.04 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 6.04. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 6.04 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
     Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6.04, BNYMCM shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Program Shares sold by it were sold to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which BNYMCM has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
     No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
     For purposes of this Section 6.04, each person, if any, who controls BNYMCM within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as BNYMCM, and each trustee, each officer of EQR who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls EQR or ERP within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as EQR.
     Section 7.01 . Subject to the provisions of this Article VII, the term of this Agreement shall run until the end of the Commitment Period.
Term
     Section 7.02 . BNYMCM may, in its sole discretion at any time, terminate the right of EQR to effect any Issuances under this Agreement, but any such termination shall not affect the settlement of any sales of Issuance Shares made pursuant to any Issuance Notice given prior to receipt by the applicable party of notice of such termination.
Termination by BNYMCM
     Section 7.03 . EQR may, in its sole discretion at any time, terminate this Agreement, but any such termination shall not affect the settlement of any sales of Issuance Shares made pursuant to any Issuance Notice give prior to receipt by the applicable party of notice of such termination.
Termination by EQR
     Section 7.04 . If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Article VII, such termination shall be without liability of any party hereto to any other party hereto except as provided in Section 9.02 and for EQR's obligations in respect of all prior Issuance Notices, and provided further that in any case the provisions of Article VI, Article VIII and Article IX shall survive termination of this Agreement without limitation.
Liability; Provisions that Survive Termination
     All representations and warranties of the Transaction Entities herein or in certificates delivered pursuant hereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any investigation made by or on behalf of BNYMCM and its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees and agents, (ii) delivery and acceptance of the Program Shares and payment therefor or (iii) any termination of this Agreement.
 
     Section 9.01 . EQR may issue a press release describing the material terms of the transactions contemplated hereby as soon as practicable following the Closing Date, and may file with the Commission a Current Report on Form 8-K describing the material terms of the transactions contemplated hereby, and EQR shall consult with BNYMCM prior to making such disclosures, and the parties shall use all commercially reasonable efforts, acting in good faith, to agree upon a text for such disclosures that is reasonably satisfactory to all parties.

If any such press release or like public statement is so required, the party making such disclosure shall consult with the other party prior to making such disclosure, and the parties shall use all commercially reasonable efforts, acting in good faith, to agree upon a text for such disclosure that is reasonably satisfactory to all parties.

     9. The Registration Statement, as of the date it first became effective, and the Prospectus, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, each appeared on its face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the applicable requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations for registration statements on Form S-3 or related prospectuses, as the case may be, except in each case that we express no opinion in this paragraph 9 with respect to (i) financial statements and schedules and other financial or statistical data derived from financial statements included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom and (ii) the Incorporated Documents.

     12. The execution, delivery and performance by each of the Company and the Operating Partnership of each of the Sales Agency Financing Agreements and the consummation by each of the Company and the Operating Partnership of the transactions contemplated thereby (i) do not violate any provision of Applicable Laws, and (ii) do not violate any provision of the Articles of Restatement of Declaration of Trust of the Company or the Seventh Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company or any provision of the Certificate of Limited Partnership of the Operating Partnership or the Sixth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Operating Partnership, that the Shares are issued and sold in accordance with the proviso to the second sentence of paragraph 7 above, and except that we express no opinion with respect to any indemnification or contribution provisions contained in any of the Sales Agency Financing Agreements.

     (A) the Registration Statement (including the information in the Prospectus that was omitted from the Registration Statement at the time it first became effective but that is deemed, pursuant to Rule 430B(f) of the 1933 Act Regulations, to be part of and included in the Registration Statement), as of the date of the Sales Agency Financing Agreements and at the date
 
hereof, included or includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; or
     (B) the Prospectus, as of the date hereof, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
except in each case that we express no belief and make no statement with respect to financial statements and schedules and other financial or statistical data derived from the financial statements included or incorporated by reference in or omitted from the Registration Statement or the Prospectus.
     The foregoing opinions and other statements are subject to the following qualifications, exceptions, assumptions and limitations:
     A. The foregoing opinions and other statements are limited to matters arising under the federal laws of the United States of America, the laws of the State of Illinois, the laws of the State of New York and Title 8.

     E. Any opinion or statement herein which is expressed to be "to our knowledge" or is otherwise qualified by words of like import means that the lawyers currently practicing law with the Firm who have had active involvement in representing the Company in connection with the issuance and sale of the Shares and our lawyers who have principal responsibility for representing the Company on other matters in areas relevant to the opinions being rendered or the statements being made, have no current conscious awareness of any facts or information contrary to such opinion or statement.

Subsidiary REIT
Officer's Certificate
     Although we have made such inquiries and performed such investigations as we have deemed necessary for purposes of our opinion, we have not independently verified all of the facts, statements, representations and covenants set forth in the Officer's Certificate, the Prospectus, or in any other document. We consequently have assumed that the information presented in such documents or otherwise furnished to us accurately and completely describes all material facts relevant to our opinion. We are not aware of any facts that are inconsistent with any of the representations made to us in the Officer's Certificate. Any representation or statement in any document upon which we rely that is made "to the best knowledge of" or otherwise similarly qualified is assumed to be true, correct and complete as if made without such qualification as to knowledge or belief. Any alteration or inaccuracy of such facts, statements, representations or covenants may adversely affect our opinions.
     For purposes of our opinion, we have assumed that all of the representations and statements of a factual nature set forth in the documents we reviewed are true, correct and complete, and all of the obligations imposed by any such documents on the parties thereto have been and will be performed or satisfied in accordance with their terms. We have also assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the proper execution of all documents, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to originals of documents submitted to us as copies, and the authenticity of the originals from which any copies were made.
     The opinions set forth in this letter are based on relevant provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ""), the regulations promulgated thereunder by the United States Department of the Treasury (the "") (including proposed and temporary Regulations), and interpretations of the foregoing as expressed in court decisions, legislative history, and existing administrative rulings and practices of the Internal Revenue Service ("") (including its practices and policies in issuing private letter rulings, which are not binding on the IRS except with respect to a taxpayer that receives such a ruling), all as of the date hereof.

     In rendering these opinions, we have assumed that the transactions contemplated by the Reviewed Documents will be consummated in accordance with the terms and provisions of such documents, and that such documents accurately reflect the material facts of such transactions. In addition, the opinions set forth herein are based on the correctness of the following specific assumptions:
 
     With respect to the last assumption, it should be noted that statutes, regulations, judicial decisions, and administrative interpretations are subject to change at any time and, in some circumstances, with retroactive effect. A material change that is made after the date hereof in any of the foregoing bases for our opinions could affect our conclusions. Furthermore, if the facts vary from those relied upon (including if any representations, warranties, covenants or assumptions upon which we have relied are inaccurate, incomplete, breached or ineffective), our opinion contained herein could be inapplicable.
     The qualification and taxation of EQR as a real estate investment trust ("") under the Code will depend upon (i) EQR's meeting, in its actual operations, the applicable asset composition, source of income, shareholder diversification, distribution and other requirements of the Code and Regulations necessary for an entity to qualify as a REIT and (ii) the satisfaction by each of the Subsidiary REITs of the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. We will not review the operations of EQR or any of the Subsidiary REITs, and no assurance can be given that the actual operations of EQR or any Subsidiary REIT will meet these requirements or the representations made to us with respect thereto.

     Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that:
 
     The foregoing opinion is limited to the matters specifically discussed herein, which are the only matters to which you have requested our opinion. Other than as expressly stated above, we express no opinion on any issue relating to EQR or any investment therein, the Operating Partnership, any Subsidiary REIT, or under any other law.
     This opinion should not be construed as or deemed to be a guaranty or insuring agreement. You should be aware that an opinion of counsel represents only counsel's best legal judgment, and has no binding effect or official status of any kind, and that no assurance can be given that the IRS will not challenge the conclusions of the opinion set forth herein or that any such challenge will not be successful or that a court considering the issues would not hold contrary to the opinions set forth herein.
     This opinion is rendered only to you pursuant to [Section 2.02] [Section 4.07] of each of the Sales Agency Financing Agreements, and may not be quoted in whole or in part or otherwise used, circulated or referred to, or be filed with, or furnished to, any other person or entity (including, without limitation, any person who acquires the Common Shares from or through the Sales Agents). This opinion is expressed as of the date hereof, and we are under no obligation to supplement or revise our opinion to reflect any legal developments or factual matters arising subsequent to the date hereof, or the impact of any information, document, certificate, record, statement, representation, covenant, or assumption relied upon herein that becomes incorrect or untrue.
     To comply with certain Regulations, we inform you that (i) this opinion was written to support the promotion and marketing by others of the transactions or matters addressed herein, (ii) this opinion was not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used, by any person for the purpose of avoiding United States federal tax penalties that may be imposed on such person, and (iii) each taxpayer should seek advice based on the taxpayer's particular circumstances from an independent tax advisor.

     Pursuant to the requirements of [Section 2.02] [Section 4.07] of each of the Sales Agency Financing Agreements, this will advise you that in the opinion of the undersigned:
     1. To my knowledge, each of the Company and the Operating Partnership is duly qualified and in good standing and authorized to transact business in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

     Section 2.01 . (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, EQR may issue Program Shares through JPMorgan and JPMorgan shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell Program Shares, up to the Maximum Program Amount, based on and in accordance with such number of Issuance Notices as EQR in its sole discretion shall choose to deliver during the Commitment Period until the number of the Program Shares sold under the Sales Agency Agreements equals the Maximum Program Amount or this Agreement is otherwise terminated. Subject to the foregoing and the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, upon the delivery of an Issuance Notice, and unless the sale of the Issuance Shares described therein has been suspended, cancelled or otherwise terminated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, JPMorgan will use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices to sell such Issuance Shares up to the amount specified into the Principal Market, and otherwise in accordance with the terms of such Issuance Notice.

JPMorgan may sell Issuance Shares in the manner described in Section 2.01(b) herein. Each of the Transaction Entities acknowledges and agrees that (i) there can be no assurance that JPMorgan will be successful in selling Issuance Shares and (ii) JPMorgan will incur no liability or obligation to the Transaction Entities or any other Person if it does not sell Issuance Shares for any reason other than a failure by JPMorgan to use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices to sell such Issuance Shares as required under this Section 2.01.

Indemnification by the Transaction Entities
               (i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Prospectus Supplement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or the omission, or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
               (ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation or of any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission,
 
provided that (subject to Section 6.03 below) any such settlement is effected with the written consent of EQR; and
               (iii) against any and all expense whatsoever as incurred (including, without limitation, the fees and other charges of counsel chosen by you) reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above;
, , that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense arises out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Prospectus Supplement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to EQR by JPMorgan expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Prospectus Supplement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act.
provided
however
     Section 6.02 . JPMorgan agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each of EQR and ERP, and each person, if any, who controls EQR or ERP within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and any trustee, director, officer, employee or affiliate thereof, against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section 6.02, as incurred; but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Prospectus Supplement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, in reliance upon, and in conformity with, written information furnished to EQR by JPMorgan expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Prospectus Supplement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act.
Indemnification by JPMorgan
     Section 6.03 . (a) Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6.01 above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by JPMorgan, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6.02 above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by EQR. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action provided,
Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings
 
however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under Section 6.01, Section 6.02 or Section 6.04 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
          (b) If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6.01(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.
     Section 6.04 . If the indemnification provided for in Section 6.01 and Section 6.02 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect benefits received by EQR, on the one hand, and JPMorgan, on the other hand, from the offering of the Program Shares to which such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses relate or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of EQR, on the one hand, and of JPMorgan, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by EQR on the one hand and JPMorgan on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of Program Shares (before deducting expenses) received by EQR bear to the total commissions received by JPMorgan.
Contribution
     The relative fault of EQR, on the one hand, and JPMorgan, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by EQR or by JPMorgan and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
     EQR and JPMorgan agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 6.04 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 6.04. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 6.04 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
     Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6.04, JPMorgan shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Program Shares sold by it were sold to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which JPMorgan has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
     No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
     For purposes of this Section 6.04, each person, if any, who controls JPMorgan within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as JPMorgan, and each trustee, each officer of EQR who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls EQR or ERP within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as EQR.
     Section 7.01 . Subject to the provisions of this Article VII, the term of this Agreement shall run until the end of the Commitment Period.
Term
     Section 7.02 . JPMorgan may, in its sole discretion at any time, terminate the right of EQR to effect any Issuances under this Agreement, but any such termination shall not affect the settlement of any sales of Issuance Shares made pursuant to any Issuance Notice given prior to receipt by the applicable party of notice of such termination.
Termination by JPMorgan
     Section 7.03 . EQR may, in its sole discretion at any time, terminate this Agreement, but any such termination shall not affect the settlement of any sales of Issuance Shares made pursuant to any Issuance Notice give prior to receipt by the applicable party of notice of such termination.
Termination by EQR
 
     Section 7.04 . If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Article VII, such termination shall be without liability of any party hereto to any other party hereto except as provided in Section 9.02 and for EQR's obligations in respect of all prior Issuance Notices, and provided further that in any case the provisions of Article VI, Article VIII and Article IX shall survive termination of this Agreement without limitation.
Liability; Provisions that Survive Termination
     All representations and warranties of the Transaction Entities herein or in certificates delivered pursuant hereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any investigation made by or on behalf of JPMorgan and its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees and agents, (ii) delivery and acceptance of the Program Shares and payment therefor or (iii) any termination of this Agreement.
     Section 9.01 . EQR may issue a press release describing the material terms of the transactions contemplated hereby as soon as practicable following the Closing Date, and may file with the Commission a Current Report on Form 8-K describing the material terms of the transactions contemplated hereby, and EQR shall consult with JPMorgan prior to making such disclosures, and the parties shall use all commercially reasonable efforts, acting in good faith, to agree upon a text for such disclosures that is reasonably satisfactory to all parties. No party hereto shall issue thereafter any press release or like public statement (including, without limitation, any disclosure required in reports filed with the Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act) related to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby that includes information related to this Agreement or transactions contemplated hereby that has not previously been disclosed without the prior written approval of the other party hereto, except as may be necessary or appropriate in the opinion of the party seeking to make disclosure to comply with the requirements of applicable law or stock exchange rules. If any such press release or like public statement is so required, the party making such disclosure shall consult with the other party prior to making such disclosure, and the parties shall use all commercially reasonable efforts, acting in good faith, to agree upon a text for such disclosure that is reasonably satisfactory to all parties.

provided
     8. The Registration Statement became effective under the 1933 Act; the Prospectus has been filed pursuant to the 1933 Act Regulations; and, to our knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued under the 1933 Act and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending by the Commission.
     9. The Registration Statement, as of the date it first became effective, and the Prospectus, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, each appeared on its face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the applicable requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations for registration statements on Form S-3 or related prospectuses, as the case may be, except in each case that we express no opinion in this paragraph 9 with respect to (i) financial statements and schedules and other financial or statistical data derived from financial statements included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom and (ii) the Incorporated Documents.
     10. The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, at the respective times such documents were filed with the Commission, each appeared on its

provided
     13. The Company is not required to be registered as an "investment company" within the meaning of the 1940 Act.

          (A) the Registration Statement (including the information in the Prospectus that was omitted from the Registration Statement at the time it first became effective but that is deemed, pursuant to Rule 430B(f) of the 1933 Act Regulations, to be part of and included in the Registration Statement), as of the date of the Sales Agency Financing Agreements and at the date
 
hereof, included or includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; or
     (B) the Prospectus, as of the date hereof, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
except in each case that we express no belief and make no statement with respect to financial statements and schedules and other financial or statistical data derived from the financial statements included or incorporated by reference in or omitted from the Registration Statement or the Prospectus.

Parrell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, and Bruce C. Strohm, Executive Vice President and General Counsel of the Company.
     E. Any opinion or statement herein which is expressed to be "to our knowledge" or is otherwise qualified by words of like import means that the lawyers currently practicing law with the Firm who have had active involvement in representing the Company in connection with the issuance and sale of the Shares and our lawyers who have principal responsibility for representing the Company on other matters in areas relevant to the opinions being rendered or the statements being made, have no current conscious awareness of any facts or information contrary to such opinion or statement.

     Although we have made such inquiries and performed such investigations as we have deemed necessary for purposes of our opinion, we have not independently verified all of the facts, statements, representations and covenants set forth in the Officer's Certificate, the Prospectus, or in any other document. We consequently have assumed that the information presented in such documents or otherwise furnished to us accurately and completely describes all material facts relevant to our opinion. We are not aware of any facts that are inconsistent with any of the representations made to us in the Officer's Certificate. Any representation or statement in any document upon which we rely that is made "to the best knowledge of" or otherwise similarly qualified is assumed to be true, correct and complete as if made without such qualification as to knowledge or belief. Any alteration or inaccuracy of such facts, statements, representations or covenants may adversely affect our opinions.
     For purposes of our opinion, we have assumed that all of the representations and statements of a factual nature set forth in the documents we reviewed are true, correct and complete, and all of the obligations imposed by any such documents on the parties thereto have been and will be performed or satisfied in accordance with their terms. We have also assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the proper execution of all documents, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to originals of documents submitted to us as copies, and the authenticity of the originals from which any copies were made.
     The opinions set forth in this letter are based on relevant provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ""), the regulations promulgated thereunder by the United States Department of the Treasury (the "") (including proposed and temporary Regulations), and interpretations of the foregoing as expressed in court decisions, legislative history, and existing administrative rulings and practices of the Internal Revenue Service ("") (including its practices and policies in issuing private letter rulings, which are not binding on the IRS except with respect to a taxpayer that receives such a ruling), all as of the date hereof.

     In rendering these opinions, we have assumed that the transactions contemplated by the Reviewed Documents will be consummated in accordance with the terms and provisions of such documents, and that such documents accurately reflect the material facts of such transactions. In addition, the opinions set forth herein are based on the correctness of the following specific assumptions:
 
     With respect to the last assumption, it should be noted that statutes, regulations, judicial decisions, and administrative interpretations are subject to change at any time and, in some circumstances, with retroactive effect. A material change that is made after the date hereof in any of the foregoing bases for our opinions could affect our conclusions. Furthermore, if the facts vary from those relied upon (including if any representations, warranties, covenants or assumptions upon which we have relied are inaccurate, incomplete, breached or ineffective), our opinion contained herein could be inapplicable.
     The qualification and taxation of EQR as a real estate investment trust ("") under the Code will depend upon (i) EQR's meeting, in its actual operations, the applicable asset composition, source of income, shareholder diversification, distribution and other requirements of the Code and Regulations necessary for an entity to qualify as a REIT and (ii) the satisfaction by each of the Subsidiary REITs of the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT.

     This opinion should not be construed as or deemed to be a guaranty or insuring agreement. You should be aware that an opinion of counsel represents only counsel's best legal judgment, and has no binding effect or official status of any kind, and that no assurance can be given that the IRS will not challenge the conclusions of the opinion set forth herein or that any such challenge will not be successful or that a court considering the issues would not hold contrary to the opinions set forth herein.

The execution and delivery by each of the Company and the Operating Partnership of each of the Sales Agency Financing Agreements, the issuance of the Common Shares by the Company, and the performance of the obligations of each of the Company and the Operating Partnership, under each of the Sales Agency Financing Agreements and the consummation by each of the Company and the Operating Partnership of the transactions contemplated thereby, will not, to my knowledge, conflict with or constitute a breach of, or default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to any material agreement or other instrument that is binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or to which any of their properties or assets is subject.
     4. To my knowledge, there are no (A) legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened which are required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, other than those disclosed therein, or (B) statutes, regulations, contracts, indentures, mortgages, loan agreements, notes, leases, instruments or other documents that are required to be described in the Prospectus or to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement that are not described or filed as required.

Trading Guidelines
     Section 2.04 . Subject to the provisions of Article V, on or before each Settlement Date, EQR will, or will cause its transfer agent to, electronically transfer the applicable
Settlements
 
Issuance Shares that have been sold by crediting Morgan Stanley or its designee's account at the Depository Trust Company through its Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian (DWAC) System, or by such other means of delivery as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties hereto and, upon receipt of such Issuance Shares, which in all cases shall be freely tradeable, transferable, registered shares in good deliverable form, Morgan Stanley will deliver the related Issuance Price in same day funds delivered to an account designated by EQR prior to the Settlement Date. If EQR defaults in its obligation to deliver Issuance Shares on a Settlement Date, EQR agrees that it will (i) hold Morgan Stanley harmless against any loss, claim, damage or expense (including, without limitation, penalties, interest and reasonable legal fees and expenses), as incurred, arising out of or in connection with such default by EQR, and (ii) pay to Morgan Stanley any Selling Commission to which it would otherwise have been entitled absent such default.

Alternative Sales Agents
     Section 2.07 . If any party believes that the exemptive provisions set forth in Rule 101(c)(1) of Regulation M under the Exchange Act (applicable to securities with an average daily trading volume of $1,000,000 that are issued by an issuer whose common equity securities have a public float value of at least $150,000,000) are not satisfied with respect to EQR or the Program Shares, it shall promptly notify the other party and sales of Program Shares under the Sales Agency Agreements shall be suspended until that or other exemptive provisions have been satisfied in the reasonable judgment of all parties.
Exemption from Regulation M

Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings
          (b) If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6.01(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.

appropriate to reflect benefits received by EQR, on the one hand, and Morgan Stanley, on the other hand, from the offering of the Program Shares to which such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses relate or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of EQR, on the one hand, and of Morgan Stanley, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by EQR on the one hand and Morgan Stanley on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of Program Shares (before deducting expenses) received by EQR bear to the total commissions received by Morgan Stanley.
     The relative fault of EQR, on the one hand, and Morgan Stanley, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by EQR or by Morgan Stanley and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     EQR and Morgan Stanley agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 6.04 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 6.04. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 6.04 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
     Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6.04, Morgan Stanley shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Program Shares sold by it were sold to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which Morgan Stanley has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
     No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
     For purposes of this Section 6.04, each person, if any, who controls Morgan Stanley within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as Morgan Stanley, and each trustee, each officer of EQR who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls EQR or ERP within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as EQR.

Term
     Section 7.02 .

In our examination, we have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies or by facsimile or other means of electronic transmission or which we obtained from the Commission's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system ("") or other sites on the internet, and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents.

Board
provided
     8. The Registration Statement became effective under the 1933 Act; the Prospectus has been filed pursuant to the 1933 Act Regulations; and, to our knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued under the 1933 Act and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending by the Commission.
     9. The Registration Statement, as of the date it first became effective, and the Prospectus, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, each appeared on its face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the applicable requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations for registration statements on Form S-3 or related prospectuses, as the case may be, except in each case that we express no opinion in this paragraph 9 with respect to (i) financial statements and schedules and other financial or statistical data derived from financial statements included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom and (ii) the Incorporated Documents.
     10. The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, at the respective times such documents were filed with the Commission, each appeared on its

     11. The statements set forth in the Base Prospectus under the heading "Description of Securities  Description of Shares of Beneficial Interest  Common Shares," to the extent such statements purport to describe certain provisions of the Common Shares as set forth in the Articles of Restatement of Declaration of Trust of the Company as currently in effect, accurately describe such provisions in all material respects, except that, we express no opinion in this paragraph 11 to the effect that any Common Shares will be duly authorized, fully paid and nonassessable.

The execution, delivery and performance by each of the Company and the Operating Partnership of each of the Sales Agency Financing Agreements and the consummation by each of the Company and the Operating Partnership of the transactions contemplated thereby (i) do not violate any provision of Applicable Laws, and (ii) do not violate any provision of the Articles of Restatement of Declaration of Trust of the Company or the Seventh Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company or any provision of the Certificate of Limited Partnership of the Operating Partnership or the Sixth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Operating Partnership, that the Shares are issued and sold in accordance with the proviso to the second sentence of paragraph 7 above, and except that we express no opinion with respect to any indemnification or contribution provisions contained in any of the Sales Agency Financing Agreements.
provided
     13. The Company is not required to be registered as an "investment company" within the meaning of the 1940 Act.
     In acting as counsel to the Company in connection with the offer and sale of the Shares, we have participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, representatives of the independent public accountants for the Company and your representatives and counsel, at which conferences certain contents of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and related matters were discussed. We have not participated in the preparation of the Registration Statement or the Base Prospectus; however, we have reviewed such documents. Although we are not passing upon or assuming responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements included or incorporated by reference in or omitted from the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Incorporated Documents and have made no independent check or verification thereof (except as set forth in paragraph 11 above), based upon our participation in such conferences, no facts have come to our attention which have caused us to believe that:
     (A) the Registration Statement (including the information in the Prospectus that was omitted from the Registration Statement at the time it first became effective but that is deemed, pursuant to Rule 430B(f) of the 1933 Act Regulations, to be part of and included in the Registration Statement), as of the date of the Sales Agency Financing Agreements and at the date
 
hereof, included or includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; or
     (B) the Prospectus, as of the date hereof, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
except in each case that we express no belief and make no statement with respect to financial statements and schedules and other financial or statistical data derived from the financial statements included or incorporated by reference in or omitted from the Registration Statement or the Prospectus.
     The foregoing opinions and other statements are subject to the following qualifications, exceptions, assumptions and limitations:
     A. The foregoing opinions and other statements are limited to matters arising under the federal laws of the United States of America, the laws of the State of Illinois, the laws of the State of New York and Title 8.

     B. In rendering our opinion set forth in paragraphs 1 and 2 above, we have relied solely upon a certificate or certificates, as the case may be, of a governmental authority or official dated on or about the date hereof.
     C. In rendering our opinion set forth in paragraph 8 above with respect to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement and the filing of the Prospectus, we have relied upon our review of the EDGAR website. In rendering our opinion set forth in paragraph 8 above with respect to the absence of stop orders or proceedings, we have relied solely upon the oral advice of the staff of the Commission via a telephonic call on the date hereof.
     D. In rendering our opinion set forth in paragraph 13 above, we have relied exclusively, as to all factual matters, on the certificate, dated as of the date of this letter, of Mark J. Parrell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, and Bruce C. Strohm, Executive Vice President and General Counsel of the Company.
     E. Any opinion or statement herein which is expressed to be "to our knowledge" or is otherwise qualified by words of like import means that the lawyers currently practicing law with the Firm who have had active involvement in representing the Company in connection with the issuance and sale of the Shares and our lawyers who have principal responsibility for representing the Company on other matters in areas relevant to the opinions being rendered or the statements being made, have no current conscious awareness of any facts or information contrary to such opinion or statement. Except to the extent expressly set forth in this letter, we have not undertaken any independent investigation to determine the existence or absence of any fact, and no inference
 
as to our knowledge of the existence or absence of any fact should be drawn from our representation of the Company or the rendering of this letter.
     The opinions expressed and the statements made herein are expressed and made on the date hereof and we assume no obligation to advise you of changes in law, fact or other circumstances (or the effect thereof on such opinions or statements) that may come to our attention after such time.
     We call your attention to the fact that, although we represent the Company in connection with the subject transaction, our engagement has been limited to the specific matters as to which we have been consulted.
     This letter is being rendered and delivered solely to and for the benefit of the persons to whom it is addressed; accordingly, it may not be delivered to or relied upon by any other person (including, without limitation, any person who acquires the Shares from or through any Sales Agent), quoted or filed with any governmental authority or other regulatory agency or otherwise circulated or utilized for any other purpose without our prior written consent, except that Hogan Lovells US LLP may rely upon our opinion set forth in paragraph 6 above to the extent that such opinion relates to the Operating Partnership and matters arising under the laws of the State of Illinois for the sole purpose of rendering its opinion pursuant to [Section 2.02] [Section 4.07] of the Sales Agency Financing Agreements.

     Pursuant to the requirements of [Section 2.02] [Section 4.07] of each of the Sales Agency Financing Agreements, this will advise you that in the opinion of the undersigned:
     1. To my knowledge, each of the Company and the Operating Partnership is duly qualified and in good standing and authorized to transact business in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not have a Material Adverse Effect.
     2. Each of the Company's Subsidiaries has been duly incorporated or formed and is validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or formation, has the corporate, limited liability company or limited partnership power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct its business as described in the Prospectus, and, to my knowledge, is duly qualified and in good standing and authorized to transact business in any jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except where the failure to be validly existing, so qualified or in good standing would not have a Material Adverse Effect; all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock, limited liability company interests and partnership interests of each Subsidiary have been duly authorized and validly issued, are, in the case of shares of capital stock, fully paid, and with respect to the shares of capital stock, limited liability company interests, and partnership interests of each Subsidiary owned by the Company, the Operating Partnership or another subsidiary of the Company or the Operating Partnership, are owned by the Company, the Operating Partnership or another subsidiary of the Company or the Operating Partnership, to my knowledge, free and clear of any security interest, mortgage, pledge, lien, encumbrance, claim or equity, except where any such security interest, mortgage, pledge, lien, encumbrance, claim or equity would not have a Material Adverse Effect. None of the outstanding shares of capital stock,
 
limited liability company interests or partnership interests of any Subsidiary were issued in violation of statutory preemptive rights or, to my knowledge, contractual rights of any security holder of such Subsidiary to subscribe for more shares of capital stock, limited liability company interests or partnership interests, except where such violation would not have a Material Adverse Effect.
     3. The execution and delivery by each of the Company and the Operating Partnership of each of the Sales Agency Financing Agreements, the issuance of the Common Shares by the Company, and the performance of the obligations of each of the Company and the Operating Partnership, under each of the Sales Agency Financing Agreements and the consummation by each of the Company and the Operating Partnership of the transactions contemplated thereby, will not, to my knowledge, conflict with or constitute a breach of, or default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to any material agreement or other instrument that is binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or to which any of their properties or assets is subject.
     4. To my knowledge, there are no (A) legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened which are required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, other than those disclosed therein, or (B) statutes, regulations, contracts, indentures, mortgages, loan agreements, notes, leases, instruments or other documents that are required to be described in the Prospectus or to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement that are not described or filed as required.

The statements set forth in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended [December 31, 2009] [and the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2010,June 30, 2010 and September 30, 2010] under the heading "Legal Proceedings," insofar as such statements purport to summarize certain legal matters, documents or proceedings or legal conclusions, to my knowledge, fairly summarize in all material respects the matters therein described.
     This opinion letter is limited to Title 8 of the Corporations and Associations Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland, those laws of the State of Illinois that are normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Sales Agency Financing Agreements and the federal laws of the United States of America. In rendering my opinions regarding due qualification, valid existence and good standing set forth in paragraphs 1 and 2 above, I have relied solely upon certificates of governmental authorities or officials. This opinion letter is based on the law in effect, and the facts and circumstances existing, on the date of this letter. I assume no obligation to update or supplement this opinion letter to reflect any facts or circumstances which may hereafter come to my attention with respect to the opinions and statements expressed above, including any changes in applicable law which may hereafter occur.
     This opinion letter is being rendered and delivered solely to and for the benefit of the persons to whom it is addressed; accordingly, it may not be delivered to or relied upon by any other person (including, without limitation, any person who acquires the Common Shares from or

Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We are acting as special tax counsel to Equity Residential, a Maryland real estate investment trust ("EQR" or the "Company"), in connection with the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-156156), under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ("Securities Act"), relating to the issuance of (i) common shares of beneficial interest, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Shares"), (ii) preferred shares of beneficial interest, par value $0.01 per share (the "Preferred Shares"), and (iii) depository shares representing fractional interests in Preferred Shares (the "Depository Shares" and together with the Common Shares, Preferred Shares, the "Shares"), as described in the Registration Statement which became effective on December 16, 2008. The term "Registration Statement" shall mean, as of any time referred to herein, such registration statement, as amended at such time, including, except as otherwise specified therein, the documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Securities Act as of the date hereof. This opinion letter is furnished to you at your request to enable EQR to fulfill the requirements of Item 601(b)(5) of Regulation S-K, 17 C.F.R.  229.601(b)(8), in connection with the Registration Statement.
     For purposes of this opinion letter, we have examined copies of the following documents (the "Reviewed Documents"): (i) an executed copy of the Registration Statement; (ii) the Articles of Restatement of EQR ("Declaration of Trust"), as certified by an officer of the Company on the date hereof as then being complete, accurate, and in effect; (iii) the Seventh Amended and Restated Bylaws of EQR ("Bylaws"), as certified by an officer of the Company on the date hereof as then being complete, accurate, and in effect; (iv) the Sixth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of ERP Operating Limited Partnership (the "Operating Partnership" and such agreement, the "ERP LP Agreement"); (v) resolutions of the Board of Trustees of EQR or a duly authorized committee thereof that authorizes and otherwise
 
Board of Trustees Equity Residential February 3, 2011 Page 2
relates to the issuance of the Shares ("Resolutions"); and (vii) such other materials and matters as we have deemed necessary for the issuance of this opinion.
     In addition, we have relied upon the factual representations and covenants of EQR and, to the extent set forth in the Officer's Certificate (as hereinafter defined), of Multifamily Portfolio Partners, Inc., a Delaware corporation, EQR-District Holding, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and BEL Residential Properties Trust, a Maryland real estate investment trust (each such entity, along with BEL Multifamily Property Trust, a Maryland real estate investment trust, BEL Communities Property Trust, a Maryland real estate investment trust, and BEL Apartment Properties Trust, a Maryland real estate investment trust, hereinafter referred to as a "Subsidiary REIT"), contained in EQR's certificate to us, dated as of the date hereof (the Officer's Certificate"), executed by a duly appointed officer of EQR setting forth certain representations and covenants relating to the organization and operation of EQR, the Operating Partnership, the Subsidiary REITs and their respective subsidiaries.
"
     For purposes of our opinion, we have not made an independent investigation of the facts set forth in the documents we reviewed. We consequently have assumed that the information presented in such documents or otherwise furnished to us accurately and completely describes all material facts relevant to our opinion. No facts have come to our attention, however, that would cause us to question the accuracy and completeness of such facts or documents in a material way. Any representation or statement in any document upon which we rely that is made "to the best of our knowledge" or otherwise similarly qualified is assumed to be correct. Any alteration of such facts may adversely affect our opinions. In the course of our representation of EQR, no information has come to our attention that would cause us to question the accuracy or completeness of the representations contained in the Officer's Certificate or of the Reviewed Documents in a material way.
     In our review, we have assumed, with your consent, that all of the representations and statements of a factual nature set forth in the documents we reviewed are true and correct, and all of the obligations imposed by any such documents on the parties thereto have been and will be performed or satisfied in accordance with their terms. We have also assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the proper execution of all documents, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to originals of documents submitted to us as copies, and the authenticity of the originals from which any copies were made.
     The opinions set forth in this letter are based on relevant provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the regulations promulgated thereunder by the United States Department of the Treasury ("Regulations") (including proposed and temporary Regulations), and interpretations of the foregoing as expressed in court decisions, the legislative history, and existing administrative rulings and practices of the Internal Revenue Service (including its practices and policies in issuing private letter rulings, which are not binding on the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") except with respect to a taxpayer that receives such a ruling), all as of the date hereof.
 
Board of Trustees Equity Residential February 3, 2011 Page 3
     In rendering these opinions, we have assumed that the transactions contemplated by the Reviewed Documents will be consummated in accordance with the terms and provisions of such documents, and that such documents accurately reflect the material facts of such transactions. In addition, the opinions are based on the correctness of the following specific assumptions:
     With respect to the last assumption, it should be noted that statutes, regulations, judicial decisions, and administrative interpretations are subject to change at any time and, in some circumstances, with retroactive effect. A material change that is made after the date hereof in any of the foregoing bases for our opinions could affect our conclusions. Furthermore, if the facts vary from those relied upon (including if any representations, warranties, covenants or assumptions upon which we have relied are inaccurate, incomplete, breached or ineffective), our opinion contained herein could be inapplicable. Moreover, the qualification and taxation of EQR as a real estate investment trust (a "REIT") under the Code will depend upon (i) EQR's meeting, in its actual operations, the applicable asset composition, source of income, shareholder diversification, distribution and other requirements of the Code and Regulations necessary for an entity to qualify as a REIT and (ii) the satisfaction by each of the Subsidiary REITs of the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. We will not review the operations of EQR or any of the Subsidiary REITs, and no assurance can be given that the actual operations of EQR or any Subsidiary REIT will meet these requirements or the representations made to us with respect thereto
     Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that:
 
Board of Trustees Equity Residential February 3, 2011 Page 4
     The foregoing opinion is limited to the matters specifically discussed herein, which are the only matters to which you have requested our opinion. Other than as expressly stated above, we express no opinion on any issue relating to EQR, Operating Partnership, any Subsidiary REIT, or to any investment therein.
     For a discussion relating the law to the facts and the legal analysis underlying the opinions set forth in this letter, we incorporate by reference the discussion of federal income tax issues, which we assisted in preparing, contained in the Prospectus, included as part of the Registration Statement, under the heading "Federal Income Tax Considerations." We assume no obligation to advise you of any changes in the foregoing subsequent to the date of this opinion letter, and we are not undertaking to update the opinion letter from time to time. You should be aware that an opinion of counsel represents only counsel's best legal judgment, and has no binding effect or official status of any kind, and that no assurance can be given that contrary positions may not be taken by the Internal Revenue Service or that a court considering the issues would not hold otherwise.
     This opinion is rendered only to you and may not be quoted in whole or in part or otherwise referred to, nor be filed with, or furnished to, any other person or entity in connection with the Registration Statements. We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Item 601(b)(8) of Regulation S-K, 17 C.F.R  229.601(b)(8), and the reference to DLA Piper LLP (US) contained under the heading "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus included as part of the Registration Statement.
