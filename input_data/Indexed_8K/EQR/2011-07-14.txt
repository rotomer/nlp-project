See Item 2.03 below.
Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation Under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
     On July 13, 2011, ERP Operating Limited Partnership (the "Operating Partnership") entered into a new $1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement that replaced the Operating Partnership's then existing revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to mature on February 28, 2012. Equity Residential, the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, remains a guarantor of the Operating Partnership's obligations under the new credit facility. The new credit facility is with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Syndication Agent, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Book Runners, Suntrust Bank, U.S. Bank National Association, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Documentation Agents, and Citibank, N.A., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as Co-Documentation Agents, and a syndicate of other banks.
     The new credit facility matures on July 13, 2014, subject to a one year extension option exercisable by the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership has the ability to increase available borrowings up to $1.75 billion by adding additional banks to the facility or obtaining the agreement of existing banks to increase their commitments. The interest rate on the advances under the new credit facility will generally be LIBOR plus a spread, which is dependent on the current credit rating of the Operating Partnership's long-term debt and is currently 115 basis points, or based upon bids received from the lending group. In addition, there is an annual facility fee, which is based on the credit rating of the Operating Partnership's long-term debt, and is currently 20 basis points.

          (b) Not later than 1:00 p.m. (Dallas time or, in the case of any Alternate Currency Borrowing, local time to the principal financial center of the Alternate Currency in question) on the date of each Borrowing as indicated in the Notice of Borrowing, each Bank shall (except as provided in subsection (c) of this Section) make available its share of such Borrowing in Federal funds or the applicable Alternate Currency immediately available in Dallas (or, in the case of any Alternate Currency Borrowing, the principal financial center of the Alternate Currency in question), to the Administrative Agent at its address referred to in Section 9.1. If the Borrower has requested the issuance of a Letter of Credit, no later than 12:00 Noon (Dallas time) on the date of such issuance as indicated in the notice delivered pursuant to Section 2.2(b), the Fronting Bank shall issue such Letter of Credit in the amount so requested and deliver the same to the Borrower or to the applicable Qualified Borrower or, at the instruction of the Borrower or the applicable Qualified Borrower, to the beneficiary thereof, with a copy thereof to the Administrative Agent. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit by the Fronting Bank, such Fronting Bank shall be deemed to have sold and transferred to each other Bank with a Dollar Commitment or Alternate Currency Commitment, as applicable, and each such other Bank shall be deemed, and hereby agrees, to have irrevocably and unconditionally purchased and received from the Fronting Bank, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and a participation in such Letter of Credit, any drawing thereunder, and the obligations of the Borrower hereunder with respect thereto, and any security therefor or guaranty pertaining thereto, in an amount equal to such Bank's ratable share thereof (based upon the ratio its Dollar Commitment or Alternate Currency Commitment, as applicable, bears to the aggregate of all Dollar Commitments or Alternate Currency Commitments, as applicable). Upon any change in any of the Commitments in accordance herewith, there shall be an automatic adjustment to such participations to reflect such changed shares. The Fronting Bank shall have the primary obligation to fund any and all draws made with respect to such Letter of Credit notwithstanding any failure of a participating Bank to fund its ratable share of any such draw. The
 
Administrative Agent will instruct the Fronting Bank to make such Letter of Credit available to the Borrower or to the applicable Qualified Borrower and the Fronting Bank shall make such Letter of Credit available to the Borrower or to the applicable Qualified Borrower or, at the instruction of the Borrower or the applicable Qualified Borrower, to the beneficiary thereof, at the Borrower's aforesaid address or at such address in the United States as Borrower or the applicable Qualified Borrower shall request on the date of the issuance thereof or, in the case of an Alternate Currency Letter of Credit, at such address in Europe or the United Kingdom or the United States as the Borrower or the applicable Qualified Borrower shall request on the date of the issuance thereof.
          (c) Not later than 3:00 p.m. (Dallas time) on the date of each Swingline Borrowing as indicated in the applicable Notice of Borrowing, the Swingline Lender shall make available such Swingline Borrowing in Federal funds immediately available in Dallas, Texas, to the Administrative Agent at its address referred to herein.
          (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Bank prior to the date of any Borrowing that such Bank will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Bank's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Bank has made such share available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with subsection (b) of this Section 2.4 and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, but shall not be obligated to, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount on behalf of such Bank. If and to the extent that such Bank shall not have so made such share available to the Administrative Agent, such Bank and the Borrower severally agree to repay (or to cause the applicable Qualified Borrower to repay) to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand, and in the case of the Borrower one (1) Business Day after demand, such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower or such Qualified Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of the Borrower, a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable thereto pursuant to Section 2.7 and (ii) in the case of such Bank, the Federal Funds Rate. If such Bank shall repay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Bank's Loan included in such Borrowing as of the date of such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement. Nothing contained in this Section 2.4(d) shall be deemed to reduce the Commitment of any Bank or in any way affect the rights of Borrower with respect to any defaulting Bank or Administrative Agent. The failure of any Bank to make available to the Administrative Agent such Bank's share of any Borrowing in accordance with Section 2.4(b) hereof shall not relieve any other Bank of its obligations to fund its Commitment, in accordance with the provisions hereof.
          (e) Subject to the provisions hereof, the Administrative Agent shall make available each Borrowing to Borrower in Federal funds or to the Borrower or the applicable Qualified Borrower in the applicable Alternate Currency immediately available in accordance with, and on the date set forth in, the applicable Notice of Borrowing.

Each Bank is hereby irrevocably authorized by the Borrower and each Qualified Borrower so to endorse its Note and to attach to and make a part of its Note a continuation of any such schedule as and when required.

If the Borrower or Qualified Borrower fails to deliver a timely Notice of Interest Rate Election to the Administrative Agent for any Group of Loans which are Euro-Dollar Loans, such Loans shall be converted into Base Rate Loans or, in the case of Euro-Dollar Loans denominated in an Alternate Currency, continued as a Euro-Dollar Loan with an Interest Period of one (1) month, on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto.

Each such optional prepayment shall be applied to prepay ratably the Loans of the several Banks included in such Group of Loans or Borrowing(or the Swingline Lender in the case of Swingline Loans) included in such Group of Loans or Borrowing.

Any such prepayment shall be

Each such optional prepayment shall be in the amounts set forth in Section 2.11(a) above and shall be applied to prepay ratably the Loans of the Banks included in any Group of Loans which are Euro-Dollar Loans (which Group of Loans shall be specified in the notice referred to above), except that any Euro-Dollar Loan which has been converted to a Base Rate Loan pursuant to Section 8.2, 8.3 or 8.4 hereof may be prepaid without ratable payment of the other Loans in such Group of Loans which have not been so converted.
          (c) The Borrower may, upon at least one (1) Business Day's notice to the Administrative Agent (by 11:00 a.m. Dallas time or local time to the principal financial center of the Alternate Currency in question, as applicable, on such Business Day), reimburse the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Fronting Bank for the amount of any drawing under a Letter of Credit in whole or in part in any amount.

          (f) Any amounts so prepaid pursuant to Section 2.11 (a), (b), (c) or (d) may be reborrowed except to the extent applied to repay any term Loans made in accordance with Section 2.1(b).

General Provisions as to Payments

The Administrative Agent will promptly (and if received prior to 12:00 noon, on the same Business Day, if received after 12:00 noon on the immediately following Business Day) distribute to each Bank its ratable share (or applicable share with respect to Money Market Loans) of each such payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of the Banks. If and to the extent that the Administrative Agent shall receive any such payment for the account of the Banks on or before 12:00 Noon (Dallas time or local time to the principal financial center of the Alternate Currency in question, as applicable) on any Business Day, and Administrative Agent shall not have distributed to any Bank its applicable share of such payment on such Business Day, Administrative Agent shall distribute such amount to such Bank together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount should have been distributed to such Bank until the date Administrative Agent distributes such amount to such Bank, at the Federal Funds Rate. Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on the Base Rate Loans or Swingline Loans or of fees shall be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day. Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Euro-Dollar Loans shall be due on a day which is not a Euro-Dollar Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Euro-Dollar Business Day unless such Euro-Dollar Business Day falls in another calendar month, in which case the date for payment thereof shall be the next preceding Euro-Dollar Business Day. Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Money Market Loans shall be due on a day which is not a Euro-Dollar Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Euro-Dollar Business Day. If the date for any payment of principal is extended by operation of law or otherwise, interest thereon shall be payable for such extended time.
          (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Banks hereunder that the Borrower or Qualified Borrower, as the case may be, will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower or Qualified Borrower, as the case may be, has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Bank on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Bank. If and to the extent that the Borrower or Qualified Borrower, as the case may be, shall not have so made such payment, each Bank shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Bank together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Bank until the date such Bank repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.
          (c) If any Bank shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.4, 2.12, 2.16, 2.18 or 9.3, then the Administrative Agent, notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, shall (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Bank for the benefit of the Administrative Agent,
 
the Swingline Lender or the Fronting Bank to satisfy such Bank's obligations to it under any such Section until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and/or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Bank under any such Section, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion.
     Section 2.13 . If the Borrower or a Qualified Borrower, as the case may be, makes any payment of principal with respect to any Euro-Dollar Loan or Money Market LIBOR Loan or Money Market Absolute Rate Loan (pursuant to Article II, VI or VIII or otherwise) on any day other than the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, or if the Borrower or a Qualified Borrower, as the case may be, fails to borrow, continue or convert to any Euro-Dollar Loans or Money Market LIBOR Loans or Money Market Absolute Rate Loans after notice has been given to any Bank in accordance with Section 2.2(a) or 2.6, or if Borrower or a Qualified Borrower, as the case may be, shall deliver a Notice of Interest Rate Election specifying that a Euro-Dollar Loan or Money Market LIBOR Loan or Money Market Absolute Rate Loan shall be converted on a date other than the first (1st) day of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto, the Borrower shall reimburse each Bank within 15 days after certification of such Bank of such loss or expense (which shall be delivered by each such Bank to Administrative Agent for delivery to Borrower) for any resulting loss or expense incurred by it (or by an existing Participant in the related Loan), including (without limitation) any loss incurred in obtaining, liquidating or employing deposits from third parties, but excluding loss of margin for the period after any such payment or failure to borrow, continue or convert, provided that such Bank shall have delivered to Administrative Agent and Administrative Agent shall have delivered to the Borrower a certification as to the amount of such loss or expense, which certification shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for and calculation of such loss or expense and shall be conclusive in the absence of demonstrable error. In addition, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the applicable Bank, any Mandatory Cost.

Computation of Interest and Fees

Letters of Credit
          (a) Subject to the terms contained in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, upon the receipt of a notice in accordance with Section 2.2(b) requesting the
 
issuance of a Letter of Credit, the Fronting Bank shall issue a Letter of Credit or Letters of Credit in such form as is reasonably acceptable to the Borrower or the Qualified Borrower and the Fronting Bank (subject to the provisions of Section 2.2(b)) in an amount or amounts equal to the amount or amounts requested by the Borrower; provided that, in the case of (i) Alternate Currency Letter(s) of Credit, the Fronting Bank shall issue the same in the Alternate Currency requested and (ii) Dollar Letter(s) of Credit, the Fronting Bank shall issue the same in Dollars. Unless otherwise specified herein, the amount of a Letter of Credit at any time shall be deemed to be the Dollar Equivalent Amount of the stated amount of such Letter of Credit in effect at such time.
          (b) It is hereby acknowledged and agreed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and all the Banks party hereto that on the Closing Date, the letters of credit previously issued by Bank of America, N.A., and U.S. Bank National Association as "Fronting Bank" under the Existing Revolving Credit Agreement, as well as by Bank of America, N.A. under a separate letter of credit facility, and more particularly set forth on hereto, shall be transferred to this Agreement and shall be deemed to be Letters of Credit hereunder.
Schedule 2.16
          (c) The Letter of Credit Usage shall be no more than Five Hundred Million Dollars ($500,000,000) at any one time (and in the case of Alternate Currency Letters of Credit, no more than the Dollar Equivalent Amount of the Alternate Currency Sublimit).
          (d) Intentionally Omitted.
          (e) In the event of any request for a drawing under any Letter of Credit by the beneficiary thereunder, the Fronting Bank shall notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (and the Administrative Agent shall notify each Bank thereof) on or before the date on which the Fronting Bank intends to honor such drawing, and, except as provided in this subsection (e), the Borrower shall reimburse the Fronting Bank, in immediately available funds, on the same day on which such drawing is honored in the Dollar Equivalent Amount of such drawing. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, however, unless the Borrower shall have notified the Administrative Agent, and the Fronting Bank prior to 11:00 a.m. (Dallas time) on the Business Day immediately prior to the date of such drawing that the Borrower intends to reimburse the Fronting Bank for the amount of such drawing with funds other than the proceeds of the Loans, the Borrower shall be deemed to have timely given a Notice of Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.2 to the Administrative Agent, requesting a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans on the date on which such drawing is honored and in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing. Each Bank (other than the Fronting Bank) shall, in accordance with Section 2.4(b), make available its Pro Rata Share of such Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, the proceeds of which shall be applied directly by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Fronting Bank for the amount of such draw. In the event that any such Bank fails to make available to the Fronting Bank the amount of such Bank's participation on the date of a drawing, the Fronting Bank shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Bank together with interest at the Federal Funds Rate commencing on the date such drawing is honored, and the provisions of Section 9.16 shall otherwise apply to such failure.
          (f) If, after the date hereof, any change in any law or regulation or in the interpretation thereof by any court or administrative or Governmental Authority charged with the
 
administration thereof shall either (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against letters of credit issued by, or assets held by, or deposits in or for the account of, or participations in any letter of credit, upon any Bank (including the Fronting Bank) or (ii) impose on any Bank any other condition regarding this Agreement or such Bank (including the Fronting Bank) as it pertains to the Letters of Credit or any participation therein and the result of any event referred to in the preceding clause (i) or (ii) shall be to increase, by an amount deemed by the Fronting Bank or such Bank to be material, the cost to the Fronting Bank or any Bank of issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or participating therein (excluding any costs already reflected in any Mandatory Cost), then the Borrower shall pay to the Fronting Bank or such Bank, within 15 days after written demand by such Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), which demand shall be accompanied by a certificate showing, in reasonable detail, the calculation of such amount or amounts, such additional amounts as shall be required to compensate the Fronting Bank or such Bank for such increased costs or reduction in amounts received or receivable hereunder. Each Bank will promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle such Bank to compensation pursuant to this Section 2.16 and will designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the reasonable judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. If such Bank shall fail to notify Borrower of any such event within 90 days following the end of the month during which such event occurred, then Borrower's liability for any amounts described in this Section incurred by such Bank as a result of such event shall be limited to those attributable to the period occurring subsequent to the ninetieth (90th) day prior to the date upon which such Bank actually notified Borrower of the occurrence of such event. A certificate of any Bank claiming compensation under this Section 2.16 and setting forth a reasonably detailed calculation of the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of demonstrable error. In determining such amount, such Bank may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.
          (g) The Borrower hereby agrees to protect, indemnify, pay and save harmless the Fronting Bank and the Banks from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, charges and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements) which the Fronting Bank or any Bank may incur or be subject to as a result of (i) the issuance of the Letters of Credit, other than to the extent of the bad faith, gross negligence or wilful misconduct of the Fronting Bank or (ii) the failure of the Fronting Bank to honor a drawing under any Letter of Credit as a result of any act or omission, whether rightful or wrongful, of any present or future or government or Governmental Authority, including by reason of court order (collectively, ""), other than to the extent of the bad faith, gross negligence or wilful misconduct of the Fronting Bank. As between the Borrower and the Fronting Bank and each Bank, the Borrower assumes all risks of the acts and omissions of any beneficiary with respect to its use, or misuses of, the Letters of Credit issued by the Fronting Bank. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Fronting Bank and the Banks shall not be responsible (i) for the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any document submitted by any party in connection with the application for and issuance of any Letter of Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged; (ii) for the validity or insufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be
de
jure
de
facto
Governmental Acts
 
invalid or ineffective for any reason; (iii) for failure of the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit to comply fully with conditions required in order to draw upon such Letter of Credit, other than as a result of the bad faith, gross negligence or wilful misconduct of the Fronting Bank; (iv) for errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any message, by mail, cable, telegraph, facsimile transmission, or otherwise; (v) for errors in interpretation of any technical terms; (vi) for any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any documents required in order to make a drawing under any Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof; (vii) for the misapplication by the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of the proceeds of such Letter of Credit; or (viii) for any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Fronting Bank or any Bank, including any Government Acts, in each case other than to the extent of the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Fronting Bank. None of the above shall affect, impair or prevent the vesting of the Fronting Bank's or any Bank's rights and powers hereunder. In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of the specific provisions hereinabove set forth, any action taken or omitted by the Fronting Bank under or in connection with the Letters of Credit issued by it or the related certificates, if taken or omitted in good faith, shall not put the Fronting Bank or any Bank under any resulting liability to the Borrower; provided that, notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, the Fronting Bank will be liable to the Borrower for any damages suffered by the Borrower or its Subsidiaries as a result of the Fronting Bank's grossly negligent or wilful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it of a sight draft and certificates strictly in compliance with the terms and conditions of the Letter of Credit, except as a result of any court order.
          (h) If the Fronting Bank or the Administrative Agent is required at any time, pursuant to any bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation or reorganization law or otherwise, to return to the Borrower any reimbursement by the Borrower of any drawing under any Letter of Credit, each Bank shall pay to the Fronting Bank or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, its Pro Rata Share of such payment, but without interest thereon unless the Fronting Bank or the Administrative Agent is required to pay interest on such amounts to the person recovering such payment, in which case with interest thereon, computed at the same rate, and on the same basis, as the interest that the Fronting Bank or the Administrative Agent is required to pay.

Special Provisions Regarding Alternate Currency Loans
          (a) Upon the occurrence of a Sharing Event, automatically (and without the taking of any action) (x) all then outstanding Euro-Dollar Loans denominated in an Alternate Currency shall be automatically converted into Base Rate Loans denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent Amount of the aggregate principal amount of the applicable Euro-Dollar Loans on the date such Sharing Event first occurred, which Loans denominated in Dollars (i) shall thereafter continue to be deemed to be Base Rate Loans and (ii) unless such Sharing Event resulted solely from a termination of the Commitments, shall be immediately due and payable on the date such Sharing Event has occurred) and (y) unless such Sharing Event resulted solely from a termination of the Commitments, all accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts owing with respect to such Loans shall be immediately due and payable in Dollars, using the Dollar Equivalent Amount of such accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts.
          (b) Upon the occurrence of a Sharing Event, and after giving effect to any automatic conversion pursuant to Section 2.20(a), each Bank shall (and hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees to) purchase and sell (in each case in Dollars) undivided participating interests in all Committed Loans outstanding to, and any unpaid Letter of Credit Usage owing by, the Borrower and the Qualified Borrowers in such amounts so that each Bank shall have a share of such outstanding Loans and unpaid Letter of Credit Usage then owing by the Borrower and the Qualified Borrowers equal to its Pro Rata Share of the Commitments (although if because of fluctuations in currency exchange rates any Bank would be required to purchase such participations after giving effect to which such Bank's allocated share of all Committed Loans and Letter of Credit Usage (including participations therein purchased pursuant to this Section 2.20) would exceed the Dollar Equivalent Amount of such Bank's Dollar Commitment and Alternate Currency Commitment, then such participations shall be in an amount after giving effect to which such Bank's allocated share of all Committed Loans and Letter of Credit Usage (including participations therein purchased pursuant to this Section 2.20) would equal the Dollar Equivalent Amount of such Bank's Dollar Commitment and Alternate Currency Commitment). Upon any such occurrence, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Bank and shall specify the amount of dollars required from such Bank in order to effect the purchases and sales by the various Banks of participating interests in the amounts required above (together with accrued
 
interest with respect to the period from the last interest payment date through the date of the Sharing Event plus any additional amounts payable by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.20 in respect of such accrued but unpaid interest); provided, in the event that a Sharing Event shall have occurred, each Bank shall be deemed to have purchased, automatically and without request, such participating interests. Promptly upon receipt of such request, each Bank shall deliver to the Administrative Agent (in immediately available funds in Dollars) the net amounts as specified by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall promptly deliver the amounts so received to the various Banks in such amounts as are needed to effect the purchases and sales of participations as provided above. Promptly following receipt thereof, each Bank which has sold participations in any of its Loans (through the Administrative Agent) will deliver to each Bank (through the Administrative Agent) which has so purchased a participating interest a participation certificate dated the date of receipt of such funds and in such amount. It is understood that the amount of funds delivered by each Bank shall be calculated on a net basis, giving effect to both the sales and purchases of participations by the various Banks as required above.
          (c) Upon the occurrence of a Sharing Event (i) no further Loans shall be made, (ii) all amounts from time to time accruing with respect to, and all amounts from time to time payable on account of, any outstanding Euro-Dollar Loans initially denominated in an Alternate Currency (including, without limitation, any interest and other amounts which were accrued but unpaid on the date of such purchase) shall be payable in Dollars as if such Euro-Dollar Loans had originally been made in Dollars and shall be distributed by the relevant Banks (or their Affiliates) to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Banks which made such Loans or are participating therein and (iii) the Commitments of the Banks shall be automatically terminated. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above, the failure of any Bank to purchase its participating interest in any Committed Loans upon the occurrence of a Sharing Event shall not relieve any other Bank of its obligation hereunder to purchase its participating interests in a timely manner, but no Bank shall be responsible for the failure of any other Bank to purchase the participating interest to be purchased by such other Bank on any date.
          (d) If any amount required to be paid by any Bank pursuant to Section 2.20(b) is not paid to the Administrative Agent within one (1) Business Day following the date upon which such Bank receives notice from the Administrative Agent of the amount of its participations required to be purchased pursuant to said Section 2.20(b), such Bank shall also pay to the Administrative Agent on demand an amount equal to the product of (i) the amount so required to be paid by such Bank for the purchase of its participations times (ii) the daily average Federal Funds Rate during the period from and including the date of request for payment to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Administrative Agent times (iii) a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days that elapsed during such period and the denominator of which is 360. If any such amount required to be paid by any Bank pursuant to Section 2.20(b) is not in fact made available to the Administrative Agent within three (3) Business Days following the date upon which such Bank receives notice from the Administrative Agent as to the amount of participations required to be purchased by it, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover from such Bank on demand, such amount with interest thereon calculated from such request date at the rate per annum applicable to Base Rate Loans hereunder. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Bank with respect to any amounts payable by any Bank pursuant to this Section 2.20 shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest
 
error and the amount reflected therein shall be paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of the relevant Banks; provided that, if the Administrative Agent (in its sole discretion) has elected to fund on behalf of such Bank the amounts owing to such Banks, then the amounts shall be paid to the Administrative Agent for its own account.
          (e) Whenever, at any time after the relevant Banks have received from any Banks purchases of participations in any Committed Loans pursuant to this Section 2.20, the Banks receive any payment on account thereof, such Banks will distribute to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the various Banks participating therein, such Banks' participating interests in such amounts (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such participations were outstanding) in like funds as received; provided, however, that in the event that such payment received by any Banks are required to be returned, the Banks who received previous distributions in respect of their participating interests therein will return to the respective Banks any portion thereof previously so distributed to them in like funds as such payment is required to be returned by the respective Banks.
          (f) Each Bank's obligation to purchase participating interests pursuant to this Section 2.20 shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance including, without limitation, (a) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Bank may have against any other Bank, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (b) the occurrence or continuance of an Event of Default, (c) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower or any other Person, (d) any breach of this Agreement by the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or any Bank or any other Person, or (e) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.
          (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement, upon any purchase of participations as required above, each Bank which has purchased such participations shall be entitled to receive from the Borrower any increased costs and indemnities directly from the Borrower to the same extent as if it were the direct Bank as opposed to a participant therein. The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that, upon the occurrence of a Sharing Event and after giving effect to the requirements of this Section 2.20, increased Taxes may be owing by the Borrower pursuant to Section 8.4, which Taxes shall be paid (to the extent provided in Section 8.4) by the Borrower, without any claim that the increased Taxes are not payable because same resulted from the participations effected as otherwise required by this Section 2.20.

          (b) If the Borrower shall designate as a Qualified Borrower hereunder any entity not organized under the laws of the United States or any State thereof, any Bank may, with notice to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, fulfill its Commitment by causing an affiliate of such Bank to act as the Bank in respect of such Qualified Borrower (and such Bank shall, to the extent of Loans made to, and participations in Letters of Credit issued for the account of, such Qualified Borrower be deemed for all purposes hereof to have pro tanto assigned such Loans and participations to such affiliate in compliance with the provisions of Section 9.6 (but only for so long as such Loans or Letters of Credit shall be outstanding) except that unless such an affiliate is a Qualified Institution, nothing herein shall be deemed to have relieved such Bank from its obligations under its Commitments).

     Section 4.5 . Except as previously disclosed by the Borrower in writing to the Banks prior to the date hereof, there is no action, suit or proceeding pending against, or to the knowledge of the Borrower threatened against or affecting, nor, to the knowledge of the Borrower, any investigation of, (i) the Borrower, any Qualified Borrower, EQR or any of their Consolidated Subsidiaries, (ii) the Loan Documents or any of the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents or (iii) any of their assets, before any court or arbitrator or any governmental body, agency or official in which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse decision which could, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect or which in any manner draws into question the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.
Litigation
     Section 4.6 . The transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents will not constitute a nonexempt prohibited transaction (as such term is defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA) that could subject the Administrative Agent or the Banks to any tax or penalty for prohibited transactions imposed under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA.
Compliance with ERISA
     Section 4.7 . The Borrower and EQR each conducts reviews of the effect of Environmental Laws on the business, operations and properties of the Borrower, EQR, Consolidated Subsidiaries of either or both, and Qualified Borrowers when necessary in the course of which it identifies and evaluates associated liabilities and costs (including, without limitation, any capital or operating expenditures required for clean-up or closure of properties presently owned, any capital or operating expenditures required to achieve or maintain compliance with environmental protection standards imposed by law or as a condition of any license, permit or contract, any related constraints on operating activities, and any actual or potential liabilities to third parties, including employees, and any related costs and expenses).

The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of the Borrower, any Qualified Borrower, EQR and their Consolidated Subsidiaries in respect of taxes or other governmental charges are, in the opinion of the Borrower, adequate.
Taxes
 
     Section 4.9 .

To the Borrower's knowledge, the Borrower, each Qualified Borrower, and each of the Real Property Assets are in compliance with all laws, rules, regulations, orders, judgments, writs and decrees, including, without limitation, all building and zoning ordinances and codes, the failure to comply with which is likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

Consents and Approvals
Bank Reply Period
     Section 8.1 . If on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period for any Euro-Dollar Borrowing or Money Market LIBOR Loan:
Basis for Determining Interest Rate Inadequate or Unfair
          (a) the Administrative Agent determines in good faith that deposits in dollars (in the applicable amounts) are not being offered in the relevant market for such Interest Period, or
          (b) Banks having 50% or more of the aggregate amount of the applicable Commitments advise the Administrative Agent that the Euro-Dollar Rate, as determined by the
 
Administrative Agent will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to each such Bank of funding its Euro-Dollar Loans for such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Banks, whereupon until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligations of the Banks to make Euro-Dollar Loans shall be suspended. In such event, (a) unless the Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent at least two Business Days before the date of (i) any Euro-Dollar Borrowing denominated in Dollars for which a Notice of Borrowing has previously been given that it elects not to borrow on such date, such Borrowing shall instead be made as a Base Rate Borrowing, or (ii) any Money Market LIBOR Borrowing for which a Notice of Money Market Borrowing has previously been given, the Money Market LIBOR Loans comprising such Borrowing shall bear interest for each day from and including the first day to but excluding the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto at the Base Rate for such day, and (b) any Notice of Borrowing for a Euro-Dollar Borrowing denominated in an Alternate Currency shall be ineffective. For purposes of this Section 8.1(b), in determining whether the Euro-Dollar Rate, as determined by Administrative Agent, will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to any Bank of funding its Euro-Dollar Loans for such Interest Period, such determination will be based solely on the ability of such Bank to obtain matching funds in the London interbank market at a reasonably equivalent rate.
     Section 8.2 . If, on or after the date of this Agreement, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank (or its Euro-Dollar Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) made after the Closing Date of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency shall make it unlawful for any Bank (or its Euro-Dollar Lending Office) (x) to make, maintain or fund its Euro-Dollar Loans, or (y) to participate in any Letter of Credit issued by the Fronting Bank, or, with respect to the Fronting Bank, to issue any Letter of Credit, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the other Banks and the Borrower, whereupon until such Bank notifies the Borrower and the Administrative Agent that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligation of such Bank in case of the event described in clause (x) above to make Euro-Dollar Loans, or in the case of the event described in clause (y) above, to participate in any Letter of Credit issued by the Fronting Bank or, with respect to the Fronting Bank, to issue any Letter of Credit, shall be suspended. With respect to Euro-Dollar Loans, before giving any notice to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section, such Bank shall designate a different Euro-Dollar Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice and will not, in the judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. If such Bank shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain and fund any of its outstanding Euro-Dollar Loans to maturity and shall so specify in such notice, the Borrower or the applicable Qualified Borrower, as the case may be, shall be deemed to have delivered a Notice of Interest Rate Election and such Euro-Dollar Loan shall be converted as of such date to a Base Rate Loan (without payment of any amounts that Borrower or the applicable Qualified Borrower, as the case may be, would otherwise be obligated to pay pursuant to Section 2.13 with respect to Loans converted pursuant to this Section 8.2) in an equal principal amount from such Bank (on which interest and principal shall be payable contemporaneously with the related Euro-Dollar Loans of the other Banks), and such Bank shall make such a Base Rate Loan.
Illegality
 
          If, at any time, it shall be unlawful for any Bank to make, maintain or fund its Euro-Dollar Loans, the Borrower shall have the right, upon five (5) Business Day's notice to the Administrative Agent, to either (x) cause a bank, reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, to offer to purchase the Commitments of such Bank for an amount equal to such Bank's outstanding Loans and all amounts due such Bank hereunder (including, without limitation, interest, Facility Fees, Letter of Credit Fees and all amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.13), and to become a Bank hereunder, or obtain the agreement of one or more existing Banks to offer to purchase the Commitments of such Bank for such amount, which offer such Bank is hereby required to accept, or (y) to repay in full all Loans then outstanding of such Bank, together with interest thereon, Facility Fees, Letter of Credit Fees and all other amounts due such Bank hereunder (including, without limitation, amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.13), upon which event, such Bank's Commitment shall be deemed to be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.11(e). Any Bank subject to this paragraph shall retain the benefits of Sections 2.16(f), 2.16(g), 8.3, 8.4 and 9.3 for the period prior to such purchase or cancellation.
     Section 8.3 .

          (a) If, on or after (x) the date hereof in the case of Committed Loans made pursuant to Section 2.1, or (y) the date of the related Money Market Quote, in the case of any Money Market Loan, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) made after the Closing Date of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve (including, without limitation, any such requirement imposed by the Federal Reserve Board (but excluding with respect to any Euro-Dollar Loan any such requirement to the extent reflected in an applicable Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage)), special deposit, insurance assessment or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) or shall impose on any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) or on the London interbank market any other condition materially more burdensome in nature, extent or consequence than those in existence as of the Closing Date affecting such Bank's Euro-Dollar Loans, its Note, or its obligation to make Euro-Dollar Loans, and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) of making or maintaining any Euro-Dollar Loan, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) under this Agreement or under its Note with respect to such Euro-Dollar Loans, by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material (excluding any amounts already reflected in any Mandatory Costs), then, within 15 days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts (based upon a reasonable allocation thereof by such Bank to the Euro-Dollar Loans made by such Bank hereunder) as will compensate such Bank for such increased cost or reduction to the extent such Bank generally imposes such additional amounts on other borrowers of such Bank in similar circumstances.
          (b) If any Bank shall have reasonably determined that, after the date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change in any law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy or liquidity requirements, or any change
 
in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) made after the Closing Date of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on capital of such Bank (or its Parent) as a consequence of such Bank's obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Bank (or its Parent) could have achieved but for such adoption, change, request or directive (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount reasonably deemed by such Bank to be material, then from time to time, within 15 days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank (or its Parent) for such reduction to the extent such Bank generally imposes such additional amounts on other borrowers of such Bank in similar circumstances.
          (c) Each Bank will promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle such Bank to compensation pursuant to this Section and will designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the reasonable judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. If such Bank shall fail to notify Borrower of any such event within 90 days following the end of the month during which such event occurred, then Borrower's liability for any amounts described in this Section incurred by such Bank as a result of such event shall be limited to those attributable to the period occurring subsequent to the ninetieth (90th) day prior to the date upon which such Bank actually notified Borrower of the occurrence of such event. A certificate of any Bank claiming compensation under this Section and setting forth a reasonably detailed calculation of the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of demonstrable error. In determining such amount, such Bank may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.
          (d) If at any time, any Bank shall be owed amounts pursuant to this Section 8.3, the Borrower shall have the right, upon five (5) Business Day's notice to the Administrative Agent to either (x) cause a bank, reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, to offer to purchase the Commitments of such Bank for an amount equal to such Bank's outstanding Loans and all amounts due such Bank hereunder (including, without limitation, interest, Facility Fees, Letter of Credit Fees and all amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.13 and this Section 8.3), and to become a Bank hereunder, or to obtain the agreement of one or more existing Banks to offer to purchase the Commitments of such Bank for such amount, which offer such Bank is hereby required to accept, or (y) to repay in full all Loans then outstanding of such Bank, together with interest thereon, Facility Fees, Letter of Credit Fees and all other amounts due such Bank hereunder (including, without limitation, amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.13 and this Section 8.3), upon which event, such Bank's Commitment shall be deemed to be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.11(e). Any Bank subject to this Section 8.3(d) shall retain the benefits of Sections 2.16(f), 2.16(g), 8.3, 8.4 and 9.3 for the period prior to such purchase or cancellation.

This indemnification shall be made within 15 days from the date such Bank, the Fronting Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) makes demand therefor.
          (d) Each Bank organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this Agreement in the case of each Bank listed on the signature pages hereof and on or prior to the date on which it becomes a Bank in the case of each other Bank, shall provide the Borrower with an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, as appropriate, or any successor form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, and shall provide Borrower with two further copies of any such form or

          (e) For any period with respect to which a Bank has failed to provide the Borrower with the appropriate form pursuant to Section 8.4(d) (unless such failure is due to a change in treaty, law or regulation occurring subsequent to the date on which a form originally was required to be provided), such Bank shall not be entitled to indemnification under Section 8.4(c) with respect to Non-Excluded Taxes imposed by the United States; , , that should a Bank, which is otherwise exempt from or subject to a reduced rate of withholding tax, become subject to Non-Excluded Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required hereunder, the Borrower shall take such steps as such Bank shall reasonably request to assist such Bank to recover such Taxes so long as Borrower shall incur no cost or liability as a result thereof.

          (g) If the Borrower or any Qualified Borrower is required to pay additional amounts to or for the account of any Bank pursuant to this Section 8.4, then such Bank will change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office so as to eliminate or reduce any such additional payment which may thereafter accrue if such change, in the judgment of such Bank, is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank.
          (h) If, at any time, any Bank shall be owed amounts pursuant to this Section 8.4, the Borrower shall have the right, upon five (5) Business Day's notice to the Administrative Agent to either (x) cause a bank, reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, to offer to purchase the Commitments of such Bank for an amount equal to such Bank's outstanding Loans

               (c) if any Swingline Loans or Letters of Credit are outstanding at the time such Bank becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
(i) provided that no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be outstanding as of the date on which the applicable Bank becomes a Defaulting Lender, all or any part of the obligations of such Defaulting Lender under any such Swingline Loan or Letter of Credit shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Share but only to the extent the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders' outstanding Commitments (it being understood that under no circumstance shall any Bank at any time be liable for any amounts in excess of its Commitment) plus such Defaulting Lender's obligations under such Swingline Loans and Letters of Credit does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders' Commitments;
(ii) if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall within fifteen (15) Business Days following notice by the Administrative Agent (x) first, prepay such Defaulting Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Swingline Loans and (y) second, cash collateralize for the benefit of the Fronting Bank only the Borrower's obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lender's Pro Rata Share of all outstanding Letters of Credit (such Defaulting Lender's "") (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) (such Defaulting Lender's "") by paying to the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Fronting Bank, for deposit in the Letter of Credit Collateral Account, Letter of Credit Collateral in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent Amount of such Defaulting Lender's Collateralized LC Exposure. The Administrative Agent shall recalculate the Dollar Equivalent Amount applicable to such Defaulting Lender's Pro Rata Share of all Alternate Currency Letters of Credit monthly, as of the first Business Day of each month to the extent included in the calculation of such Defaulting Lender's Non-Reallocated Share. Interest shall accrue on such Letter of Credit Collateral in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.4. Such Letter of Credit Collateral shall be held and applied for the benefit of the Fronting Bank only and otherwise in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.4 for so long as such Letters of Credit are outstanding;
LC Exposure
Collateralized LC Exposure
(iii) if the Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.8(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Letters of Credit during the period such Defaulting Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Letters of Credit is cash collateralized;
(iv) if the LC Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then the fees payable to the Banks pursuant to Section 2.8(a) and Section 2.8(b) shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders' Pro Rata Shares; and
 
(v) if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lender's Pro Rata Share of all outstanding Letters of Credit is neither reallocated nor cash collateralized pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the Fronting Bank or any other Bank hereunder, all Facility Fees that otherwise would have been payable to such Defaulting Lender (solely with respect to the portion of such Defaulting Lender's Commitment that was utilized by such Letters of Credit) and Letter of Credit Fees payable under Section 2.8(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender's obligations under the Letters of Credit shall be payable to the Fronting Bank until and to the extent that such obligations under the Letters of Credit are reallocated and/or cash collateralized; and
(vi) so long as such Bank is a Defaulting Lender, the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan and the Fronting Bank shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related LC Exposure of the Defaulting Lender will be 100% covered by the Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateralized in accordance with Section 9.16(c)(ii), and participating interests in any newly made Swingline Loan or any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 9.16(c)(i) (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein).
               (d) In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Borrower, the Swingline Lender and the Fronting Bank each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Bank to be a Defaulting Lender, then the obligations under the Swingline Loan and the Letters of Credit of the Banks shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Bank's Commitment and on such date such Bank shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Banks (other than Money Market Loans and Swingline Loans) as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Bank to hold such Loans in accordance with its Pro Rata Share and all Letter of Credit Collateral deposited or then held with respect to such Bank's LC Exposure shall be delivered to the Borrower; provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Bank will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Bank's having been a Defaulting Lender.
               (e) If at any time any Bank becomes a Defaulting Lender, then until such time as such Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters required under and in accordance with Section 9.16(d), the Borrower shall have the right, upon five (5) Business Days' notice to the Administrative Agent to either (x) cause a bank, reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, to offer to purchase the Commitments of such Defaulting Lender for an amount equal to such Defaulting Lender's outstanding Loans (other than any Money Market Loans held by it), and to become a Bank hereunder, or to obtain the agreement of one or more existing Banks to offer to purchase the Commitments of such Defaulting Lender for such amount, which offer such Defaulting Lender is hereby required to accept, or (y) to repay in full all Loans then outstanding of such Defaulting Lender (excluding, at the option of the Borrower, any Money Market Loans held by it), together with interest and all other amounts due thereon, upon which event, such Defaulting Lender's Commitment shall be deemed to be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.11(e).
 
          (f) Nothing contained in this Section or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed to reduce the Commitment of any Bank or in any way affect the rights of Borrower with respect to any Defaulting Lender or, if the Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent. The status of any Bank as a Defaulting Lender shall not relieve any other Bank of its obligations to fund its Commitment or otherwise perform its obligations in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

Additional Cost Rate
Mandatory Cost
3. The Additional Cost Rate for any Bank lending from a Euro-Dollar Lending Office in a Participating Member State will be the percentage notified by that Bank to the Administrative Agent. This percentage will be certified by such Bank in its notice to the Administrative Agent to be its reasonable determination of the cost (expressed as a percentage of such Bank's participation in all Loans made from such Euro-Dollar Lending Office) of complying with the minimum reserve requirements of the European Central Bank in respect of Loans made from that Euro-Dollar Lending Office.
4. The Additional Cost Rate for any Bank lending from a Euro-Dollar Lending Office in the United Kingdom will be calculated by the Administrative Agent as follows:
     (a) in relation to any Loan in Pounds Sterling:
     (b) in relation to any Loan in Euros:
          Where:
          "A" is the percentage of Eligible Liabilities (assuming these to be in excess of any stated minimum) which that Bank is from time to time required to maintain as an interest free cash ratio deposit with the Bank of England to comply with cash ratio requirements.
 
          "B" is the percentage rate of interest (excluding the Applicable Margin, the Mandatory Cost and, in the case of interest charged at the Default Rate, without counting any increase in interest rate effected by the charging of the Default Rate) payable for the relevant Interest Period of such Loan.
          "C" is the percentage (if any) of Eligible Liabilities which that Bank is required from time to time to maintain as interest bearing Special Deposits with the Bank of England.
          "D" is the percentage rate per annum payable by the Bank of England to the Administrative Agent on interest bearing Special Deposits.
          "E" is designed to compensate Banks for amounts payable under the Fees Rules and is calculated by the Administrative Agent as being the average of the most recent rates of charge supplied by the Banks to the Administrative Agent pursuant to paragraph 7 below and expressed in pounds per 1,000,000.
5. For the purposes of this Schedule:
     (a) "" and "" have the meanings given to them from time to time under or pursuant to the Bank of England Act 1998 or (as may be appropriate) by the Bank of England;
Eligible Liabilities
Special Deposits
     (b) "" means the rules on periodic fees contained in the FSA Supervision Manual or such other law or regulation as may be in force from time to time in respect of the payment of fees for the acceptance of deposits;
Fees Rules
     (c) "s" means the fee tariffs specified in the Fees Rules under the activity group A.1 Deposit acceptors (ignoring any minimum fee or zero rated fee required pursuant to the Fees Rules but taking into account any applicable discount rate);
Fee Tariff
     (d) "" means each state so described in any legislative measures of the European Council for the introduction of, changeover to or operation of a single or unified European currency.
Participating Member State
     (e) "" has the meaning given to it in, and will be calculated in accordance with, the Fees Rules.
Tariff Base
6. In application of the above formulae, A, B, C and D will be included in the formulae as percentages (i.e. 5% will be included in the formula as 5 and not as 0.05). A negative result obtained by subtracting D from B shall be taken as zero. The resulting figures shall be rounded to four decimal places.
7. If requested by the Administrative Agent or the Borrower, each Bank with a Euro-Dollar Lending Office in the United Kingdom or a Participating Member State shall, as soon as practicable after publication by the Financial Services Authority, supply to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, the rate of charge payable by such Bank to the Financial Services Authority pursuant to the Fees Rules in respect of the relevant financial year of the Financial
 
Services Authority (calculated for this purpose by such Bank as being the average of the Fee Tariffs applicable to such Bank for that financial year) and expressed in pounds per 1,000,000 of the Tariff Base of such Bank.
8. Each Bank shall supply any information required by the Administrative Agent for the purpose of calculating its Additional Cost Rate. In particular, but without limitation, each Bank shall supply the following information in writing on or prior to the date on which it becomes a Bank:
     (a) the jurisdiction of the Euro-Dollar Lending Office out of which it is making available its participation in the relevant Loan; and
     (b) any other information that the Administrative Agent may reasonably require for such purpose.
Each Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent in writing of any change to the information provided by it pursuant to this paragraph.
9. The percentages of each Bank for the purpose of A and C above and the rates of charge of each Bank for the purpose of E above shall be determined by the Administrative Agent based upon the information supplied to it pursuant to paragraphs 7 and 8 above and on the assumption that, unless a Bank notifies the Administrative Agent to the contrary, each Bank's obligations in relation to cash ratio deposits and Special Deposits are the same as those of a typical bank from its jurisdiction of incorporation with a Euro-Dollar Lending Office in the same jurisdiction as its Euro-Dollar Lending Office.
10. The Administrative Agent shall have no liability to any Person if such determination results in an Additional Cost Rate which over- or under-compensates any Bank and shall be entitled to assume that the information provided by any Bank pursuant to paragraphs 3, 7 and 8 above is true and correct in all respects.
11. The Administrative Agent shall distribute the additional amounts received as a result of the Mandatory Cost to the Banks on the basis of the Additional Cost Rate for each Bank based on the information provided by each Bank pursuant to paragraphs 3, 7 and 8 above.
12. Any determination by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Schedule in relation to a formula, the Mandatory Cost, an Additional Cost Rate or any amount payable to a Bank shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on all parties hereto.
13. The Administrative Agent may from time to time, after consultation with the Borrower and the Banks, reasonably and in good faith, determine and notify to all parties any amendments which are required to be made to this Schedule in order to comply with any change in law, regulation or any requirements from time to time imposed by the Bank of England, the Financial Services Authority or the European Central Bank (or, in any case, any other authority which replaces all or any of its functions), it being understood that any such proposed amendment shall be subject to the Borrower's reasonable agreement as to the necessity thereof.
 
14. If the Borrower or any Qualified Borrower is required to pay additional amounts to or for the account of any Bank pursuant to this Schedule, then such Bank will change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office so as to eliminate or reduce any such additional payment which may thereafter accrue if such change, in the judgment of such Bank, is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank.
15. The Borrower and/or any Qualified Borrower shall be required to pay any Mandatory Cost only to the extent that the Administrative Agent and/or the applicable Bank generally imposes such Mandatory Cost on other borrowers of such Bank in similar circumstances.
16. For any Interest Period with respect to which the Administrative Agent has failed to calculate Mandatory Costs within thirty (30) days after the commencement thereof,, the Borrower shall have no liability to pay such Mandatory Costs for such Interest Period.

          WHEREAS, the Banks have agreed to make loans (hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Loans") and otherwise extend credit to Borrower in an aggregate principal amount the Dollar Equivalent Amount of which is not to exceed $1,250,000,000 (which amount may be increased to an amount not to exceed $1,750,000,000);
          WHEREAS, the Loans will be evidenced by certain promissory notes (the "Notes") of Borrower made to each of the Banks in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement;
          WHEREAS, the Credit Agreement and the Notes and any other documents executed in connection therewith are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Loan Documents";
          WHEREAS, capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Credit Agreement;
          WHEREAS, Guarantor is a limited partnership which, except for certain preference units, is wholly-owned (directly and indirectly) by Borrower; and
          WHEREAS, in order further to induce the Administrative Agent and the Banks to enter into the Loan Documents, Guarantor has agreed to enter into this Guaranty;
 
          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the benefits to be derived from the making of the Loans and other extensions of credit under the Credit Agreement by the Banks to Borrower, and in order to induce the Administrative Agent and the Banks to enter into the Loan Documents, Guarantor hereby agrees as follows:
          1. Guarantor, on behalf of itself and its successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably, absolutely and unconditionally guarantees the full and punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity or otherwise, of all Obligations of Borrower now or hereafter existing under the Notes and the Credit Agreement, for principal and/or interest as well as any and all other amounts due thereunder, including, without limitation, all indemnity obligations of Borrower thereunder, and any and all reasonable costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements) incurred by the Administrative Agent or the Banks in enforcing its or their rights under this Guaranty (all of the foregoing obligations being the "Guaranteed Obligations").
          2. It is agreed that the Guaranteed Obligations are primary and this Guaranty shall be enforceable against Guarantor and its successors and assigns without the necessity for any suit or proceeding of any kind or nature whatsoever brought by the Administrative Agent or any Bank against Borrower or its respective successors or assigns or any other party or against any security for the payment and performance of the Guaranteed Obligations and without the necessity of any notice of nonpayment or nonobservance or of any notice of acceptance of this Guaranty or of any notice or demand to which Guarantor might otherwise be entitled (including, without limitation, diligence, presentment, notice of the incurrence of any Guaranteed Obligation, maturity, extension of time, change in nature or form of the Guaranteed Obligations, acceptance of further security, release of further security, imposition or agreement arrived at as to the amount of or the terms of the Guaranteed Obligations, notice of adverse change in Borrower's financial condition and any other fact which might materially increase the risk to Guarantor), all of which Guarantor hereby expressly waives; and Guarantor hereby expressly agrees that the validity of this Guaranty and the obligations of Guarantor hereunder shall in no way be terminated, affected, diminished, modified or impaired by reason of the assertion of or the failure to assert by the Administrative Agent or any Bank against Borrower or its respective successors or assigns, any of the rights or remedies reserved to the Administrative Agent and the Banks pursuant to the provisions of the Loan Documents. Guarantor agrees that any notice or directive given at any time to the Administrative Agent which is inconsistent with the waiver in the immediately preceding sentence shall be void and may be ignored by the Administrative Agent and the Banks, and, in addition, may not be pleaded or introduced as evidence in any litigation relating to this Guaranty for the reason that such pleading or introduction would be at variance with the written terms of this Guaranty, unless the Administrative Agent and the Banks have specifically agreed otherwise in a writing, signed by a duly authorized officer. Guarantor specifically acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing waivers are of the essence of this transaction and that, but for this Guaranty and such waivers, the Administrative Agent and the Banks would decline to execute the Loan Documents.
          3. Guarantor waives, and covenants and agrees that it will not at any time insist upon, plead or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any and all appraisal, valuation, stay, extension, marshalling of assets or redemption laws, or right of
 
homestead or exemption, whether now or at any time hereafter in force, which may delay, prevent or otherwise affect the performance by Guarantor of its obligations under, or the enforcement by the Administrative Agent of, this Guaranty. Guarantor further covenants and agrees not to set up or claim any defense, counterclaim, offset, setoff or other objection of any kind to any action, suit or proceeding at law, in equity or otherwise, or to any demand or claim that may be instituted or made by the Administrative Agent other than the defense of the actual timely payment and performance by Borrower of the Guaranteed Obligations; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not be deemed a waiver of Guarantor's right to assert any compulsory counterclaim, if such counterclaim is compelled under local law or rule of procedure, nor shall the foregoing be deemed a waiver of Guarantor's right to assert any claim which would constitute a defense, setoff, counterclaim or crossclaim of any nature whatsoever against Administrative Agent or any Bank in any separate action or proceeding. Guarantor represents, warrants and agrees that, as of the date hereof, its obligations under this Guaranty are not subject to any counterclaims, offsets or defenses against the Administrative Agent or any Bank of any kind.
          4. The provisions of this Guaranty are for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Banks and their successors and permitted assigns, and nothing herein contained shall impair as between Borrower or Guarantor and the Administrative Agent and the Banks the obligations of Borrower and Guarantor under the Loan Documents.
          5. This Guaranty shall be a continuing, irrevocable, unconditional and absolute guaranty and the liability of Guarantor hereunder shall in no way be terminated, affected, modified, impaired or diminished by reason of the happening, from time to time, of any of the following, although without notice or the further consent of Guarantor:
     (a) any assignment, amendment, modification or waiver of or change in any of the terms, covenants, conditions or provisions of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or the Loan Documents or the invalidity or unenforceability of any of the foregoing; or
     (b) any extension of time that may be granted by the Administrative Agent or any Bank to Borrower, any guarantor, or their respective successors or assigns, heirs, executors, administrators or personal representatives; or
     (c) any action which the Administrative Agent or any Bank may take or fail to take under or in respect of any of the Loan Documents or by reason of any waiver of, or failure to enforce, any of the rights, remedies, powers or privileges available to the Administrative Agent and the Banks under this Guaranty or available to the Administrative Agent and the Banks at law, in equity or otherwise, or any action on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Bank granting indulgence or extension in any form whatsoever; or
     (d) any sale, exchange, release, or other disposition of any property pledged, mortgaged or conveyed, or any property in which the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks have been granted a lien or security interest to secure any indebtedness of
 
Borrower to the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks or any impairment of or failure to perfect any security interest therein; or
     (e) any release of any person or entity who may be liable in any manner for the payment and collection of any amounts owed by Borrower to the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks; or
     (f) the application of any sums by whomsoever paid or however realized to any amounts owing by Borrower to the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks under the Loan Documents in such manner as the Administrative Agent shall determine in its sole discretion; or
     (g) Borrower's or any guarantor's voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, sale of all or substantially all of their respective assets and liabilities, appointment of a trustee, receiver, liquidator, sequestrator or conservator for all or any part of Borrower's or any guarantor's assets, insolvency, bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors, reorganization, arrangement, composition or readjustment, or the commencement of other similar proceedings affecting Borrower or any guarantor or any of the assets of any of them, including, without limitation, (i) the release or discharge of Borrower or any guarantor from the payment and performance of their respective obligations under any of the Loan Documents by operation of law, or (ii) the impairment, limitation or modification of the liability of Borrower or any guarantor in bankruptcy, or of any remedy for the enforcement of the Guaranteed Obligations under any of the Loan Documents, or Guarantor's liability under this Guaranty, resulting from the operation of any present or future provisions of the Bankruptcy Code or other present or future federal, state or applicable statute or law or from the decision in any court; or
     (h) any improper disposition by Borrower of the proceeds of the Loans, it being acknowledged by Guarantor that the Administrative Agent or any Bank shall be entitled to honor any request made by Borrower for a disbursement of such proceeds and that neither the Administrative Agent nor any Bank shall have any obligation to see to the proper disposition by Borrower of such proceeds.
          6. Guarantor agrees that if at any time all or any part of any payment at any time received by the Administrative Agent or any Bank from Borrower or Guarantor or any other Person obligated in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations under or with respect to this Guaranty is or must be rescinded or returned by the Administrative Agent or any Bank for any reason whatsoever (including, without limitation, the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of Borrower or Guarantor or such other Person), then Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall, to the extent of the payment rescinded or returned, be deemed to have continued in existence notwithstanding such previous receipt by such party, and Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, as to such payment, as though such previous payment had never been made.
          7. Until this Guaranty is terminated pursuant to the terms hereof, Guarantor (i) shall have no right of subrogation against Borrower or any entity comprising same by reason
 
of any payments or acts of performance by Guarantor in compliance with the obligations of Guarantor hereunder; (ii) waives any right to enforce any remedy which Guarantor now or hereafter shall have against Borrower or any entity comprising same by reason of any one or more payments or acts of performance in compliance with the obligations of Guarantor hereunder and (iii) from and after an Event of Default, subordinates any liability or indebtedness of Borrower or any entity comprising same now or hereafter held by Guarantor or any affiliate of Guarantor to the obligations of Borrower under the Loan Documents.
          8. Guarantor represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and the Banks with the knowledge that the Administrative Agent and the Banks are relying upon the same, as follows:
     (a) as of the date hereof, Guarantor is a limited partnership which, except for certain preference units, is wholly-owned (directly and indirectly) by Borrower;
     (b) based upon such relationship, Guarantor has determined that it is in its best interests to enter into this Guaranty;
     (c) this Guaranty is necessary and convenient to the conduct, promotion and attainment of Guarantor's business, and is in furtherance of Guarantor's business purposes;
     (d) the benefits to be derived by Guarantor from Borrower's access to funds and other credit made possible by the Loan Documents are at least equal to the obligations undertaken pursuant to this Guaranty;
     (e) Guarantor is solvent and has full power and legal right to enter into this Guaranty and to perform its obligations under the terms hereof and (i) Guarantor is organized and validly existing under the laws of the State of Ohio, (ii) Guarantor has complied with all provisions of applicable law in connection with all aspects of this Guaranty, and (iii) the person executing this Guaranty has all the requisite power and authority to execute and deliver this Guaranty;
     (f) to the best of Guarantor's knowledge, there is no action, suit, proceeding, or investigation pending or threatened against or affecting Guarantor at law, in equity, in admiralty or before any arbitrator or any governmental department, commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality (domestic or foreign) which is likely to materially and adversely affect the property, assets or condition (financial or otherwise) of Guarantor or which is likely to materially and adversely impair the ability of Guarantor to perform its obligations under this Guaranty;
     (g) the execution and delivery of and the performance by Guarantor of its obligations under this Guaranty have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of Guarantor and do not (i) violate any provision of any law, rule, regulation (including, without limitation, Regulation U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States), order, writ, judgment, decree,
 
determination or award presently in effect having applicability to Guarantor or the organizational documents of Guarantor, the consequences of which violation would materially and adversely affect the property, assets or condition (financial or otherwise) of Guarantor or which is likely to materially and adversely impair the ability of Guarantor to perform its obligations under this Guaranty or (ii) violate or conflict with, result in a breach of or constitute (with due notice or lapse of time or both) a default under any indenture, agreement or other instrument to which Guarantor is a party, or by which Guarantor or any of its property is bound, the consequences of which violation, conflict, breach or default would materially and adversely affect the property, assets or condition (financial or otherwise) of Guarantor or which is likely to materially and adversely impair the ability of Guarantor to perform its obligations under this Guaranty;
     (h) this Guaranty has been duly executed by Guarantor and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Guarantor, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms except as enforceability may be limited by applicable insolvency, bankruptcy or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally or general principles of equity, whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law;
     (i) no authorization, consent, approval, license or formal exemption from, nor any filing, declaration or registration with, any Federal, state, local or foreign court, governmental agency or regulatory authority is required in connection with the making and performance by Guarantor of this Guaranty, except those which have already been obtained;

     (k) Guarantor is not engaged principally, or as one of its important activities, in the business of purchasing, carrying, or extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any margin stock (within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States).
          9. Guarantor and the Administrative Agent each acknowledge and agree that this Guaranty is a guarantee of payment and performance and not of collection and enforcement in respect of any obligations which may accrue to the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks from Borrower under the provisions of any Loan Document.
          10. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, and in conjunction therewith, the Administrative Agent or any Bank may assign any or all of its rights under this Guaranty. In the event of any such assignment, the Administrative Agent shall give Guarantor prompt notice of same. If the Administrative Agent or any Bank elects to sell all the Loans or participations in the Loans and the Loan Documents, including this Guaranty, the Administrative Agent or any Bank may forward to each purchaser and prospective purchaser all documents and information relating to this Guaranty or to Guarantor, whether furnished by
 
Borrower or Guarantor or otherwise, subject to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement.
          11. Guarantor agrees, upon the written request of the Administrative Agent, to execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent, from time to time, any modification or amendment hereto or any additional instruments or documents reasonably considered necessary by the Administrative Agent or its counsel to cause this Guaranty to be, become or remain valid and effective in accordance with its terms, provided, that any such modification, amendment, additional instrument or document shall not increase Guarantor's obligations or diminish its rights hereunder and shall be reasonably satisfactory as to form to Guarantor and to Guarantor's counsel.
          12. The representations and warranties of Guarantor set forth in this Guaranty shall survive until this Guaranty shall terminate in accordance with the terms hereof.
          13. This Guaranty contains the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements relating to such subject matter and may not be modified, amended, supplemented or discharged except by a written agreement signed by Guarantor and the Administrative Agent (acting with the requisite consent of the Banks as provided in the Credit Agreement).
          14. If all or any portion of any provision contained in this Guaranty shall be determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect for any reason, such provision or portion thereof shall be deemed stricken and severed from this Guaranty and the remaining provisions and portions thereof shall continue in full force and effect.
          15. This Guaranty may be executed in counterparts which together shall constitute the same instrument.
          16. All notices, requests and other communications to any party hereunder shall be in writing (including bank wire, facsimile transmission followed by telephonic confirmation or similar writing) and shall be addressed to such party at the address set forth below or to such other address as may be identified by any party in a written notice to the others:
 
          Each such notice, request or other communication shall be effective (i) if given by facsimile transmission, when such facsimile is transmitted to the facsimile number specified in this Section and the appropriate facsimile confirmation is received, (ii) if given by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, with first class postage prepaid, addressed as aforesaid, upon receipt or refusal to accept delivery, (iii) if given by a nationally recognized overnight carrier, 24 hours after such communication is deposited with such carrier with postage prepaid for next day delivery, or (iv) if given by any other means, when delivered at the address specified in this Section.
          17. Any acknowledgment or new promise, whether by payment of principal or interest or otherwise by Borrower or Guarantor, with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations shall, if the statute of limitations in favor of Guarantor against the Administrative Agent and the Banks shall have commenced to run, toll the running of such statute of limitations, and if the period of such statute of limitations shall have expired, prevent the operation of such statute of limitations.
          18. This Guaranty shall be binding upon Guarantor and its successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Banks and their successors and permitted assigns; provided, however, that Guarantor may not assign or transfer
 
any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of all of the Banks, and any such attempted assignment or transfer without such consent shall be null and void.
          19. The failure of the Administrative Agent to enforce any right or remedy hereunder, or promptly to enforce any such right or remedy, shall not constitute a waiver thereof, nor give rise to any estoppel against the Administrative Agent or any Bank, nor excuse Guarantor from its obligations hereunder. Any waiver of any such right or remedy to be enforceable against the Administrative Agent and the Banks must be expressly set forth in a writing signed by the Administrative Agent (acting with the requisite consent of the Banks as provided in the Credit Agreement).
          20. (a) THIS GUARANTY AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS.
               (b) Any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Guaranty and any action for enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof may be brought in the courts of the State of Illinois or of the United States of America for the Northern District of Illinois, and, by execution and delivery of this Guaranty, the Guarantor hereby accepts for itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and appellate courts from any thereof. The Guarantor irrevocably consents to the service of process out of any of the aforementioned courts in any such action or proceeding by the mailing of copies thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to the Guarantor at its address for notices set forth herein. The Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any of the aforesaid actions or proceedings arising out of or in connection with this Guaranty brought in the courts referred to above and hereby further irrevocably waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Nothing herein shall affect the right of the Administrative Agent to serve process in any other manner permitted by law or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against the Guarantor in any other jurisdiction.
               (c) GUARANTOR HEREBY WAIVES ITS RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY AND ALL CLAIMS OR CAUSES OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS GUARANTY. IT IS HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGED BY GUARANTOR THAT THE WAIVER OF A JURY TRIAL IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE BANKS TO ACCEPT THIS GUARANTY AND THAT THE LOANS AND OTHER EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT MADE BY THE BANKS ARE MADE IN RELIANCE UPON SUCH WAIVER. GUARANTOR FURTHER WARRANTS AND REPRESENTS THAT SUCH WAIVER HAS BEEN KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY MADE, FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL. IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS GUARANTY MAY BE FILED BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT IN COURT AS A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A NONJURY TRIAL.
 
               (d) Guarantor does hereby further covenant and agree to and with the Administrative Agent and the Banks that Guarantor may be joined in any action against Borrower in connection with the Loan Documents and that recovery may be had against Guarantor in such action or in any independent action against Guarantor (with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations), without the Administrative Agent or any Bank first pursuing or exhausting any remedy or claim against Borrower or its successors or assigns. Guarantor also agrees that, in an action brought with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations in any jurisdiction, it shall be conclusively bound by the judgment in any such action by the Administrative Agent (wherever brought) against Borrower or its successors or assigns, as if Guarantor were a party to such action, even though Guarantor was not joined as a party in such action.
               (e) Guarantor agrees to pay all reasonable expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and disbursements) which may be incurred by the Administrative Agent or the Banks in connection with the enforcement of their rights under this Guaranty, whether or not suit is initiated.
          21. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein (but subject to Section 6 hereof), this Guaranty shall terminate and be of no further force or effect upon the full performance and payment of the Guaranteed Obligations hereunder. Upon termination of this Guaranty in accordance with the terms of this Guaranty, the Administrative Agent promptly shall deliver to Guarantor such documents as Guarantor or Guarantor's counsel reasonably may request in order to evidence such termination.
          22. All of the Administrative Agent's and the Banks' rights and remedies under each of the Loan Documents or under this Guaranty are intended to be distinct, separate and cumulative and no such right or remedy therein or herein mentioned is intended to be in exclusion of or a waiver of any other right or remedy available to the Administrative Agent or any Bank.
          23. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in no event shall the Guaranteed Obligations equal or exceed such an amount that, as of the date hereof, would render, or would be deemed to render, Guarantor insolvent.
          24. No claim may be made by the Guarantor or any other Person acting by or through Guarantor against the Administrative Agent or any Bank or the affiliates, directors, officers, employees, attorneys or agents of any of them for any consequential or punitive damages in respect of any claim for breach of contract or any other theory of liability arising out of or related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by the other Loan Documents, or any act, omission or event occurring in connection therewith; and Guarantor hereby waives, releases and agrees not to sue upon any claim for any such damages, whether or not accrued and whether or not known or suspected to exist in its favor.
 
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed and delivered this Guaranty as of the date and year first above written.

It is agreed that the Guaranteed Obligations of Guarantor hereunder are primary and this Guaranty shall be enforceable against Guarantor and its successors and assigns without the necessity for any suit or proceeding of any kind or nature whatsoever brought by the Administrative Agent or any of the Banks against the relevant Qualified Borrower or its respective successors or assigns or any other party or against any security for the payment and performance of the Guaranteed Obligations and without the necessity of any notice of non-payment or non-observance or of any notice of acceptance of this Guaranty or of any notice or demand to which Guarantor might otherwise be entitled (including, without limitation, diligence, presentment, notice of incurrence of any Guaranteed Obligation, maturity, extension of time, change in nature or form of the Guaranteed Obligations, acceptance of further security, release of further security, imposition or agreement arrived at as to the amount of or the terms of the Guaranteed Obligations, notice of adverse change in such Qualified Borrower's financial condition and any other fact which might materially increase the risk to Guarantor), all of which Guarantor hereby expressly waives; and Guarantor hereby expressly agrees that the validity of this Guaranty and the obligations of Guarantor hereunder shall in no way be terminated, affected, diminished, modified or impaired by reason of the assertion of or the failure to assert by the Administrative Agent or any of the Banks against such Qualified Borrower or its respective successors or assigns, any of the rights or remedies reserved to the Administrative Agent or any of the Banks pursuant to the provisions of the Loan Documents. Guarantor agrees that any notice or directive given at any time to the Administrative Agent or any of the Banks which is inconsistent with the waiver in the immediately preceding sentence shall be void and may be ignored by the Administrative Agent and the Banks, and, in addition, may not be pleaded or introduced as evidence in any litigation relating to this Guaranty for the reason that such pleading or introduction would be at variance with the written terms of this Guaranty, unless the Administrative Agent has specifically agreed otherwise in a writing, signed by a duly authorized officer. Guarantor specifically acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing waivers are of the essence of this transaction and that, but for this Guaranty and such waivers, the Administrative Agent and the Banks would not make requested Loans or otherwise extend credit to a Qualified Borrower.
          5. Guarantor waives, and covenants and agrees that it will not at any time insist upon, plead or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any and all appraisal, valuation, stay, extension, marshalling-of-assets or redemption laws, or right of homestead or exemption, whether now or at any time hereafter in force, which may delay, prevent or otherwise affect the performance by Guarantor of its obligations under, or the enforcement by the Administrative Agent or any of the Banks of, this Guaranty. Guarantor further covenants and agrees not to set up or claim any defense, counterclaim, offset, setoff or
 
other objection of any kind to any action, suit or proceeding at law, in equity or otherwise, or to any demand or claim that may be instituted or made by the Administrative Agent or any of the Banks other than the defense of the actual timely payment and performance by the relevant Qualified Borrower of the Guaranteed Obligations hereunder; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not be deemed a waiver of Guarantor's right to assert any compulsory counterclaim, if such counterclaim is compelled under local law or rule of procedure, nor shall the foregoing be deemed a waiver of Guarantor's right to assert any claim which would constitute a defense, setoff, counterclaim or crossclaim of any nature whatsoever against Administrative Agent or any Bank in any separate action or proceeding. Guarantor represents, warrants and agrees that, as of the date hereof, its obligations under this Guaranty are not subject to any counterclaims, offsets or defenses against the Administrative Agent or any Bank of any kind.
          6. The provisions of this Guaranty are for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Banks and their successors and permitted assigns, and nothing herein contained shall impair as between any Qualified Borrower and the Administrative Agent and the Banks the obligations of such Qualified Borrower under the Loan Documents.
          7. This Guaranty shall be a continuing, unconditional and absolute guaranty and the liability of Guarantor hereunder shall in no way be terminated, affected, modified, impaired or diminished by reason of the happening, from time to time, of any of the following, all without notice or the further consent of Guarantor:
     a. any assignment, amendment, modification or waiver of or change in any of the terms, covenants, conditions or provisions of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or the Loan Documents or the invalidity or unenforceability of any of the foregoing; or
     b. any extension of time that may be granted by the Administrative Agent to any Qualified Borrower, any guarantor, or their respective successors or assigns, heirs, executors, administrators or personal representatives; or
     c. any action which the Administrative Agent may take or fail to take under or in respect of any of the Loan Documents or by reason of any waiver of, or failure to enforce, any of the rights, remedies, powers or privileges available to the Administrative Agent under this Guaranty or available to the Administrative Agent at law, in equity or otherwise, or any action on the part of the Administrative Agent granting indulgence or extension in any form whatsoever; or
     d. any sale, exchange, release, or other disposition of any property pledged, mortgaged or conveyed, or any property in which the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks have been granted a lien or security interest to secure any indebtedness of any Qualified Borrower to the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks; or
     e. any release of any person or entity who may be liable in any manner for the payment and collection of any amounts owed by any Qualified Borrower to the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks; or
     f. the application of any sums by whomsoever paid or however realized to any amounts owing by any Qualified Borrower to the Administrative Agent and/or the
 
Banks under the Loan Documents in such manner as the Administrative Agent shall determine in its sole discretion; or
     g. Any Qualified Borrower's or any guarantor's voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, sale of all or substantially all of their respective assets and liabilities, appointment of a trustee, receiver, liquidator, sequestrator or conservator for all or any part of any Qualified Borrower's or any guarantor's assets, insolvency, bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors, reorganization, arrangement, composition or readjustment, or the commencement of other similar proceedings affecting any Qualified Borrower or any guarantor or any of the assets of any of them, including, without limitation, (i) the release or discharge of any Qualified Borrower or any guarantor from the payment and performance of their respective obligations under any of the Loan Documents by operation of law, or (ii) the impairment, limitation or modification of the liability of any Qualified Borrower or any guarantor in bankruptcy, or of any remedy for the enforcement of the Guaranteed Obligations under any of the Loan Documents, or Guarantor's liability under this Guaranty, resulting from the operation of any present or future provisions of the Bankruptcy Code or other present or future federal, state or applicable statute or law or from the decision in any court; or
     h. any improper disposition by any Qualified Borrower of the proceeds of the Loans, it being acknowledged by Guarantor that the Administrative Agent or any Bank shall be entitled to honor any request made by any Qualified Borrower for a disbursement of such proceeds and that neither the Administrative Agent nor any Bank shall have any obligation to see the proper disposition by any Qualified Borrower of such proceeds.
          8. Guarantor agrees that if at any time all or any part of any payment at any time received by the Administrative Agent from any Qualified Borrower or Guarantor under or with respect to this Guaranty is or must be rescinded or returned by the Administrative Agent or any Bank for any reason whatsoever (including, without limitation, the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Qualified Borrower or Guarantor), then Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall, to the extent of the payment rescinded or returned, be deemed to have continued in existence notwithstanding such previous receipt by such party, and Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall continue to be effective or reinstated, as the case may be, as to such payment, as though such previous payment had never been made.
          9. Until this Guaranty is terminated pursuant to the terms hereof, Guarantor (i) shall have no right of subrogation against any Qualified Borrower or any entity comprising same by reason of any payments or acts of performance by Guarantor in compliance with the obligations of Guarantor hereunder, (ii) waives any right to enforce any remedy which Guarantor now or hereafter shall have against any Qualified Borrower or any entity comprising same by reason of any one or more payments or acts of performance in compliance with the obligations of Guarantor hereunder and (iii) from and after an Event of Default, subordinates any liability or indebtedness of any Qualified Borrower or any entity comprising same now or hereafter held by Guarantor or any affiliate of Guarantor to the obligations of any Qualified Borrower under the Loan Documents. The foregoing, however, shall not be deemed in any way to limit any rights that Guarantor may have pursuant to the organizational documents of any Qualified Borrower or which it may have at law or in equity with respect to any other partners of such Qualified Borrower.
 
          10. Guarantor represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and the Banks with the knowledge that the Administrative Agent and the Banks are relying upon the same, as follows:
     a. Guarantor will be familiar with the financial condition of each Qualified Borrower;
     b. Guarantor has determined that it is in its best interests to enter into this Guaranty;
     c. this Guaranty is necessary and convenient to the conduct, promotion and attainment of Guarantor's business, and is in furtherance of Guarantor's business purposes;

     g. the execution and delivery of and the performance by Guarantor of its obligations under this Guaranty have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of Guarantor and do not (i) violate any provision of any law, rule, regulation (including, without limitation, Regulation U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States), order, writ, judgment, decree, determination or award presently in effect having applicability to Guarantor or the organizational documents of Guarantor the consequences of which violation is likely to materially and adversely impair the ability of Guarantor to perform its obligations under this Guaranty or (ii) violate or conflict with, result in a breach of or constitute (with due notice or lapse of time or both) a default under any indenture, agreement or other instrument to which Guarantor is a party, or by which Guarantor or any of its property is bound, the consequences of which violation, conflict, breach or default is likely to materially and adversely impair the ability of Guarantor to perform its obligations under this Guaranty;
     h. this Guaranty has been duly executed by Guarantor and constitutes the
 
legal, valid and binding obligation of Guarantor, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms except as enforceability may be limited by applicable insolvency, bankruptcy or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally or general principles of equity, whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law;
     i. no authorization, consent, approval, license or formal exemption from, nor any filing, declaration or registration with, any Federal, state, local or foreign court, governmental agency or regulatory authority is required in connection with the making and performance by Guarantor of this Guaranty, except those which have already been obtained; and
     j. Guarantor is not an "investment company" as that term is defined in, nor is it otherwise subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
          11. Guarantor and Administrative Agent each acknowledge and agree that this Guaranty is a guarantee of payment and performance and not of collection and enforcement in respect of any obligations which may accrue to the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks from any Qualified Borrower under the provisions of any Loan Document.
          12. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, and in conjunction therewith, the Administrative Agent or any Bank may assign any or all of its rights under this Guaranty.

          14. The representations and warranties of Guarantor set forth in this Guaranty shall survive until this Guaranty shall terminate in accordance with the terms hereof.
          15. This Guaranty contains the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements relating to such subject matter and may not be modified, amended, supplemented or discharged except by a written agreement signed by Guarantor and the Administrative Agent.
          16. If all or any portion of any provision contained in this Guaranty shall be
 
determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect for any reason, such provision or portion thereof shall be deemed stricken and severed from this Guaranty and the remaining provisions and portions thereof shall continue in full force and effect.
          17. This Guaranty may be executed in counterparts which together shall constitute the same instrument.

All notices, requests and other communications to any party hereunder shall be in writing (including bank wire, telex, facsimile transmission followed by telephonic confirmation or similar writing) and shall be addressed to such party at the address set forth below or to such other address as may be identified by any party in a written notice to the others:

          20. This Guaranty shall be binding upon Guarantor and its successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Banks and their successors and permitted assigns.
          21. The failure of the Administrative Agent to enforce any right or remedy hereunder, or promptly to enforce any such right or remedy, shall not constitute a waiver thereof, nor give rise to any estoppel against the Administrative Agent, nor excuse Guarantor from its obligations hereunder. Any waiver of any such right or remedy to be enforceable against the Administrative Agent must be expressly set forth in a writing signed by the Administrative Agent.
          22. a. THIS GUARANTY AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

Nothing herein shall affect the right of the Administrative Agent to serve process in any other manner permitted by law or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against the Guarantor in any other jurisdiction.
     c. GUARANTOR HEREBY WAIVES ITS RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL
 
OF ANY AND ALL CLAIMS OR CAUSES OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS GUARANTY. IT IS HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGED BY GUARANTOR THAT THE WAIVER OF A JURY TRIAL IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT TO ACCEPT THIS GUARANTY AND THAT THE LOANS AND OTHER EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT MADE BY THE BANKS ARE MADE IN RELIANCE UPON SUCH WAIVER. GUARANTOR FURTHER WARRANTS AND REPRESENTS THAT SUCH WAIVER HAS BEEN KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY MADE, FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL. IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS GUARANTY MAY BE FILED BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT IN COURT AS A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A NON-JURY TRIAL.
     d. Guarantor does hereby further covenant and agree to and with the Administrative Agent that Guarantor may be joined in any action against any Qualified Borrower in connection with the Loan Documents and that recovery may be had against Guarantor in such action or in any independent action against Guarantor (with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations), without the Administrative Agent first pursuing or exhausting any remedy or claim against any Qualified Borrower or its successors or assigns. Guarantor also agrees that, in an action brought with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations in any jurisdiction, it shall be conclusively bound by the judgment in any such action by the Administrative Agent (wherever brought) against any Qualified Borrower or its successors or assigns, as if Guarantor were a party to such action, even though Guarantor was not joined as a party in such action.
     e. Guarantor agrees to pay all reasonable expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and disbursements) which may be incurred by the Administrative Agent or the Banks in connection with the enforcement of their rights under this Guaranty, whether or not suit is initiated.
          23. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein (but subject to Section 8 hereof), this Guaranty shall terminate and be of no further force or effect upon the full performance and payment of the Guaranteed Obligations hereunder and the termination of the Commitments under the Credit Agreement. Upon termination of this Guaranty in accordance with the terms of this Guaranty, the Administrative Agent promptly shall deliver to Guarantor such documents as Guarantor or Guarantor's counsel reasonably may request in order to evidence such termination.
          24. All of the Administrative Agent's rights and remedies under each of the Loan Documents or under this Guaranty are intended to be distinct, separate and cumulative and no such right or remedy therein or herein mentioned is intended to be in exclusion of or a waiver of any other right or remedy available to the Administrative Agent.
          25. The Guarantor shall not use any assets of an "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA or a "plan" within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "") to repay or secure the Loans, the Notes, the Obligations or this Guaranty. The Guarantor shall not assign, sell, pledge, encumber, transfer, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of any of its rights or interests (direct or indirect) in any
Code
 
Qualified Borrower, or attempt to do any of the foregoing or suffer any of the foregoing, or permit any party with a direct or indirect interest or right in any Qualified Borrower to do any of the foregoing, if such action would cause the Notes, the Loans, the Obligations, this Guaranty, or any of the other Loan Documents or the exercise of any of the Administrative Agent's or Bank's rights in connection therewith, to constitute a prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Code (unless the Guarantor furnishes to the Administrative Agent a legal opinion satisfactory to the Administrative Agent that the transaction is exempt from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and the Code (and for this purpose, the Administrative Agent and the Banks, by accepting the benefits of this Guaranty, hereby agree to supply Guarantor all relevant non-confidential, factual information reasonably necessary to such legal opinion and reasonably requested by Guarantor) or would otherwise result in the Administrative Agent or any of the Banks being deemed in violation of Sections 404 or 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or would otherwise result in the Administrative Agent or any of the Banks being a fiduciary or party in interest under ERISA or a "disqualified person" as defined in Section 4975(e)(2) of the Code with respect to an "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA or a "plan" within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code. The Guarantor shall indemnify and hold each of the Administrative Agent and the Banks free and harmless from and against all loss, costs (including attorneys' fees and expenses), expenses, taxes and damages (including consequential damages) that each of the Administrative Agent and the Banks may suffer by reason of the investigation, defense and settlement of claims and in obtaining any prohibited transaction exemption under ERISA necessary in Administrative Agent's reasonable judgment as a result of Guarantor's action or inaction or by reason of a breach of the foregoing provisions by Guarantor.

induce the Administrative Agent and the Banks to enter into the Loan Documents, Guarantor hereby agrees as follows:
          1. Guarantor, on behalf of itself and its successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably, absolutely and unconditionally guarantees the full and punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity or otherwise, of all Obligations of Borrower now or hereafter existing under the Notes and the Credit Agreement, for principal and/or interest as well as any and all other amounts due thereunder, including, without limitation, all indemnity obligations of Borrower thereunder, and any and all reasonable costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements) incurred by the Administrative Agent or the Banks in enforcing its or their rights under this Guaranty (all of the foregoing obligations being the "").
Guaranteed Obligations
          2. It is agreed that the Guaranteed Obligations are primary and this Guaranty shall be enforceable against Guarantor and its successors and assigns without the necessity for any suit or proceeding of any kind or nature whatsoever brought by the Administrative Agent or any Bank against Borrower or its respective successors or assigns or any other party or against any security for the payment and performance of the Guaranteed Obligations and without the necessity of any notice of non-payment or non-observance or of any notice of acceptance of this Guaranty or of any notice or demand to which Guarantor might otherwise be entitled (including, without limitation, diligence, presentment, notice of maturity, extension of time, change in nature or form of the Guaranteed Obligations, acceptance of further security, release of further security, imposition or agreement arrived at as to the amount of or the terms of the Guaranteed Obligations, notice of adverse change in Borrower's financial condition and any other fact which might materially increase the risk to Guarantor), all of which Guarantor hereby expressly waives; and Guarantor hereby expressly agrees that the validity of this Guaranty and the obligations of Guarantor hereunder shall in no way be terminated, affected, diminished, modified or impaired by reason of the assertion of or the failure to assert by the Administrative Agent or any Bank against Borrower or its respective successors or assigns, any of the rights or remedies reserved to the Administrative Agent and the Banks pursuant to the provisions of the Loan Documents. Guarantor agrees that any notice or directive given at any time to the Administrative Agent which is inconsistent with the waiver in the immediately preceding sentence shall be void and may be ignored by the Administrative Agent and the Banks, and, in addition, may not be pleaded or introduced as evidence in any litigation relating to this Guaranty for the reason that such pleading or introduction would be at variance with the written terms of this Guaranty, unless the Administrative Agent and the Banks have specifically agreed otherwise in a writing, signed by a duly authorized officer. Guarantor specifically acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing waivers are of the essence of this transaction and that, but for this Guaranty and such waivers, the Administrative Agent and the Banks would decline to execute the Loan Documents.
 
          3. Guarantor waives, and covenants and agrees that it will not at any time insist upon, plead or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any and all appraisal, valuation, stay, extension, marshalling-of-assets or redemption laws, or right of homestead or exemption, whether now or at any time hereafter in force, which may delay, prevent or otherwise affect the performance by Guarantor of its obligations under, or the enforcement by the Administrative Agent of, this Guaranty. Guarantor further covenants and agrees not to set up or claim any defense, counterclaim, offset, set-off or other objection of any kind to any action, suit or proceeding at law, in equity or otherwise, or to any demand or claim that may be instituted or made by the Administrative Agent other than the defense of the actual timely payment and performance by Borrower of the Guaranteed Obligations; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not be deemed a waiver of Guarantor's right to assert any compulsory counterclaim, if such counterclaim is compelled under local law or rule of procedure, nor shall the foregoing be deemed a waiver of Guarantor's right to assert any claim which would constitute a defense, setoff, counterclaim or crossclaim of any nature whatsoever against Administrative Agent or any Bank in any separate action or proceeding. Guarantor represents, warrants and agrees that, as of the date hereof, its obligations under this Guaranty are not subject to any counterclaims, offsets or defenses against the Administrative Agent or any Bank of any kind.
          4. The provisions of this Guaranty are for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Banks and their successors and permitted assigns, and nothing herein contained shall impair as between Borrower and the Administrative Agent and the Banks the obligations of Borrower under the Loan Documents.
          5. This Guaranty shall be a continuing, irrevocable, unconditional and absolute guaranty and the liability of Guarantor hereunder shall in no way be terminated, affected, modified, impaired or diminished by reason of the happening, from time to time, of any of the following, although without notice or the further consent of Guarantor:
     (a) any assignment, amendment, modification or waiver of or change in any of the terms, covenants, conditions or provisions of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or the Loan Documents or the invalidity or unenforceability of any of the foregoing; or
     (b) any extension of time that may be granted by the Administrative Agent or any Bank to Borrower, any guarantor, or their respective successors or assigns, heirs, executors, administrators or personal representatives; or
     (c) any action which the Administrative Agent or any Bank may take or fail to take under or in respect of any of the Loan Documents or by reason of any waiver or, or failure to enforce any of the rights, remedies, powers or privileges available to the Administrative Agent and
 
the Banks under this Guaranty or available to the Administrative Agent and the Banks at law, in equity or otherwise, or any action on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Bank granting indulgence or extension in any form whatsoever; or
     (d) any sale, exchange, release, or other disposition of any property pledged, mortgaged or conveyed, or any property in which the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks have been granted a lien or security interest to secure any indebtedness of Borrower to the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks or any impairment of or failure to perfect any security interests therein; or
     (e) any release of any person or entity who may be liable in any manner for the payment and collection of any amounts owed by Borrower to the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks; or
     (f) the application of any sums by whomsoever paid or however realized to any amounts owing by Borrower to the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks under the Loan Documents in such manner as the Administrative Agent shall determine in its sole discretion; or
     (g) Borrower's or any guarantor's voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, sale of all or substantially all of their respective assets and liabilities, appointment of a trustee, receiver, liquidator, sequestrator or conservator for all or any part of Borrower's or any guarantor's assets, insolvency, bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors, reorganization, arrangement, composition or readjustment, or the commencement of other similar proceedings affecting Borrower or any guarantor or any of the assets of any of them, including, without limitation, (i) the release or discharge of Borrower or any guarantor from the payment and performance of their respective obligations under any of the Loan Documents by operation of law, or (ii) the impairment, limitation or modification of the liability of Borrower or any guarantor in bankruptcy, or of any remedy for the enforcement of the Guaranteed Obligations under any of the Loan Documents, or Guarantor's liability under this Guaranty, resulting from the operation of any present or future provisions of the Bankruptcy Code or other present or future federal, state or applicable statute or law or from the decision in any court; or
     (h) any improper disposition by Borrower of the proceeds of the Loans, it being acknowledged by Guarantor that the Administrative Agent or any Bank shall be entitled to honor any request made by Borrower for a disbursement of such proceeds and that neither the Administrative Agent nor any Bank shall have any obligation to see to the proper disposition by Borrower of such proceeds.
 
          6. Guarantor agrees that if at any time all or any part of any payment at any time received by the Administrative Agent or any Bank from Borrower or Guarantor or any other Person obligated in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations under or with respect to this Guaranty is or must be rescinded or returned by the Administrative Agent or any Bank for any reason whatsoever (including, without limitation, the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of Borrower or Guarantor or such other Person), then Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall, to the extent of the payment rescinded or returned, be deemed to have continued in existence notwithstanding such previous receipt by such party, and Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, as to such payment, as though such previous payment had never been made.
          7. Until this Guaranty is terminated pursuant to the terms hereof, Guarantor (i) shall have no right of subrogation against Borrower or any entity comprising same by reason of any payments or acts of performance by Guarantor in compliance with the obligations of Guarantor hereunder; (ii) waives any right to enforce any remedy which Guarantor now or hereafter shall have against Borrower or any entity comprising same by reason of any one or more payment or acts of performance in compliance with the obligations of Guarantor hereunder and (iii) from and after an Event of Default, subordinates any liability or indebtedness of Borrower or any entity comprising same now or hereafter held by Guarantor or any affiliate of Guarantor to the obligations of Borrower under the Loan Documents. The foregoing, however, shall not be deemed in any way to limit any rights that Guarantor may have pursuant to the Agreement of Limited Partnership of Borrower or which it may have at law or in equity with respect to any other partners of Borrower.
          8. Guarantor represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and the Banks with the knowledge that the Administrative Agent and the Banks are relying upon the same, as follows:

     (b) based upon such relationship, Guarantor has determined that it is in its best interests to enter into this Guaranty;
     (c) this Guaranty is necessary and convenient to the conduct, promotion and attainment of Guarantor's business, and is in furtherance of Guarantor's business purposes;

     (f) to the best of Guarantor's knowledge, there is no action, suit, proceeding, or investigation pending or threatened against or affecting Guarantor at law, in equity, in admiralty or before any arbitrator or any governmental department, commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality (domestic or foreign) which is likely to materially and adversely affect the property, assets or condition (financial or otherwise) of Guarantor or which is likely to materially and adversely impair the ability of Guarantor to perform its obligations under this Guaranty;
     (g) the execution and delivery of and the performance by Guarantor of its obligations under this Guaranty have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of Guarantor and do not (i) violate any provision of any law, rule, regulation (including, without limitation, Regulation U or X of the Federal Reserve Board of the United States), order, writ, judgment, decree, determination or award presently in effect having applicability to Guarantor or the organizational documents of Guarantor, the consequences of which violation would materially and adversely affect the property, assets or condition (financial or otherwise) of Guarantor or which is likely to materially and adversely impair the ability of Guarantor to perform its obligations under this Guaranty or (ii) violate or conflict with, result in a breach of or constitute (with due notice or lapse of time or both) a default under any indenture, agreement or other instrument to which Guarantor is a party, or by which Guarantor or any of its property is bound, the consequences of which violation, conflict, breach or default would materially and adversely affect the property, assets or condition (financial or otherwise) of Guarantor or which is likely to materially and adversely impair the ability of Guarantor to perform its obligations under this Guaranty;
     (h) this Guaranty has been duly executed by Guarantor and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Guarantor, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms except as enforceability may be limited by applicable insolvency, bankruptcy or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally or general principles of equity, whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law;
     (i) no authorization, consent, approval, license or formal exemption from, nor any filing, declaration or registration with, any
 
Federal, state, local or foreign court, governmental agency or regulatory authority is required in connection with the making and performance by Guarantor of this Guaranty, except those which have already been obtained;
     (j) Guarantor is not an "investment company" as that term is defined in, nor is it otherwise subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended;
     (k) Guarantor is not engaged principally, or as one of its important activities, in the business of purchasing, carrying, or extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any margin stock (within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States); and
     (l) All of the representations and warranties in the Credit Agreement concerning Guarantor are true and correct.
          Guarantor covenants that it will comply or cause compliance with all covenants in the Credit Agreement which are applicable to it.
          9. Guarantor and the Administrative Agent each acknowledge and agree that this Guaranty is a guarantee of payment and performance and not of collection and enforcement in respect of any obligations which may accrue to the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks from Borrower under the provisions of any Loan Document.
          10. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, and in conjunction therewith, the Administrative Agent or any Bank may assign any or all of its rights under this Guaranty. In the event of any such assignment, the Administrative Agent shall give Guarantor prompt notice of same. If the Administrative Agent or any Bank elects to sell all the Loans or participations in the Loans and the Loan Documents, including this Guaranty, the Administrative Agent or any Bank may forward to each purchaser and prospective purchaser all documents and information relating to this Guaranty or to Guarantor, whether furnished by Borrower or Guarantor or otherwise, subject to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement.
          11. Guarantor agrees, upon the written request of the Administrative Agent, to execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent, from time to time, any modification or amendment hereto or any additional instruments or documents reasonably considered necessary by the Administrative Agent or its counsel to cause this Guaranty to be, become or remain valid and effective in accordance with its terms, provided, that any such modification, amendment, additional instrument or document shall not increase Guarantor's obligations or diminish its rights hereunder and shall be reasonably satisfactory as to form to Guarantor and to Guarantor's counsel.
 
          12. The representations and warranties of Guarantor set forth in this Guaranty shall survive until this Guaranty shall terminate in accordance with the terms hereof.
          13. This Guaranty contains the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements relating to such subject matter and may not be modified, amended, supplemented or discharged except by a written agreement signed by Guarantor and the Administrative Agent (acting with the requisite consent of the Banks as provided in the Credit Agreement).
          14. If all or any portion of any provision contained in this Guaranty shall be determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect for any reason, such provision or portion thereof shall be deemed stricken and severed from this Guaranty and the remaining provisions and portions thereof shall continue in full force and effect.
          15. This Guaranty may be executed in counterparts which together shall constitute the same instrument.
          16. All notices, requests and other communications to any party hereunder shall be in writing (including bank wire, facsimile transmission followed by telephonic confirmation or similar writing) and shall be addressed to such party at the address set forth below or to such other address as may be identified by any party in a written notice to the others:
 
          Each such notice, request or other communication shall be effective (i) if given by facsimile transmission, when such facsimile is transmitted to the facsimile number specified in this Section and the appropriate facsimile confirmation is received, (ii) if given by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, with first class postage prepaid, addressed as aforesaid, upon receipt or refusal to accept delivery, (iii) if given by a nationally recognized overnight carrier, 24 hours after such communication is deposited with such carrier with postage prepaid for next day delivery, or (iv) if given by any other means, when delivered at the address specified in this Section.
          17. Any acknowledgment or new promise, whether by payment of principal or interest or otherwise by Borrower or Guarantor, with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations shall, if the statute of limitations in favor of Guarantor against the Administrative Agent and the Banks shall have commenced to run, toll the running of such statute of limitations, and if the period of such statute of limitations shall have expired, prevent the operation of such statute of limitations.
          18. This Guaranty shall be binding upon Guarantor and its successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Banks and their successors and permitted assigns; provided, however, that the Guarantor may not assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of all of the Banks, and any attempted such assignment or transfer without such consent shall be null and void.
          19. The failure of the Administrative Agent to enforce any right or remedy hereunder, or promptly to enforce any such right or remedy, shall not constitute a waiver thereof, nor give rise to any estoppel against the Administrative Agent or any Bank, nor excuse Guarantor from its obligations hereunder. Any waiver of any such right or remedy to be enforceable against the Administrative Agent and the Banks must be expressly set forth in a writing
 
signed by the Administrative Agent (acting with the requisite consent of the Banks as provided in the Credit Agreement).
          20. (a) THIS GUARANTY AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS.
     (b) Any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Guaranty and any action for enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof may be brought in the courts of the State of Illinois or of the United States of America for the Northern District of Illinois, and, by execution and delivery of this Guaranty, the Guarantor hereby accepts for itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and appellate courts from any thereof. The Guarantor irrevocably consents to the service of process out of any of the aforementioned courts in any such action or proceeding by the mailing of copies thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to the Guarantor at its address for notices set forth herein. The Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any of the aforesaid actions or proceedings arising out of or in connection with this Guaranty brought in the courts referred to above and hereby further irrevocably waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Nothing herein shall affect the right of the Administrative Agent to serve process in any other manner permitted by law or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against the Guarantor in any other jurisdiction.
     (c) GUARANTOR HEREBY WAIVES ITS RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY AND ALL CLAIMS OR CAUSES OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS GUARANTY. IT IS HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGED BY GUARANTOR THAT THE WAIVER OF A JURY TRIAL IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE BANKS TO ACCEPT THIS GUARANTY AND THAT THE LOANS AND OTHER EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT MADE BY THE BANKS ARE MADE IN RELIANCE UPON SUCH WAIVER. GUARANTOR FURTHER WARRANTS AND REPRESENTS THAT SUCH WAIVER HAS BEEN KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY MADE, FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL. IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS GUARANTY MAY BE FILED BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT IN COURT AS A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A NON-JURY TRIAL.
 
     (d) Guarantor does hereby further covenant and agree to and with the Administrative Agent and the Banks that Guarantor may be joined in any action against Borrower in connection with the Loan Documents and that recovery may be had against Guarantor in such action or in any independent action against Guarantor (with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations), without the Administrative Agent and the Banks first pursuing or exhausting any remedy or claim against Borrower or its successors or assigns. Guarantor also agrees that, in an action brought with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations in any jurisdiction, it shall be conclusively bound by the judgment in any such action by the Administrative Agent (wherever brought) against Borrower or its successors or assigns, as if Guarantor were a party to such action, even though Guarantor was not joined as a party in such action.
     (e) Guarantor agrees to pay all reasonable expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and disbursements) which may be incurred by the Administrative Agent or the Banks in connection with the enforcement of their rights under this Guaranty, whether or not suit is initiated.
          21. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein (but subject to Section 6 hereof), this Guaranty shall terminate and be of no further force or effect upon the full performance and payment of the Guaranteed Obligations hereunder. Upon termination of this Guaranty in accordance with the terms of this Guaranty, the Administrative Agent promptly shall deliver to Guarantor such documents as Guarantor or Guarantor's counsel reasonably may request in order to evidence such termination.
          22. All of the Administrative Agent's and the Banks' rights and remedies under each of the Loan Documents or under this Guaranty are intended to be distinct, separate and cumulative and no such right or remedy therein or herein mentioned is intended to be in exclusion of or a waiver of any other right or remedy available to the Administrative Agent or any Bank.
          23. No claim may be made by Guarantor or any other Person acting by or through Guarantor against the Administrative Agent or any Bank or the affiliates, directors, officers, employees, attorneys or agent of any of them for any consequential or punitive damages in respect of any claim for breach of contract or any other theory of liability arising out of or related to the transactions contemplated by this Guaranty or by the other Loan Documents, or any act, omission or event occurring in connection therewith; and Guarantor hereby waives, releases and agrees not to sue upon any claim for any such damages, whether or not accrued and whether or not known or suspected to exist in its favor.
 
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed and delivered this Guaranty as of the date and year first above written.
 
          On July _, 2011, before me personally came Mark Parrell, to me known to be the person who executed the foregoing instrument, and who, being duly sworn by me, did depose and say that he is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Equity Residential, and that he executed the foregoing instrument in the organization's name, and that he had authority to sign the same, and he acknowledged to me that he executed the same as the act and deed of said organization for the uses and purposes therein mentioned.
