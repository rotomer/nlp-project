Exhibit 99.1
Equity Residential Reports Second Quarter 2011 Results
Quarterly Same Store Revenue Increases 4.9%
CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 27, 2011--Equity Residential (NYSE: EQR) today reported results for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2011. All per share results are reported on a fully-diluted basis.
As we enter the final months of our primary leasing season, we are pleased that fundamentals remain strong across all of our markets and that same store net operating income (NOI) results for the full year should be at the high end of our original guidance range, said David J. Neithercut, Equity Residentials President and CEO. However, we expect Normalized Funds from Operations for the year to be slightly below our original guidance midpoint due to increased disposition activity as we take advantage of attractive pricing for non-core assets and are challenged to redeploy that capital in a highly competitive acquisition environment in our core markets.
Second Quarter 2011
FFO (Funds from Operations), as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), for the second quarter of 2011 was $0.58 per share compared to $0.58 per share in the second quarter of 2010.
For the second quarter of 2011, the company reported Normalized FFO of $0.60 per share compared to $0.58 per share in the same period of 2010. The difference is due primarily to:
the positive impact of $0.06 per share from higher same store NOI and $0.04 per share from higher lease-up NOI;
the negative impact of $0.06 per share from 2011 transaction activity and timing; and
the negative impact of approximately $0.02 per share from other items including higher interest expense and the dilutive effect of stock options due to a higher than budgeted share price.
Normalized FFO begins with FFO and eliminates certain items that by their nature are not comparable from period to period or that tend to obscure the companys actual operating performance. A reconciliation and definition of Normalized FFO are provided on pages 6 and 26 of this release and the company has included guidance for Normalized FFO on page 25 of this release.
For the second quarter of 2011, the company reported earnings of $1.85 per share compared to $0.02 per share in the second quarter of 2010. The difference is due primarily to higher gains from property sales in 2011.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2011
FFO for the six months ended June 30, 2011 was $1.14 per share compared to $1.07 per share in the same period of 2010.
For the six months ended June 30, 2011, the company reported Normalized FFO of $1.16 per share compared to $1.09 per share in the same period of 2010.
For the six months ended June 30, 2011, the company reported earnings of $2.27 per share compared to $0.21 per share in the same period of 2010.
Same Store Results
On a same store second quarter to second quarter comparison, which includes 105,730 apartment units, revenues increased 4.9%, expenses increased 0.7% and NOI increased 7.4%.
On a same store six-month to six-month comparison, which includes 104,163 apartment units, revenues increased 4.5%, expenses decreased 0.3% and NOI increased 7.4%.
Acquisitions/Dispositions
During the second quarter of 2011, the company acquired five properties with a total of 1,548 apartment units for an aggregate purchase price of $410.2 million at a weighted average capitalization (cap) rate of 5.0%. The company also acquired, for potential development, a land parcel located across the street from its 425 Mass Avenue apartment property in Washington, D.C. for $12.9 million.
During the quarter, the company sold 26 properties, with a total of 8,536 apartment units for an aggregate sale price of $911.5 million at a weighted average cap rate of 6.3% generating an unlevered internal rate of return (IRR), inclusive of management costs, of 11.7%.
During the first six months of 2011, the company acquired seven properties with a total of 2,069 apartment units for an aggregate purchase price of $549.3 million at a weighted average cap rate of 5.2%; a commercial building adjacent to its Harbor Steps apartment property in downtown Seattle for a purchase price of $11.8 million, for potential redevelopment; and one land parcel for $12.9 million.
Also during the first six months of 2011, the company sold 38 properties with a total of 11,267 apartment units for an aggregate sale price of $1.17 billion at a weighted average cap rate of 6.4% generating an unlevered IRR, inclusive of management costs, of 11.5%.
Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility
On July 13, 2011, the company entered into a new $1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement with a group of 23 financial institutions. The new facility matures in July 2014, subject to a one-year extension at the companys option. The interest rate on advances under the new facility will generally be LIBOR plus a spread (currently 1.15%) and the company pays an annual facility fee of 0.2%. Both the spread and the facility fee are dependent on the credit rating of the companys long-term debt. This facility replaced the companys existing facility which was scheduled to mature in February 2012.
Redemption of Notes
On July 18, 2011, the company called for redemption on August 18, 2011 its outstanding 3.85% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2026. As of July 15, 2011, there was $482.5 million of notes outstanding. The redemption of these notes has been planned since the beginning of the year and the impact of this redemption was included in the companys 2011 Normalized FFO guidance. Details of the redemption can be found in the companys July 18, 2011 press release.
At-The-Market (ATM) Share Offering Program
The company has not issued any shares under this program since January 13, 2011 and currently has 10 million shares available for future issuance under this program. The company would use proceeds from share sales primarily to fund its investment activity, including development, and to fund debt repayment.
Third Quarter 2011 Guidance
The company has established a Normalized FFO guidance range of $0.59 to $0.63 per share for the third quarter of 2011. The difference between the companys second quarter 2011 Normalized FFO of $0.60 per share and the midpoint of the third quarter guidance range is primarily due to:
the positive impact of $0.02 per share from higher same store and lease-up NOI;
the positive impact of $0.01 per share from lower G&A expenses and other items; and
the negative impact of $0.02 per share from 2011 transaction activity and timing.
Full Year 2011 Guidance
The company has revised its guidance for its full year 2011 same store operating performance, transactions and Normalized FFO results as well as other items listed on page 25 of this release. The changes to the full year same store, transactions and Normalized FFO guidance are listed below:
The difference between the midpoint of the previous Normalized FFO guidance range and the midpoint of the revised guidance range is due primarily to:
the positive impact of $0.07 per share from higher NOI from same store and lease-up properties;
the positive impact of $0.03 per share from lower interest expense due to development debt payoffs and the application of transaction proceeds to maturing debt;
the negative impact of $0.10 per share from 2011 transaction activity and timing; and
the negative impact of approximately $0.02 per share from other items including lower interest income and the dilutive effect of stock options due to a higher than budgeted share price.
