Exhibit 99.1
Equity Residential Reports Third Quarter 2011 Results
Quarterly Same Store Revenue Increases 5.5%
Quarterly Net Operating Income Increases 9.0%
CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 26, 2011--Equity Residential (NYSE: EQR) today reported results for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2011. All per share results are reported on a fully-diluted basis.
We are extremely pleased with our continued strong operating performance which delivered same store NOI growth of 9.0% in the third quarter, said David J. Neithercut, Equity Residentials President and CEO. Fundamentals continue to be positive and we remain confident that increasing demand for apartment living combined with limited new supply will produce strong results next year and for years to come despite concerns about weakening economic growth.
Third Quarter 2011
FFO (Funds from Operations), as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), for the third quarter of 2011 was $0.63 per share compared to $0.55 per share in the third quarter of 2010.
For the third quarter of 2011, the company reported Normalized FFO of $0.62 per share compared to $0.57 per share in the same period of 2010. The difference is due primarily to:
the positive impact of $0.08 per share from higher same store net operating income (NOI) and $0.02 per share from higher lease-up NOI;
the negative impact of $0.08 per share from 2010 and 2011 transaction activity and timing; and
the positive impact of approximately $0.03 per share from lower interest expense and other items.
Normalized FFO begins with FFO and eliminates certain items that by their nature are not comparable from period to period or that tend to obscure the companys actual operating performance. A reconciliation and definition of Normalized FFO are provided on pages 6 and 26 of this release and the company has included guidance for Normalized FFO on page 25 of this release.
For the third quarter of 2011, the company reported earnings of $0.35 per share compared to $0.09 per share in the third quarter of 2010. The difference is due primarily to higher gains from property sales in 2011.
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2011
FFO for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 was $1.77 per share compared to $1.63 per share in the same period of 2010.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, the company reported Normalized FFO of $1.78 per share compared to $1.66 per share in the same period of 2010.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, the company reported earnings of $2.62 per share compared to $0.30 per share in the same period of 2010.
Same Store Results
On a same store third quarter to third quarter comparison, which includes 104,922 apartment units, revenues increased 5.5%, expenses decreased 0.1% and NOI increased 9.0%.
On a same store nine-month to nine-month comparison, which includes 102,129 apartment units, revenues increased 4.8%, expenses decreased 0.3% and NOI increased 7.9%.
Acquisitions/Dispositions
During the third quarter of 2011, the company acquired two properties with a total of 365 apartment units for an aggregate purchase price of $113.0 million at a weighted average capitalization (cap) rate of 4.7% and a newly constructed, unoccupied asset currently in lease up for $39.5 million. Also during the quarter, the company acquired a land parcel located in Southern California for $5.6 million and entered into a long-term ground lease on a land parcel in New York City, both for potential development.
During the quarter, the company sold seven properties, with a total of 2,261 apartment units for an aggregate sale price of $210.1 million at a weighted average cap rate of 7.2% generating an unlevered internal rate of return (IRR), inclusive of management costs, of 8.2%.
During the first nine months of 2011, the company acquired ten properties, consisting of 2,529 apartment units, for an aggregate purchase price of $701.7 million. The weighted average cap rate on these acquisitions, excluding the lease up asset described above, is 5.1%. The company also acquired a commercial building adjacent to its Harbor Steps apartment property in downtown Seattle for a purchase price of $11.8 million, for potential redevelopment, two land parcels for $18.5 million, and entered into the long-term ground lease for potential development described above.
Also during the first nine months of 2011, the company sold 45 properties with a total of 13,528 apartment units for an aggregate sale price of $1.38 billion at a weighted average cap rate of 6.5% generating an unlevered IRR, inclusive of management costs, of 11.0%.
Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility
On July 13, 2011, the company entered into a new $1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement with a group of 23 financial institutions. The new facility matures in July 2014, subject to a one-year extension at the companys option. The interest rate on advances under the new facility will generally be LIBOR plus a spread (currently 1.15%) and the company pays an annual facility fee of 0.2%. Both the spread and the facility fee are dependent on the credit rating of the companys long-term debt. This facility replaced the companys existing facility which was scheduled to mature in February 2012.
Redemption of Notes
On August 18, 2011, the company redeemed its 3.85% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2026, of which $482.5 million were outstanding. The notes were redeemed at par and no premium was paid. The redemption of these notes had been planned since the beginning of the year and the impact of this redemption was included in the companys 2011 Normalized FFO guidance.
At-The-Market (ATM) Share Offering Program
The company has not issued any shares under this program since January 13, 2011 and currently has 10 million shares available for future issuance under this program. The company would use proceeds from share sales primarily to fund its investment activity, including development, and to fund debt repayment.
Fourth Quarter 2011 Guidance
The company has established a Normalized FFO guidance range of $0.63 to $0.67 per share for the fourth quarter of 2011. The difference between the companys third quarter 2011 Normalized FFO of $0.62 per share and the midpoint of the fourth quarter guidance range is primarily due to:
the positive impact of $0.02 per share from higher same store and lease-up NOI;
the positive impact of $0.01 per share from 2010 and 2011 transaction activity and timing; and
the positive impact of $0.01 per share from lower interest expense.
Full Year 2011 Guidance
The company has revised its guidance for its full year 2011 same store operating performance, transactions and Normalized FFO results as well as other items listed on page 25 of this release. The changes to the full year same store, transactions and Normalized FFO guidance are listed below:
