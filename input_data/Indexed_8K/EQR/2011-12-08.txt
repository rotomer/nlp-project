Item 8.01. Other Events.
On December 8, 2011, Equity Residential (the "Company") filed a prospectus supplement (the "Prospectus Supplement") with the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the Company's current "at the market" equity offering program (the "ATM Program"). The Prospectus Supplement was filed solely to continue the current ATM Program under a new prospectus and registration statement and to replace the previous prospectus supplement relating to the ATM Program, which related to the Company's automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-156156) that expires on December 16, 2011. The Prospectus Supplement registered 10,000,000 common shares of beneficial interest, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company, which is the same number of shares registered on the expiring registration statement. There have been no sales under the ATM Program since January 13, 2011.
On December 7, 2011, ERP Operating Limited Partnership, a subsidiary and the operating partnership of the Company through which the Company owns substantially all its assets, entered into an agreement to sell $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.625% notes due December 15, 2021 to certain underwriters. The sale of notes is expected to close on December 12, 2011.
This Current Report shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state.

In addition, we have relied upon the factual representations and covenants of EQR and, to the extent set forth in the Officer's Certificate (as hereinafter defined), of Multifamily Portfolio Partners, Inc., a Delaware corporation, EQR-District Holding, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and BEL Residential Properties Trust, a Maryland real estate investment trust (each such entity, along with BEL Multifamily Property Trust, a Maryland real estate investment trust, BEL Communities Property Trust, a Maryland real estate investment trust, and BEL Apartment Properties Trust, a Maryland real estate investment trust, hereinafter referred to as a ""), contained in EQR's certificate to us, dated as of the date hereof (the "), executed by a duly appointed officer of EQR setting forth certain representations and covenants relating to the organization and operation of EQR, the Operating Partnership, the Subsidiary REITs and their respective subsidiaries.
Subsidiary REIT
"Officer's Certificate
For purposes of our opinion, we have not made an independent investigation of the facts set forth in the documents we reviewed. We consequently have assumed that the information presented in such documents or otherwise furnished to us accurately and completely describes all material facts relevant to our opinion. No facts have come to our attention, however, that would cause us to question the accuracy and completeness of such facts or documents in a material way. Any representation or statement in any document upon which we rely that is made "to the best of our knowledge" or otherwise similarly qualified is assumed to be correct. Any alteration of such facts may adversely affect our opinions. In the course of our representation of EQR, no information has come to our attention that would cause us to question the accuracy or completeness of the representations contained in the Officer's Certificate or of the Reviewed Documents in a material way.
In our review, we have assumed, with your consent, that all of the representations and statements of a factual nature set forth in the Officer's Certificate and the Reviewed Documents are true and correct, and all of the obligations imposed by any such documents on the parties thereto have been and will be performed or satisfied in accordance with their terms.

The opinions set forth in this letter are based on relevant provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ""), the regulations promulgated thereunder by the United States Department of the Treasury ("") (including proposed and temporary Regulations), and interpretations of the foregoing as expressed in court decisions, the legislative history, and existing administrative rulings and practices of the Internal Revenue Service (including its practices and policies in issuing private letter rulings, which are not binding on the Internal Revenue Service ("") except with respect to a taxpayer that receives such a ruling), all as of the date hereof.

In rendering these opinions, we have assumed that the transactions contemplated by the Reviewed Documents will be consummated in accordance with the terms and provisions of such documents, and that such documents accurately reflect the material facts of such transactions. In addition, the opinions set forth herein are based on the correctness of the following specific assumptions:
(i) EQR, the Operating Partnership, the Subsidiary REITs and their respective subsidiaries will each be operated in the manner described in the Declaration of Trust, the Bylaws, the ERP LP Agreement, the other organizational documents of each such entity, as the case may be, and all terms and provisions of such agreements and documents will be complied with by all parties thereto;
(ii) EQR is a duly formed real estate investment trust under the laws of the State of Maryland;
(iii) Operating Partnership is a duly organized and validly existing limited partnership under the laws of the State of Illinois; and
(iv) There will be no change in the applicable laws of the State of Maryland, the State of Illinois, or in the Code, the Regulations, and the interpretations of the Code and such Regulations by the courts and the IRS, after the date of this letter.
With respect to the last assumption, it should be noted that statutes, regulations, judicial decisions, and administrative interpretations are subject to change at any time and, in some circumstances, with retroactive effect. A material change that is made after the date hereof in any of the foregoing bases for our opinions could affect our conclusions. Furthermore, if the facts vary from those relied upon (including if any representations, warranties, covenants or assumptions upon which we have relied are inaccurate, incomplete, breached or ineffective), our opinion contained herein could be inapplicable. Moreover, the qualification and taxation of EQR as a real estate investment trust (a "") under the Code will depend upon (i) EQR's meeting, in its actual operations, the applicable asset composition, source of income, shareholder diversification, distribution and other requirements of the Code and Regulations necessary for an entity to qualify as a REIT and (ii) the satisfaction by each of the Subsidiary REITs of the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. We will not review the operations of EQR or any of the Subsidiary REITs, and no assurance can be given that the actual operations of EQR or any Subsidiary REIT will meet these requirements or the representations made to us with respect thereto.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that:
(i) EQR was organized and has operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code for each of its taxable years ended December 31, 1992 through December 31, 2010, and EQR's current organization and proposed method of operation will enable it to continue to satisfy the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code for its taxable years ending after the date of this opinion.
(ii) The discussion in the Prospectus, included as part of the Registration Statement under the heading "Federal Income Tax Considerations Related to Common Shares" and the Prospectus Supplement under the heading "Supplemental Federal Income Tax Considerations" (which incorporates by reference the tax discussion in the EQR 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 under the heading "Federal Income Tax Considerations"), to the extent that it constitutes matters of federal income tax law or legal conclusions relating thereto, is accurate in all material respects.
The foregoing opinion is limited to the matters specifically discussed herein, which are the only matters to which you have requested our opinion. Other than as expressly stated above, we express no opinion on any issue relating to EQR or any investment therein, the Operating Partnership, any Subsidiary REIT, or under any other law.
For a discussion relating the law to the facts and the legal analysis underlying the opinions set forth in this letter, we incorporate by reference the discussion of federal income tax issues, which we assisted in preparing, contained in the Prospectus, included as part of the Registration Statement, under the heading "Federal Income Tax Considerations Related to Common Shares", and the Prospectus Supplement, under the heading "Supplemental Federal Income Tax Considerations" (which incorporates by reference the tax discussion in the EQR 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 under the heading "Federal Income Tax Considerations"). We assume no obligation to advise you of any changes in the foregoing subsequent to the date of this opinion letter, and we are not undertaking to update the opinion letter from time to time. You should be aware that an opinion of counsel represents only counsel's best legal judgment, and has no binding effect or official status of any kind, and that no assurance can be given that contrary positions may not be taken by the IRS or that a court considering the issues would not hold otherwise.
This opinion is rendered only to you and may not be quoted in whole or in part or otherwise referred to, nor be filed with, or furnished to, any other person or entity in connection with the Registration Statement. We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement under the Securities Act pursuant to Item
