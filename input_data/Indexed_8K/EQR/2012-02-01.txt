Equity Residential Reports Full Year 2011 Results
 
Revenues Increase 5.0%; NOI Increases 7.7%
 
Provides Outlook for 2012 Performance
 
CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 1, 2012--Equity Residential (NYSE: EQR) today reported results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2011. All per share results are reported on a fully-diluted basis.
 
We are extremely pleased with the 7.7% increase in same store net operating income delivered by our portfolio and our teams across the country in 2011, said David J. Neithercut, Equity Residentials President and CEO. We are confident that multifamily fundamentals will remain strong as we see no let up in demand and little new supply which will keep retention high, vacancy low and rental rates on the rise.
 
Fourth Quarter 2011
 
FFO (Funds from Operations), as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), for the fourth quarter of 2011 was $0.64 per share compared to $0.45 per share in the fourth quarter of 2010. The difference is due primarily to a fourth quarter 2010 non-cash impairment charge on certain land parcels of $45.4 million, or $0.15 per share.
 
For the fourth quarter of 2011, the company reported Normalized FFO of $0.65 per share compared to $0.61 per share in the same period of 2010. The difference is due primarily to:
 
 
 
 
Normalized FFO begins with FFO and eliminates certain items that by their nature are not comparable from period to period or that tend to obscure the companys actual operating performance. A reconciliation and definition of Normalized FFO are provided on pages 8 and 28 of this release and the company has included guidance for Normalized FFO on page 27 of this release.
 
 
 
 
 
For the fourth quarter of 2011, the company reported earnings of $0.33 per share compared to $0.65 per share in the fourth quarter of 2010. The difference is due primarily to lower gains from property sales in 2011 partially offset by the non-cash impairment charge on certain land parcels in 2010 described above.
 
Year Ended December 31, 2011
 
FFO for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $2.41 per share compared to $2.07 per share in the same period of 2010.
 
Normalized FFO for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $2.43 per share compared to $2.27 per share in the same period of 2010.
 
Earnings for the year ended December 31, 2011 were $2.95 per share compared to $0.95 per share in the same period of 2010.
 
Same Store Results
 
On a same store fourth quarter over fourth quarter comparison, which includes 105,861 apartment units, revenues increased 5.8%, expenses increased 2.8% and NOI increased 7.6%.
 
On a same store year over year comparison, which includes 101,312 apartment units, revenues increased 5.0%, expenses increased 0.6% and NOI increased 7.7%.
 
Acquisitions/Dispositions
 
During the fourth quarter of 2011, the company acquired 11 properties with a total of 3,669 apartment units for an aggregate purchase price of $681.3 million at a weighted average capitalization (cap) rate of 5.2%.
 
Also during the quarter, the company acquired four land parcels for future development, one in New York City, one in San Francisco, one in Seattle and one in Southern California, for an aggregate purchase price of $183.9 million. Included in this total amount is the $134.0 million paid for the land parcel in New York City for a co-development with Toll Brothers (NYSE: TOL). Equity Residential funded $76.1 million of this purchase price and $57.9 million was funded by Toll Brothers. See page 11 of this release for further discussion.
 
During the quarter, the company sold two consolidated properties, consisting of 817 apartment units, for an aggregate sale price of $98.8 million at a weighted average cap rate of 6.2% generating an unlevered internal rate of return (IRR), inclusive of management costs, of 12.6%.
 
During 2011, the company acquired 20 stabilized properties, consisting of 6,103 apartment units, for an aggregate purchase price of $1.34 billion at a weighted average cap rate of 5.2%. The company also acquired one property in lease-up consisting of 95 apartment units for $39.5 million.
 
 
 
 
 
During 2011, the company acquired six land parcels - one in New York City, two in Southern California, one in San Francisco, one in Seattle and one in Washington, D.C.- and entered into a long-term ground lease on a parcel in New York City, all for future development, for an aggregate purchase price of $202.3 million. Included in this total amount is the $57.9 million funded by Toll Brothers for the parcel in New York City described above.
 
During 2011, the company sold 47 consolidated properties, consisting of 14,345 apartment units, for an aggregate sale price of $1.48 billion at a weighted average cap rate of 6.5% generating an unlevered IRR, inclusive of management costs, of 11.1%.
 
Archstone
 
As previously disclosed, on December 2, 2011 the company entered into a contract with affiliates of Bank of America and Barclays PLC to acquire, for $1.325 billion, half of their interests - an approximately 26.5% interest overall - in Archstone, a privately-held owner, operator and developer of multifamily apartment properties. On January 20, 2012, Lehman Brothers, the other owner of Archstone, acquired this 26.5% interest pursuant to a right of first offer and as a result the companys contract with the sellers was terminated.
 
Equity Residential now has the exclusive right, exercisable on or before February 19, 2012, to contract to purchase the remaining 26.5% interest in Archstone owned by the same sellers for a price, determined by the company, equal to $1.325 billion or higher. Any purchase of the remaining interest by the company would also be subject to Lehmans right of first offer, and if Lehman were to exercise such right, the company would be entitled to a break-up fee of up to $80 million, depending on the purchase price.
 
In 2011, the company incurred Archstone-related expenses of approximately $4.4 million. Approximately $2.6 million of this total was financing-related and $1.8 million was pursuit costs. These expenses are included in the companys FFO but not in its Normalized FFO.
 
Financing Activities
 
On December 12, 2011, the company closed a $1.0 billion unsecured note offering maturing December 15, 2021 with a coupon rate of 4.625% and an all-in effective interest rate of approximately 6.2% including the effect of fees and the termination of certain interest rate hedges. Proceeds from the issuance are being used to repay outstanding amounts on the companys revolving credit facility, pay termination costs on interest rate swaps, fund maturing debt and for other corporate purposes.
 
On January 6, 2012, the company amended its $1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility to increase the available borrowings by $500 million to $1.75 billion. The expansion was intended to fund a portion of an Archstone acquisition until repaid from property disposition proceeds, but may be used for any corporate purpose. The terms of the facility did not change, including the July 13, 2014 maturity date.
 
 
 
 
 
Also on January 6, 2012, the company entered into a new senior unsecured $500 million delayed draw term loan facility with an interest rate of LIBOR plus a spread (currently 1.25%) which is dependent on the credit rating of the companys long-term debt. The maturity date of the facility is January 4, 2013, subject to two one-year extension options exercisable by the company. The facility is currently undrawn and may be drawn anytime on or before July 4, 2012 and may be used to finance an Archstone acquisition, to repay the companys existing $500 million term loan that matures in October 2012 or for other corporate purposes.
 
With the completion of these financing activities, the company terminated the $1.0 billion bridge loan facility that it obtained contemporaneously with entering into the Archstone contract.
 
During the fourth quarter of 2011, utilizing the companys At-the-Market (ATM) share offering program, the company issued 827,686 common shares at an average price of $57.31 per share for total consideration of approximately $47.4 million. During 2011, the company issued approximately 3.9 million common shares at an average price of $52.23 per share for total consideration of approximately $201.9 million. During the first quarter of 2012, the company issued 201,284 common shares at an average price of $57.87 per share for total consideration of $11.6 million. The company will use the proceeds from these share sales primarily to fund its normal, ongoing investment activity, including development, and for general corporate purposes. The company has approximately 8.97 million common shares available for future issuance under this program. No additional ATM issuances are included in the companys 2012 guidance.
 
As of January 31, 2012, the company had cash on hand of approximately $265.2 million, approximately $1.7 billion available on its revolving credit facility and $500 million available on its delayed draw term loan.
 
2011 Common Share Dividend
 
For the full year 2011, the company paid a dividend of $1.58 per share which, per the companys stated policy, is approximately 65% of the companys Normalized FFO per share for the year and a 7.5% increase over the 2010 dividend.
 
First Quarter 2012 Guidance
 
The company has established a Normalized FFO guidance range of $0.58 to $0.62 per share for the first quarter of 2012. The difference between the companys fourth quarter 2011 Normalized FFO of $0.65 per share and the midpoint of the first quarter guidance range of $0.60 per share is primarily due to:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Full Year 2012 Guidance
 
The company has established a Normalized FFO guidance range of $2.68 to $2.78 per share for the full year 2012. The assumptions underlying this guidance can be found on page 27 of this release. The difference between the companys full-year 2011 Normalized FFO of $2.43 per share and the midpoint of the companys guidance range of $2.73 per share for full year 2012 Normalized FFO is primarily due to:
 
 
 
 
 
The companys 2012 guidance for Normalized FFO, FFO and earnings per share includes no impact, positive or negative, from the pursuit or acquisition of any interest in Archstone. Because Normalized FFO is designed to eliminate non-comparable items like pursuit costs and break-up fees, these items would not be included in Normalized FFO in any event.
 
2012 Common Share Dividend
 
The company expects to pay a dividend of $0.3375 per share for each of the first three quarters of 2012 and a fourth quarter dividend that would bring the full year amount to approximately 65% of the companys Normalized FFO per share for the year.
 
Based on the companys guidance range of $2.68 to $2.78 per share for 2012 Normalized FFO, the company estimates that its 2012 annual common share dividend would range from $1.74 to $1.81 per share. All future dividends remain subject to the discretion of the companys Board of Trustees.

Equity Residential expects to announce first quarter 2012 results on Wednesday, April 25, 2012 and host a conference call to discuss those results at 10:00 a.m. CT on Thursday, April 26, 2012.
