Exhibit 99.1
Equity Residential Reports First Quarter Results
Same Store Revenues Increase 5.5%; Same Store NOI Increases 7.8%
CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 25, 2012--Equity Residential (NYSE: EQR) today reported results for the quarter ended March 31, 2012. All per share results are reported on a fully-diluted basis.
"As we expected, and as demonstrated by our first quarter operating results, fundamentals continue to be strong across all of our core markets, said David J. Neithercut, Equity Residentials President and CEO. As we enter our primary leasing season, we continue to expect that we will achieve same store revenue growth for the year around the mid-point of our previously provided range of 5% to 6%.
First Quarter 2012
FFO (Funds from Operations), as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), for the first quarter of 2012 was $0.60 per share compared to $0.56 per share in the first quarter of 2011.
For the first quarter of 2012, the company reported Normalized FFO of $0.61 per share compared to $0.56 per share in the same period of 2011. The difference is due primarily to:
the positive impact of $0.07 per share from higher same store net operating income (NOI) and $0.02 per share from higher NOI from properties in lease-up;
the negative impact of $0.03 per share from 2011 and 2012 transaction activity; and
the negative impact of $0.01 per share from other items.
Normalized FFO begins with FFO and eliminates certain items that by their nature are not comparable from period to period or that tend to obscure the companys actual operating performance. A reconciliation and definition of Normalized FFO are provided on pages 6 and 25 of this release and the company has included guidance for Normalized FFO on page 24 of this release.
For the first quarter of 2012, the company reported earnings of $0.47 per share compared to $0.42 per share in the first quarter of 2011. The difference is due primarily to higher gains from property sales as well as the items discussed above.
Same Store Results
On a same store first quarter to first quarter comparison, which includes 105,612 apartment units, revenues increased 5.5%, expenses increased 1.8% and NOI increased 7.8%.
Acquisitions/Dispositions
During the first quarter of 2012, the company acquired three properties with a total of 544 apartment units for an aggregate purchase price of $159.1 million at a weighted average capitalization (cap) rate of 4.4%. Also during the quarter, the company acquired two land parcels, one in Seattle and one in South Florida, for an aggregate purchase price of $23.7 million.
During the quarter, the company sold three consolidated properties, consisting of 1,522 apartment units, for an aggregate sale price of $206.4 million at a weighted average cap rate of 6.2% generating an unlevered internal rate of return (IRR), inclusive of management costs, of 12.6%.
Archstone
As previously disclosed, on December 2, 2011 the company entered into a contract with affiliates of Bank of America and Barclays PLC (the Sellers) to acquire, for $1.325 billion, half of their interests - an approximately 26.5% interest overall - in Archstone, a privately-held owner, operator and developer of multifamily apartment properties. On January 20, 2012, Lehman Brothers, the other owner of Archstone, acquired this 26.5% interest pursuant to a right of first offer and the companys contract with the Sellers was terminated.
Equity Residential then had an exclusive 30-day right to contract to purchase the remaining 26.5% interest in Archstone owned by the Sellers for a price, determined by Equity Residential, equal to $1.325 billion or higher. During the first quarter of 2012, Equity Residential and the Sellers agreed to a 60-day extension of this purchase right at an increased minimum price of $1.485 billion. On April 18, 2012, the parties agreed to an additional extension and increase in the minimum purchase price. Equity Residential now has, until May 21, 2012, the exclusive right to contract to purchase this remaining interest at a price, to be determined by the company, equal to $1.5 billion or higher. Any offer to purchase the remaining interest would also be subject to Lehmans right of first offer. If Lehman were to exercise such right, the company would be entitled to a break-up fee of $80 million.
Financing Activities
On January 6, 2012, the company amended its $1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility to increase the available borrowings by $500 million to $1.75 billion. The expansion was intended to fund a portion of an Archstone acquisition until repaid from property disposition proceeds, but may be used for any corporate purpose. The terms of the facility did not change, including the July 13, 2014 maturity date.
Also on January 6, 2012, the company entered into a new senior unsecured $500 million delayed draw term loan facility with an interest rate of LIBOR plus a spread (currently 1.25%) which is dependent on the credit rating of the companys long-term debt. The maturity date of the facility is January 4, 2013, subject to two one-year extension options exercisable by the company. The facility provides for a single draw anytime on or before July 4, 2012 and may be used for any corporate purpose including to finance an Archstone acquisition or to repay the companys existing $500 million term loan that matures in October 2012.
With the completion of these financing activities, the company terminated the $1 billion bridge loan facility that it obtained contemporaneously with entering into the original Archstone contract.
During the first quarter of 2012, utilizing the companys At-the-Market (ATM) share offering program, the company issued approximately 2.1 million common shares at an average price of $59.47 per share for total consideration of approximately $123.6 million. The company will use the proceeds from these share sales primarily to fund its normal, ongoing investment activity, including development, and for general corporate purposes. The company has approximately 7.1 million common shares available for future issuance under this program. No additional ATM issuances are included in the companys 2012 guidance.
As of April 24, 2012, the company had cash on hand of approximately $54 million, approximately $1.7 billion available on its revolving credit facility and $500 million available on its delayed draw term loan.
Second Quarter 2012 Guidance
The company has established a Normalized FFO guidance range of $0.65 to $0.69 per share for the second quarter of 2012. The difference between the companys first quarter 2012 Normalized FFO of $0.61 per share and the midpoint of the second quarter guidance range of $0.67 per share is primarily due to:
the positive impact of $0.04 per share from same store and lease-up property NOI in the second quarter of 2012;
the positive impact of $0.01 per share from 2011 and 2012 transaction activity; and
the positive impact of $0.01 per share from lower total interest expense.
