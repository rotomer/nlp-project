Accordingly, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements.

11.8.2 Sellers shall use their Commercially Reasonable Efforts to (a) cause each of the Archstone Entities that is a corporation (for U.S. federal income tax purposes) to make a Tax election on IRS Form 8875 in effect at the time of the Closing for each such Archstone Entity to be treated as a "taxable REIT subsidiary" of Buyer or Buyer Designee if such Archstone Entity is eligible to make such election, (b) cooperate with Buyer and Buyer Designee (individually or as a group) to the extent reasonably requested by Buyer or Buyer Designee to ensure that the elections described in clause (a) above are made by each other corporation (for U.S. federal income Tax purposes) eligible to make such election in which one or more Archstone Entities acquires, directly or indirectly, a controlling interest in the future, (c) cause each of the Archstone Entities that is set forth on Schedule 5.8.3 to make an election pursuant to Section 754 of the Code for the taxable year in which Closing occurs, and (d) provide to Buyer or Buyer Designee information that is reasonably available to the Sellers upon their request (either individually or together with each other or with each other and Buyer or Buyer Designee) that is reasonably requested by Buyer or Buyer Designee (i) related to the income, operations and assets of the Archstone Entities to the extent relevant to determine whether a real estate investment trust under Subchapter M of the Code (a "REIT") that owned the Purchased Interests would satisfy the income requirements of Section 856, et. seq. of the Code, determined solely by reference to the Purchased Interests, and (ii) in respect of the allocations pursuant to Section 755 of the Code related to the Contemplated Transactions.
11.8.3 The provisions of this Section 11.8 shall survive the Closing with respect to any Seller only if and for so long as such Seller continues to hold any Other Interests.

The representations and warranties contained herein (other than the Seller Fundamental Representations and the Buyer Fundamental Representations) or in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement relating to the representations and warranties (other than the Seller Fundamental Representations and the Buyer Fundamental Representations) and the covenants contained herein that are to be performed at or prior to the Closing shall terminate as of the Closing. The Seller Fundamental Representations and the Buyer Fundamental Representations, and the right to make a claim for indemnification with respect to the Seller Fundamental Representations and the Buyer Fundamental Representations, shall survive until the fifth anniversary of the Closing. All covenants and agreements which apply after the Closing shall survive the Closing in accordance with their terms and all claims related to the matters described in Sections 12.2.2(b) through 12.2.2(c) shall survive until the fifth anniversary of the Closing. It is understood and agreed that (a) after the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any breach of this Agreement shall be a claim for Losses made pursuant to (and subject to the limitations of) this Article 12; provided that notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall limit the right of any Party (A) to pursue an action for or to seek remedies with respect to claims for fraud or willful misconduct, or (B) to seek specific performance or other equitable relief in accordance with Section 13.4; and (b) before the Closing, the Parties shall be entitled only to the termination and other remedies set forth in Article 13, and indemnification under this Article 12 shall not apply.

12.2.2 Effective as of the Closing and subject to the limitations set forth in this Article 12, Sellers shall severally, and not jointly and severally, indemnify Buyer, Buyer Designee, their respective Affiliates and their respective Representatives (together, in each case, with their respective successors and permitted assigns, the "Buyer Indemnified Parties") against, and hold them harmless from, any and all Losses (including any Losses incurred by any Archstone Entity) to the extent arising out of, resulting from or related to:
 
 
provided, however, that for the avoidance of doubt, in respect of clauses (a), (b) and (c), Sellers shall only be liable for damages payable to a holder of Series O, Series P and Series Q Preferred Units of Archstone or Series I Preferred Units of Archstone Multifamily Series I Trust to the extent the sum of (i)(x) the amounts payable to such holder, plus (y) the liquidation preference of any such Preferred Units held by such holder of such Preferred Units following resolution of any applicable Proceeding, exceeds (ii) the amount of principal (plus any accrued but unpaid dividends on the date of redemption) required to redeem such Preferred Units.

12.3.5 In no event shall the total amount of Losses for which Sellers are liable under Section 12.2.2 as a result of any Proceeding instituted by a Bridge Equity Provider (as defined in the Bridge Equity Providers Agreement) against any Seller, any Buyer Indemnified Party or any Archstone Entity exceed $10,000,000 in the aggregate. In addition, in no event shall any Seller be liable under Section 12.2.2 for any Losses with respect to any Proceedings instituted by a Bridge Equity Provider (as defined in the Bridge Equity Providers Agreement) against any Seller, any Buyer Indemnified Party or any Archstone Entity after the Closing Date.

12.3.6 For any matters that are indemnifiable by any Indemnifying Party under Section 12.2.1 or Section 12.2.2, (a) if any Losses with respect to such matters are out-of-pocket Losses, then such Losses shall not be payable to the Indemnified Party until such expense has actually been incurred and an invoice related thereto has been submitted for payment, or (b) if any Losses relate to the settlement of any claim or judgment, then such Losses shall not be payable to the Indemnified Party until the earliest of (i) the time when such settlement amount or judgment-related amount has actually been paid, (ii) with respect to any judgment, when the judgment has become final and non-appealable, and (iii) when a surety bond in respect thereof is required to be posted.
12.3.7 With respect to Losses arising from a breach of a Seller Fundamental Representation that does not relate solely to a single Seller or the Purchased Interests sold by a single Seller and with respect to any matter set forth in Section 12.2.2(b) or (c), each Seller shall be responsible for its ratable portion of such Losses based on the percentage of the aggregate purchase price paid by Buyer hereunder that was received by such Seller.

12.5 Indemnification Procedures.
12.5.1 If any Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party, as the case may be, seeks to make a claim for indemnification (an "Indemnified Claim") pursuant to Section 12.2.1 or Section 12.2.2, as applicable, other than in respect of a Third Party Claim, the Party entitled to indemnification (the "Indemnified Party") shall notify the party required to provide indemnity hereunder (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing of such claim specifying in reasonable detail the factual basis of such claim, stating the amount of Losses (or if not known, a good faith estimate of the amount of Losses) and the method of computation thereof, containing a reference to any and all provisions of this Agreement with respect to which indemnification is being sought (each such notice, a "Claim Notice"). The failure by any Indemnified Party to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability under this Agreement which it may have to such Indemnified Party under Section 12.2 hereof except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been prejudiced with respect to such individual indemnified claim in any material respect as a result of such failure. The Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall endeavor to negotiate in good faith a resolution of any dispute described in a Claim Notice and, if not resolved through negotiations within 60 days after the delivery of the Claim Notice, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation as provided in Section 14.5. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, any payment under this Section 12.5.1 shall be treated as an adjustment to the purchase price hereunder for Tax purposes.
12.5.2 In the event that any claim is asserted in writing by any Person other than a Buyer Indemnified Party or a Seller Indemnified Party or any Proceeding is commenced or threatened in writing by any Person other than a Buyer Indemnified Party or a Seller Indemnified Party involving a claim for which an Indemnifying Party may be obligated to indemnify an Indemnified Party (a "Third Party Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall give written notice to the Indemnifying Party promptly (and in any event within 30 days) after the Indemnified Party receives written notification of the facts giving rise to such Third Party Claim, specifying in reasonable detail the factual basis of the Third Party Claim, stating the amount of Losses (or if not known, a good faith estimate of the amount of Losses) and the method of computation thereof, containing a reference to any and all provisions of this Agreement with respect to which indemnification is being sought. The failure of an Indemnified Party to provide notice in accordance with this Section 12.5.2, or any delay in providing such notice, shall not constitute a waiver of that Indemnified Party's claims to indemnification pursuant to Section 12.2, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party shall have been prejudiced in any material respect as a result of such failure, or (ii) such notice is not delivered to the Indemnifying Party prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period set forth in Section 12.1. Any such notice to the Indemnifying Party of a Third Party Claim shall be accompanied by a copy of any papers theretofore served on or delivered to the Indemnified Party in connection with such Third Party Claim.
 
 
 
 
12.6 Existing Claims. Each of Sellers acknowledges and agrees that, as of the date of this Agreement, (a) the Archstone Entities have suffered Losses in connection with the Acquisition Litigation, including legal fees and related expenses, and (b) Sellers shall be responsible for indemnifying and holding harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties in accordance with Section 12.2.2 solely for Losses incurred from and after September 30, 2011.
12.7 Litigation Cooperation. Buyer shall, and shall cause each of the other Buyer Indemnified Parties to, use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to facilitate the participation by Sellers in the conduct of the Acquisition Litigation, including by (a) promptly informing Sellers of the receipt of any notices, correspondence, Filings or other communications with respect to the matters described in Section 12.2.2(b) and 12.2.2(c), (b) keeping Sellers reasonably apprised of the status of Proceedings with respect to the matters described in Section 12.2.2(b) and 12.2.2(c), including by providing Sellers with prior notice of any anticipated vote (including any vote on any "Major Matter" or "Special Major Matter" (as such terms are defined in the Voting Agreement)) by any Buyer Indemnified Party (in its capacity as a direct or indirect equityholder and/or director of the Archstone Entities or any of their Affiliates) on all matters relating to the matters described in Section 12.2.2(b), (c) consulting with Sellers prior to voting on any matter described in clause (b) of this Section 12.7, (d) providing Sellers with access to records, documents or other information of the Archstone Entities or any of their Affiliates to the extent relevant to the matters described in Section 12.2.2(b) and 12.2.2(c), and (e) providing Sellers and their counsel with a reasonable opportunity to comment on any notices, correspondence, Filings or other communications by the Buyer Indemnified Parties or the Archstone Entities or any of their Affiliates concerning the matters described in Section 12.2.2(b) and 12.2.2(c) and to give good faith consideration to any such comments of Sellers. Buyer shall, and shall cause each of the other Buyer Indemnified Parties to, use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause the Archstone Entities not to enter into any settlement, compromise or discharge of any claims relating to the Acquisition Litigation without the prior written consent of the Sellers with respect to which Buyer or any Buyer Indemnified Parties intend to seek indemnification under Section 12.2.2
12.8 Tax Benefits. In calculating the amount of any Losses payable under this Article 12, there shall be deducted from any such Losses payable to the Indemnified Party an amount equal to any cash Tax benefit realized or to be realized in the same Taxable period as the period during which the Indemnified Party became entitled to indemnification with respect to the applicable Loss under this Article 12 (including any cash Tax benefit realized or to be realized in the same Taxable period as the period during which the Indemnified Party became entitled to indemnification with respect to the applicable Loss under Article 12 as a result of being an equity owner in any the Archstone Entities). If a cash Tax benefit with respect to a Loss that has been the subject of indemnification under this Article 12 is realized by an Indemnified Party in another Taxable period that ends on or prior to the three-year anniversary of the date on which such Loss was incurred, then payments shall be made by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party to reflect such cash Tax benefit at the time of realization. In the event there are any indemnity payments required under this Article 12, the Indemnified Party shall provide on an annual basis a certification by a responsible tax officer of the amount (if any) of a cash Tax benefit that would reduce the amount of any such indemnity payments or give rise to an obligation to make a payment to the Indemnifying Party under this Section 12.8. In applying the foregoing, to the extent that the Purchased Interests are held by a REIT or by an entity that is a disregarded entity or partnership for U.S. federal income Tax purposes in which a REIT owns, directly or indirectly, the beneficial interests, then no Tax benefit shall be considered to have been realized with respect to the beneficial interests owned directly or indirectly by the REIT.
12.9 Third Party Recovery. In calculating the amount of any Losses payable under this Article 12, there shall be deducted from any such Losses payable to the Indemnified Party an amount equal to any payment received from a third party (including an insurer) by such Indemnified Party in respect of any such Loss (or by an Archstone Entity, in respect of any Losses by the Archstone Entities for which the Indemnified Party is indemnified). If an Indemnified Party recovers an amount from a third party (including an insurer) in respect of a Loss that is the subject of indemnification hereunder after all or a portion of such Loss has been paid by the Indemnifying Party hereunder pursuant to this Article 12, the Indemnified Party shall promptly remit to the Indemnifying Party the excess (if any) of (i) the amount paid by the Indemnifying Party in respect of such Loss, plus the amount actually received from the Third Party in respect thereof, over (ii) the full amount of the Loss.
13.1 Termination of Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this Agreement may be terminated and the Contemplated Transactions may be abandoned at any time prior to the Closing as provided in this Article 13.
13.1.1 Consent. Buyer and Sellers may terminate this Agreement by mutual written consent.
13.1.2 Expiration; Illegality; Prohibition. Either Buyer or any Seller may terminate this Agreement by written notice to the other Parties:
 
 
13.1.3 Breach. Buyer or any Seller may terminate this Agreement by written notice to the other Parties in the event of a breach by the other Party of any covenant or agreement under this Agreement (including the breach of representations and warranties set forth herein), where the effect of such breach would be to cause the conditions to the obligation to consummate the Closing of the terminating Party not to be capable of being satisfied, and such breach is not cured by the breaching Party within 20 Business Days following receipt of written notice from the terminating Party of the breach or alleged breach, which written notice shall state that, unless such breach is cured in accordance with this Section 13.1.3, the terminating Party intends to terminate this Agreement (it being understood that such 20-Business Day cure period shall not extend the Expiration Date).
13.1.4 Satisfaction of Conditions to Closing. Buyer or any Seller may terminate this Agreement by written notice to the other Parties if any event shall occur after the date of this Agreement that shall have made it impossible to satisfy a condition precedent to the terminating Party's obligations to perform its obligations hereunder, unless the occurrence of such event shall be due to the failure of the terminating Party to perform or comply with any of the agreements, covenants or conditions hereof to be performed or complied with by such Party prior to the Closing. Buyer shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement due to the inability of the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 8.4 to be satisfied only if Buyer provides written notice terminating this Agreement within 20 days after the date on which Sellers provide notice to Buyer that the Archstone Entities have taken the action that caused the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 8.4 not to be satisfied; provided that Buyer shall have stated in its notice objecting to such action, as described in Section 8.4, that such action would cause the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 8.4 not to be satisfied.
13.2 Effect of Termination; Remedies. In the event of the termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Contemplated Transactions pursuant to Section 13.1:
13.2.1 this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and of no further force and effect, except that Section 11.5, this Section 13.2, Section 13.3 and Article 14 and all applicable definitions in this Agreement shall survive such termination;
13.2.2 Buyer shall return all documents, work papers and other materials (and all copies thereof) obtained from any Archstone Entity, any Seller or any of their respective Representatives relating to the Contemplated Transactions, whether so obtained before or after the execution hereof, to Sellers and otherwise comply with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement;
13.2.3 Sellers shall return all documents, work papers and other materials (and all copies thereof) obtained from any Buyer or any of its Representatives relating to the Contemplated Transactions, whether so obtained before or after the execution hereof, to Buyer;
13.2.4 all filings, applications and other submissions made to any Person, including any Governmental Authority, in connection with the Contemplated Transactions shall, to the extent practicable, be withdrawn from such Person; and
13.2.5 the sole and exclusive rights and remedies of a Party, if any, following a termination under Section 13.1 shall be termination of this Agreement without other recourse and the rights and remedies, if any, available under Section 13.3, if applicable, shall be in lieu of any other rights or remedies available by applicable Law or otherwise.
13.3 Termination Remedies. In the event that:
13.3.1 this Agreement shall be terminated by Buyer in accordance with Section 13.1.4 due to the inability of the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 8.4 to be satisfied, then if, on or prior to the 6-month anniversary of the date of termination of this Agreement, (i) any Seller enters into any agreement or agreements with respect to the sale to any Person (other than Buyer and its Affiliates) of, an amount of its interests in the Archstone Entities equal to or greater than the portion of such Seller's interests in the Archstone Entities on the date of this Agreement represented by the Purchased Interests held by it in one or a series of related transactions, and (ii) such sale of interests in the Archstone Entities to the Person referred to in clause (i) above is consummated in one or a series of related transactions, then such Seller shall pay to Buyer within 10 days following the date of such sale, an amount equal to 3.5% of any purchase price received by such Seller pursuant thereto (any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 13.3.1, the "Buyer Liquidated Damages Amount"); or
13.3.2 this Agreement shall be terminated by any Party in accordance with Section 13.1.4 due to the inability of the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 7.3 to be satisfied, then the Sellers shall pay to Buyer (x) simultaneously with the consummation of the sale by Sellers of the Purchased Interests pursuant to the Lehman IPA, in the case of a sale of the
Purchased Interests to Lehman in accordance with the Omnibus Agreement, or (y) within three (3) Business Days after the consummation of any other sale of the Purchased Interests pursuant to the exercise of a right of first offer, an amount equal to $80,000,000 (the "Breakup Fee"); provided that each Seller shall only be responsible for its ratable portion of such Breakup Fee based on the percentage of the aggregate purchase price that was received by such Seller in such sale of the Purchased Interests; provided further that under no circumstances pursuant to this Section 13.3.2 shall (i) Barclays be responsible for an amount payable under the Breakup Fee in excess of $37,947,532, (ii) BANA be responsible for an amount payable under the Breakup Fee in excess of $42,011,962 or (iii) BofA Strategic be responsible for an amount payable under the Breakup Fee in excess of $40,506. In the event that, on or prior to the date that is more than 30 and less than 120 days following the date that Sellers sell the Purchased Interests pursuant to the exercise of a right of first offer, Buyer enters into an Entire Company Sale (as defined in the Omnibus Agreement), then, on the date of the closing of the Entire Company Sale, Buyer shall pay to the Sellers all or a portion of the Breakup Fee previously paid to Buyer in accordance with the terms of the Omnibus Agreement.
For the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances shall the Breakup Fee and the Buyer Liquidated Damages Amount both be payable to Buyer. Either the Buyer Liquidated Damages Amount or the Breakup Fee shall be payable, if applicable, under this Section 13.3, without further liability on the part of Sellers. Sellers agree that (a) the Contemplated Transactions are unique and that damages for failure by Sellers to consummate the Contemplated Transactions will be extremely difficult and impracticable to ascertain, (b) the Buyer Liquidated Damages Amount is a reasonable and rational estimate at this time and is an acceptable damages amount to Buyer upon the occurrence of the events described in Section 13.3.1, (c) the Breakup Fee is a reasonable and rational estimate at this time and is an acceptable damages amount to Buyer upon the occurrence of the events described in Section 13.3.2, and (d) neither the Buyer Liquidated Damages Amount nor the Breakup Fee is intended as a penalty, but as full liquidated damages under this Agreement and as compensation for Buyer's losses and other expenses associated with this Agreement solely with respect to any termination of this Agreement by Buyer under Section 13.1.4 due to the inability of the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 8.4 to be satisfied or by any Party under Section 13.1.4 due to the inability of the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 7.3 to be satisfied. The agreements contained in this Section 13.3 are an integral part of the Contemplated Transactions and the Parties agree that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement. In addition, the Parties acknowledge that in the absence of a waiver, a bond or undertaking may be required by a court and the Parties hereby waive any such requirement of such a bond or undertaking.
13.4 Specific Performance. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that, subject to the terms of Section 13.3, each of the Parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof pursuant to this Section 13.4, in addition to any other remedy at law or in equity. It is accordingly agreed that, subject to the terms and conditions of Section 13.3, any Seller or Buyer shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the other Parties and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, without the necessity of posting bonds or other undertaking in connection therewith; it being understood and agreed that, notwithstanding the first sentence
of this Section 13.4 or anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, a Party's right to specific performance to require the other Parties to consummate the Closing shall remain subject to the satisfaction (or waiver by the applicable Party) of the conditions to Closing hereunder. Any requirements for the securing or posting of any bond with such remedy are hereby waived.
14.1 Notices. All notices, consents and other communications hereunder shall be in writing (including telecopy or similar writing) and shall be deemed to have been duly given (a) when delivered by hand or by Federal Express or a similar overnight courier to (or if that day is not a Business Day, or if delivered after 5:00 p.m., New York, New York time on a Business Day, on the first following day that is a Business Day), (b) five (5) days after being deposited in any United States Post Office enclosed in a postage prepaid, registered or certified envelope addressed to, or (c) when successfully transmitted by facsimile (with a confirming copy of such communication to be sent as provided in clauses (a) or (b) above) to, the Party for whom intended, at the address or facsimile number for such Party set forth below (or to such other address or facsimile number and with such other copies, as such Party may hereafter specify for the purpose by notice to the other Party):

14.2 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the other Transaction Documents, the Omnibus Agreement and the other documents and instruments referred to herein and therein) and the Disclosure Schedules sets forth the entire agreement and understanding of the Parties in respect of the Contemplated Transactions and supersedes all prior discussions, negotiations, agreements, arrangements and understandings, whether oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof. There are no warranties, representations or other agreements between the Parties in connection with the subject matter of this Agreement, except as specifically set forth in this Agreement.
14.3 Amendments and Waivers.
14.3.1 Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or modified only by a written instrument signed by all of the Parties hereto.
14.3.2 No waiver hereunder shall be valid or binding unless set forth in writing and duly executed by the Party against whom enforcement of the waiver is sought. Any such waiver shall constitute a waiver only with respect to the specific matter described in such writing and shall in no way impair the rights of the Party granting such waiver in any other respect or at any other time. Neither the waiver by any of the Parties of a breach of or a default under any of
the provisions of this Agreement, nor the failure by any of the Parties, on one or more occasions, to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement or to exercise any right or privilege hereunder, shall be construed as a waiver of any other breach or default of a similar nature, or as a waiver of any of such provisions, rights or privileges hereunder. Except as otherwise provided herein, no action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf of any Party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the Party taking such action of compliance with any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement.
14.4 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed, performed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware (without giving effect to its principles or rules of conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would require or permit the application of the laws of another jurisdiction).
14.5 Jurisdiction and Venue.
14.5.1 Each of the Parties irrevocably agrees that any legal action or Proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder brought by the other Party or its successors or assigns, shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or Proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts, agrees that it will not bring any Proceeding relating to this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions in any court other than the aforesaid courts and waives any objection to venue laid therein. Process in any such Proceeding may be served on any Party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the State of Delaware. Without limiting the foregoing, Sellers and Buyer agree that service of process upon such Party at the address referred to in Section 14.1, together with written notice of such service to such Party, shall be deemed effective service of process upon such Party.
14.5.2 Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any Proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with Section 14.1, (b) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law, any claim that (i) the Proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such Proceeding is improper, or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.
14.6 WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY.
14.6.1
EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS
The scope of this waiver is intended to be all-encompassing of any and all disputes that may be filed in any court and that relate to the subject matter of the Contemplated Transactions, including contract claims, tort claims, breach of duty claims and all other common law and statutory claims. In the event of litigation, this Agreement may be filed as a written consent to a trial by the court.
LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS. THIS WAIVER MAY NOT BE MODIFIED EITHER ORALLY OR IN WRITING (OTHER THAN BY A MUTUAL WRITTEN WAIVER SPECIFICALLY REFERRING TO THIS SECTION 14.6.1) AND EXECUTED BY EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO). THIS WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENTS OR DOCUMENTS RELATING TO THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS.
14.6.2
EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14.6.
14.7 Binding Effect. This Agreement will be binding upon, inure solely to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns.
14.8 Interpretation. As used in this Agreement and required by the context, the singular and plural shall be deemed to include all genders; words importing persons shall include partnerships, corporations and other entities; when reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, Section, Schedule or Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Article, Section, Schedule or Exhibit of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated; and the terms "herein," "hereof" and "hereunder" or other similar terms, refer to this Agreement as a whole and not only to the particular sentence, subsection or section in which any such term may be employed. Whenever in this Agreement the word "including" is used, it shall be deemed to be for purposes of identifying only one or more of the possible alternatives, and the entire provision in which such word appears shall be read as if the phrase "including without limitation" were actually used in the text. The section headings herein are for convenience only and shall not affect the construction hereof. All references to dollars (or the symbol "$") contained herein shall be deemed to refer to United States dollars. Where any provision in this Agreement refers to action to be taken by any Person, or which such Person is prohibited from taking, such provision shall be applicable whether the action in question is taken directly or indirectly by such Person. Except when used together with the word "either" or otherwise for the purpose of identifying mutually exclusive alternatives, the term "or" has the inclusive meaning represented by the
phrase "and/or". With regard to each and every term and condition of this Agreement, the Parties understand and agree that the same have or has been mutually negotiated, prepared and drafted, and that if at any time the Parties desire or are required to interpret or construe any such term or condition or any agreement or instrument subject thereto, no consideration shall be given to the issue of which Party actually prepared, drafted or requested any term or condition of this Agreement.
14.9 Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, such term, provision, covenant or restriction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement, and the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the Contemplated Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such a determination, the Parties shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to affect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the Contemplated Transactions shall be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.
14.10 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and delivered in multiple counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. It is the express intent of the Parties to be bound by the exchange of signatures on this Agreement via facsimile or electronic mail via the portable document format (PDF). A facsimile or other copy of a signature shall be deemed an original. This Agreement shall become effective when each Party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other Parties hereto. Until and unless each Party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other Parties hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no Party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other communication).
14.11 Third Parties. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, no provision of this Agreement is intended or shall confer on any Person, other than the Parties (and their successors and permitted assigns), any rights under this Agreement and no other Person shall be entitled to rely thereon.
14.12 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred by any Party (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Party shall have the right to assign all or certain provisions of this Agreement, or any interest herein, and may delegate any duty or obligation hereunder, without the consent of the other Parties, (i) to any Affiliate of such Party, or (ii) at any time after the Closing, to any purchaser of all or substantially all of the assets or Equity Interests (whether by merger, recapitalization, reorganization or otherwise) of such Party; provided that, in the case of each of clauses (i) through (ii), no such assignment or delegation shall relieve such Party of any of its obligations hereunder. Any attempted assignment, delegation or transfer in violation of this Section 14.12 shall be null and void.
14.13 Schedules and Exhibits. The schedules and exhibits, if any, referenced in this Agreement constitute an integral part of this Agreement and are incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof. Any information disclosed in a schedule or a section of any such schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed in such other schedules or sections of any such schedule to the extent that the disclosure is reasonably apparent from its face to be applicable to such other schedule or section of any such schedule. Disclosure of any fact or item in any schedule shall not be deemed to constitute an admission that such item or fact is material for the purposes of this Agreement.
14.14 Time Periods. Any action required hereunder to be taken within a certain number of days shall, unless otherwise provided herein, be taken within that number of calendar days; provided, however, that if the last day for taking such action falls on a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday, the period during which such action may be taken shall be extended to the next Business Day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have executed and delivered this Agreement as of the date set forth above.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(i) with respect to Applicable Purchased Interests for which the allocated Purchase Price is $1.00 or $100,000, there will be no change in the allocable Purchase Price; and
(ii) with respect to all other Applicable Purchased Interests, the remaining portion of each of the BANA Purchase Price and the Barclays Purchase Price, after deducting the amounts referred to in clause (i), will be allocated separately in accordance with the "waterfall" contained in the applicable Organizational Documents for the Primary Archstone Entities and the amounts that are allocated to each such Applicable Purchased Interest in such waterfall will be the allocated Purchase Price for purposes of the table above.

Statements in this news release, and other statements that Equity Residential may make, including statements about the transactions described in this release, may contain forward-looking or other statements that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. The statements contained in this news release that are not purely historical are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including, without limitation, statements regarding the management of Equity Residential's expectations, beliefs and intentions. All forward-looking statements included in this communication are based on information available to Equity Residential on the date hereof. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "may," "can," "will," "should," "could," "expects," "plans," "anticipates," "intends," "believes," "estimates," "predicts," "potential," "targets," "goals," "projects," "outlook," "continue," "preliminary," "guidance," or variations of such words, similar expressions, or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology.

Accordingly, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Neither Equity Residential nor any other person can assume responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of forward-looking statements. There are various important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in any such forward-looking statements, many of which are beyond Equity Residential's control.

Equity Residential undertakes no obligation (and expressly disclaims any such obligation) to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
