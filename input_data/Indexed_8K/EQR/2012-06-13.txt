Item 8.01 Other Events
Equity Residential (the "Company") and ERP Operating Limited Partnership (the "Operating Partnership") are re-issuing in an updated format their historical financial statements to satisfy SEC requirements as they relate to discontinued operations.
The results of operations of the Companys and the Operating Partnership's consolidated properties that were sold during the first three months of 2012 were reported as a component of discontinued operations for each period presented (including the comparable period of the prior year) in the Companys and the Operating Partnership's first quarter 2012 quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on May 3, 2012. Under SEC requirements, the same reclassification as discontinued operations is required for previously issued annual financial statements for each of the three years shown in the Companys and the Operating Partnership's most recent annual report on Form 10-K, if those financial statements are incorporated by reference in subsequent filings with the SEC made under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, even though those financial statements relate to periods prior to the sale date.
The aforementioned reclassification has no effect on the Companys and the Operating Partnership's previously reported net income, net income available to Common Shares/Units, funds from operations (FFO), FFO available to Common Shares and Units / Units, normalized funds from operations (Normalized FFO) or Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units / Units.
This report on Form 8-K updates Items 6, 7, 8 and 15 (Exhibit 12 only) of the Companys and the Operating Partnership's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 to reclassify those properties sold during the first three months of 2012 as a component of discontinued operations for each period presented in the annual report. Exhibit 12 also reflects certain interim information for the quarters ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. All other items of the Companys and the Operating Partnership's Form 10-K remain unchanged. No attempt has been made to update matters in the Form 10-K except to the extent expressly provided above.

Exhibit 12
(1) For the quarter ended March 31, 2011 and the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the coverage deficiencies approximated $14.1 million, $118.4 million, $116.2 million, $188.1 million and $151.0 million, respectively. All ratios have been reduced due to the disposition of properties which resulted in the inclusion of those properties in discontinued operations. The ratios have been further reduced due to non-cash depreciation expense and impairment charges and premiums on the redemption of Preferred Shares/Preference Units. The Company was in compliance with its unsecured public debt covenants for all periods presented.

Table of Contents
We may also acquire multifamily properties that are unoccupied or in the early stages of lease up. We may be unable to lease up these apartment properties on schedule, resulting in decreases in expected rental revenues and/or lower yields due to lower occupancy and rates as well as higher than expected concessions. We may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired property up to standards established for its intended market position or to complete a development property. Additionally, we expect that other real estate investors with capital will compete with us for attractive investment opportunities or may also develop properties in markets where we focus our development and acquisition efforts. This competition (or lack thereof) may increase (or depress) prices for multifamily properties. We may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms. We have acquired in the past and intend to continue to pursue the acquisition of properties and portfolios of properties, including large portfolios, that could increase our size and result in alterations to our capital structure. The total number of apartment units under development, costs of development and estimated completion dates are subject to uncertainties arising from changing economic conditions (such as the cost of labor and construction materials), competition and local government regulation;
Forward-looking statements and related uncertainties are also included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.
Overview
Equity Residential (EQR), a Maryland real estate investment trust (REIT) formed in March 1993, is an S&P 500 company focused on the acquisition, development and management of high quality apartment properties in top United States growth markets. ERP Operating Limited Partnership (ERPOP), an Illinois limited partnership, was formed in May 1993 to conduct the multifamily residential property business of Equity Residential. EQR has elected to be taxed as a REIT. References to the Company, we, us or our mean collectively EQR, ERPOP and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by EQR and/or ERPOP. References to the Operating Partnership mean collectively ERPOP and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by ERPOP.
EQR is the general partner of, and as of
December 31, 2011
owned an approximate
95.7%
ownership interest in ERPOP. All of the Company's property ownership, development and related business operations are conducted through the Operating Partnership and EQR has no material assets or liabilities other than its investment in ERPOP. EQR issues public equity from time to time but does not have any indebtedness as all debt is incurred by the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership holds substantially all of the assets of the Company, including the Company's ownership interests in its joint ventures. The Operating Partnership conducts the operations of the business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity.
The Company's corporate headquarters are located in Chicago, Illinois and the Company also operates property management offices in each of its markets. As of
December 31, 2011
, the Company had approximately
3,800
employees who provided real estate operations, leasing, legal, financial, accounting, acquisition, disposition, development and other support functions.
Business Objectives and Operating and Investing Strategies
The Company invests in apartment communities located in strategically targeted markets with the goal of maximizing our risk adjusted total return (operating income plus capital appreciation) on invested capital.
Our operating focus is on balancing occupancy and rental rates to maximize our revenue while exercising tight cost control to generate the highest possible return to our shareholders. Revenue is maximized by attracting qualified prospects to our properties, cost-effectively converting these prospects into new residents and keeping our residents satisfied so they will renew
12
Table of Contents
their leases upon expiration. While we believe that it is our high-quality, well-located assets that bring our customers to us, it is the customer service and superior value provided by our on-site personnel that keeps them renting with us and recommending us to their friends.
We use technology to engage our customers in the way that they want to be engaged. Many of our residents utilize our web-based resident portal which allows them to sign their lease, review their account and make payments, provide feedback and make service requests on-line.
We seek to maximize capital appreciation of our properties by investing in markets that are characterized by conditions favorable to multifamily property appreciation. These markets generally feature one or more of the following:
Acquisitions and developments may be financed from various sources of capital, which may include retained cash flow, issuance of additional equity and debt, sales of properties and joint venture agreements. In addition, the Company may acquire properties in transactions that include the issuance of limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership (OP Units) as consideration for the acquired properties. Such transactions may, in certain circumstances, enable the sellers to defer, in whole or in part, the recognition of taxable income or gain that might otherwise result from the sales. The Company may acquire land parcels to hold and/or sell based on market opportunities. The Company may also seek to acquire properties by purchasing defaulted or distressed debt that encumbers desirable properties in the hope of obtaining title to property through foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure proceedings. The Company has also, in the past, converted some of its properties and sold them as condominiums but is not currently active in this line of business.
Over the past several years, the Company has done an extensive repositioning of its portfolio from low barrier to entry/non-core markets to high barrier to entry/core markets. Since 2005, the Company has sold over 124,000 apartment units primarily in its non-core markets for an aggregate sales price of approximately $10.0 billion, acquired over 42,000 apartment units in its core markets for approximately $9.4 billion and began approximately $2.7 billion of development projects in its core markets. We are currently seeking to acquire and develop assets primarily in the following targeted metropolitan areas: Boston, New York, Washington DC, South Florida, Southern California, San Francisco and Seattle. We also have investments (in the aggregate about 19.2% of our NOI at
December 31, 2011
) in other markets including Denver, Atlanta, Phoenix, New England (excluding Boston), Orlando and Jacksonville but do not currently intend to acquire or develop new assets in these markets.
As part of its strategy, the Company purchases completed and fully occupied apartment properties, partially completed or partially occupied properties or land on which apartment properties can be constructed. We intend to hold a diversified portfolio of assets across our target markets. As of
December 31, 2011
, no single metropolitan area accounted for more than 15.3% of our NOI, though no guarantee can be made that NOI concentration may not increase in the future.
We endeavor to attract and retain the best employees by providing them with the education, resources and opportunities to succeed. We provide many classroom and on-line training courses to assist our employees in interacting with prospects and residents as well as extensively train our customer service specialists in maintaining the equipment and appliances on our property sites. We actively promote from within and many senior corporate and property leaders have risen from entry level or junior positions. We monitor our employees' engagement by surveying them annually and have consistently received high engagement scores.
We have a commitment to sustainability and consider the environmental impacts of our business activities. We have a dedicated in-house team that initiates and applies sustainable practices in all aspects of our business, including transactions, property operations and property management activities. With its high density, multifamily housing is, by its nature, an environmentally friendly property type. Our recent acquisition and development activities have been primarily concentrated in pedestrian-friendly urban locations near public transportation. When developing and renovating our properties, we strive to reduce energy and water usage by investing in energy saving technology while positively impacting the experience of our residents and the value of our assets. We continue to implement a combination of irrigation, lighting and HVAC improvements at our properties that will reduce energy and water consumption.

Current Environment
We expect strong growth in 2012 same store revenue (anticipated increase ranging from 5.0% to 6.0%) and 2012 NOI (anticipated increase ranging from 6.5% to 8.5%) and are optimistic that the strength in fundamentals realized in 2011 will be sustained for the foreseeable future. We believe the key drivers behind the anticipated increases in revenue are base rent pricing, renewal pricing, resident turnover and physical occupancy. Despite extremely slow growth in the overall economy, our business continues to perform well as evidenced by rising base and renewal rents. Our relatively stable turnover and solid occupancy, which we anticipate will continue throughout 2012, provide us with the ability to increase rental rates. The combined forces of demographics, household formations and the continued aversion to home ownership should ensure a continued strong demand for rental housing.
The Company anticipates that 2012 same store expenses will increase 1.5% to 2.5% primarily due to increases in real estate taxes, utilities and payroll. Real estate taxes are expected to increase 4.0% to 5.0% in 2012 most significantly due to the burn off of 421a tax abatements in New York City but also due to expected value and rate increases in some of our jurisdictions. Utilities are expected to grow 1.5% to 2.5% in 2012 as increases in water, sewer and trash are partially offset by decreases in natural gas rates. On-site payroll is expected to increase by approximately 1.0% in 2012 as normal annual merit increases in payroll should be mitigated by improvements in technology and automation. This follows several years of excellent expense control, with a compounded annual growth in same store expenses of approximately 1.0% over the last five years.
The Company continues to sell non-core assets and reduce its exposure to non-core markets as we believe these assets do not fit into our long term plans and we can sell them for prices that we believe are favorable. The Company sold 47 consolidated properties consisting of 14,345 apartment units for $1.48 billion during the year ended December 31, 2011. The Company's decision to accelerate the timing and increase the volume of dispositions combined with reinvestment of the cash proceeds in assets with lower cap rates (see definition below) later in 2011 was dilutive to our 2011 per share results. The Company defines dilution from transactions as the lost NOI from sales proceeds that were not reinvested in other apartment properties or were reinvested in properties with a lower cap rate. The Company anticipates consolidated dispositions of approximately $1.25 billion during the year ended December 31, 2012.
Competition for the properties we are interested in acquiring is significant due to the overall improvement in market fundamentals. We believe our access to capital, our ability to execute large, complex transactions and our ability to efficiently stabilize large scale lease up properties provide us with a competitive advantage. The Company acquired 21 consolidated properties consisting of 6,198 apartment units for $1.38 billion and one commercial building for potential redevelopment for $11.8 million. The Company anticipates consolidated acquisitions of approximately $1.25 billion during the year ended December 31, 2012.
 
The Company also acquired six land parcels and entered into a long-term ground lease on another land parcel for $202.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2011. We acquired these land parcels with the intent to develop them into approximately $725.0 million of new apartment properties. The Company also started construction on six projects representing 2,124 apartment units totaling $656.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2011. The Company expects to start construction on eight projects representing 2,014 apartment units totaling approximately $750.0 million of development costs during the year ended December 31, 2012.
On December 2, 2011, the Company entered into a contract with affiliates of Bank of America and Barclays PLC to acquire, for
$1.325 billion
, half of their interests - an approximately
26.5%
interest overall - in Archstone, a privately-held owner, operator and developer of multifamily apartment properties. On January 20, 2012, Lehman Brothers, the other owner of Archstone, acquired this
26.5%
interest pursuant to a right of first offer and as a result, the Company's contract with the sellers was terminated. The Company now has the exclusive right, exercisable on or before April 19, 2012, to contract to purchase the remaining
26.5%
interest in Archstone owned by the same sellers for a price, determined by the Company, equal to $1.485 billion or higher. Any purchase of the remaining interest by the Company would also be subject to Lehman's right of first offer, and if Lehman were to exercise such right, the Company would be entitled to a break-up fee of
$80.0 million
, subject to repayment in certain limited circumstances. In 2011, the Company incurred Archstone-related expenses of approximately
$4.4 million
. Approximately
$2.6 million
of this total was financing-related and
$1.8 million
was pursuit costs.
    
We currently have access to multiple sources of capital including the equity markets as well as both the secured and unsecured debt markets. In December 2011, the Company completed a $1.0 billion unsecured ten year note offering with a coupon of 4.625% and an all-in effective interest rate of approximately 6.2%. We also raised $201.9 million in equity under our ATM Common Share offering program in 2011 and raised an additional $123.6 million under this program thus far in 2012. In July 2011, the Company replaced its then existing unsecured revolving credit facility which was due to mature in February 2012 with a new $1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility maturing on July 13, 2014, subject to a one-year extension option exercisable by the Company. The Company believes that the new facility contains a diversified and strong bank group which increases its
14
Table of Contents
balance sheet flexibility going forward. Subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company amended this facility to increase available borrowings by $500.0 million to $1.75 billion and entered into a commitment for a new senior unsecured
$500.0 million
delayed draw term loan facility. The Company arranged these facilities to replace a commitment for a $1.0 billion senior unsecured bridge loan facility and represents access to certain but contingent capital should the Company be successful in its pursuit of Archstone. These facilities are also available for other funding obligations should the Company be unsuccessful in its pursuit of Archstone.
We believe that cash and cash equivalents, securities readily convertible to cash, current availability on our revolving credit facility and delayed draw term loan facility and disposition proceeds for 2012 will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our funding obligations relating to asset acquisitions, including an interest in Archstone, debt maturities and existing development projects through 2012. We expect that our remaining longer-term funding requirements will be met through some combination of new borrowings, equity issuances (including EQR's ATM Common Share offering program), property dispositions, joint ventures and cash generated from operations.
There is significant uncertainty surrounding the futures of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the Government Sponsored Enterprises or GSEs). Through their lender originator networks, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are significant lenders both to the Company and to buyers of the Company's properties. The GSEs have a mandate to support multifamily housing through their financing activities. Any changes to their mandates, reductions in their size or the scale of their activities or loss of key personnel could have a significant impact on the Company and may, among other things, lead to lower values for our disposition assets and higher interest rates on our borrowings. Such changes may also provide an advantage to us by making the cost of financing single family home ownership more expensive and provide us a competitive advantage given the size of our balance sheet and the multiple sources of capital to which we have access.
    
We believe that the Company is well-positioned as of December 31, 2011 because our properties are geographically diverse, were approximately 94.2% occupied (94.7% on a same store basis) and the long-term demographic picture is positive. With the exception of the Washington, D.C. market area, little new multifamily rental supply will be added to our markets over the next several years. We believe our strong balance sheet and ample liquidity will allow us to fund our debt maturities and development costs in the near term, and should also allow us to take advantage of investment opportunities in the future. As economic conditions continue to improve, the short-term nature of our leases and the limited supply of new rental housing being constructed, along with the customer service and superior value provided by our on-site personnel, should allow us to realize even more revenue growth and improvement in our operating results.
The current environment information presented above is based on current expectations and is forward-looking.
Results of Operations
In conjunction with our business objectives and operating strategy, the Company continued to invest in apartment properties located in strategically targeted markets during the years ended
December 31, 2011
and
December 31, 2010
. In summary, we:

The Company's primary financial measure for evaluating each of its apartment communities is net operating income (NOI). NOI represents rental income less property and maintenance expense, real estate tax and insurance expense and property management expense. The Company believes that NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of its operating performance because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the Company's apartment communities. The cap rate is generally the first year NOI yield (net of replacements) on the Company's investment.
Properties that the Company owned for all of both
2011
and
2010
(the 
2011
Same Store Properties), which represented 101,312 apartment units, impacted the Company's results of operations. Properties that the Company owned for all of both
2010
and
2009
(the 
2010
Same Store Properties), which represented 112,042 apartment units, also impacted the Company's results of operations. Both the
2011
Same Store Properties and
2010
Same Store Properties are discussed in the following paragraphs.
The Company's acquisition, disposition and completed development activities also impacted overall results of operations for the years ended
December 31, 2011
and
2010
. The impacts of these activities are discussed in greater detail in the following paragraphs.
Comparison of the year ended
December 31, 2011
to the year ended
December 31, 2010
For the year ended
December 31, 2011
, the Company reported diluted earnings per share of $2.95 compared to $0.95 per share for the year ended
December 31, 2010
. The difference is primarily due to higher gains from property sales in
2011
vs.
2010
, higher total property net operating income driven by the positive impact of the Companys same store and lease-up activity and $45.4 million in impairment losses in 2010 that did not reoccur in 2011, partially offset by dilution as a result of the net impact of the Company's 2010 and 2011 acquisition and disposition activities.
For the year ended
December 31, 2011
, income from continuing operations increased approximately $164.7 million when compared to the year ended
December 31, 2010
. The increase in continuing operations is discussed below.
Revenues from the
2011
Same Store Properties increased $81.9 million primarily as a result of an increase in average rental rates charged to residents and an increase in occupancy. Expenses from the
2011
Same Store Properties increased $3.5 million primarily due to increases in property management costs, real estate taxes and utilities, partially offset by decreases in leasing and advertising costs and insurance. The following tables provide comparative same store results and statistics for the

Table of Contents
For properties that the Company acquired prior to January 1, 2011 and expects to continue to own through December 31, 2012, the Company anticipates the following same store results for the full year ending
December 31, 2012
:
The Company anticipates consolidated rental acquisitions of $1.25 billion and consolidated rental dispositions of $1.25 billion and expects that acquisitions will have a 1.25% lower cap rate than dispositions for the full year ending
December 31, 2012
.
These
2012
assumptions are based on current expectations and are forward-looking.
Non-same store operating results increased approximately $110.7 million and consist primarily of properties acquired in calendar years
2010
and
2011
, as well as operations from the Companys completed development properties. Although the operations of both the non-same store assets and the same store assets have been positively impacted during the year ended
December 31, 2011
, the non-same store assets have contributed a greater percentage of total NOI to the Companys overall operating results primarily due to 2010 and 2011 acquisitions, increasing occupancy for properties in lease-up and a longer ownership period in 2011 than 2010. This increase primarily resulted from:
See also Note 17 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding the Companys segment disclosures.
Fee and asset management revenues, net of fee and asset management expenses, increased approximately $0.3 million or 6.0% primarily due to revenues earned on management of the Companys unconsolidated development joint ventures, an increase in revenue earned on management of the Company's military housing ventures at Fort Lewis and McChord Air Force Base and lower expenses, partially offset by the unwinding of four institutional joint ventures during 2010.
Property management expenses from continuing operations include off-site expenses associated with the self-management of the Companys properties as well as management fees paid to any third party management companies. These expenses increased approximately $2.0 million or 2.6%. This increase is primarily attributable to an increase in payroll-related costs, which is largely a result of the creation of the Companys central business group, which moved certain administrative functions off-site, and increases in legal and professional fees and education/conference expenses.
Depreciation expense from continuing operations, which includes depreciation on non-real estate assets, increased approximately $33.8 million or 5.6% primarily as a result of additional depreciation expense on properties acquired in
2011
, development properties placed in service and capital expenditures for all properties owned, partially offset by a decrease in the amortization of furniture, fixtures and equipment that were fully depreciated.
18
Table of Contents
General and administrative expenses from continuing operations, which include corporate operating expenses, increased approximately $3.7 million or 9.3% primarily due to an increase in payroll-related costs, which is largely a result of the acceleration of long-term compensation expense for retirement eligible employees. The Company anticipates that general and administrative expenses will approximate $45.0 million to $46.0 million for the year ending
December 31, 2012
. The above assumption is based on current expectations and is forward-looking.
Impairment from continuing operations decreased approximately $45.4 million due to an impairment charge taken during the fourth quarter of 2010 on land held for development related to two potential development projects that did not reoccur in 2011. See Note 18 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Interest and other income from continuing operations increased approximately $2.8 million or 54.4% primarily as a result of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents due to larger overall cash balances during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010, forfeited deposits for terminated disposition transactions and proceeds received from the Companys final royalty participation in LRO/Rainmaker (a revenue management system), partially offset by insurance/litigation settlement proceeds that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2010 and did not reoccur during the year ended December 31, 2011. The Company anticipates that interest and other income will approximate $0.5 million to $1.0 million for the year ending
December 31, 2012
. The above assumption is based on current expectations and is forward-looking.
Other expenses from continuing operations increased approximately $2.6 million or 22.0% primarily due to an increase in property acquisition costs incurred in conjunction with the Companys 2011 acquisitions as well as transaction costs related to the pursuit of Archstone.
Interest expense from continuing operations, including amortization of deferred financing costs, increased approximately $9.4 million or 2.0% primarily as a result of a full year of interest expense on the $600.0 million of unsecured notes that closed in July 2010 and interest expense on forward starting swaps terminated in conjunction with the issuance of $1.0 billion of unsecured notes, partially offset by lower interest expense on mortgage notes payable due to lower balances during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010. During the year ended
December 31, 2011
, the Company capitalized interest costs of approximately $9.1 million as compared to $13.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2010
. This capitalization of interest primarily relates to consolidated projects under development. The effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended
December 31, 2011
was 5.30% as compared to 5.14% for the year ended December 31, 2010. The Company anticipates that interest expense from continuing operations will approximate $458.0 million to $468.0 million for the year ending
December 31, 2012
. The above assumption is based on current expectations and is forward-looking.
Income and other tax expense from continuing operations increased approximately $0.4 million primarily due to Tennessee and Texas franchise tax refunds received during the year ended December 31, 2010 that did not reoccur during the year ended December 31, 2011, partially offset by decreases in all other taxes. The Company anticipates that income and other tax expense will approximate $0.5 million to $1.5 million for the year ending
December 31, 2012
. The above assumption is based on current expectations and is forward-looking.
Loss from investments in unconsolidated entities decreased approximately $0.7 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily due to the unwinding of four institutional joint ventures during 2010.
Net gain on sales of unconsolidated entities decreased approximately $28.1 million primarily due to the gain on sale and revaluation of seven previously unconsolidated properties that were acquired from the Companys joint venture partner and the gain on sale for 27 unconsolidated properties that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2010 that did not reoccur during the year ended December 31, 2011.
Net gain on sales of land parcels increased approximately $5.6 million primarily due to the gain on sale of a land parcel located in suburban Washington, D.C. during the year ended December 31, 2011 and a loss on sale of a land parcel during the same period in 2010.
Discontinued operations, net increased approximately $474.5 million between the periods under comparison. This increase is primarily due to higher gains from property sales during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010, partially offset by properties sold in 2011 which reflect operations for none of or a partial period in 2011 in contrast to a full or partial period in 2010. See Note 11 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Comparison of the year ended

For the year ended
December 31, 2010
, the Company reported diluted earnings per share of $0.95 compared to $1.27 per share for the year ended

Revenues from the
2010
Same Store Properties decreased $2.1 million primarily as a result of a decrease in average rental rates charged to residents, partially offset by an increase in occupancy. Expenses from the
2010
Same Store Properties increased $6.2 million primarily due to increases in repairs and maintenance expenses (mostly due to greater storm-related costs such as snow removal and roof repairs incurred during the first quarter of 2010), higher property management costs and increases in utility costs, partially offset by lower real estate taxes and leasing and advertising expenses. The following tables provide comparative same store results and statistics for the

business. While the operations of the non-same store assets have been negatively impacted during the year ended
December 31, 2010
similar to the same store assets, the non-same store assets have contributed a greater percentage of total NOI to the Company's overall operating results primarily due to increasing occupancy for properties in lease-up and a longer ownership period in
2010
than
2009
. This increase primarily resulted from:
See also Note 17 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding the Company's segment disclosures.
Fee and asset management revenues, net of fee and asset management expenses, increased approximately $1.5 million or 49.2% primarily due to an increase in revenue earned on management of the Company's military housing ventures at Fort Lewis and McChord Air Force Base (primarily due to increased housing redevelopment on the base which earned the Company additional fees) as well as a decrease in asset management expenses, partially offset by the unwinding of the Company's institutional joint ventures during 2010.
Property management expenses from continuing operations include off-site expenses associated with the self-management of the Company's properties as well as management fees paid to any third party management companies. These expenses increased approximately $8.8 million or 12.3%. This increase is primarily attributable to an increase in payroll-related costs (due primarily to higher health insurance and bonus costs, acceleration of long-term compensation expense for retirement eligible employees and the creation of the Company's central business group, which moved administrative functions off-site), legal and professional fees, education/conference expenses, real estate tax consulting fees and travel expenses.
Depreciation expense from continuing operations, which includes depreciation on non-real estate assets, increased approximately $94.4 million or 18.4% primarily as a result of additional depreciation expense on properties acquired in
2009
and
2010
, development properties placed in service and capital expenditures for all properties owned.
General and administrative expenses from continuing operations, which include corporate operating expenses, increased approximately $0.9 million or 2.3% primarily due to higher overall payroll-related costs (due primarily to higher bonus costs), partially offset by lower tax compliance fees and office rents.
Impairment from continuing operations increased approximately $34.3 million due to a $45.4 million impairment charge taken during the fourth quarter of 2010 on land held for development related to two potential development projects compared to an $11.1 million impairment charge taken during 2009 on land held for development. See Note 18 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Interest and other income from continuing operations decreased approximately $11.4 million or 68.8% primarily as a result of a decrease in interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and investment securities due to lower interest rates during the year ended
December 31, 2010
and lower overall balances as well as gains on debt extinguishment and the sale of investment securities recognized during the year ended December 31, 2009 that did not reoccur in 2010, partially offset by an increase in insurance/litigation settlement proceeds.
Other expenses from continuing operations increased approximately $5.5 million or 84.2% primarily due to an increase in the expensing of overhead (pursuit cost write-offs) as a result of the Company's decision to reduce its development activities in prior periods as well as an increase in property acquisition costs incurred in conjunction with the Company's significantly higher acquisition volume in 2010.
Interest expense from continuing operations, including amortization of deferred financing costs, decreased approximately $27.1 million or 5.4% primarily as a result of lower overall debt balances and higher debt extinguishment costs due to the significant debt repurchases in
2009
and lower rates in 2010, partially offset by interest expense on the $500.0 million mortgage pool that closed in 2009, the $600.0 million of unsecured notes that closed in July 2010 and lower capitalized interest. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company capitalized interest costs of approximately $13.0 million as compared to $34.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2009
. This capitalization of interest primarily relates to consolidated projects under development. The effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended December 31, 2010 was 5.14% as compared to 5.62% for the year ended December 31, 2009.

Income and other tax expense from continuing operations decreased approximately $2.4 million or 89.2% primarily due to a decrease in franchise taxes for Texas and a decrease in business taxes for Washington, D.C.
Loss from investments in unconsolidated entities decreased approximately $2.1 million or 73.9% as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2009
primarily due to the Company's $1.8 million share of defeasance costs incurred in conjunction with the extinguishment of cross-collateralized mortgage debt on one of the Company's partially owned unconsolidated joint ventures taken during the year ended
December 31, 2009
that did not reoccur in 2010.
Net gain on sales of unconsolidated entities increased approximately $17.4 million primarily due to larger gains on sale and revaluation of seven previously unconsolidated properties that were acquired from the Company's joint venture partner and the gain on sale for 27 properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with unconsolidated properties sold in the same period in
2009

Net loss on sales of land parcels increased approximately $1.4 million primarily due to the loss on sale of one land parcel during the year ended December 31, 2010.
Discontinued operations, net decreased approximately $61.0 million or 13.7% between the periods under comparison. This decrease is primarily due to lower gains from property sales during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in
2009
and the operations of those properties. In addition, properties sold in 2010 reflect operations for none of or a partial period in 2010 in contrast to a full or partial period in

Liquidity and Capital Resources
For the Year Ended
December 31, 2011
EQR issues public equity from time to time and guarantees certain debt of ERPOP. EQR does not have any indebtedness as all debt is incurred by the Operating Partnership.
As of January 1,
2011
, the Company had approximately $431.4 million of cash and cash equivalents, its restricted 1031 exchange proceeds totaled $103.9 million and it had $1.28 billion available under its then existing revolving credit facility (net of $147.3 million which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and $75.0 million which had been committed by a now bankrupt financial institution and was not available for borrowing). After taking into effect the various transactions discussed in the following paragraphs and the net cash provided by operating activities, the Companys cash and cash equivalents balance at
December 31, 2011
was approximately $383.9 million, its restricted 1031 exchange proceeds totaled $53.7 million and the amount available on its new revolving credit facility was $1.22 billion (net of $31.8 million which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit).
During the year ended
December 31, 2011
, the Company generated proceeds from various transactions, which included the following:
During the year ended
December 31, 2011
, the above proceeds were primarily utilized to:
In September 2009, EQR announced the establishment of an At-The-Market (ATM) share offering program which
22
Table of Contents
would allow EQR to sell up to
17.0 million
Common Shares (later increased by 5.7 million Common Shares) from time to time over the next three years into the existing trading market at current market prices as well as through negotiated transactions. Per the terms of ERPOP's partnership agreement, EQR contributes the net proceeds from all equity offerings to the capital of ERPOP in exchange for additional OP Units (on a one-for-one Common Share per OP Unit basis). EQR may, but shall have no obligation to, sell Common Shares through the ATM share offering program in amounts and at times to be determined by EQR. Actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by EQR from time to time, including (among others) market conditions, the trading price of EQR's Common Shares and determinations of the appropriate sources of funding for EQR. During the year ended
December 31, 2011
, EQR issued approximately
3.9 million
Common Shares at an average price of
$52.23
per share for total consideration of approximately
$201.9 million
through the ATM program. During the year ended
December 31, 2010
, EQR issued approximately
6.2 million
Common Shares at an average price of
$47.45
per share for total consideration of approximately
$291.9 million
through the ATM program. During the year ended
December 31, 2009
, EQR issued approximately
3.5 million
Common Shares at an average price of
$35.38
per share for total consideration of approximately
$123.7 million
through the ATM program. In addition, during the first quarter of 2012 through February 17, 2012, the Company issued approximately 2.1 million Common Shares at an average price of $59.47 per share for total consideration of approximately $123.6 million. Through February 17, 2012, EQR has cumulatively issued approximately 15.6 million Common Shares at an average price of $47.53 per share for total consideration of approximately $741.2 million. EQR has 7.1 million Common Shares remaining available for issuance under the ATM program as of February 17, 2012.
On June 16, 2011, the shareholders of EQR approved the Company's 2011 Share Incentive Plan (the 2011 Plan). The 2011 Plan reserved
12,980,741
Common Shares for issuance. In conjunction with the approval of the 2011 Plan, no further awards may be granted under the 2002 Share Incentive Plan. The 2011 Plan expires on June 16, 2021. See Note 12 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Depending on its analysis of market prices, economic conditions and other opportunities for the investment of available capital, EQR may repurchase its Common Shares pursuant to its existing share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Trustees. As of February 17, 2012, EQR had authorization to repurchase an additional $464.6 million of its shares. No shares were repurchased during 2011. See Note 3 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Depending on its analysis of prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors, the Company may from time to time seek to repurchase and retire its outstanding debt in open market or privately negotiated transactions.

The interest rate on advances under the new credit facility will generally be LIBOR plus a spread (currently 1.15%) and the Company pays an annual facility fee of 0.2%. Both the spread and the facility fee are dependent on the credit rating of the Company's long-term debt. Subsequent to year-end, the Company amended this facility to increase available borrowings by $500.0 million to $1.75 billion. The terms did not change, including the July 13, 2014 maturity date.

An unlimited amount of equity and debt securities remains available for issuance by EQR and ERPOP under effective shelf registration statements filed with the SEC. Most recently, EQR and ERPOP filed a universal shelf registration statement for an unlimited amount of equity and debt securities that automatically became effective upon filing with the SEC in October 2010 and expires on October 15, 2013. However, as of February 17, 2012, issuances under the ATM share offering program are limited to 7.1 million additional shares. Per the terms of ERPOP's partnership agreement, EQR contributes the net proceeds of all equity offerings to the capital of ERPOP in exchange for additional OP Units (on a one-for-one Common Share per OP Unit basis) or preference units (on a one-for-one preferred share per preference unit basis).

The Company generally expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements, including capital expenditures related to maintaining its existing properties and certain scheduled unsecured note and mortgage note repayments, through its working capital, net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility. Under normal operating conditions, the Company considers its cash provided by operating activities to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payments of distributions. However, there may be times when the Company experiences shortfalls in its coverage of distributions, which may cause the Company to consider reducing its distributions and/or using the proceeds from property dispositions or additional financing transactions to make up the difference. Should these shortfalls occur for lengthy periods of time or be material in nature, the Companys financial condition may be adversely affected and it may not be able to maintain its current distribution levels.
During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company announced a new dividend policy which it believes will generate payouts more closely aligned with the actual annual operating results of the Companys core business and provide transparency to investors. The Company intends to pay an annual cash dividend equal to approximately 65% of Normalized FFO for the year. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company paid $0.3375 per share for each of the first three quarters and $0.5675 per share for the fourth quarter to bring the total payment for the year (an annual rate of $1.58 per share) to approximately 65% of Normalized FFO. The Company anticipates the expected dividend payout will range from $1.74 to $1.81 per share ($0.3375 per share for each of the first three quarters with the balance for the fourth quarter) for the year ending December 31, 2012. All future dividends remain subject to the discretion of the Board of Trustees. The above assumption is based on current expectations and is forward-looking. While our dividend policy makes it less likely we will over distribute, it will also lead to a dividend reduction more quickly than a fixed dividend policy should operating results deteriorate. The Company believes that its expected 2012 operating cash flow will be sufficient to cover capital expenditures and distributions.
The Company also expects to meet its long-term liquidity requirements, such as scheduled unsecured note and mortgage debt maturities, property acquisitions, financing of construction and development activities and capital improvements through the issuance of secured and unsecured debt and equity securities, including additional OP Units, and proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties and joint ventures. In addition, the Company has significant unencumbered properties available to secure additional mortgage borrowings in the event that the public capital markets are unavailable or the cost of alternative sources of capital is too high. The fair value of and cash flow from these unencumbered properties are in excess of the requirements the Company must maintain in order to comply with covenants under its unsecured notes and line of credit. Of the $20.4 billion in investment in real estate on the Companys balance sheet at December 31, 2011, $13.9 billion or 68.3% was unencumbered. However, there can be no assurances that these sources of capital will be available to the Company in the future on acceptable terms or otherwise.
ERPOP's credit ratings from Standard & Poors (S&P), Moodys and Fitch for its outstanding senior debt are BBB+, Baal and BBB+, respectively. EQR's equity ratings from S&P, Moodys and Fitch for its outstanding preferred equity are BBB+, Baa2 and BBB-, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2010, Fitch downgraded ERPOPs credit rating from A- to BBB+ and EQR's equity rating from BBB+ to BBB-, which did not have an effect on EQR's cost of funds. During the first quarter of 2011, Moodys raised its outlook for both EQR and ERPOP from negative outlook to stable outlook and in the fourth quarter of 2011 revised its outlook from stable outlook to developing outlook.
The Company's $1.425 billion (net of $75.0 million which had been committed by a now bankrupt financial institution and was not available for borrowing) long-term revolving credit facility was replaced with a new $1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility maturing on July 13, 2014, subject to a one-year extension option exercisable by the Company. The interest rate on advances under the new credit facility will generally be LIBOR plus a spread (currently 1.15%) and the Company pays an annual facility fee of 0.2%. Both the spread and the facility fee are dependent on the credit rating of the Company's long term debt. Effective January 6, 2012, the Company amended this facility to increase available borrowings by $500.0 million to $1.75 billion. The terms did not change, including the July 13, 2014 maturity date. As of February 17, 2012, there was available borrowings of $1.72 billion (net of $30.8 million which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit) on the new revolving credit facility. This facility may, among other potential uses, be used to fund property acquisitions, costs for certain properties

under development and short-term liquidity requirements.
In 2010, a portion of the parking garage collapsed at one of the Companys rental properties (Prospect Towers in Hackensack, New Jersey). Through December 31, 2011, the Company has cumulatively incurred $13.3 million in capitalized costs to rebuild the garage, incurred $7.2 million in expenses for items such as accommodating displaced residents and legal costs and estimates that its lost revenues approximate $2.3 million, and the Company estimates that its total costs will approximate $23.0 million. Through December 31, 2011, the Company has cumulatively received approximately $10.1 million in insurance proceeds and estimates its total insurance reimbursements will approximate $12.0 million. The garage has been rebuilt with costs capitalized as incurred. All other costs, including lost revenue due to a portion of the property being temporarily unavailable for occupancy, reduce earnings as they are incurred. Generally, insurance proceeds are recorded as increases to earnings as they are received. During the year ended
December 31, 2011
, the Company received approximately
$6.1 million
in insurance proceeds which offset expenses of
$1.7 million
that were recorded relating to this loss and are included in real estate taxes and insurance on the consolidated statements of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company received approximately $4.0 million in insurance proceeds which fully offset the impairment charge recognized to write-off the net book value of the collapsed garage and partially offset expenses of $5.5 million that were recorded relating to this loss and are included in real estate taxes and insurance on the consolidated statements of operations. In addition, the Company estimates that its lost revenues approximated $0.7 million and $1.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, as a result of lost occupancy in the high-rise tower following the collapse. None of the amounts referenced above impact same store results.
See Note 18 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the events which occurred subsequent to
December 31, 2011

Capitalization of Fixed Assets and Improvements to Real Estate
Our policy with respect to capital expenditures is generally to capitalize expenditures that improve the value of the property or extend the useful life of the component asset of the property. We track improvements to real estate in two major categories and several subcategories:
All replacements are depreciated over a five to ten-year estimated useful life. We expense as incurred all make-ready maintenance and turnover costs such as cleaning, interior painting of individual apartment units and the repair of any replacement item noted above.
All building improvements are depreciated over a five to fifteen-year estimated useful life. We capitalize building improvements and upgrades only if the item: (i) exceeds $2,500 (selected projects must exceed $10,000); (ii) extends the useful life of the asset; and (iii) improves the value of the asset.
For the year ended
December 31, 2011
, our actual improvements to real estate totaled approximately $144.5 million. This includes the following (amounts in thousands except for apartment unit and per apartment unit amounts):

Capital Expenditures to Real Estate
For the Year Ended
December 31, 2010
For
2012
, the Company estimates that it will spend approximately $1,225 per apartment unit of capital expenditures for its same store properties inclusive of apartment unit renovation/rehab costs, or $850 per apartment unit excluding apartment unit renovation/rehab costs. For
2012
, the Company estimates that it will spend $39.2 million rehabbing 4,700 apartment units (equating to about $8,300 per apartment unit rehabbed). The above assumptions are based on current expectations and are forward-looking.
During the year ended
December 31, 2011
, the Companys total non-real estate capital additions, such as computer software, computer equipment, and furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements to the Companys property management offices and its corporate offices, were approximately $7.1 million. The Company expects to fund approximately $6.7 million in total additions to non-real estate property in
2012
. The above assumption is based on current expectations and is forward-looking.
Improvements to real estate and additions to non-real estate property are generally funded from net cash provided by operating activities and from investment cash flow.

Derivative Instruments
In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes. The Company seeks to manage these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments.
The Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors. When viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge, the Company has not sustained a material loss from these instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives it currently has in place.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations
The Company admitted an
80%
institutional partner to
two
separate entities/transactions (one in December 2010 and the other in August 2011), each owning a developable land parcel, in exchange for
$40.1 million
in cash and retained a
20%
equity interest in both of these entities. These land parcels are now unconsolidated. Total project costs are approximately
$232.8 million
and construction will be predominantly funded with two separate long-term, non-recourse secured loans from the partner. While the Company is the managing member of both of the joint ventures, is responsible for constructing both of the projects and has given certain construction cost overrun guarantees, all major decisions are made jointly, the large majority of funding is provided by the partner and the partner has significant involvement in and oversight of the ongoing projects. The Company's remaining funding obligations are currently estimated at
$5.4 million
. The Company's strategy with respect to these ventures was to reduce its financial risk related to the development of the properties. However, management does not believe that these investments have a materially different impact upon the Company's liquidity, cash flows, capital resources, credit or market risk than its other consolidated development activities.
In December 2011, the Company acquired a vacant land parcel at 400 Park Avenue South in New York City in a joint venture with Toll Brothers (NYSE: TOL). Until the core and shell of the building is complete, the building and land will be owned jointly and are required to be consolidated on the Company's balance sheet. Thereafter, the Company will solely own and control the rental portion of the building (floors 2-22) and Toll Brothers will solely own and control the for sale portion of the building (floors 23-40). Once the core and shell are complete, the Toll Brothers' portion of the property will be deconsolidated from the Company's balance sheet. The acquisition was financed through contributions by the Company and Toll Brothers of approximately $102.5 million and $75.7 million, respectively, which included a land purchase price of
$76.1 million
and
$57.9 million
, respectively, and taxes and fees of $0.4 million and $0.3 million, respectively. Deposits were made to the venture of $26.0 million and $17.5 million, respectively, to collateralize construction guarantees. Management does not believe that this investment has a materially different impact upon the Company's liquidity, cash flows, capital resources, credit or market risk than its other consolidated development activities.
As of
December 31, 2011
, the Company has six consolidated projects totaling 1,535 apartment units and two unconsolidated projects totaling 945 apartment units in various stages of development with estimated completion dates ranging through March 31, 2014, as well as other completed development projects that are in various stages of lease up or are stabilized. The development agreements currently in place are discussed in detail in Note 16 of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.
See also Notes 2 and 6 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding the Companys investments in partially owned entities.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, resulting in different financial results or different presentation of our financial statements.
The Companys significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended
December 31, 2011
and are consistent with the year ended
December 31, 2010
.
The Company has identified five significant accounting policies as critical accounting policies. These critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant judgments and estimates. With respect to these critical accounting policies, management believes that the application of judgments and estimates is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented. The five critical accounting policies are:
Acquisition of Investment Properties
The Company allocates the purchase price of properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, the Company utilizes a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property, our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data. The Company also considers information obtained about each property as a result of its pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets, including its investments in real estate, for indicators of impairment. The judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance, market conditions and legal and environmental concerns, as well as the Companys ability to hold and its intent with regard to each asset. Future events could occur which would cause the Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted.
Depreciation of Investment in Real Estate
The Company depreciates the building component of its investment in real estate over a 30-year estimated useful life, building improvements over a 5-year to 15-year estimated useful life and both the furniture, fixtures and equipment and replacements components over a 5-year to 10-year estimated useful life, all of which are judgmental determinations.

Table of Contents
Cost Capitalization
See the
Capitalization of Fixed Assets and Improvements to Real Estate
section for a discussion of the Companys policy with respect to capitalization vs. expensing of fixed asset/repair and maintenance costs. In addition, the Company capitalizes an allocation of the payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend their time on the supervision of major capital and/or renovation projects. These costs are reflected on the balance sheet as an increase to depreciable property.
For all development projects, the Company uses its professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred. The Company capitalizes interest, real estate taxes and insurance and payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend their time on development activities, with capitalization ceasing no later than 90 days following issuance of the certificate of occupancy. These costs are reflected on the balance sheet as construction-in-progress for each specific property. The Company expenses as incurred all payroll costs of on-site employees working directly at our properties, except as noted above on our development properties prior to certificate of occupancy issuance and on specific major renovations at selected properties when additional incremental employees are hired.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments, Including Derivative Instruments
The valuation of financial instruments requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments. The Company, where possible, bases the fair values of its financial instruments, including its derivative instruments, on listed market prices and third party quotes. Where these are not available, the Company bases its estimates on current instruments with similar terms and maturities or on other factors relevant to the financial instruments.
Funds From Operations and Normalized Funds From Operations
For the year ended
December 31, 2011
, Funds From Operations (FFO) available to Common Shares and Units / Units and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units / Units increased $129.4 million, or 20.8%, and $77.2 million, or 11.3%, respectively, as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2010
. For the year ended December 31, 2010, FFO available to Common Shares and Units / Units and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units / Units increased $7.3 million, or 1.2%, and $20.9 million, or 3.2%, respectively, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009.

to Common Shares and Units / Units can help compare the operating performance of a companys real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. The company also believes that Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units / Units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company because they allow investors to compare the companys operating performance to its performance in prior reporting periods and to the operating performance of other real estate companies without the effect of items that by their nature are not comparable from period to period and tend to obscure the Companys actual operating results. FFO, FFO available to Common Shares and Units / Units, Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units / Units do not represent net income, net income available to Common Shares / Units or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO, FFO available to Common Shares and Units / Units, Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units / Units should not be exclusively considered as alternatives to net income, net income available to Common Shares / Units or net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The Companys calculation of FFO, FFO available to Common Shares and Units / Units, Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units / Units may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Equity Residential (EQR), a Maryland real estate investment trust (REIT) formed in March 1993, is an S&P 500 company focused on the acquisition, development and management of high quality apartment properties in top United States growth markets. ERP Operating Limited Partnership ("ERPOP"), an Illinois limited partnership, was formed in May 1993 to conduct the multifamily residential property business of Equity Residential. EQR has elected to be taxed as a REIT. References to the "Company," "we," "us" or "our" mean collectively EQR, ERPOP and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by EQR and/or ERPOP. References to the "Operating Partnership" mean collectively ERPOP and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by ERPOP. Unless otherwise indicated, the notes to consolidated financial statements apply to both the Company and the Operating Partnership.
EQR is the general partner of, and as of
December 31, 2011
owned an approximate
95.7%
ownership interest in ERPOP. All of the Company's property ownership, development and related business operations are conducted through the Operating Partnership and EQR has no material assets or liabilities other than its investment in ERPOP. EQR issues public equity from time to time but does not have any indebtedness as all debt is incurred by the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership holds substantially all of the assets of the Company, including the Company's ownership interests in its joint ventures. The Operating Partnership conducts the operations of the business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity.
As of
December 31, 2011
, the Company, directly or indirectly through investments in title holding entities, owned all or a portion of
427
properties located in
15
states and the District of Columbia consisting of
121,974
apartment units. The ownership breakdown includes (table does not include various uncompleted development properties):
            
The Wholly Owned Properties are accounted for under the consolidation method of accounting. The Company beneficially owns 100% fee simple title to
400
of the
404
Wholly Owned Properties and all but
one
of its wholly owned development properties and land parcels. The Company owns the building and improvements and leases the land underlying the improvements under long-term ground leases that expire in
2026
,
2077
,
2101
and
2104
for the
four
operating properties, respectively, and
2110
for
one
land parcel. These properties are consolidated and reflected as real estate assets while the ground leases are accounted for as operating leases.
The Partially Owned Properties  Consolidated are controlled by the Company but have partners with noncontrolling interests and are accounted for under the consolidation method of accounting. The Military Housing properties consist of investments in limited liability companies that, as a result of the terms of the operating agreements, are accounted for as management contract rights with all fees recognized as fee and asset management revenue.
Basis of Presentation
Due to the Companys ability as general partner to control either through ownership or by contract the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries, the Operating Partnership and each such subsidiary has been consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes, except for
two
unconsolidated developments and our military housing properties. The consolidated financial statements also include all variable interest entities for which the Company is the primary beneficiary.
Noncontrolling interests represented by EQR's indirect
1%
interest in various entities are immaterial and have not been accounted for in the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Operating Partnership. In addition, certain amounts due from EQR for its
1%
interest in various entities have not been reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets of the Operating Partnership since such amounts are immaterial.

Real Estate Assets and Depreciation of Investment in Real Estate
Effective for business combinations on or after January 1, 2009, an acquiring entity is required to recognize all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition-date fair value with limited exceptions. In addition, an acquiring entity is required to expense acquisition-related costs as incurred (amounts are included in the other expenses line item in the consolidated statements of operations), value noncontrolling interests at fair value at the acquisition date and expense restructuring costs associated with an acquired business.
The Company allocates the purchase price of properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, the Company utilizes a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property, our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data. The Company also considers information obtained about each property as a result of its pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired. The Company allocates the purchase price of acquired real estate to various components as follows:
Replacements inside an apartment unit such as appliances and carpeting are depreciated over an estimated useful life of
five
to
ten
years. Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred and significant renovations and improvements that improve and/or extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized over their estimated useful life, generally
five
to
fifteen
years. Initial direct leasing costs are expensed as incurred as such expense approximates the deferral and amortization of initial direct leasing costs over the lease terms. Property sales or dispositions are recorded when title transfers to unrelated third parties, contingencies have been removed and sufficient cash consideration has been received by the Company. Upon disposition, the related costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts. Any gain or loss on sale is recognized in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
The Company classifies real estate assets as real estate held for disposition when it is certain a property will be disposed of (see further discussion below).
The Company classifies properties under development and/or expansion and properties in the lease-up phase (including land) as construction-in-progress until construction has been completed and all certificates of occupancy permits have been obtained.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets, including its investments in real estate, for indicators of impairment. The judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance, market conditions and legal and environmental concerns, as well as the Companys ability to hold and its intent with regard to each asset. Future events could occur which would cause the Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted.
For long-lived assets to be held and used, the Company compares the expected future undiscounted cash flows for the long-lived asset against the carrying amount of that asset. If the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, the Company would record an impairment loss for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying amount of the asset.
F-21
Table of Contents
For long-lived assets to be disposed of, an impairment loss is recognized when the estimated fair value of the asset, less the estimated cost to sell, is less than the carrying amount of the asset measured at the time that the Company has determined it will sell the asset. Long-lived assets held for disposition and the related liabilities are separately reported, with the long-lived assets reported at the lower of their carrying amounts or their estimated fair values, less their costs to sell, and are not depreciated after reclassification to real estate held for disposition.
Cost Capitalization
See the
Real Estate Assets and Depreciation of Investment in Real Estate
section for a discussion of the Companys policy with respect to capitalization vs. expensing of fixed asset/repair and maintenance costs. In addition, the Company capitalizes an allocation of the payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend their time on the supervision of major capital and/or renovation projects. These costs are reflected on the balance sheet as an increase to depreciable property.
For all development projects, the Company uses its professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred. The Company capitalizes interest, real estate taxes and insurance and payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend their time on development activities, with capitalization ceasing no later than 90 days following issuance of the certificate of occupancy. These costs are reflected on the balance sheet as construction-in-progress for each specific property. The Company expenses as incurred all payroll costs of on-site employees working directly at our properties, except as noted above on our development properties prior to certificate of occupancy issuance and on specific major renovations at selected properties when additional incremental employees are hired.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all demand deposits, money market accounts and investments in certificates of deposit and repurchase agreements purchased with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions. The combined account balances at one or more institutions typically exceed the Federal Depository Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance coverage, and, as a result, there is a concentration of credit risk related to amounts on deposit in excess of FDIC insurance coverage. The Company believes that the risk is not significant, as the Company does not anticipate the financial institutions non-performance.
Investment Securities
Investment securities are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. These securities are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at amortized cost if management has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Otherwise, the securities are classified as available-for-sale and carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive (loss), a separate component of shareholders equity/partners' capital.
Deferred Financing Costs
Deferred financing costs include fees and costs incurred to obtain the Companys lines of credit and long-term financings. These costs are amortized over the terms of the related debt. Unamortized financing costs are written off when debt is retired before the maturity date. The accumulated amortization of such deferred financing costs was
$37.7 million
and
$43.9 million
at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, respectively.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments, Including Derivative Instruments
The valuation of financial instruments requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments. The Company, where possible, bases the fair values of its financial instruments, including its derivative instruments, on listed market prices and third party quotes. Where these are not available, the Company bases its estimates on current instruments with similar terms and maturities or on other factors relevant to the financial instruments.
In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes. The Company seeks to manage these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments.
The Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors. When viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge, the Company has not sustained a material loss from these instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives.
F-22
Table of Contents
The Company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and measures those instruments at fair value. In addition, fair value adjustments will affect either shareholders equity/partners' capital or net income depending on whether the derivative instruments qualify as a hedge for accounting purposes and, if so, the nature of the hedging activity. When the terms of an underlying transaction are modified, or when the underlying transaction is terminated or completed, all changes in the fair value of the instrument are marked-to-market with changes in value included in net income each period until the instrument matures. Any derivative instrument used for risk management that does not meet the hedging criteria is marked-to-market each period. The Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
Revenue Recognition
Rental income attributable to residential leases is recorded on a straight-line basis, which is not materially different than if it were recorded when due from residents and recognized monthly as it was earned. Leases entered into between a resident and a property for the rental of an apartment unit are generally year-to-year, renewable upon consent of both parties on an annual or monthly basis. Fee and asset management revenue and interest income are recorded on an accrual basis.
Share-Based Compensation
The Company expenses share-based compensation such as restricted shares and share options. Any common share of beneficial interest,
$0.01
par value per share (the "Common Shares") issued pursuant to EQR's incentive equity compensation and employee share purchase plans will result in ERPOP issuing units of limited partnership interest ("OP Units") to EQR on a one-for-one basis, with ERPOP receiving the net cash proceeds of such issuances.
The fair value of the option grants are recognized over the vesting period of the options. The fair value for the Company's share options was estimated at the time the share options were granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the primary grant in each year having the following weighted average assumptions:
    
The valuation method and assumptions are the same as those the Company used in accounting for option expense in its consolidated financial statements. The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. This model is only one method of valuing options and the Companys use of this model should not be interpreted as an endorsement of its accuracy. Because the Companys share options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in managements opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its share options and the actual value of the options may be significantly different.
Income and Other Taxes
Due to the structure of EQR as a REIT and the nature of the operations of its operating properties, no provision for federal income taxes has been made at the EQR level. In addition, ERPOP generally is not liable for federal income taxes as the partners recognize their proportionate share of income or loss in their tax returns; therefore no provision for federal income taxes has been made at the ERPOP level. Historically, the Company has generally only incurred certain state and local income, excise and franchise taxes. The Company has elected Taxable REIT Subsidiary (TRS) status for certain of its corporate subsidiaries and as a result, these entities will incur both federal and state income taxes on any taxable income of such entities after consideration
F-23
Table of Contents
of any net operating losses.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities applicable to the TRS are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. These assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates for which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effects of changes in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized in earnings in the period enacted. The Companys deferred tax assets are generally the result of tax affected amortization of goodwill, differing depreciable lives on capitalized assets and the timing of expense recognition for certain accrued liabilities. As of
December 31, 2011
, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of approximately
$31.7 million
, which is fully offset by a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty in forecasting future TRS taxable income.
The Company provided for income, franchise and excise taxes allocated as follows in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended
December 31, 2011
,
2010
and
2009
(amounts in thousands):
    
The Companys TRSs have approximately
$71.4 million
of NOL carryforwards available as of January 1, 2012 that will expire between
2028 and 2031
.
During the years ended
December 31, 2011
,
2010
and

The cost of land and depreciable property, net of accumulated depreciation, for federal income tax purposes as of
December 31, 2011
and
2010
was approximately
$11.4 billion
and
$10.9 billion
, respectively.
Noncontrolling Interests
A noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary (minority interest) is in most cases an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent company's equity. In addition, consolidated net income is required to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest and the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interest are required to be disclosed on the face of the Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 3 for further discussion.
Operating Partnership: Net income is allocated to noncontrolling interests based on their respective ownership percentage of the Operating Partnership. The ownership percentage is calculated by dividing the number of OP Units held by the noncontrolling interests by the total OP Units held by the noncontrolling interests and EQR. Issuance of additional Common Shares and OP Units changes the ownership interests of both the noncontrolling interests and EQR. Such transactions and the related proceeds are treated as capital transactions.
F-24
Table of Contents
Partially Owned Properties: The Company reflects noncontrolling interests in partially owned properties on the balance sheet for the portion of properties consolidated by the Company that are not wholly owned by the Company. The earnings or losses from those properties attributable to the noncontrolling interests are reflected as noncontrolling interests in partially owned properties in the consolidated statements of operations.
Partners' Capital
The "Limited Partners" of ERPOP include various individuals and entities that contributed their properties to ERPOP in exchange for OP Units. The "General Partner" of ERPOP is EQR. Net income is allocated to the Limited Partners based on their respective ownership percentage of the Operating Partnership. The ownership percentage is calculated by dividing the number of OP Units held by the Limited Partners by the total OP Units held by the Limited Partners and the General Partner. Issuance of additional Common Shares and OP Units changes the ownership interests of both the Limited Partners and EQR. Such transactions and the related proceeds are treated as capital transactions.
Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership / Redeemable Limited Partners
The Company classifies Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership / Redeemable Limited Partners in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheets for the portion of OP Units that EQR is required, either by contract or securities law, to deliver registered Common Shares to the exchanging OP Unit holder. The redeemable noncontrolling interest units / redeemable limited partner units are adjusted to the greater of carrying value or fair market value based on the Common Share price of EQR at the end of each respective reporting period.
Use of Estimates
In preparation of the Companys financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications considered necessary for a fair presentation have been made to the prior period financial statements in order to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications have not changed the results of operations or equity/capital.

In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
, which superseded all then-existing non-SEC accounting and reporting standards and became the source of authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by non-governmental entities. The Company adopted the codification as required, effective for the quarter ended September 30, 2009. The adoption of the codification had no impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial position but changed the way we refer to accounting literature in our reports.
Effective January 1, 2010, in an effort to improve financial standards for transfers of financial assets, more stringent conditions for reporting a transfer of a portion of a financial asset as a sale (e.g. loan participations) are required, the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity and special guidance for guaranteed mortgage securitizations are eliminated, other sale-accounting criteria is clarified and the initial measurement of a transferors interest in transferred financial assets is changed. This does not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial position.
Effective January 1, 2010, the analysis for identifying the primary beneficiary of a Variable Interest Entity (VIE) has been simplified by replacing the previous quantitative-based analysis with a framework that is based more on qualitative judgments. The analysis requires the primary beneficiary of a VIE to be identified as the party that both (a) has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance and (b) has an obligation to absorb losses or a right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. For the Company, this includes certain consolidated development partnerships as the Company provides substantially all of the capital for these ventures (other than third party mortgage debt, if any). For the Company, these requirements affected only disclosures and had no impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial position. See Note 6 for further discussion.
The Company is the controlling partner in various consolidated partnerships owning
21
properties and
3,916
apartment units and various completed and uncompleted development properties having a noncontrolling interest book value of

. The Company is required to make certain disclosures regarding noncontrolling interests in consolidated limited-life subsidiaries. Of the consolidated entities described above, the Company is the controlling partner in limited-life partnerships owning
six
properties. These
six
partnership agreements contain provisions that require the partnerships to be liquidated through the sale of their assets upon reaching a date specified in each respective partnership agreement. The Company, as controlling partner, has an obligation to cause the property owning partnerships to distribute the proceeds of liquidation to the Noncontrolling Interests in these Partially Owned Properties only to the extent that the net proceeds received by the partnerships from the sale of their assets warrant a distribution based on the partnership agreements. As of
December 31, 2011
, the Company estimates the value of Noncontrolling Interest distributions for these
six
properties would have been approximately
$33.8 million
(Settlement Value) had the partnerships been liquidated. This Settlement Value is based on estimated third party consideration realized by the partnerships upon disposition of the
six
Partially Owned Properties and is net of all other assets and liabilities, including yield maintenance on the mortgages encumbering the properties, that would have been due on
December 31, 2011
had those mortgages been prepaid. Due to, among other things, the inherent uncertainty in the sale of real estate assets, the amount of any potential distribution to the Noncontrolling Interests in the Company's Partially Owned Properties is subject to change. To the extent that the partnerships' underlying assets are worth less than the underlying liabilities, the Company has no obligation to remit any consideration to the Noncontrolling Interests in these Partially Owned Properties.
Effective January 1, 2011, companies are required to separately disclose purchases, sales, issuances and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of recurring Level 3 fair value measurements. This does not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial position. See Note 9 for further discussion.
Effective January 1, 2012, companies will be required to separately disclose the amounts and reasons for any transfers of assets and liabilities into and out of Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. For fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3), companies will be required to disclose quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs used for all Level 3 measurements and a description of the Company's valuation processes in determining fair value. In addition, companies will be required to provide a qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of recurring Level 3 measurements to changes in the unobservable inputs disclosed, including the interrelationship between inputs. Companies will also be required to disclose information about when the current use of a non-financial asset measured at fair value differs from its highest and best use and the hierarchy classification for items whose fair value is not recorded on the balance sheet but is disclosed in the notes. The Company does not expect this will have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial position.
Effective January 1, 2009, issuers of certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash on conversion were required to separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects each issuer's nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. As the Company was required to apply this retrospectively, the accounting for its
$650.0 million
3.85%
convertible unsecured notes that were issued in
August 2006
with a final maturity in
August 2026
was affected. On
August 18, 2011
, the Company redeemed these notes at par (
$482.5 million
was outstanding on
August 18, 2011
) and no premium was paid. The Company recognized
$11.8 million
,
$18.6 million
and
$20.6 million
in interest expense related to the stated coupon rate of
3.85%
for the years ended
December 31, 2011
,
2010
and
2009
, respectively. The amount of the conversion option as of the date of issuance calculated by the Company using a
5.80%
effective interest rate was
$44.3 million
and was amortized to interest expense over the expected life of the convertible notes (through the first put date on
August 18, 2011
). Total amortization of the cash discount and conversion option discount on the unsecured notes resulted in a reduction to earnings of approximately
$5.0 million
,
$7.8 million
and
$10.6 million
, respectively, or
$0.02

$0.03
per share/Unit and
$0.04

$27.0 million
, decreased the January 1, 2009 balance of notes by
$17.3 million
and increased the January 1, 2009 balance of paid in capital (included in general partner's capital in the Operating Partnership's financial statements) by
$44.3 million

$44.3 million
at both
December 31, 2011

The equity positions of various individuals and entities that contributed their properties to the Operating Partnership in exchange for OP Units, as well as the equity positions of the holders of LTIP Units, are collectively referred to as the Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership. Subject to certain exceptions (including the book-up requirements of LTIP Units), the Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership may exchange their Units with EQR for Common Shares on a one-for-one basis. The carrying value of the Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership (including redeemable interests) is allocated based on the number of Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership Units in total in proportion to the number of Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership Units in total plus the number of Common Shares. Net income is allocated to the Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership based on the weighted average ownership percentage during the period.
The Operating Partnership has the right but not the obligation to make a cash payment instead of issuing Common Shares to any and all holders of Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership Units requesting an exchange of their OP Units with EQR. Once the Operating Partnership elects not to redeem the Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership Units for cash, EQR is obligated to deliver Common Shares to the exchanging holder of the Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership Units.
The Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership Units are classified as either mezzanine equity or permanent equity. If EQR is required, either by contract or securities law, to deliver registered Common Shares, such Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership are differentiated and referred to as Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership. Instruments that require settlement in registered shares can not be classified in permanent equity as it is not always completely within an issuers control to deliver registered shares. Therefore, settlement in cash is assumed and that responsibility for settlement

in cash is deemed to fall to the Operating Partnership as the primary source of cash for EQR, resulting in presentation in the mezzanine section of the balance sheet. The Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership are adjusted to the greater of carrying value or fair market value based on the Common Share price of EQR at the end of each respective reporting period. EQR has the ability to deliver unregistered Common Shares for the remaining portion of the Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership Units that are classified in permanent equity at

The carrying value of the Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership is allocated based on the number of Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership Units in proportion to the number of Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership Units in total. Such percentage of the total carrying value of Units which is ascribed to the Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership is then adjusted to the greater of carrying value or fair market value as described above. As of
December 31, 2011
, the Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership have a redemption value of approximately
$416.4 million

Net proceeds from EQR Common Share and Preferred Share (see definition below) offerings are contributed by EQR to ERPOP. In return for those contributions, EQR receives a number of OP Units in ERPOP equal to the number of Common Shares it has issued in the equity offering (or in the case of a preferred equity offering, a number of preference units in ERPOP equal in number and having the same terms as the Preferred Shares issued in the equity offering). As a result, the net offering proceeds from Common Shares and Preferred Shares are allocated between shareholders equity and Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership to account for the change in their respective percentage ownership of the underlying equity of ERPOP.

institutional partner to
two
separate entities/transactions (one in December 2010 and the other in August 2011), each owning a developable land parcel, in exchange for
$40.1 million
in cash and retained a
20%
equity interest in both of these entities. These land parcels are now unconsolidated. Total project costs are approximately
$232.8 million
and construction will be predominantly funded with
two
separate long-term, non-recourse secured loans from the partner. While the Company is the managing member of both of the joint ventures, is responsible for constructing both of the projects and has given certain construction cost overrun guarantees, all major decisions are made jointly, the large majority of funding is provided by the partner and the partner has significant involvement in and oversight of the ongoing projects, neither of which is a VIE. The Company's remaining funding obligations are currently estimated at

In December 2011, the Company and Toll Brothers (NYSE: TOL) jointly acquired a vacant land parcel at 400 Park Avenue South in New York City. The Company's and Toll Brothers' allocated portions of the purchase price were approximately
$76.1 million
and
$57.9 million
, respectively. Until the core and shell of the building is complete, the building and land will be owned jointly and are required to be consolidated on the Company's balance sheet. Thereafter, the Company will solely own and control the rental portion of the building (floors 2-22) and Toll Brothers will solely own and control the for sale portion of the building (floors 23-40). Once the core and shell are complete, the Toll Brothers' portion of the property will be deconsolidated from the Company's balance sheet. The acquisition was financed through contributions by the Company and Toll Brothers of approximately
$102.5 million
and
$75.7 million
, respectively, which included the land purchase noted above and taxes and fees of
$0.4 million
and
$0.3 million

. The Company has identified certain development partnerships as VIEs as the Company provides substantially all of the capital for these ventures (other than third party mortgage debt, if any) despite the fact that each partner legally owns
50%
of each venture. The Company is the primary beneficiary as it exerts the most significant power over the ventures, absorbs the majority of the expected losses and has the right to receive a majority of the expected residual returns. The assets net of liabilities of the Companys VIEs are restricted in their use to the specific VIE to which they relate and are not available for general corporate use. The Company does not have any unconsolidated VIEs.

On December 2, 2011, the Company obtained a commitment for a senior unsecured bridge loan facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed
$1.0 billion
to finance the potential acquisition of an ownership interest in Archstone, a privately-held owner, operator and developer of multifamily apartment properties. The Company paid fees of
$2.6 million
to structure this facility, which were recorded as deferred financing costs and amortized in 2011. See Note 18 for discussion on the cancellation of this facility.
On October 11, 2007, the Company closed on a
$500.0 million
senior unsecured term loan. Effective April 5, 2011, the Company exercised the second of its
two
one
-year extension options and as a result, the maturity date is now
October 5, 2012
. The Company has the ability to increase available borrowings by an additional
$250.0 million
under certain circumstances. The loan bears interest at variable rates based upon LIBOR plus a spread (currently
0.50%
) dependent upon the current credit rating on the Companys long-term senior unsecured debt.
On August 23, 2006, the Company issued
$650.0 million
of exchangeable notes that were to mature on
August 15, 2026
. The notes bore interest at a fixed rate of
3.85%
. The notes were exchangeable into Common Shares, at the option of the holders, under specific circumstances or on or after August 15, 2025, at an exchange rate of
16.3934
shares per
$1,000
principal amount of notes (equivalent to an exchange price of
$61.00
per share). On August 18, 2011 (the "Redemption Date"), the Operating Partnership redeemed all of the outstanding notes for 
$482.5 million
in cash, which was equal to 100% of the principal amount of such notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to but excluding the Redemption Date. See Note 2 for more information on the change in the recognition of interest expense for these notes.
Lines of Credit
In July 2011, the Company replaced its then existing unsecured revolving credit facility with a new
$1.25 billion
unsecured revolving credit facility maturing on
July 13, 2014
, subject to a one-year extension option exercisable by the Company. The Company has the ability to increase available borrowings by an additional
$500.0 million
by adding additional banks to the facility or obtaining the agreement of existing banks to increase their commitments. See Note 18 for discussion on the increase of available borrowings for this facility. The interest rate on advances under the new credit facility will generally be LIBOR plus a spread (currently
1.15%
) and the Company pays an annual facility fee of
0.2%
. Both the spread and the facility fee are dependent on the credit rating of the Company's long-term debt. This facility replaced the Company's
$1.425 billion
facility which was scheduled to mature in
February 2012
. The Company wrote-off
$0.2 million
in unamortized deferred financing costs related to the old facility.
As of
December 31, 2011
, the amount available on the new credit facility was
$1.22 billion
(net of
$31.8 million
which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit) and there was no amount outstanding. During the year ended

The valuation of financial instruments requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments. The Company, where possible, bases the fair values of its financial instruments, including its derivative instruments, on listed market prices and third party quotes. Where these are not available, the Company bases its estimates on current instruments with similar terms and maturities or on other factors relevant to the financial instruments.

A three-level valuation hierarchy exists for disclosure of fair value measurements. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. A financial instruments categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels are defined as follows:

The Companys derivative positions are valued using models developed by the respective counterparty as well as models developed internally by the Company that use as their basis readily observable market parameters (such as forward yield curves and credit default swap data). Employee holdings other than Common Shares within the supplemental executive retirement plan (the SERP) are valued using quoted market prices for identical assets and are included in other assets and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The Companys investment securities are valued using quoted market prices or readily available market interest rate data. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership/Redeemable Limited Partners are valued using the quoted market price of Common Shares.

The Company's real estate asset impairment charges were the result of an analysis of the parcels' estimated fair value (determined using internally developed models that were based on market assumptions and comparable sales data) compared to their current capitalized carrying value. The market assumptions used as inputs to the Company's fair value model include construction costs, leasing assumptions, growth rates, discount rates, terminal capitalization rates and development yields, along with the Company's current plans for each individual asset. The Company uses data on its existing portfolio of properties and its recent acquisition and development properties, as well as similar market data from third party sources, when available, in determining these inputs. The valuation techniques used to measure fair value is consistent with how similar assets were measured in prior periods. See Note 18 for further discussion.

Any Common Shares issued pursuant to EQR's incentive equity compensation and employee share purchase plans will result in ERPOP issuing OP Units to EQR on a one-for-one basis with ERPOP receiving the net cash proceeds of such issuances.
On June 16, 2011, the shareholders of EQR approved the Company's 2011 Plan. The 2011 Plan reserved
12,980,741
Common Shares for issuance. In conjunction with the approval of the 2011 Plan, no further awards may be granted under the 2002 Share Incentive Plan. The 2011 Plan expires on June 16, 2021. As of December 31, 2011,
12,473,580
shares were available for future issuance.
Pursuant to the 2011 Plan, the 2002 Share Incentive Plan, as restated, and the Amended and Restated 1993 Share Option and Share Award Plan, as amended (collectively the Share Incentive Plans), officers, trustees and key employees of the Company may be granted share options to acquire Common Shares (Options) including non-qualified share options (NQSOs), incentive share options (ISOs) and share appreciation rights (SARs), or may be granted restricted or non-restricted shares (including performance-based awards), subject to conditions and restrictions as described in the Share Incentive Plans. Prior to 2007, certain executive officers of the Company participated in the Companys performance-based restricted share plan but the Company has not awarded any performance-based award grants since 2006. Options, SARs, restricted shares, performance shares and LTIP Units (see discussion below) are sometimes collectively referred to herein as Awards.
The Options are generally granted at the fair market value of the Companys Common Shares at the date of grant, vest in
three equal installments
over a
three-year
period, are exercisable upon vesting and expire
ten years from the date of grant
. The exercise price for all Options under the Share Incentive Plans is equal to the fair market value of the underlying Common Shares at the time the Option is granted. Options exercised result in new Common Shares being issued on the open market. The 2002
F-47
Table of Contents
Share Incentive Plan and the Amended and Restated 1993 Share Option and Share Award Plan, as amended, will terminate at such time as all outstanding Awards have expired or have been exercised/vested. The Board of Trustees may at any time amend or terminate the Share Incentive Plans, but termination will not affect Awards previously granted. Any Options which had vested prior to such a termination would remain exercisable by the holder.
Restricted shares that have been awarded through December 31, 2011 generally vest
three years from the award date
. In addition, the Companys unvested restricted shareholders have the same voting rights as any other Common Share holder. During the
three-year period of restriction
, the Companys unvested restricted shareholders receive quarterly dividend payments on their shares at the same rate and on the same date as any other Common Share holder. As a result, dividends paid on unvested restricted shares are included as a component of retained earnings (included in general partner's capital in the Operating Partnership's financial statements) and have not been considered in reducing net income available to Common Shares/Units in a manner similar to the Companys preferred share/preference unit dividends for the earnings per share/Unit calculation. If employment is terminated prior to the lapsing of the restriction, the shares are generally canceled.
In December 2008, the Companys then existing 2002 Share Incentive Plan was amended to allow for the issuance of long-term incentive plan units (LTIP Units) to officers of the Company as an alternative to the Companys restricted shares. The 2011 Plan also allows for the issuance of LTIP Units. LTIP Units are a class of partnership interests that under certain conditions, including vesting, are convertible by the holder into an equal number of OP Units, which are redeemable by the holder for Common Shares on a one-for-one basis or the cash value of such shares at the option of the Company. In connection with the grant of long-term incentive compensation for services provided during a year, officers of the Company are allowed to choose, on a one-for-one basis, between restricted shares and LTIP Units. In January 2011, certain holders of restricted shares converted these shares into LTIP Units. Similar to restricted shares, LTIP Units generally vest
three years from the award date
. In addition, LTIP Unit holders receive quarterly dividend payments on their LTIP Units at the same rate and on the same date as any other OP Unit holder. As a result, dividends paid on LTIP Units are included as a component of Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership/Limited Partners' capital and have not been considered in reducing net income available to Common Shares/Units in a manner similar to the Companys preferred share/preference unit dividends for the earnings per share/Unit calculation. If employment is terminated prior to vesting, the LTIP Units are generally canceled. An LTIP Unit will automatically convert to an OP Unit when the capital account of each LTIP Unit increases (books-up) to a specified target. If the capital target is not attained within
ten years
following the date of issuance, the LTIP Unit will automatically be canceled and no compensation will be payable to the holder of such canceled LTIP Unit.
All Trustees, with the exception of the Company's non-executive Chairman and employee Trustees, are granted options and restricted shares that vest
one-year
from the grant date that corresponds to the term for which he or she has been elected to serve. The non-executive Chairman's grants vest over the same term or period as all other employees.
The Company's Share Incentive Plans provide for certain benefits upon retirement. For employees hired prior to January 1, 2009, retirement generally means the termination of employment (other than for cause): (i) on or after age 62; or (ii) prior to age 62 after meeting the requirements of the Rule of 70 (described below). For employees hired after January 1, 2009, retirement generally means the termination of employment (other than for cause) after meeting the requirements of the Rule of 70. For Trustees, retirement generally means termination of service on the Board (other than for cause) on or after age 72.
The Rule of 70 is met when an employees years of service with the Company (which must be at least 15 years) plus his or her age (which must be at least 55 years) on the date of termination equals or exceeds 70 years. In addition, the employee must give the Company at least 6 months advance written notice of his or her intention to retire and sign a release upon termination of employment, releasing the Company from customary claims and agreeing to ongoing non-competition and employee non-solicitation provisions.
Under the Company's definitions of retirement, several of its executive officers, including its Chief Executive Officer, are retirement eligible. The Company's non-executive Chairman is retirement eligible in 2013.
For employees hired prior to January 1, 2009 who retire at or after age 62 or for Trustees who retire at or after age 72, such employees or Trustee's unvested restricted shares, LTIP Units and share options would immediately vest, and share options would continue to be exercisable for the balance of the applicable ten-year option period, as is provided under the Share Incentive Plans. For all other employees (those hired after January 1, 2009 and those hired before such date who choose to retire prior to age 62), upon such retirement under the Rule of 70 definition of retirement of employees, such employees unvested restricted shares, LTIP Units and share options would continue to vest per the original vesting schedule (subject to immediate vesting upon the occurrence of a subsequent change in control of the Company or the employees death), and options would continue to be exercisable for the balance of the applicable ten-year option period, subject to the employees compliance with the non-competition and employee non-solicitation provisions. If an employee violates these provisions after such retirement, all unvested restricted shares, unvested LTIP Units and unvested and vested share options at the time of the violation would be void, unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Trustees.

The Company established a supplemental executive retirement plan (the SERP) to provide certain officers and trustees an opportunity to defer a portion of their eligible compensation in order to save for retirement. The SERP is restricted to investments in Common Shares, certain marketable securities that have been specifically approved and cash equivalents. The deferred compensation liability represented in the SERP and the securities issued to fund such deferred compensation liability are consolidated by the Company and carried on the Companys balance sheet, and the Companys Common Shares held in the SERP are accounted for as a reduction to paid in capital (included in general partner's capital in the Operating Partnership's financial statements).

, the Company filed with the SEC a Form S-3 Registration Statement to register
4,850,000
Common Shares under the DRIP Plan, which included the remaining shares available for issuance under the 2008 registration, which terminated as of such date. The registration statement was automatically declared effective the same day and expires at the earlier of the date on which all
4,850,000
shares have been issued or November 18, 2014. The Company has
4,849,796
Common Shares available for issuance under the DRIP Plan at
December 31, 2011
.
The DRIP Plan provides holders of record and beneficial owners of Common Shares and Preferred Shares with a simple and convenient method of investing cash distributions in additional Common Shares (which is referred to herein as the Dividend Reinvestment  DRIP Plan). Common Shares may also be purchased on a monthly basis with optional cash payments made by participants in the DRIP Plan and interested new investors, not currently shareholders of EQR, at the market price of the Common Shares less a discount ranging between
0%
and
5%
, as determined in accordance with the DRIP Plan (which is referred to herein as the Share Purchase  DRIP Plan). Common Shares purchased under the DRIP Plan may, at the option of EQR, be directly issued by EQR or purchased by EQR's transfer agent in the open market using participants funds. The net proceeds from any Common Share issuances are contributed to ERPOP in exchange for OP Units.
Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement for the Operating Partnership, ERPOP is required to reimburse EQR
F-51

for all expenses incurred by EQR in excess of income earned by EQR through its indirect
1%
ownership of various entities. Amounts paid on behalf of EQR are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as general and administrative expenses.
The Company leases its corporate headquarters from an entity controlled by EQRs Chairman of the Board of Trustees. The lease terminates on
January 31, 2022
. Amounts incurred for such office space for the years ended
December 31, 2011
,
2010
and
2009
, respectively, were approximately
$2.2 million
,
$2.7 million
and
$3.0 million
. The Company believes these amounts equal market rates for such rental space.
The Company, as an owner of real estate, is subject to various Federal, state and local environmental laws. Compliance by the Company with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on the Company. However, the Company cannot predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations on its current properties or on properties that it may acquire in the future.
The Company is party to a housing discrimination lawsuit brought by a non-profit civil rights organization in April 2006 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The suit alleges that the Company designed and built approximately
300
of its properties in violation of the accessibility requirements of the Fair Housing Act and Americans With Disabilities Act. The suit seeks actual and punitive damages, injunctive relief (including modification of non-compliant properties), costs and attorneys' fees. The Company believes it has a number of viable defenses, including that a majority of the named properties were completed before the operative dates of the statutes in question and/or were not designed or built by the Company. Accordingly, the Company is defending the suit vigorously. Due to the pendency of the Company's defenses and the uncertainty of many other critical factual and legal issues, it is not possible to determine or predict the outcome of the suit or a possible loss or a range of loss, and no amounts have been accrued at
December 31, 2011
. While no assurances can be given, the Company does not believe that the suit, if adversely determined, would have a material adverse effect on the Company.
The Company does not believe there is any other litigation pending or threatened against it that, individually or in the aggregate, may reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company.
The Company had established a reserve and recorded a corresponding reduction to its net gain on sales of discontinued operations related to potential liabilities associated with its condominium conversion activities. The reserve covered potential product liability related to each conversion. The Company periodically assessed the adequacy of the reserve and made adjustments as necessary. During the year ended
December 31, 2011
, the Company recorded additional reserves of approximately
$0.1 million
, paid approximately
$2.3 million
in settlements and legal fees and released approximately
$1.1 million
of remaining reserves. No amounts remain accrued at
December 31, 2011
as the Company does not believe it has material exposure remaining for its past condominium conversion activities.
As of
December 31, 2011
, the Company has
six
consolidated projects totaling
1,535
apartment units in various stages of development with commitments to fund of approximately
$351.2 million
and estimated completion dates ranging through
March 31, 2014
, as well as other completed development projects that are in various stages of lease up or are stabilized. The consolidated projects under development are being developed solely by the Company, while certain completed development projects were either developed solely by the Company or co-developed with various third party development partners. The development venture agreements with partners are primarily deal-specific, with differing terms regarding profit-sharing, equity contributions, returns on investment, buy-sell agreements and other customary provisions. The partner is most often the general or managing partner of the development venture. The typical buy-sell arrangements contain appraisal rights and provisions that provide the right, but not the obligation, for the Company to acquire the partner's interest in the project at fair market value upon the expiration of a negotiated time period (typically two to five years after substantial completion of the project).
As of
December 31, 2011
, the Company has
two
unconsolidated projects totaling
945
apartment units under development with commitments to fund of approximately
$5.4 million
and estimated completion dates ranging through
September 30, 2013
. While the Company is the managing member of both of the joint ventures, is responsible for constructing both projects and has given certain construction cost overrun guarantees, all major decisions are made jointly, the large majority of funding is provided by the partner and the partner has significant involvement in and oversight of the ongoing projects. The buy-sell arrangements contain provisions that provide the right, but not the obligation, for the Company to acquire the partner's interests or sell its interests at any time following the occurrence of certain pre-defined events (including at stabilization) described in the development venture agreements.
In December 2011, the Company and Toll Brothers (NYSE: TOL) jointly acquired a vacant land parcel at 400 Park Avenue South in New York City. The Company's and Toll Brothers' allocated portions of the purchase price were approximately
$76.1 million
and
$57.9 million
, respectively. Until the core and shell of the building is complete, the building and land will be
F-52
Table of Contents
owned jointly and are required to be consolidated on the Company's balance sheet. Thereafter, the Company will solely own and control the rental portion of the building (floors 2-22) and Toll Brothers will solely own and control the for sale portion of the building (floors 23-40). Once the core and shell are complete, the Toll Brothers' portion of the property will be deconsolidated from the Company's balance sheet. The acquisition was financed through contributions by the Company and Toll Brothers of approximately
$102.5 million
and
$75.7 million
, respectively, which included the land purchase noted above and taxes and fees of
$0.4 million
and
$0.3 million
, respectively. Restricted deposits were made to the venture of
$26.0 million
and
$17.5 million
, respectively, to collateralize construction guarantees. As of December 31, 2011, Toll Brothers' noncontrolling interest balance totaled
$75.8 million
.
During the years ended
December 31, 2011
,
2010
and
2009
, total operating lease payments expensed for office space, including a portion of real estate taxes, insurance, repairs and utilities, and including rent due under three ground leases, aggregated
$7.1 million
,
$7.6 million
and
$8.4 million
, respectively.
The Company has entered into a retirement benefits agreement with its Chairman of the Board of Trustees and deferred compensation agreements with its Vice Chairman and two former chief executive officers. During the years ended
December 31, 2011
,
2010
and
2009
, the Company recognized compensation expense of
$1.0 million
,
$0.9 million
and
$1.2 million
, respectively, related to these agreements.
The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations for minimum rent payments under operating leases and deferred compensation for the next five years and thereafter as of
December 31, 2011
:
Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by senior management. Senior management decides how resources are allocated and assesses performance on a monthly basis.
The Companys primary business is the acquisition, development and management of multifamily residential properties, which includes the generation of rental and other related income through the leasing of apartment units to residents. Senior management evaluates the performance of each of our apartment communities individually and geographically, and both on a same store and non-same store basis; however, each of our apartment communities generally has similar economic characteristics, residents, products and services. The Companys operating segments have been aggregated by geography in a manner identical to that which is provided to its chief operating decision maker.
The Companys fee and asset management, development (including its partially owned properties) and condominium conversion activities are immaterial and do not individually meet the threshold requirements of a reportable segment and as such, have been aggregated in the Other segment in the tables presented below.
All revenues are from external customers and there is no customer who contributed
10%
or more of the Companys total revenues during the three years ended
December 31, 2011
,
2010
or
2009
.
The primary financial measure for the Companys rental real estate segment is net operating income (NOI), which represents rental income less: 1) property and maintenance expense; 2) real estate taxes and insurance expense; and 3) property management expense (all as reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations). The Company believes that NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of its operating performance because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the Companys apartment communities. Current year NOI is compared to prior year NOI and current year budgeted NOI as a measure of financial performance. The following tables present NOI for each segment from our rental real estate specific to continuing operations for the years ended
December 31, 2011
,
2010
and
2009
, respectively, as well as total assets for the years ended
December 31, 2011
and

During the year ended
December 31, 2011
, the Company received
$4.5 million
for the termination of its royalty participation in LRO/Rainmaker, a revenue management system, which is included in interest and other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. During the year ended
December 31, 2010
, an arbitration panel awarded commissions, interest and costs in the amount of
$1.7 million
to the listing and marketing agent related to
38
potential condo sales at one of the Companys properties. In addition, during
2011
,
2010
and
2009
, the Company received
$0.8 million
,
$5.2 million
and
$0.2 million
, respectively, for the settlement of litigation/insurance claims, which are included in interest and other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
During the year ended
December 31, 2011
, the Company disposed of its corporate housing business for a sales price of approximately
$4.0 million
, of which the Company provided
$2.0 million
of seller financing to the buyer. At the time of sale, the full amount of the seller financing was reserved against and the related gain was deferred. The Company subsequently collected
$0.2 million
on this note receivable and has recognized a cumulative net gain on the sale of approximately
$1.2 million
.
    
On December 2, 2011, the Company entered into a contract with affiliates of Bank of America and Barclays PLC to acquire, for
$1.325 billion
, half of their interests - an approximately
26.5%
interest overall - in Archstone, a privately-held owner, operator and developer of multifamily apartment properties. On January 20, 2012, Lehman Brothers, the other owner of Archstone, acquired this
26.5%
interest pursuant to a right of first offer and as a result, the Company's contract with the sellers was terminated. The Company now has the exclusive right, exercisable on or before April 19, 2012, to contract to purchase the remaining
26.5%
interest in Archstone owned by the same sellers for a price, determined by the Company, equal to
$1.485 billion
or higher. Any purchase of the remaining interest by the Company would also be subject to Lehman's right of first offer, and if Lehman were to exercise such right, the Company would be entitled to a break-up fee of
$80.0 million
, subject to repayment in certain limited circumstances. In 2011, the Company incurred Archstone-related expenses of approximately
$4.4 million
. Approximately
$2.6 million
of this total was financing-related and
$1.8 million
was pursuit costs.
    
    
During the year ended
December 31, 2010
, the Company recorded a
$45.4 million
non-cash asset impairment charge on two parcels of land held for development as a result of changes in the Companys future plans for those parcels. The Company now intends to sell one parcel in the near term and contemplated a joint venture structure for the other, necessitating this impairment charge. During the year ended
December 31, 2009
, the Company recorded an
$11.1 million
non-cash asset impairment charge on a parcel of land held for development. These charges were the result of an analysis of each parcels estimated fair value (determined using internally developed models that were based on market assumptions and comparable sales data) compared to its current capitalized carrying value. The market assumptions used as inputs to the Companys fair value model include construction costs, leasing assumptions, growth rates, discount rates, terminal capitalization rates and development yields, along with the Companys current plans for each individual asset. The Company uses data on its existing portfolio of properties and its recent acquisition
F-56
Table of Contents
and development properties, as well as similar market data from third party sources, when available, in determining these inputs.
        
In 2010, a portion of the parking garage collapsed at one of the Companys rental properties (Prospect Towers in Hackensack, New Jersey). The Company estimates that the costs related to such collapse (both expensed and capitalized), including providing for residents' interim needs, lost revenue and garage reconstruction, will be approximately
$23.0 million
, before insurance reimbursements of
$12.0 million
. The garage has been rebuilt with costs capitalized as incurred. Other costs, like those to accommodate displaced residents, lost revenue due to a portion of the property being temporarily unavailable for occupancy and legal costs, reduce earnings as they are incurred. Generally, insurance proceeds are recorded as increases to earnings as they are received. During the year ended
December 31, 2011
, the Company received approximately
$6.1 million
in insurance proceeds which offset expenses of
$1.7 million
that were recorded relating to this loss and are included in real estate taxes and insurance on the consolidated statements of operations. During the year ended
December 31, 2010
, the Company received approximately
$4.0 million
in insurance proceeds which fully offset the impairment charge recognized to write-off the net book value of the collapsed garage and partially offset expenses of
$5.5 million
that were recorded relating to this loss and are included in real estate taxes and insurance on the consolidated statements of operations.
