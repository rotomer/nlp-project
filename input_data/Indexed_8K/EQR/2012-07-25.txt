Equity Residential Reports Second Quarter Results
 
Same Store Revenues Increase 5.5%; Same Store NOI Increases 7.5%
 
CHICAGO, IL - July 25, 2012 - Equity Residential (NYSE: EQR) today reported results for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2012. All per share results are reported on a fully-diluted basis.
 
2012 will be another very good year for Equity Residential, said David J. Neithercut, Equity Residentials President and CEO. Apartment fundamentals are extremely positive and, as expected, we should deliver same store revenue growth for the full year of around 5.5%, which will lead to another very strong year of same store net operating income performance in excess of 7%. Longer term, we expect fundamentals to remain favorable and for continued operating performance above historical levels.
 
Second Quarter 2012
 
FFO (Funds from Operations), as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), for the second quarter of 2012 was $0.64 per share compared to $0.58 per share in the second quarter of 2011.
 
For the second quarter of 2012, the company reported Normalized FFO of $0.68 per share compared to $0.60 per share in the same period of 2011. The difference is due primarily to:
 
 
 
 
Normalized FFO begins with FFO and eliminates certain items that by their nature are not comparable from period to period or that tend to obscure the companys actual operating performance. A reconciliation and definition of Normalized FFO are provided on pages 24 and 26 of this release and the company has included guidance for Normalized FFO on page 25 of this release.
 
For the second quarter of 2012, the company reported earnings of $0.33 per share compared to $1.85 per share in the second quarter of 2011. The difference is due primarily to higher gains from property sales in the second quarter of 2011 as well as the items discussed above.
 
 
 
 
 
Six Months Ended June 30, 2012
 
FFO for the six months ended June 30, 2012 was $1.24 per share compared to $1.14 per share in the same period of 2011.
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2012, the company reported Normalized FFO of $1.29 per share compared to $1.16 per share in the same period of 2011.
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2012, the company reported earnings of $0.80 per share compared to $2.30 per share in the same period of 2011.
 
Same Store Results
 
On a same store second quarter to second quarter comparison, which includes 105,604 apartment units, revenues increased 5.5%, expenses increased 2.0% and NOI increased 7.5%.
 
On a same store six-month to six-month comparison, which includes 103,950 apartment units, revenues increased 5.5%, expenses increased 1.9% and NOI increased 7.5%.
 
Acquisitions/Dispositions
 
During the second quarter of 2012, the company acquired two properties with a total of 812 apartment units for an aggregate purchase price of $510.9 million at a weighted average capitalization (cap) rate of 5.0%.
 
During the quarter, the company sold nine properties, consisting of 1,662 apartment units, for an aggregate sale price of $129.9 million at a weighted average cap rate of 6.7% generating an unlevered internal rate of return (IRR), inclusive of management costs, of 9.0%.
 
During the first six months of 2012, the company acquired five properties with a total of 1,356 apartment units for an aggregate purchase price of $670.0 million at a weighted average cap rate of 4.8% and two land parcels for $23.7 million.
 
Also during the first six months of 2012, the company sold 12 properties with a total of 3,184 apartment units for an aggregate sale price of $336.3 million at a weighted average cap rate of 6.4% generating an unlevered IRR, inclusive of management costs, of 11.0%.
 
Archstone
 
As previously disclosed, on June 6, 2012, Equity Residential received $150 million in termination fees from Bank of America, Barclays Bank PLC (together, the Sellers) and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (Lehman) as a result of Lehmans acquisition of the Sellers remaining 26.5% interest in Archstone, a privately-held owner, operator and developer of multifamily apartment properties. The company will recognize $70 million of these fees in interest and other income in the third quarter of 2012 and expects to recognize $80 million of these fees in interest and other income in the fourth quarter of 2012, subject to resolution of certain contingencies more fully described in previous disclosures. These termination fees will not be included in the companys Normalized FFO.
 
Financing Activities
 
The company previously entered into a new senior unsecured $500 million delayed draw term loan facility that provided for a single draw anytime on or before July 4, 2012 and could have been used for any corporate purpose including to finance an Archstone acquisition. The company elected not to draw on this facility and the facility expired undrawn.
 
 
 
 
 
As previously disclosed on July 20, 2012, the company called for redemption, on August 20, 2012, all of its outstanding Series N Depositary Shares (with a liquidation value of $150 million) each representing 1/10 of a 6.48% Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Share of Beneficial Interest. As a result of this redemption, the company will record a non-cash charge of approximately $5.1 million, or approximately $0.02 per share, in the third quarter of 2012 for the write-off of the original issuance costs. This charge will reduce earnings per share and FFO but will not impact Normalized FFO.
 
During the quarter, the company issued 1,081,797 units in its operating limited partnership having a value of approximately $66.6 million in connection with a property acquisition. The company has not issued any common shares under its At-the-Market (ATM) share offering program since the first quarter of 2012.
 
As of July 24, 2012, the company had cash on hand of approximately $75 million and approximately $1.72 billion available on its revolving credit facility.
 
Third Quarter 2012 Guidance
 
The company has established a Normalized FFO guidance range of $0.70 to $0.74 per share for the third quarter of 2012. The difference between the companys second quarter 2012 Normalized FFO of $0.68 per share and the midpoint of the third quarter guidance range of $0.72 per share is primarily due to:
 
 
 
Full Year 2012 Guidance
 
The company has revised its guidance for its full year 2012 same store operating performance, transactions and Normalized FFO results as well as other items listed on page 25 of this release. The changes to the full year same store, transactions and Normalized FFO guidance are listed below:
 
 
The difference between the midpoint of the previous Normalized FFO guidance range and the midpoint of the revised guidance range is due primarily to:
