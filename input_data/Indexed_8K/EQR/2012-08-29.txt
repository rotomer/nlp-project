Mr. Tuomi will continue to receive his current base salary until the Effective Date, and will be eligible to receive a cash bonus and equity awards for his service in 2012, consistent with the Companys current practices. For Mr. Tuomis service in 2013, he will be entitled to receive prorated equity awards and a cash bonus (the Prorated Awards) for the six month period ending on the Effective Date. The Prorated Awards, based on 100% of his current target amounts, will be comprised of $250,000 of restricted shares or LTIP Units, $250,000 of share options and a $250,000 cash bonus.
In accordance with the Rule of 70 provisions of the Companys Share Incentive Plans, Mr. Tuomis unvested equity awards will continue to vest per their original vesting schedules (subject to immediate vesting upon the occurrence of a subsequent change in control of the Company or his death or disability), and all options will continue to be exercisable for the balance of the ten-year option periods applicable to such awards, subject in each case to Mr. Tuomis compliance with non-competition and employee non-solicitation provisions. The Rule of 70 is met when an employees years of service with the Company (which must be at least 15 years) plus his or her age (which must be at least 55 years) on the date of termination equals or exceeds 70 years.
