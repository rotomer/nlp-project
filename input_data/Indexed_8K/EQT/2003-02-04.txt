            Other Events
 
                        On January 30, 2003, Equitable Resources, Inc. ("Equitable") issued a press release announcing the results of its fourth quarter and full year 2002 earnings.  A copy of Equitable's press release is attached hereto as an Exhibit (99) and is incorporated in this report by reference.
 
 
 
 
                        Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99
 
 
 
PITTSBURGH, January 30/PRNewswire-FirstCall/  Equitable Resources (NYSE: EQT )
today announced record core earnings per diluted share (EPS) of $2.44 (excluding a $0.08 per share loss related to the Company's stake in Westport Resources) and EPS from continuing operations of $2.36.  This represents a 15% increase over 2001 core EPS of $2.12.  Earnings from continuing operations were $2.30 per diluted share in 2001, which included $0.18 in EPS from Westport.
 
For the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company reported core EPS of $0.71 and EPS from continuing operations of $0.67. Core EPS excludes a $0.04 loss from the Company's share of Westport Resources in the 2002 quarter.  Fourth quarter 2001 core earnings were $0.39 per share, excluding Westport.
 
RESULTS BY SEGMENT
 
Equitable Utilities
 
Equitable Utilities had earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of $101.9 million for 2002, compared with $79.0 million for 2001, a 29% increase.  Net revenues for 2002 were $233.4 million compared to $230.7 million in 2001.  Heating degree-days were 5,258 for 2002, which is 4% colder than the 5,059 degree days recorded in 2001, but 12% wa rmer than the 30-year normal of 5,968.  Commercial and industrial volumes increased 22% resulting in a 5.5% increase in commercial and industrial net revenue.  The net revenue increase was not proportionate to the increase in throughput due to the low margins on industrial business.
 
Total operating expenses for 2002 were $131.5 million compared to $151.8 million in 2001.  After adjusting for 2001 charges for workforce reductions totaling $6.0 million and the fourth quarter 2001 decision to increase the reserves related to bad debts by $7.0 million, total expenses decreased by $7.3 million, or 5% in 2002.  This improvement is related to reduced expenses at the distribution and pipeline operations from prior year initiatives as well as process improvements in the current year, partially offset by increased pension and post-retirement benefit expenses.
 
EBIT for the 2002 fourth quarter was $30.0 million, higher than the $22.0 million earned in the year ago quarter due to significantly colder weather and the absence of the $7.0 million fourth quarter 2001 charge related to bad debts.  The fourth quarter 2002 weather was 36% colder than the prior year and 3% colder than normal, resulting in a 20% increase in net residential revenues.  Excluding the 2001 bad debt charge, expenses were 7% higher than the prior year primarily due to increased pension and post-retirement benefit expenses.

Equitable Supply
 
Previously, Equitable Supply was referred to as Equitable Production.  The Company believes that this business segment will be better understood by expanding the segment's information concerning its two lines of business, production and gathering.
 
Equitable Supply recorded EBIT of  $164.4 million in 2002, 8% lower than the $178.7 million earned in 2001. Revenues declined by 4.4%, due to a 6.7% lower realized natural gas price and a reduction in volume from the sale in December 2001 of the Company's oil dominated fields, which produced about 4 Bcfe per year. These declines were partially offset by increased sales volumes, resulting from increased drilling and production enhancement initiatives. The consolidation of Appalachian Basin Partners effective January 1, 2002 resulted in a minority interest of $7.1 million being reflected on the Company's income statement.
 
These factors were partially offset by a 5.2% reduction in operating expenses, resulting from reduced well-tending expenses, lower third party gathering costs and productivity improvements.
 
EBIT for the 2002 fourth quarter of $47.3 million compared favorably to the $34.8 million of EBIT in 2001. Realized natural gas prices in the 2002 fourth quarter were 26% higher than in the fourth quarter 2001 and operated and gathered volumes increased, while total expenses were essentially unchanged.
 
 
NORESCO
 
< font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The NORESCO segment posted EBIT of $14.5 million, 11.2% higher than the $13.1 million earned in 2001.  EBIT was negatively impacted by a write-off of $5.3 million for the Jamaican power plant in the second quarter.  The write-off was partially offset by the impact of the absence of goodwill amortization.  Goodwill amortization was $3.8 million in 2001.  Total revenue for 2002 was $190.1 million, 21% higher than 2001 revenue of  $157.4 million.  Total expenses were up 5% at $30.5 million in 2002 compared with $29.1 million in 2001.  The construction backlog was $118 million at year-end, down from $128 million at the end of 2001.
 
NORESCO posted EBIT of $5.2 mi llion in the fourth quarter of 2002, compared with $4.2 million in the same period in 2001.  Revenues were up 14% at $54.0 million compared with $47.3 million in the fourth quarter 2001, while total expenses were essentially flat.
 
Westport
 
                Earnings for 2002 include a loss of $5.6 million, net of taxes of $2.9 million, or $0.08 per share from the Company's stake in Westport Resources. For 2001, the Company' s share of Westport earnings was $11.6 million, net of taxes of $6.2 million, or $0.18 per share.  In the 2002 fourth quarter, the Company recorded a loss of $2.5 million, net of taxes of $1.3 million, or  $0.04 per share.  For the fourth quarter 2001, the Company's loss from Westport was $1.4 million, net of taxes of $0.7 million, or $0.02 per share. Westport earnings are not considered core earnings and are excluded from the Company's earnings guidance.  Equitable owns 13.9 million shares, or approximately 20.8% of Westport Resources, which is down from 26.7% at the end of the third quarter.

Full Year 2003 Outlook
 
On October 18, 2002, Equitable forecasted 2003 full-year core , typically measured in heating degree-days.  During winter months, the EPS impact of changes in heating degree days (HDD) is approximately $0.015 per 100 HDD change.  Due to additional hedges discussed below, the impact on 2003 earnings guidance from in the NYMEX gas price
EPS of between $2.70 and $2.80 per share.  Equitable Resources reiterates this earnings guidance.  This guidance assumes normal weather for the year.  Earnings at Equitable Utilities are sensitive to changes in weather

Stock Buyback
 
During the fourth quarter, Equitable repurchased approximately 500,000 shares of EQT stock for a total of 2,905,500 shares for the year.  The number of shares repurchased since October 1998 is approximately 15.2 million out of 18.8 million currently authorized.
 
2002 Capital Expenditures
 
The capital expenditures for 2002 were $218 million.  Equitable Supply spent $147.5 million, of which $114.4 million was spent on developmental drilling and $33.1 million was spent on infrastructure projects.  Equitable Utilities spent $70.2 million, $58.3 million for infrastructure and $11.9 million for business development.
 
2003 Capital Expenditures
 
Equitable forecasts
$228 million of capital expenditures for 2003.  This forecast includes $152 million for Equitable Supply, $73 million for Equitable Utilities, and $3 million for Noresco and Headquarters.
Hedging
 
Equitable has taken advantage of favorable gas prices to significantly hedge production.  The approximate volumes and prices of Equitable's hedges and fixed-price contracts for 2003  2005 are:

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Core Earnings
 
As mentioned previously, Equitable owns 13.9 million shares, or approximately 20.8% of Westport Resources, which is down from 26.7% at the end of the third quarter.  The Company does not have operational control of Westport.  Furthermore, the Company has announced its intention to continue to be diluted as an owner of Westport through reduced share ownership and through Westport's announced strategy of increasing its size.  The Company expects that its influence over Westport will decline in conjunction with the expected dilution.  If the Company is further diluted and its influence decreased, it may be required to change the accounting treatment for its investment from the equity method to the cost method, eliminating the inclusion of Westport's results in Equitable's earnings.  The Company believes core earnings, excluding equity earnings or losses from Westport, provide investors a better understanding of the Company's performance.
 
Earnings Before Interest and Taxes
 
The Company reports earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) by segment in this press release.  Both interest and income taxes are controlled on a consolidated, corporate-wide basis, and are not allocated to the segments.  The following table presents EBIT by corresponding source:
 
 
Adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142
 
In 2002, Equitable adopted SFAS No. 142, a new accounting standard for treatment of goodwill and other intangible assets.  As a result, Equitable's ongoing annual amortization expense was reduced by approximately $3.8 million.  During the second quarter, the Company completed the required initial impairment test of goodwill.  As a result of the impairment test, the Company was required to record a charge for the cumulative effect of an accounting change of $5.5 million, net of tax, retroactive to the first quarter 2002.  The Company has elected to complete its annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter and no additional impairment was required.
 
Impact From a Change in IRS Interpretation of a Previously Disallowed Loss
 
In April 1998, management adopted a formal plan to sell the Company's natural gas midstream operations.   A capital loss was treated as a nondeductible item for tax reporting purposes under the then current Treasury regulations embodying the "loss disallowance rule," resulting in an additional tax recorded on this sale as a reduction to net income from discontinued operations.   In May 2002, the IRS issued new Treasury regulations interpreting the "loss disallowance rule" that are now expected to permit a significant portion of the capital loss to be treated as deductible.  Consequently, in the second quarter, the Company recorded a $9.0 million increase in net income from discontinued operations.
