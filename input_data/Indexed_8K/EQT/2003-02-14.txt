ITEM 5. Other Events Equitable Resources Inc. announced the adoption of new stock ownership guidelines on the January 30, 2003 teleconference with security analysts discussing financial results for the calendar year 2002. This filing provides specific information about the new stock ownership guidelines. STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES The program is designed to satisfy an individual employee's needs for portfolio diversification, while maintaining management stock ownership at levels high enough to assure shareholders of management's commitment to value creation. Shares personally held, stock held in employee benefit plans, and "time restricted" long-term incentive shares qualify toward meeting the plan requirement. As long as an employee maintains qualified shareholdings in excess of the applicable guideline, he or she may sell shares or exercise options for cash by selling shares ("cashless exercise"). The guidelines are mandatory for officers and recommended for other covered employees. In 2002, the Company established a new executive performance incentive share program to provide additional retention incentives for key executive employees. The 143,000 restricted shares awarded in 2002 under the program vest in 2005 in a range of 0-200% of the number of shares awarded, depending on the attainment of pre-set financial performance measures. Because the award is contingent, these restricted shares are not counted toward the stock ownership guidelines.
