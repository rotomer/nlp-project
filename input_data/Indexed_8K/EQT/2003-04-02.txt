EXHIBIT 99 Contact: Cindy Jergan (412) 395-3125 EQUITABLE RESOURCES ESTABLISHES COMMUNITY GIVING FOUNDATION PITTSBURGH, April 2, 2003/ PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Equitable Resources (NYSE: EQT) announced creation of a community giving foundation to further enhance its tradition of financial and volunteer support of non-profit organizations in Pittsburgh and portions of West Virginia and Kentucky. The company said its community contributions focus on the educational needs of children and the habitability issues facing the growing senior population. Over the past several years, Equitable and its business units have contributed more than $5 million to charitable endeavors, including the support of a wide range of programs benefiting youth and seniors. Equitable Resources Foundation, Inc. is being established with an initial investment of approximately $17 million, which represents a donation commitment from Equitable of 905,000 shares of Westport Resources Corporation (NYSE:WRC), an exploration and production company in which Equitable continues to have a passive investment. The donation and subsequent monetization of appreciated shares utilizing the newly established Foundation will support Equitable's increased commitment to a community giving program in a much more efficient manner than a community giving program funded by cash donations. This initial investment is projected to negatively impact Equitable's first quarter 2003 results by three-cents per share and is expected to have no impact on the company's total 2003 earnings guidance of $2.70 to $2.80 per share. Charlene Petrelli, Equitable Resources vice president, human resources, will also serve as president of the Foundation. All inquiries and applications for Foundation grants should be addressed to: "Equitable Resources Foundation, Inc."
