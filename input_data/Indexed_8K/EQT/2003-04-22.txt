PITTSBURGH, April 22, 2003/ PRNewswire/FirstCall Equitable Resources Inc. (NYSE: EQT) announced first quarter 2003 earnings from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change of $1.02 per diluted share, on net income of $64.5 million.  This represents a 28% increase over the $0.80 per diluted share from continuing operations for the same period a year ago.  After the cumulative effect of that accounting change, which related to "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" (SFAS No. 143), the Company earned $0.96 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2003.
 
Quarterly Results by Business
 
Equitable Utilities
 
Equitable Utilities had earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of $59.0 million for the first quarter, a 10% increase over the $53.5 million reported for the same period last year, primarily due to colder weather in 2003.  Heating degree days for the first quarter 2003 were 29% colder than the prior year and 6% colder than normal.  The increased net operating revenues due to weather were partially offset by an increase in weather-related costs.
 
Net operating revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2003 were $97.2 million compared to $85.9 million for the same quarter in 2002.  The increase was mainly due to colder temperatures.  In the first quarter 2003, distribution net revenues increased by $11.9 million and marketing revenues were $1.0 million higher, while pipeline net revenues decreased by $1.6 million.  The decline in pipeline net revenues was due to reduced storage revenue opportunities resulting from cold weather demands.
 
Total expenses for the first quarter were $38.2 million compared to $32.4 million reported during the same period last year.  Weather-related charges, primarily related to bad debt and increased maintenance costs, accounted for nearly 80% of the increase.  The increased provisions for bad debt reflected both higher usage and higher passed-through commodity prices.  The remainder of the increase is attributable to higher pension, legal and insurance expenses.
 
Equitable Supply
 
Equitable Supply had EBIT of $47.8 million for the first quarter, 29% higher than the $37.2 million earned in the same quarter in 2002, primarily due to higher commodity prices.  Production EBIT was up 29% at $42.0 million compared with $32.5 million in the same period last year.  Production revenues were $64.7 million compared with $50.8 million in 2002.  The revenue increase was a result of both a sales volume increase of 0.6 Bcfe and an effective gas price of $3.99 per Mcfe vs. $3.21 per Mcfe in 2002.  Gathering EBIT was also higher by $1.1 million.  The increase was driven by revenues of $17.0 million compared to $15.6 million last year, resulting from higher third party volumes and higher rates.
Total operated volumes were essentially flat year over year at 22.4 Bcfe vs. 22.5 Bcfe in 2002.  Expected increases were not realized due to greater than anticipated external curtailments, impacts from extreme weather and operational matters related to installation of well automation equipment in two districts.
 
 
Operating expenses for the quarter were $33.3 million compared to $27.8 million last year.  The increase in operating expenses was due to increases of $2.5 million in severance tax related to higher gas prices, $1.8 million in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense (DD&A), and $1.2 million in selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A).  Of the $0.08 per Mcfe produced increase in DD&A, approximately $0.03 per Mcfe relates to the developmental drilling program, $0.03 per Mcfe relates to the purchase of the minority interest in ABP and $0.02 per Mcfe relates to the change in accounting standards discussed below (SFAS 143).  The increase in SG&A was mainly due to increased legal and insurance expense and an increase in professional staffing.  Field operating expenses, consisting of gathering and compression and lease operating expenses, were held constant at $10.7 million.
 
NORESCO
 
The NORESCO segment had EBIT of $4.9 million  in the first quarter of 2003, compared to EBIT of $4.2 million in the first quarter last year.  Gross profit margin increased to $9.4 million from $8.6 million.  Total revenue increased by 28% to $45.5 million compared to $35.4 million in 2002.  Operating expenses for the first quarter 2003 were $5.5 million compared to $6.0 million in the first quarter 2002.
 
This segment's quarter-end backlog was $89 million, $19 million lower than the $108 million backlog a year earlier.
 
Other Business
 
2003 Earnings Guidance
 
The Company reiterates its previously forecast 2003 earnings per share of between $2.70 and $2.80.  The $0.10 range is primarily due to the uncertainty of the passage of an energy bill restoring Section 29 energy tax credits that expired at the end of 2002.  Due to significant hedges discussed below, the impact on 2003 earnings guidance from changes in the price of natural gas is expected to be less than $0.005 per share for every $0.10 change in the NYMEX natural gas price.
 
Hedging
 
Equitable has taken advantage of favorable gas prices to significantly hedge production.  The approximate volumes and prices of Equitable's hedges and fixed-price contracts for 2003 to 2005 are:
 
 
* The above price is based on a conversion rate of 1.05 MMbtu/Mcf
 
Stock Buyback
 
During the quarter, Equitable Resources repurchased 448,000 shares of EQT stock.  The total number of shares repurchased since October 1998 is approximately 15.7 million out of the current 18.8 million share repurchase authorization.
 
Westport
 
Equitable Resources reported $3.6 million in equity earnings from its minority ownership in Westport Resources during the first quarter 2003.  Earnings net of tax were $2.3 million, or $0.04 per share.
 
Equitable owns approximately 13 million shares, or 19.5% of Westport Resources, which is down from 20.8% at the end of 2002.  The Company does not have operational control of Westport.  As a result of the decreased ownership, the Company changed the accounting treatment for its investment from the equity method to the cost method, effective March 31, 2003.  The change in accounting methods will eliminate the inclusion of Westport's results in Equitable's earnings in future periods.
Dividend
 
On April 17, 2003, the Board of Directors of Equitable Resources declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 20 cents per share, an 18% increase over the $0.17 dividend last quarter, payable June 1, 2003 to shareholders of record on May 9, 2003.  The company is targeting dividend growth at a rate similar to the rate of earnings per share growth.
 
Community Giving Foundation
 
Equitable established a community giving foundation to facilitate the Company's charitable giving program for approximately 10 years.  The foundation was funded through a contribution of 905,000 shares of Westport Resources Corporation.  Earnings were negatively impacted by $2.2 million net of a tax benefit of $7.1 million, or $0.03 per share in the quarter, as a result of the contribution.  The favorable treatment of contributing appreciated shares reduced the effective tax rate for the quarter from an estimated effective rate of 34.0%.
 
Long Term Debt
 
In February 2003, the Company issued $200 million of notes with an effective interest rate of 5.22% and a maturity date of March 2018.  The proceeds from the issuance will be used for retiring the Company's outstanding 7.35% Trust Preferred Securities and general corporate purposes.
 
Trust Preferred
 
The Company will exercise its option to redeem the entire $125 million of 7.35% Trust Preferred Capital Securities on April 23, 2003.
 
Appalachian Basin Partners
 
In February 2003, the Company purchased the remaining 31% limited partnership interest in Appalachian Basin Partners, LP (ABP) from the minority interest holders for $44.2 million.  As a result, effective February 1, 2003, the Company no longer recognizes minority interest expense associated with ABP, which totaled $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002.
 
Adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143
 
In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standard Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," (Statement No. 143) which became effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2003.  Statement No. 143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized by the Company at the time the obligation is incurred.  The new rules apply to the plugging and abandonment obligation related to Equitable Supply's wells.  When the liability is initially recorded, the Company must also capitalize the cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset.  The liability is accreted to its future value through charges to operating expense and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the asset.  If the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount, the Company will recognize a gain or loss upon settlement.  The Company adopted Statement No. 143 on January 1, 2003.  This cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulted in a one-time charge to earnings of $3.6 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, during the three months ended March 31, 2003.
