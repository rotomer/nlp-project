the adoption of new stock ownership guidelines.  The filing provided information about the Company's stock ownership guidelines.
On February 18, 2003, Equitable Resources Inc. filed a Form 8-K announcing
 
The filing also included a table providing the current ownership status of the Company's officers as of February 14, 2003.  The number of shares held by two officers was incorrectly reported.  The reported number of shares held by Arthur Cantrell and by Randall Crawford were 18,282 and 17,592, respectively.  The reported numbers inadvertently included 5,000 performance share units held by these two officers that do not qualify under the stock ownership guidelines.  Therefore, the correct number of qualified shares held by Arthur Cantrell and by Randall Crawford were 13,282 and 12,592, respectively.
 
Shares personally held, stock held in employee benefit plans, and "time restricted" long-term incentive shares qualify toward meeting the plan requirement.  As long as an employee maintains qualified shareholdings in excess of the applicable guideline, he or she may sell shares or exercise options for cash by selling shares ("cashless exercise").  The guidelines are mandatory for officers and recommended for other covered employees.  Updated amounts for all affected officers, as of September 30, 2003, are provided below:
