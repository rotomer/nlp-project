Exhibit 99
 
 
PITTSBURGH, April 15, 2004/ PRNewswire-FirstCall/  Equitable Resources Inc. (NYSE: EQT) today announced first quarter 2004 income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change of $1.10 per diluted share, 8% higher than the $1.02 reported in the first quarter 2003.  The Board of Directors also announced a 27% dividend increase, the third in five quarters.
 
Quarterly Results by Business
 
Equitable Utilities
 
Equitable Utilities had operating income for the first quarter of $56.0 million compared to $59.0 million reported for the same period last year.  Net operating revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2004 were $93.8 million compared to $97.2 million.  The decrease in operating income and net operating revenues was primarily attributable to weather 6% warmer than the first quarter 2003.  Total operating expenses for the quarter were $37.8 million, slightly lower than the $38.2 million reported last year.
 
Equitable Gas Company reached agreement with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission to make participation in the Company's low-income energy assistance programs more accessible and to improve participants' ability to pay bills.  Beginning April 2, 2004, the Company will collect an additional $0.30 per Mcf from residential customers to fund the enhanced assistance program.  The surcharge will remain in place until Equitable Gas seeks authority to change the funding mechanism.   The Company is committed to working with its Utility Commissions to find innovative ways to serve its customers.
 
Equitable Supply
 
Equitable Supply had operating income for the quarter of $61.5 million, 27% higher than the $48.4 million earned in the same period last year.  Total revenues were $99.2 million, $17.5 million higher than the previous year's total operating revenue of $81.7 million.  Production revenues increased $14.7 million quarter over quarter to $79.4 million in 2004 from $64.7 million in 2003.  The revenue increase was a result of both a sales volume increase of 1.5 Bcfe and an average sales price increase of $0.51 per Mcfe.  Gathering revenues were $2.8 million higher at $19.8 million, compared with $17.0 million in 2003.  The increased gathering revenue was primarily due to an increase in gathering rates.
 
Operating expenses for the quarter were $37.7 million compared to $33.3 million last year.  The increase in total operating expenses was due to increases of $2.5 million in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and $1.9 million in other expenses.
NORESCO
 
NORESCO's net operating revenues increased in the first quarter 2004 to $9.8 million, compared to $9.4 million in the first quarter 2003.  The increase in revenues was offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses resulting in a slight decrease in operating income from $3.9 million to $3.8 million.  NORESCO's quarter-end backlog was $118 million, compared to $89 million a year earlier.
 
Other Business
 
Dividend
 
On April 14, 2004, the Board of Directors of Equitable Resources declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 38 cents per share, payable June 1, 2004 to shareholders of record on May 7, 2004.  This represents a 27% increase over last quarter and the third increase in five quarters.  This dividend is 124% higher than the $0.17 per share paid on March 1, 2003.
 
2004 Earnings Guidance
 
The Company reiterates its previously forecast 2004 earnings per share of between $3.00 and $3.05.  Due to significant hedges discussed below, the impact on 2004 earnings guidance from changes in the price of natural gas is expected to be approximately $0.01 per share for every $0.10 change in the NYMEX natural gas price, from $4.50 per MMbtu, and by approximately $0.01 per 100 heating degree days versus normal.
 
Hedging

Westport
 
Equitable owns approximately 11.5 million shares of Westport Resources Corporation (NYSE:WRC).  On April 7, 2004, Westport announced a merger with Kerr-McGee Corporation (NYSE: KMG).  Westport and Kerr-McGee expect that the merger will close in the third quarter of 2004.  Under the terms of the agreement, Equitable will receive 0.71 shares of Kerr-McGee for each Westport share.  Equitable expects to own 8.2 million shares of Kerr-McGee at close.  Equitable entered into a voting agreement with Kerr-McGee to vote in favor of the merger.  As part of the agreement, Equitable agreed to refrain from selling Westport shares through the expected closing date.
