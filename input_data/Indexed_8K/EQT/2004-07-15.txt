Item 12.
         Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
Today, Equitable Resources, Inc. ("Equitable") issued a press release announcing its second quarter 2004 earnings.  A copy of Equitable's press release is attached hereto and furnished as Exhibit 99 and is incorporated in this report by reference.
 
The information in this Form 8-K and in Exhibit 99 attached hereto shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933.
 
In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, Equitable provides certain segment related non-GAAP financial information as additional information for its operating results as well as non-GAAP earnings guidance in the press release. Equitable's management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP segment information provides useful information to management and investors regarding the financial condition, operations and trends of each of Equitable's segments without being obscured by the financial condition, operations and trends for the other segments or by the effects of corporate allocations of interest and income taxes. In addition, management uses these measures for budget planning purposes.  In addition, because Equitable's 2004 earnings have been significantly impacted by several specific events Equitable's management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP earnings guidance will allow investors to better understand the Company's performance, including comparisons to prior and future periods, by focusing on results excluding the impact of the unusual events.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
PITTSBURGH, July 15, 2004/ PRNewswire-FirstCall/  Equitable Resources Inc. (NYSE: EQT) today announced second quarter 2004 earnings per diluted share (EPS) of $2.06 compared with $0.50 reported in the second quarter 2003.  As described in detail below, the reported $2.06 EPS includes several unusual items, the most significant of which are a $1.94 per share net benefit related to the merger of Westport Resources Corp. with Kerr-McGee Corp. and a charge of $0.42 per share related to impairments and costs related to the Company's exit from its international power generation business.
 
Quarterly Results by Business
 
Equitable Utilities
 
Equitable Utilities had operating income for the second quarter of $11.0 million compared to $12.7 million reported for the same period last year.  Net operating revenues were $44.8 million compared to $44.2 million in 2003.
 
Total operating expenses for the quarter were $33.8 million, 7% higher than the $31.5 million reported last year.  The implementation of a customer information system resulted in an increase in costs of $2.7 million, including higher bad debt expense due to delays in customer terminations.  Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) and insurance costs were also higher.
 
Equitable Supply
 
Equitable Supply had operating income for the quarter of $52.7 million, 15% higher than the previous year's total operating income of $45.8 million.  Total operating revenues were $92.5 million, $13.1 million higher than the previous year's total operating revenue of $79.4 million.  Production sales volumes increased 7.9% over the second quarter 2003 to 16.8 MMcfe from 15.6 MMcfe.  The average sales price increased from $3.83 per Mcfe in 2003 to $4.28 per Mcfe in 2004.
 
Operating expenses for the quarter were $39.8 million compared to $33.6 million last year.  The increase in total operating expenses included a $1 million expense resulting from the Company's compliance activities related to revisions in the Federal Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure Regulation.  Other operating expenses were higher consistent with the decision to improve compression, infrastructure and measurement in the field.
 
The Company amended its prepaid forward contract at the end of the second quarter with a portion of the proceeds from the sale of Kerr-McGee shares.  The amendment required the Company to repay the net present value of the portion of the prepayment related to the undelivered quantities of natural gas in the original contract and eliminated the related deferred revenues.  The deferred revenues were treated by many as the equivalent of debt.  The Company continues to have an obligation to deliver the remaining contract volumes at the original contract price, but will receive cash revenues of $4.57 per MCF prospectively.  The contract amendment resulted in a $5.5 million pretax expense, or $3.6 million ($0.06 per diluted share) after tax.
 
Equitable Supply received a $6.1 million, or $4.0 million ($0.06 per diluted share) after tax, insurance payment in the second quarter related to a disputed insurance coverage claim.  This payment and the prepaid related charge are reported as other income, net.
NORESCO
 
NORESCO's net operating revenues increased in the second quarter 2004 to $9.7 million, compared to $8.5 million in the second quarter 2003.  The increase in revenues was somewhat offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses resulting in an increase in operating income from $2.4 million to $3.5 million.  NORESCO's quarter-end external backlog was $97 million, compared to $78 million a year earlier.
 
Several negative circumstances caused the Company to evaluate its international investments for additional impairments and to accelerate its plans to exit the international generation business.  As a result, the Company recognized an impairment of $40.2 million, or $26.5 million ($0.42 per diluted share) after tax, essentially the cost of its entire international investment and the related costs of exiting these investments.  The Company is actively evaluating alternatives for the sale of its international assets.
 
Other Business
 
Westport/Kerr-McGee Merger
 
The merger between Westport Resources Corp. (NYSE: WRC) and Kerr-McGee Corp. (NYSE: KMG) closed on June 25, 2004.  As a result of the merger, Equitable recognized a capital gain of $217 million pretax, or $143 million ($2.26 per diluted share) after tax on the exchange of Westport shares for Kerr-McGee shares.  The revised book basis of the KMG shares is $49.82.  Offsetting the capital gain is $10 million of transaction-related expenses, including associated compensation accruals, or $6.6 million ($0.10 per diluted share) after tax.
 
Equitable sold 800,000 shares of KMG after the merger was completed.  The sale resulted in cash proceeds of $43.0 million, a pretax capital gain of $3.0 million, or $2.0 million ($0.03 per diluted share) after tax.  Equitable owned approximately 7.4 million shares of KMG at quarter end.  The gain was recorded in other income.
 
Equitable is evaluating additional sales and/or hedges of the Kerr-McGee shares and the use of any proceeds of such a transaction.  The potential use of proceeds includes, among other things, reinvestment in the Company's core businesses, stock repurchases, and debt repayment.
 
Equitable committed 357,000 shares of Kerr-McGee to the charitable foundation established in 2003.  The foundation supports development programs in the communities where the Company conducts business.  The contribution resulted in an $18.2 million pre-tax charge, or $12.0 million ($0.19 per diluted share) after tax.  The shares are expected to be transferred to the trust in the third quarter, reducing the number of KMG shares held by Equitable to approximately 7.0 million.
 
The net impact of the WRC/KMG related items described in this section, plus the related cost of the amendment to the prepaid forward contract described above in the Supply segment discussion, was approximately $1.94 per diluted share.
 
Executive Performance Incentive Plans
 
The EQT share appreciation during the second quarter resulted in an increase in the expected cost of the 2002 and 2003 executive performance incentive plans (EPIP).  As a result, the Company recognized an increase in long-term incentive plan pre-tax expense of $6.1 million, or $4.0 million ($0.06 per diluted share) after tax.
Stock Buyback
 
During the quarter, Equitable Resources repurchased 1 million shares of EQT stock.  The total number of shares repurchased since October 1998 is approximately 18 million of the current 21.8 million share repurchase authorization.
 
Dividend
 
On July 14, 2004, the Board of Directors of Equitable Resources declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 38 cents per share, payable September 1, 2004 to shareholders of record on August 13, 2004.
 
2004 Earnings Guidance
 
The Company expects to report GAAP earnings of between $4.68 and $4.73 and non-GAAP core earnings between $3.10 and $3.15 per diluted share in 2004, updating the previous earnings guidance of $3.00 - $3.05 per share.  The increase is due to higher than expected natural gas prices for the first half of 2004 and additional hedges put in place for the second half of the year, partially offset by higher than expected EPIP expense and higher cost related to the implementation of the customer information system at Utilities.  This guidance assumes $5.50 per MMbtu average NYMEX natural gas price for the second half of 2004 and normal weather.  Earnings per share is expected to differ from guidance by less than $0.005 per $0.10 change in average NYMEX gas price and by approximately $0.01 per 100 heating degree days versus normal.  The core earnings guidance excludes certain other items described in this release.
 
2005 Earnings Guidance
 
The Company is initiating 2005 earnings guidance of $3.45 - $3.50 per diluted share.  This earnings guidance assumes $5.50 per MMbtu average NYMEX natural gas price and normal weather.  Earnings per share is expected to differ from guidance by approximately $0.01 per $0.10 change in average NYMEX gas price and by approximately $0.01 per 100 heating degree days versus normal.
 
Hedging
 
During the second quarter, the Company increased its hedge position for 2004 through 2011.  The approximate volumes and prices of Equitable's hedges for second half of 2004 through 2006 are:

2004 Non-GAAP Earnings Guidance Reconciliation
 
The following table provides investors a reconciliation between the Company's guidance and the corresponding GAAP earnings:
Since the effective date of the SEC rules relating to the use of non-GAAP financial measures, Equitable has not issued non-GAAP guidance.  Due to the significant number of non-operating items affecting 2004 results, management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP guidance provides useful information to management and investors in understanding the financial condition, operations and trends of each of Equitable's segments and consolidated results.
