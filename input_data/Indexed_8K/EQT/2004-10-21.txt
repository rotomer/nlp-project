Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
Today, Equitable Resources, Inc. ("Equitable") issued a press release announcing its third quarter 2004 earnings.  A copy of Equitable's press release is attached hereto and furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated in this report by reference.
 
The information in this Form 8-K and in Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933.
 
In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, Equitable provides certain segment related non-GAAP financial information as additional information for its operating results in the press release. Equitable's management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP segment information provides useful information to management and investors regarding the financial condition, operations and trends of each of Equitable's segments without being obscured by the financial condition, operations and trends for the other segments or by the effects of corporate allocations of interest and income taxes. In addition, management uses these measures for budget planning purposes.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
PITTSBURGH, October 21, 2004/ PRNewswire-FirstCall/  Equitable Resources, Inc. (NYSE: EQT) today announced third quarter 2004 earnings of $0.57 per diluted share.  This compares with diluted earnings of $0.45 per share in the third quarter 2003.
 
Quarterly Results by Business
 
Equitable Utilities
 
Equitable Utilities had operating income for the third quarter of $3.7 million compared to $5.3 million reported for the same period last year.  Net operating revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2004 were $35.0 million compared to $35.1 million for the same period last year.  Total operating expenses for the quarter were $31.3 million, $1.5 million higher than the $29.8 million reported during the same period last year.  This is more than explained by increases of $0.9 million in insurance and legal costs, of $0.4 million related to the recent implementation of a customer information system, and of $0.5 million due to flooding in its operating region which resulted in increased overtime and contractor costs.
 
Equitable Supply
 
The revenue increase was a result of both a sales volume increase of 0.6 Bcfe and an average sales price increase of $0.61 to $4.43 per Mcfe, compared with $3.82 per Mcfe for the same period last year.  Gathering revenues were $17.9 million, compared with $17.8 million in 2003.  The quarter includes an increase in operating income of $2.7 million related to a change in the liquid processing contract from a make-whole arrangement to a processing fee arrangement.
Equitable Supply had operating income for the quarter of $58.9 million, 16% higher than the $50.6 million earned in the same period last year.  Total operating revenues were $98.7 million, $15.7 million higher than the previous year's total operating revenue of $83.0 million.  Production revenues increased $15.5 million quarter over quarter to $80.7 million in 2004 from $65.2 million in 2003. 
 
Operating expenses for the quarter were $39.7 million compared to $32.4 million last year.  The increase in total operating expenses was primarily due to increases of $1.5 million in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, $1.2 million in lease operating expenses, $1.4 million in severance tax related to higher gas prices, $1.4 million in selling, general and administrative expense and $1.7 million in gathering and compression expense.
 
NORESCO
 
NORESCO's operating income for the third quarter was $3.5 million, $1.3 million less than the $4.8 million in the same period last year.  Net operating revenues decreased to $9.0 million from $10.3 million in 2003.
 
Total operating expenses for the third quarter 2004 were $5.5 million, compared to $5.6 million in the third quarter 2003.  NORESCO's quarter-end backlog was $93 million, compared to $158 million a year earlier.
 
Other Business
 
Dividend
 
On October 20, 2004, the Board of Directors of Equitable Resources declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 38 cents per share, payable December 1, 2004 to shareholders of record on November 12, 2004.
 
Westport/Kerr-McGee Merger
 
The third quarter 2004 earnings reflected a $3.0 million, or $2.0 million ($0.03 per diluted share) after tax, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense reduction of the estimated Westport/Kerr-McGee transaction related expenses accrued in the second quarter 2004.
 
Year-to-date Results
 
Included in the year-to-date results are the following items described more fully in the second quarter of 2004 earnings press release:
 
 
*as adjusted above.
 Pre-tax and after-tax data is in millions of dollars.  EPS is fully diluted, in dollars.     Calculations use a 34.3% tax rate and 63.3 million shares outstanding.
 
2004 Earnings Guidance
 
The Company is increasing its 2004 GAAP earnings guidance by $0.03 to between $4.71 and $4.76 per diluted share to reflect the reduction in Westport/Kerr-McGee related charges discussed above.  This guidance assumes normal weather.  Earnings per share is expected to differ by approximately $0.01 per 100 heating degree days versus normal, but should not be materially affected by changes in NYMEX natural gas prices.
 
2005 Earnings Guidance
 
The Company is reiterating 2005 earnings guidance of between $3.45 and $3.50 per diluted share.  This earnings guidance assumes $5.50 per MMbtu average NYMEX natural gas price and normal weather.  Earnings per share is expected to differ from guidance by approximately $0.01 per $0.10 change in average NYMEX gas price and by approximately $0.01 per 100 heating degree days versus normal.  2005 guidance is lower than 2004 guidance, with the difference being more than explained by the significant second quarter 2004 gain resulting from the Westport/Kerr-McGee merger.
 
Hedging
 
During the third quarter, the Company increased its hedge position for 2004 through 2011.  The approximate volumes and prices of Equitable's hedges for the last quarter of 2004 through 2006 are:
 
 
*    The above price is based on a conversion rate of 1.05 MMbtu/Mcf

 October through December
