Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
PITTSBURGH, January 27/PRNewswire-FirstCall/  Equitable Resources, Inc. (NYSE: EQT) today announced record 2004 annual earnings per diluted share (EPS) of $4.44.  This compares with EPS of $2.68 in 2003.  Fourth quarter 2004 EPS was $0.69 as compared to fourth quarter 2003 EPS of $0.78.  Several non-operational factors discussed below impacted full-year results, including a $13.4 million fourth quarter charge for the settlement of a cash balance pension plan.
 
In January 2005, the Company purchased the remaining 99% limited partnership interest in Eastern Seven Partners, L.P.  As detailed below, this transaction added approximately 30 Bcfe of reserves.
 
RESULTS BY SEGMENT
 
Equitable Utilities
 
Equitable Utilities had operating income of $108.1 million for 2004, compared with $109.9 million for 2003, a 2% decrease.  Net operating revenues for 2004 were $242.7 million compared to $245.1 million in 2003.  Heating degree-days were 5,360 for 2004, which is 6% warmer than the 5,695 degree-days recorded in 2003 and 8% warmer than the 30-year norm of 5,82 9 degree-days.
 
Total operating expenses for 2004 were $134.6 million, compared to $135.2 million in 2003.  Expenses related to depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense (DD&A) and bad debt expense were lower than the prior year, but were partially offset by higher customer information system costs and state franchise taxes.  The decrease in DD&A primarily reflects application of longer expected service life to pipes at Equitable Gas resulting from a Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission mandated asset service life study, partially offset by the effect of capital investments.
 
Operating income for the 2004 fourth quarter was $37.5 million, 14% higher than the $32.8 million earned in the year ago quarter.  Increased storage and commercial margins, partially offset by lower heating-related revenues, resulted in a 1% increase in net operating revenues for the quarter.  Operating expenses in the quarter decreased 11% from $35.8 million in 2003 to $31.7 million in 2004, primarily as a result of a reduction in DD&A at Equitable Gas as noted above, retroactive to January 1, 2004, and a reduction in bad debt expense.
 
Equitable Supply
 
Equitable Supply recorded operating income of $227.4 million in 2004, 16% higher than the $195.8 million earned in 2003.  Total revenues for 2004 were $390.4 million, 17% higher than the 2003 revenues of $332.4 million.  The increase in total revenues was primarily the result of a 14% higher average well-head sales price, a 5% increase in sales volumes, and a 7% increase in gathering revenues.
 
Operating expenses increased 19% from $136.6 million in 2003 to $163.1 million in 2004 due to higher gathering and compression expense, DD&A, lease operating expense, and severance taxes.& #160; The increase in gathering and compression expense is mainly attributable to increases in compressor expense, field line and meter operations, and staffing.  DD&A increased due to capital expenditures for production and gathering assets.  The increase in lease operating expense is primarily related to increased cost for insurance, a charge for environmental site assessments required under the Company's Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure plan, and increased property tax due to increased revenues.  During 2004, the Company made a strategic shift toward developing an infrastructure that will accommodate production from an accelerated drilling program.  The Company plans to drill 440 wells in 2005, compared with the 314 wells drilled in 2004.
 
me for the 2004 fourth quarter of $54.2 million compared favorably to the $51.0 million of operating income in the fourth quarter 2003.  The average well-head sales price was 16% higher as compared to the fourth quarter 2003, and sales volumes were slightly higher.  Operating expenses increased to $45.8 million in the fourth quarter 2004 from $37.3 million for the same period last year.  Gathering and compression
Operating inco
 
expense increased from $7.2 million in the 2003 fourth quarter to $12.9 million in the 2004 fourth quarter primarily due to increases in compressor expense and field line and meter operations.  During the quarter, upon completion of Supply's internal evaluation of operational job functions, there was a reclassification of certain operating expenses for the first nine months of 2004 ($1.7 million) from lease operating expense to gathering and compression expense, consistent with Supply's continued efforts to separate the gathering business from production.
 
Supply amended its prepaid forward contract at the end of the second quarter 2004 with a portion of the proceeds from the sale of Kerr-McGee shares.  The amendment required Supply to repay the net present value of the portion of the prepayment related to the undelivered quantities of natural gas in the original contract.  Prospectively, through the term of the remaining contract (December 2005), Supply will deliver the required quantity of gas at an effective price of $4.79/Mcf rather than $3.99/Mcf as originally stated in the contract.  The contract amendment resulted in an expense of $5.5 million, reported as other income, net.
 
Equitable Supply received an insurance payment in the second quarter related to a disputed insurance coverage claim of $6.1 million.  This payment was reported as other income, net.
 
The third quarter included an increase in operating income of $2.7 million related to a change in the liquid processing contract from a make-whole arrangement to a processing fee arrangement.
 
NORESCO
 
The NORESCO segment posted 2004 operating income of $14.9 million, c ompared with $16.9 million earned in 2003.  Net operating revenues for 2004 were $39.3 million, 4% lower than 2003 net operating revenues of $41.0 million.  Total operating expenses were $24.4 million in 2004 compared with $24.1 million in 2003.  The construction backlog was $83.5 million at year-end, down from $134.2 million at the end of 2003.  The decreases in revenues and backlog were mainly due to the lapsing in September 2003 of the enabling legislation for the performance contracting work that NORESCO performs for the federal government.  The federal government passed new enabling legislation in October 2004, providing NORESCO with the opportunity to resume contracting this work.
 
NORESCO posted operating income of $4.2 mil lion in the fourth quarter of 2004, compared with $5.8 million in the same period in 2003.  Net operating revenues were lower by 16% at $10.8 million in 2004, compared with $12.8 million in the fourth quarter 2003, while total operating expenses were $6.6 million in the fourth quarter 2004, $0.3 million lower than the $6.9 million in the same period 2003.
 
In the second quarter 2004, NORESCO recognized an impairment of $40.3 million, which represents substantially all of the international investment portfolio and the related costs of exiting these investments.  In January 2005, NORESCO sold its interest in a Costa Rican electric generation plant to a third party purchaser and recorded a slight gain on the sale.
 
Other Business
 
Pension
 
During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company irrevocably committed to settle the cash balance portion of the defined benefit pension plan.  This settlement resulted in the Company incurring a charge of $13.4 million.  The cash balance portion of the pension plan provided future benefits for certain salaried employees of the Company's Utilities segment.
 
Supply Asset Rationalization
 
In January 2005, Equitable purchased the remaining 99% limited partnership interest in Eastern Seven Partners, L.P. for cash ($57.5 million) and assumed liabilities ($47.3 million).  The purchase added approximately 30 Bcfe of reserves.  Equitable intends to sell some non-core producing properties during the first half of 2005.  The net result of the purchase and sale is expected to increase the sales volume at Supply to
73 Bcfe in 2005.  The expected increase in revenues will be partially offset by lower other revenues from fees formerly paid by the partnership for marketing and operating services ($4.1 million in 2004).
 
2005 Earnings Guidance
 
The Company is reiterating 2005 earnings guidance of between $3.45 and $3.50 per diluted share.  This earnings guidance assumes $5.50 per MMbtu average NYMEX natural gas price and normal weather.
 
Stock Buyback
 
During the fourth quarter, Equitable repurchased 500,000 shares of EQT stock for a total of 2,350,000 shares for the year.  The number of shares repurchased since October 1998 is approximately 19.0 million out of the 21.8 million shares currently authorized for repurchase.

Executive
Performance Incentive Programs
 
The 2002 and 2003 executive performance incentive programs are intended to align management long-term compensation with shareholder return relative to a peer group of 30 companies.  The cost of these programs was $26.2 million in 2004, compared with $15.0 million in 2003.  The increase in expense related to these programs was primarily the result of the Company's continued re-evaluation of its payout assumptions under the programs, including the Company's share price payout assumptions and the estimated performance levels to be attained.
 
In the fourth quarter 2004, the cost of these programs was $10.2 million, compared with $1.0 million in the fourth quarter 2003.
