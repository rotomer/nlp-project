Temporary Suspension of Trading Under Registrant's Employee Benefit Plans
 
On January 28, 2005 Equitable Resources, Inc. ("Equitable") sent a notice to the directors and executive officers of Equitable advising that the blackout period with respect to certain benefit plans, which was expected to end during the week of January 23, 2005, was being extended with a new expected end during the week of February 13, 2005.  Equitable provided the notice to its directors and executive officers in accordance with Section 306 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Rule 104 of Regulation BTR.
 
A copy of the notice is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
By memoranda from me dated November 23, 2004 and December 3, 2004, you were advised of an upcoming "Blackout Period" during which you would not be permitted, directly or indirectly, to purchase, sell or otherwise acquire or transfer any equity securities of Equitable Resources, Inc. (the "Company") if the equity security was acquired in connection with your service or employment as a director or executive officer.
 
The Blackout Period, which began January 7, 2005, related to our transition from Putnam Investments to Fidelity Investments as our trustee and recordkeeper in respect of certain benefit plans.  We expected the Blackout Period to end during the week of January 23, 2005.  Transition issues relative to Company Common Stock held in respect of our deferred compensation plans have resulted in an extension of the period during which participants in those plans may not engage in transactions in Company Common Stock; accordingly, we are required by law to extend the Blackout Period during which you may not, directly or indirectly, purchase, sell or otherwise acquire or transfer any equity securities of the Company acquired in connection with your service or employment as a director or executive officer.
 
We currently expect the Blackout Period to end during the week of February 13, 2005.We will advise you when the Blackout Period ends.  Do not hesitate to contact Kim Sachse (412-553-5758) or me (at the phone number above) should you have any questions.
