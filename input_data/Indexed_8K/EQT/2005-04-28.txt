Item 2.02.
 
Today, Equitable Resources, Inc. ("Equitable") issued a press release announcing its first quarter 2005 earnings.  A copy of Equitable's press release is attached hereto and furnished as Exhibit 99 and is incorporated in this report by reference.
 
The information in this Form 8-K and in Exhibit 99 attached hereto shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933.
 
In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, Equitable provides certain segment related financial information as additional information for its operating results as well as earnings guidance excluding the impact of certain second quarter events in the press release. Equitable's management believes that the presentation of this segment information provides useful information to management and investors regarding the financial condition, operations and trends of each of Equitable's segments without being obscured by the financial condition, operations and trends for the other segments or by the effects of corporate allocations of interest and income taxes. In addition, management uses these measures for budget planning purposes. Because Equitable's 2005 earnings will be impacted by several specific second quarter events, Equitable's management believes that the presentation of the earnings guidance will allow investors to better understand the Company's performance, including comparisons to prior and future periods, by focusing on results excluding the impact of the unusual events.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, hereunto duly authorized.

PITTSBURGH, April 28, 2005/ PRNewswire-FirstCall/  Equitable Resources, Inc. (NYSE: EQT) today announced first quarter 2005 earnings per diluted share (EPS) of $1.23, 12% higher than the $1.10 reported in the first quarter 2004.
 
Quarterly Results by Business
 
Equitable Utilities
 
Equitable Utilities had operating income for the first quarter of $62.4 million compared to $56.0 million reported for the same period last year.  Net operating revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2005 were $99.3 million compared to $93.8 million.  The 6% increase in net operating revenues is mainly due to a $5.6 million increase in margins in the Energy Marketing Group, primarily attributable to storage asset optimization resulting from high gas price volatility in the quarter.  Commercial and other regulated services revenues were $2.0 million higher than last year.  Weather was slightly warmer than the first quarter 2004, resulting in a decrease in distribution revenues of $2.1 million.  Total operating expenses for the quarter were $36.9 million, 2% lower than the $37.8 million reported last year.  Insurance reserves were $1.0 million lower than the first quarter 2004, bad debt expense was down $0.9 million, and depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense was down $0.7 million.  These expense reductions were partially offset by higher operating costs and higher fringe benefit costs.
 
Equitable Supply
 
Equitable Supply had operating income for the quarter of $65.4 million, 6% higher than the $61.5 million earned in the same period last year.  Total revenues were $113.3 million, $14.1 million higher than the previous year's total operating revenue of $99.2 million.  Production revenues increased $9.7 million quarter over quarter to $89.1 million in 2005 from $79.4 million in 2004.  The revenue increase was a result of both a sales volume increase of 1.3 Bcfe, from the acquisition early in the first quarter of the remaining 99% interest in Eastern Seven Partners, L.P. (ESP), and an average sales price increase of $0.24 per Mcfe.  Gathering revenues were $4.4 million higher at $24.2 million, compared with $19.8 million in 2004.  The increased gathering revenue was due to an increase in gathering rates and higher gathered volumes.
 
 Operating expenses for the quarter were $47.9 million compared to $37.7 million last year.  One reason for this increase was additional costs of $3.4 million resulting from the purchase of ESP.  Excluding the ESP costs, the increase in total operating expenses was primarily due to increases of $3.0 million in gathering expenses, $1.2 million in production taxes, $1.1 million in DD&A expense, and $1.0 million in lease operating expenses.
 
NORESCO
 
NORESCO reported operating income of $3.7 million in the first quarter 2005, $0.1 million lower than the first quarter 2004.  NORESCO's net operating revenues increased slightly for the quarter to $9.9 million from $9.8 million reported last year.  This was offset by an increase of $0.2 million in operating expenses, which were $6.2 million compared to $6.0 million in the first quarter 2004.  Net earnings from non-consolidated investments less minority interest increased by $0.4 million.   NORESCO's quarter-end backlog was $83 million, compared to $118 million a year earlier.
