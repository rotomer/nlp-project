ITEM 7.01              Regulation FD Disclosure
 
Equitable Resources, Inc. announced that on May 13, 2005 it terminated the three variable share forward transactions entered into in July 2004 with respect to an aggregate of 6.0 million shares of common stock of Kerr-McGee Corporation (KMG).  In connection with the termination, Equitable incurred an aggregate termination cost of $95.8 million and sold an aggregate of 4.3 million KMG shares to its three counterparties at an average price of $75.43 per share to cover their respective hedged positions. Equitable received $227 million in pre-tax net proceeds from sale of the KMG shares net of the aggregate termination cost of the variable share forward transactions.
 
Equitable unconditionally tendered its remaining 1.7 million KMG shares at $85.00 per share to Kerr-McGee in connection with Kerr-McGee's Dutch auction tender offer to purchase its own shares that ended at midnight May 18, 2005. On May 24, 2005, Kerr-McGee announced the final proration factor for the tender offer of approximately 33.64% and a purchase price of $85 per share.  Accordingly, as a result of its tender of shares, Equitable expects to receive approximately $49 million in pre-tax proceeds on the sale of approximately 0.6 million shares and will thereafter, hold approximately 1.1 million KMG shares which will be held for sale.   Equitable expects to use the proceeds of the sale of its KMG shares for general corporate purposes.
