On May 31, 2005, Equitable Resources, Inc announced the closing of a sale of non-core gas properties.  The text below incorporates the announcement and additional information regarding production per day.
 
Equitable Resources, Inc announced the closing of most of its previously disclosed sale of non-core gas properties to NCL Appalachian Partners, a partnership between Locin Oil Corporation and GE Commercial Finance Energy Financial Services.  Equitable sold an estimated 66 Bcf of proved reserves, of which approximately 59 Bcf were developed, for $147 million.  The sold properties produce approximately 10,000 Mcf per day.
