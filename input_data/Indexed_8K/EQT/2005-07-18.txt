Voting Rights
.  Except as provided in this Section 2.1, the holders of the Common Stock shall have exclusive voting rights for the election of Directors and for all other purposes and shall be entitled to one vote for each share held.
 
The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have no voting rights except as may be provided with respect to any particular series of the Preferred Stock by the Board of Directors pursuant to Subdivision 1.1 of Division A hereof.  On any matter on which the holders of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to vote, they shall be entitled to vote as established by the Board of Directors pursuant to Subdivision 1.1 of Division A hereof.
 
In all elections for Directors, every stockholder entitled to vote shall have the right, in person or by proxy, to multiply the number of votes to which such stockholder may be entitled by the number of Directors for the election of whom he is entitled to vote at such meeting, and such stockholder may cast the whole number of such votes for one candidate or may distribute them among any two or more candidates.  The candidates receiving the highest number of votes up to the number of Directors to be elected shall be elected.  The foregoing provisions of this paragraph shall not be changed with respect to any class of stock unless the holders of record of not less than two-thirds of the number of shares of such class of stock then outstanding shall consent thereto in writing or by voting therefor in person or by proxy at the meeting of stockholders at which any such change is considered.
 
2.2
        
Pre-emptive Rights
.  Upon any issue for money or other consideration of any stock of the Company that may be authorized from time to time, no holder of stock, irrespective of the kind of such stock, shall have any pre-emptive or other right to subscribe for, purchase, or receive any proportionate or other share of the stock so issued, but the Board of Directors may dispose of all or any portion of such stock as and when it may determine, free of any such rights, whether by offering the same to stockholders or by sale or other disposition as said Board may deem advisable; provided, however, that if the Board of Directors shall determine to offer any new or additional shares of Common Stock, or any security convertible into Common Stock, for money, other than (i) by a public offering of all of such shares or offering of all of such shares to or through underwriters or investment bankers who shall have agreed promptly to make a public offering of such shares, or (ii) pursuant to any employee compensation, incentive or other benefit program adopted by the Board of Directors, the same shall first be offered pro rata to the holders of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company at a price not less favorable than the price at which the Board of Directors issues and disposes of such stock or securities to other than such holders of Common Stock before deducting reasonable commissions or compensation that may be paid by the Company in connection with the sale of any such stock and securities; and provided, further, that the time within which such pre-emptive rights shall be exercised may be limited by the Board of Directors to such time as the said Board may deem proper, not less, however, than ten days after mailing of notice that such stock rights are available and may be exercised.

2.3
        
Amendments to By-Laws
.  The Board of Directors may make, amend and repeal the By-Laws with respect to those matters which are not, by statute, reserved exclusively to the shareholders, subject always to the power of the shareholders to change such action as provided herein. No By-Law may be made, amended or repealed by the shareholders unless such action is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than 80% of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote in an annual election of directors, voting together as a single class, unless such action has been previously approved by a two-thirds vote of the whole Board of Directors, in which event (unless otherwise expressly provided in the Articles or the By-Laws) the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the votes which all shareholders are entitled to cast thereon shall be required.
 
2.4
        
Amendments to Articles
.  Subject to the voting rights given to any particular series of the Preferred Stock by the Board of Directors pursuant to Subdivision 1.1 of Division A hereof, and except as may be specifically provided to the contrary in any other provision in the Articles with respect to amendment or repeal of such provision, the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than 80% of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote in an annual
election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend the Articles of the Company or repeal any provision thereof, unless such action has been previously approved by a two-thirds vote of the whole Board of Directors, in which event (unless otherwise expressly provided in the Articles) the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the votes which all shareholders are entitled to cast thereon shall be required.
 
2.5
        
General
.  The Company may issue and dispose of any of its authorized shares for such consideration as may be fixed by the Board of Directors subject to the laws then applicable and to the provisions of Subdivision 2.2 of this Division B.
 
 
3.1
        
The business and affairs of the Company shall be managed by a Board of Directors comprised as follows:
 
(a)
  
The Board of Directors shall consist of not less than 5 nor more than 12 persons, the exact number to be fixed from time to time by the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority vote of the directors then in office.
 
(b)
  
Directors of the Company shall be classified with respect to the time for which they shall severally hold office by dividing them into three classes:  Class 1; Class 2; and Class 3, as nearly equal in number as possible.  At the special meeting of shareholders at which the amendment adding this Division C shall be adopted, the then current directors shall be assigned to the three classes in accordance with resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors.  Class 1 directors shall not be elected at such special meeting but shall continue to hold office until the annual meeting of shareholders in 1984.  Class 2 directors shall be elected by shareholders at such special meeting to extended terms of office, to serve until the annual meeting in 1985.  Class 3 directors shall be elected by shareholders at such special meeting to extended terms of office, to serve until the annual meeting in 1986.  Each class of directors to be elected at such special meeting shall be elected in a separate election.  At each succeeding annual meeting of shareholders, the class of directors then being elected shall be elected to hold office for a term of three years.  Each director shall hold office for the term for which elected and until his or her successor shall have been elected and qualified.
 
(c)
  
Any director, any class of directors or the entire Board of Directors may be removed from office by shareholder vote at any time, without assigning any cause, but only if shareholders entitled to cast at least 80% of the votes which all shareholders would be entitled to cast at an annual election of directors or of such class of directors shall vote in favor of such removal; , that no individual director shall be removed without cause (unless the entire Board of Directors or any class of directors be removed) in case the votes cast against such removal would be sufficient, if voted cumulatively for such director, to elect him or her to the class of directors of which he or she is a member.
provided, however
 
(d)
  
Vacancies in the Board of Directors, including vacancies resulting from an increase in the number of directors, shall be filled only by a majority vote of the remaining directors then in office, though less than a quorum, except that vacancies resulting from removal from office by a vote of the shareholders may be filled by the shareholders at the same meeting at which such removal occurs.  All directors elected to fill vacancies shall hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of shareholders at which the term of the class to which they have been elected
expires.  No decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director.
 
(e)
  
Whenever the holders of any class or series of preferred stock shall have the right, voting separately as a class, to elect one or more directors of the Company, none of the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.1 shall apply with respect to the director or directors elected by such holders of preferred stock.
 
3.2
        
Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, the Articles or the By-Laws of the Company, the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than 80% of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote in an annual election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend, alter, change or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with, this Division C, unless such action has been previously approved by a two-thirds vote of the whole Board of Directors.
 
3.3
        
No Director shall be personally liable for monetary damages as such (except to the extent otherwise provided by law) for any action taken, or any failure to take any action, unless such Director has breached or failed to perform the duties of his or her office under Title 42, Chapter 83, Subchapter F of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes (or any successor statute relating to Directors' standard of care and justifiable reliance); and the breach or failure to perform constitutes self-dealing, willful misconduct or recklessness.
 
If the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes are amended after May 22, 1987, the date this section received shareholder approval, to further eliminate or limit the personal liability of Directors, then a Director shall not be liable, in addition to the circumstances set forth in this section, to the fullest extent permitted by the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes, as so amended.
 
The provisions of this section shall not apply to any actions filed prior to January 27, 1987 nor to any breach of performance of duty, or any failure of performance of duty, by any Director occurring prior to January 27, 1987.

Sixth
:  Henceforth, these Articles of the Company shall not include any prior documents.
 
RESOLVED, That pursuant to the authority conferred upon the Board of Directors by Article Fifth, Division A, section 1.1 of the Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company, as amended, there is hereby established a series of the Preferred Stock of the Company to consist initially of 500,000 shares with the designation and relative rights and preferences thereof to be as follows:
 
.  The shares of such series shall be designated as "Series One Preferred Stock."  Shares of this series shall be issued pursuant to the exercise of rights to purchase Series One Preferred Stock distributed to the holders of Common Stock, without par value, of the Company (the "Common Stock").
Designation
 
.  Subject to the rights and preferences of the holders of any shares of any series of Preferred Stock ranking senior as to dividends to this Series One Preferred Stock, as such may be established by the Board of Directors, the holders of shares of Series One Preferred Stock, in preference to the holders of Common Stock and shares of stock ranking junior as to dividends to the Series One Preferred Stock, shall be entitled to receive, when and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash on the 15th day of March, June, September and December in each year (each such date being referred to herein as a "Quarterly Dividend Payment Date"), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Series One Preferred Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) $29.50 or (b) subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 100 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends plus 100 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions, other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock, or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise), paid on the Common Stock at any time during the quarter year immediately preceding the quarter year ending on the day immediately preceding such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.  In the event the Company shall at any time after April 1, 1996 (the "Rights Distribution Date") during any quarter year immediately preceding the quarter year ending on the day immediately preceding a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock or combine the outstanding Common Stock into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amounts to which holders of shares of Series One Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying each such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the
Dividends and Distributions
number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
 
Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of Series One Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares of Series One Preferred Stock, unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series One Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.  Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest.  Dividends paid on the shares of Series One Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding.  The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series One Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be no more than 30 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.
 
.  Except as otherwise provided by law, holders of shares of Series One Preferred Stock shall have no voting rights.

Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or distributions payable on the Series One Preferred Stock are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not declared, on shares of Series One Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been paid in full, the Company shall not: (i) declare or pay dividends on, make any distributions on, or redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or as to assets) to the Series One Preferred Stock; (ii) declare or pay dividends on or make any other distributions on any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or as to assets) with the Series One Preferred Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the Series One Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are then entitled; (iii) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or as to assets) to the Series One Preferred Stock, provided that the Company may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such junior stock in exchange for shares of any stock of the Company ranking junior (either as to dividends or as to assets) to the Series One Preferred Stock; or (iv) purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of Series One Preferred Stock, or any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series One Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to all holders of such shares upon such terms as the Board of Directors, after consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the respective series and classes, shall determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or classes.  The Company shall not permit any subsidiary of the Company to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the Company unless the Company could, under this paragraph, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.
Certain Restrictions
.  Any shares of Series One Preferred Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the Company in any manner whatsoever shall be retired and canceled promptly after the acquisition thereof.  All such shares shall upon their cancellation become authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock to be created by resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors, subject to the conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth herein.
Reacquired Shares
 
.  Subject to the rights and preferences of the holders of any shares of any series of Preferred Stock ranking senior as to assets to this Series One Preferred Stock, as such may be established by the Board of Directors, upon any involuntary or voluntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company,  no distribution shall be made to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or as to assets) to the Series One Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Series One Preferred Stock shall have received an amount per share equal to the Per Share Series One Liquidation Preference.  The Per Share Series One Liquidation Preference shall be equal to the sum of (x) $100.00 plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of such payment, plus (y) the Participation Preference.  The "Participation Preference" is an amount per each share of Series One Preferred Stock outstanding equal to the product of (A) the Excess Distribution Amount, as hereinafter defined, times (B) a fraction whose numerator is 100 and whose denominator is the sum of (i) the product of 100 times the number of outstanding shares of Series One Preferred Stock, plus (ii) the product of 100 times a fraction whose numerator is the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock and whose denominator is the Adjustment Number; provided, however, if the foregoing computation results in a negative number, then the Participation Preference shall be 0.  Following the payment of the full amount of the Series One Liquidation Preference, holders of shares of Common Stock shall receive the remaining assets to be distributed.
Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up
 
The "Excess Distribution Amount" is an amount equal to the amount available for distribution to shareholders of the Company after payment of all debts and liabilities less the sum of (i) the liquidation preferences in respect of all shares of preferred stock of the Company other than the Series One Preferred Stock, (ii) the product of 100 times the number of outstanding shares of Series One Preferred Stock, and (iii) the product of the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock times a fraction whose numerator is 100 and whose denominator is the Adjustment Number.
 
The Adjustment Number shall initially be 100 and shall be subject to adjustment as provided below.  In the event the Company shall at any time after the Rights Distribution Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the Adjustment Number in effect immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such Adjustment Number by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
.  In case the Company shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case the shares of Series One Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed in an amount per share (subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth) equal to 100 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged.  In the event the Company shall at any time (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock or combine the outstanding Common Stock into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or change of shares of Series One Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
Consolidation, Merger, etc
 
.  The outstanding shares of Series One Preferred Stock may be redeemed at the option of the Board of Directors as a whole, but not in part, at any time or from time to time, at a cash price per share equal to (i) the product of the Adjustment Number times the Average Market Value, as such term is hereinafter defined, of the Common Stock, plus (ii) all dividends which on the redemption date have accrued on the shares to be redeemed and have not been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart, without interest; provided, however, that if and whenever any quarter-yearly dividend shall have accrued on the Series One Preferred Stock which has not been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart, the Company may not purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of Series One Preferred Stock unless all shares of such stock at the time outstanding are so purchased or otherwise acquired.  The "Average Market Value" is the average of the closing sale prices of the Common Stock during the 30-day period immediately preceding the date before the redemption date on the Composite Tape for New York Stock Exchange-Listed Stocks, or, if such stock is not quoted on the Composite Tape, on the New York Stock Exchange, or, if such stock is not listed on such Exchange, on the principal United States securities exchange registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, on which such stock is listed, or, if such stock is not listed on any such exchange, the average of the closing bid quotations with respect to a share of Common Stock during such 30-day period on the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Automated Quotations System or any system then in use, or, if no such quotations are available, the fair market value of the Common Stock as determined by the Board of Directors in good faith.
Redemption
 
.  Series One Preferred Stock may be issued in fractions of a share which shall entitle the holder, in proportion to such holder's fractional shares, to exercise voting rights, if applicable, receive dividends, participate in distributions and to have the benefit of all other rights of holders of Series One Preferred Stock.
