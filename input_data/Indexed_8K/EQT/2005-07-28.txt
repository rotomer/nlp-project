Exhibit 99
 
 
PITTSBURGH, July 28, 2005/ PRNewswire-FirstCall/  Equitable Resources Inc. (NYSE: EQT) today announced second quarter 2005 earnings per diluted share (EPS) of $1.04 compared with $2.06 reported in the second quarter 2004.  The reported $1.04 EPS includes the impact of several unusual items.  The Company recognized a $60.8 million gain on the sale of approximately 5.9 million shares of Kerr-McGee, an $11.1 million negative tax impact related to the American Jobs Creation Act, $7.3 million of office relocation costs, and a $6.7 million reserve reversal on international projects, as described below.
 
In the second quarter 2004, there were also several unusual items, most notably a $217.2 million gain recorded as a result of the Westport/Kerr-McGee merger, $40.2 million of impairment charges related to the Company's international investments, and an $18.2 million charitable foundation contribution, all of which were detailed in Equitable's earnings press release dated July 15, 2004.
 
Quarterly Results by Business
 
Equitable Utilities
 
Equitable Utilities had operating income for the second quarter of $5.7 million compared to $11.0 million reported for the same period last year.  Net operating revenues were $42.1 million compared to $44.8 million in 2004.
 
Total operating expenses for the quarter increased by $2.6 million from $33.8 million in 2004 to $36.4 million in 2005.  Expenses for the 2005 quarter included a $3.8 million charge related to the Company's relocation into a new office, detailed below, and a $0.8 million charge for an enhanced severance program for employees whose jobs will be eliminated as a result of the implementation of a new automated meter reading process.  Increases in fringe benefit rates, insurance premiums, and other operating costs were more than offset by decreases of $3.7 million in the segment's bad debt expense and $0.7 million in depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) for the quarter.  Of the decrease in bad debt expense, $2 million was attributable to an above normal reserve rate in the second quarter 2004, with the balance the result of progress made on collections.
 
Equitable Supply
 
Equitable Supply's operating income for the 2005 second quarter totaled $63.2 million, 20% higher than the $52.7 million earned in the same period last year.  Total operating revenues were $112.2 million, $19.7 million higher than the previous year's total of $92.5 million.  Production revenues increased $15.1 million quarter over quarter to $89.7 million in 2005 from $74.6 million in 2004.  The increase was primarily due to increased sales volumes from the Eastern Seven Partners (ESP) acquisition earlier this year and a higher average well-head sales price.  Gathering revenues were $4.6 million higher at $22.5 million, compared with $17.9 million in 2004.  The increase in gathering revenue was primarily due to an increase in gathering rates, partially offset by a decrease in gathered volumes.
 
Total operating expenses for the 2005 second quarter totaled $49.0 million compared to $39.8 million in the 2004 second quarter, of which $4.1 million resulted from the costs of operating properties purchased from ESP.  Excluding the ESP costs, the increase in operating expenses was due to increases of $1.9 million in gathering expenses, $1.6 million in production taxes, $1.2 million in DD&A expense, and $1.0 million in selling, general and administrative expense, offset by a decrease of $0.6 million in lease operating expenses.

continued to evaluate its future obligations associated with exiting the international market and as a result reduced these obligations by $6.7 million.  This reduction in obligations is primarily the result of bringing the Panamanian power plant into compliance with local noise restrictions without incurring costs that had been previously expected and the anticipated award of a replacement power sales agreement.
 
Other Business
 
Kerr-McGee Corp.
 
In the second quarter 2005, Equitable terminated forward transactions entered into in July 2004 with respect to an aggregate of 6.0 million shares of common stock of Kerr-McGee Corporation (KMG).  In connection with the termination, Equitable incurred termination costs of $95.8 million.  Also in the quarter, Equitable sold approximately 5.9 million KMG shares at an average price of $76.43 per share.  These transactions resulted in a net pre-tax gain of $60.8 million in the quarter.
 
Equitable recorded $0.1 million in KMG dividends in the quarter, $1.0 million less than the $1.1 million recorded in the first quarter.
 
Equitable currently owns approximately 1.1 million KMG shares which are held for sale.
 
Sale of Gas Properties
 
As previously disclosed, during the second quarter 2005, Equitable sold an estimated 66 Bcf of proved reserves, of which approximately 59 Bcf were developed, for $147 million.  The proceeds were reduced for $5 million of purchase price adjustments.  The Company did not record a gain or loss upon the closing of this sale.
 
Office Consolidation
 
In May 2005, the Company completed the relocation of its corporate headquarters and other operations to a newly constructed office building located at the North Shore in Pittsburgh.  In the second quarter 2005, the Company recognized a loss of $7.3 million on the early termination of operating leases and the impairment of assets related to the move, for a total year-to-date loss of $7.8 million.  Of the $7.3 million in losses in the second quarter, $3.8 million was related to the Utilities segment and $3.5 million was unallocated.
 
Executive Performance Incentive Programs
 
EPIPs is expensed during the program period, and the EPIPs do not have the long-term dilutive effect of stock options.  The expense of the program varies based in part on changes in Equitable's stock price.  The significant stock appreciation in the second quarter resulted in EPIP expense of $11.5 million in the quarter and $14.6 million year-to-date.
Unlike stock options, the cost of the
The Company has two Executive Performance Incentive Programs (EPIPs) linked to shareholder returns; one matures December 31, 2005, the other on December 31, 2008.    The programs are designed to align management's long-term incentive compensation to the absolute and relative returns earned by the Company's shareholders.  These programs have economic costs similar to stock option-based programs, but different accounting treatment. 
 
Tax
 
During the second quarter of 2005, the Company completed its review of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Jobs Act), which the President signed into law on October 22, 2004.  The Company has determined that amendment of certain executive compensation plans is likely before year end in order to comply with the Jobs Act.  The Company anticipates that such amendments will result in payment during a period when some of the compensation may not be deductible under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue
  As a result, the Company recorded an $11.1 million valuation allowance against the deferred tax benefit associated with the affected compensation programs.
Code.
 
2005 Earnings Guidance
 
The Company is adjusting its 2005 EPS guidance to $3.90-$3.95 (pre-split) to reflect the effects of the Kerr-McGee transactions, the Section 162(m) tax impact, office consolidation expenses, and the international reserve adjustment.  The Company is also reiterating its Production sales volume forecast of 73 Bcfe.
