ITEM 1.01.  ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT
 
On December 14, 2005, Equitable Resources, Inc. entered into a First Amendment to Credit Agreement (the "First Amendment") amending the Revolving Credit Agreement (the "Revolving Credit Agreement"), dated August 11, 2005, among the Company, Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent and a Letter of Credit Issuer, J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Syndication Agent and a Letter of Credit Issuer, the Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi, Ltd., Citibank, N.A., and PNC Bank, National Association, as Co-Documentation Agents, and the other lender parties thereto (the "Lenders").  The First Amendment increased the Lenders' aggregate commitment from $650,000,000 to an aggregate of $1,000,000,000 and extended the stated maturity date from August 9, 2006 to August 10, 2010.  A copy of the First Amendment will be filed as an exhibit to the Company's 2005 annual report on Form 10-K.  The increase in borrowing capacity is in response to higher working capital needs associated with high natural gas prices.  The Company had short-term loan balances of $368 million and $438 million as of December 14, 2005 and September 30, 2005, respectively.
