ITEM 2.06 MATERIAL IMPAIRMENTS
 
Equitable Resources, Inc. ("Equitable" or the "Company"), through an indirect subsidiary, entered into a stock purchase agreement under which the Company agreed to sell its NORESCO business segment for approximately $82 million, subject to customary adjustments. On December 23, 2005, a condition to closing that was uncertain at time of signing was satisfied; as a consequence, the sale is now viewed as probable and generally accepted accounting principles require that a charge be recorded. While the amount of the charge will not be known until a closing occurs, the Company currently estimates that the charge should be between $18 million and $23 million, most of which relates to the recording of income taxes associated with the difference between the book and tax basis of the assets that are now considered available for sale and will require future cash expenditures.    Subject to other more customary closing conditions, the sale of NORESCO is expected to close not later than the first quarter of 2006.
