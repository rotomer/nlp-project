Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
PITTSBURGH, January 26/PRNewswire-FirstCall/Equitable Resources, Inc. (NYSE: EQT) today announced 2005 annual earnings per diluted share (EPS) of $2.10.  This compares with EPS of $2.22 in 2004.  Fourth quarter 2005 EPS was $0.59 as compared to fourth quarter 2004 EPS of $0.35.  Several non-operational factors, discussed below, affected 2005 and 2004 results, including the gain resulting from the Westport Resources Corporation (Westport) merger with Kerr-McGee Corporation (KMG) in 2004, the gains on the sale of KMG shares in both years, pension settlement charges in both years, and the sale of NORESCO in the fourth quarter 2005.
 
RESULTS BY SEGMENT
 
Equitable Utilities
Equitable Utilities had operating income of $98.3 million for 2005, compared with $108.1 million for 2004, a 9% decrease.  2005 net revenues increased $10.7 million or 4.4% over the previous year.  Distribution net revenues were 1.4% lower due to a decline in use per heating degree-day.  Heating degree-days totaled 5,543 for 2005, or 3.4% colder than the 5,360 degree-days recorded in 2004, but 4.9% warmer than the 30-year normal of 5,829 degree-days. Marketing net revenues were $14.3 million higher than in 2004, benefiting from storage asset optimization opportunities and more than offsetting the lower distribution net revenues.
 
Total operating expenses for 2005 were 15% higher at $155.1 million, compared to $134.6 million in 2004.  The biggest increase resulted from settlement charges primarily for the conversion from a defined benefit pension plan to a defined contribution plan for 229 employees, totaling $16.0 million for 2005 and $2.2 million in the fourth quarter. In addition, as discussed in the second quarter earnings press release, Equitable consolidated its entire Pittsburgh-based workforce into a single office building.  Equitable Utilities' charges associated with that move were $3.8 million.  Employee wages and benefit costs were $3.1 million higher than last year.  A $4.7 million reduction in bad debt expense for the year partially offset these increases.
 
Operating income for the 2005 fourth quarter was $37.7 million, slightly higher than the $37.5 million earned in the year ago quarter.  Net revenues were $75.9 million, $6.8 million higher than fourth quarter 2004 revenues of $69.1 million.  Colder weather increased distribution throughput and associated revenues and storage asset optimization opportunities contributed to an increase in marketing revenues.  Operating expenses in the quarter increased $6.5 million, from $31.7 million in 2004 to $38.2 million in 2005.  A $4.1 million increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) in the quarter was primarily a result of the timing of a $3.5 million reduction in DD&A resulting from an asset service life study, which was recorded in the fourth quarter 2004, retroactive to January 1, 2004.  In addition, $2.2 million of the higher operating costs in 2005 was related to pension settlements discussed above. Finally, $1.3 million of increased operating expense resulted from higher bad debt allowances related to higher distribution revenues from increased commodity rates and colder weather.  Reductions in other operating expenses partially offset the increases.
 
Equitable Supply
 
Equitable Supply had operating income of $293.6 million in 2005, 29% higher than the $227.4 million in 2004. Total revenues for 2005 were $489.2 million, 25% higher than 2004 revenues of $390.4 million. The increase in total revenues was primarily the result of a 16% increase in the average well-head sales price, a 9% increase in sales volumes, and a 33% increase in gathering revenues. The increase in the average well-head sales price for the year and the fourth quarter was mainly attributable to increased market prices on unhedged
 
volumes, partially offset by an adjustment of $10.6 million. That adjustment was principally due to our conclusion that the well-head sales price allocated to a 3rd party's working interest gas in previous periods may be lower than the Company was obligated to pay.
 
Operating expenses increased from $163.1 million in 2004 to $195.6 million in 2005.  Of that increase, production taxes, related to higher natural gas prices and higher volumes, were $13.7 million higher than 2004. DD&A, lease operating expenses, gathering and compression expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses were all higher.  Efforts to increase production and sales and overall oilfield inflation related to increased natural gas prices explain the higher costs.  During 2005, the Company drilled 455 wells, compared with the 314 wells drilled
in 2004.  The Company expects to drill 550 wells in 2006.
 
Operating inco
me for the 2005 fourth quarter totaled $85.2 million, $31.0 million higher than the $54.2 million of operating income in the fourth quarter 2004.  Revenues totaled $136.5 million, $36.5 million higher than last year and expenses totaled $51.3 million, $5.5 million higher than last year.  The factors driving increased revenues and costs for the full 2005 year also apply to the fourth quarter results.
 
NORESCO
 
In December 2005, Equitable sold NORESCO for approximately $82 million, subject to customary adjustments.  The sale resulted in reclassifying NORESCO as "discontinued operations."  With amounts recorded net of tax, Equitable recorded income of $1.5 million from discontinued operations in 2005, compared to a loss of $18.9 million in 2004.  In the fourth quarter, Equitable recorded a loss from discontinued operations of $7.2 million, which included net costs related to the NORESCO sale of $18.7 million and a tax benefit of $6.4 million from reorganizing international assets.  In the fourth quarter 2004, the Company reported earnings from discontinued operations of $3.0 million.  All periods presented have been restated to reflect the discontinued operations.
 
In 2004, NORESCO recognized an impairment of $23.9 million, which represented substantially all of the international investment portfolio and the related costs of exiting these investments.  The business conditions improved internationally during 2005 resulting in a reversal of $7.8 million of the reserves, of which $2.7 million was recorded in the fourth quarter.  These amounts are reported after-tax.
 
Other Business
 
Kerr-McGee Corp.
 
In 2005, Equitable sold approximately 7 million KMG shares resulting in a net pre-tax gain of $110.3 million.  These totals include 0.7 million shares sold in the fourth quarter for a gain of $30.0 million.
 
In 2004, the merger between Westport and KMG resulted in a gain of $217.2 million on the exchange of Westport shares for KMG shares.  Equitable also sold 800,000 KMG shares for a gain of $3.0 million and contributed 357,000 shares to the Equitable foundation incurring an $18.2 million expense.
 
Office Consolidation
 
As mentioned above, in 2005 the Company completed its relocation to a new office building.  The Company recognized a loss of $7.8 million related to the move, $3.8 million was allocated to Utilities, $0.5 million was allocated to Supply and $3.5 million was not allocated to a segment.
 
Executive
Performance Incentive Programs
 
During 2005, two Executive Performance Incentive Programs (EPIPs) linked to shareholder returns were in place; one vested and was paid out on December 30, 2005, the other vests on December 31, 2008.  The programs are designed to align management's long-term incentive compensation to the absolute and relative returns earned by the Company's shareholders.  The expense related to these programs totaled $43.8 million in 2005, with $13.9 million recorded in the fourth quarter 2005.
Tax
 
During 2005, the Company completed its review of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Jobs Act), which the President signed into law on October 22, 2004.  As a result, the Board of Directors ended the deferred compensation plans for employees.  This decision, and the payout of the 2003
EPIP in December,
resulted in a $15.3 million tax loss disallowance under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, of which $5.0 million was recorded in the fourth quarter.

The Company estimates 2006 earnings guidance of $1.90 - $2.00 per diluted share.  The guidance is based on the current NYMEX strip.

2005 Capital Expenditures
 
Equitable invested $333 million in capital projects during 2005.  This included $131 million for well development, $75 million for Supply infrastructure, $61 million for Equitable Utilities, and $8 million for Headquarters.  During 2005, the Company purchased the limited partnership interest in Eastern Seven Partners for $58 million.
 
2006 Capital Expenditures
 
Equitable forecasts $497 million of capital expenditures for 2006.  This forecast includes $194 million for well development, $222 million for midstream and infrastructure investment in Appalachia, $78 million for Equitable Utilities and $3 million for Headquarters.
 
                The Company is announcing a significant infrastructure project called The Big Sandy Pipeline. The Big Sandy Pipeline will help to alleviate throughput constraints in Eastern Kentucky for Equitable Supply and third party producers.  The 60 mile, 20" pipeline is expected to have a capacity of 70,000 dth per day and will connect the Kentucky Hydrocarbon processing plant in Langley, Kentucky with the Tennessee Gas Pipeline interconnect in Carter County, Kentucky.  The pipeline, which is projected to cost $83 million, is scheduled for operation in 2007.
