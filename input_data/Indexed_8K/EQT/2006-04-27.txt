PITTSBURGH, April 27, 2006/ PRNewswire-FirstCall/  Equitable Resources, Inc. (NYSE: EQT) today announced first quarter 2006 earnings per diluted share (EPS) of $0.59. This compares with EPS of $0.60 from continuing operations, and EPS of $0.61 including discontinued operations, reported for the first quarter 2005.
 
Quarterly Results by Business
 
Equitable Utilities
 
Equitable Utilities had operating income for the first quarter of $61.0 million compared to $62.4 million reported for the same period last year. Overall net operating revenues were $98.9 million compared to $99.3 million for the first quarter 2005. Distribution net operating revenues were $54.1 million, 19% lower than last year's $66.8 million, as weather was 13% warmer than normal and 10% warmer than last year, measured by heating degree days. Use per heating degree day was also lower than the previous year due to conservation, consistent with high commodity prices.
 
Pipeline net operating revenues increased by $8.6 million over the first quarter 2005 to $25.1 million. Equitrans received final approval of its rate case in the quarter, resulting in net operating revenues of $8.1 million at Pipeline and $1.1 million at Marketing. Provisions of the rate increase were implemented in September 2004, subject to refund, so a large percentage of incremental revenues and expenses had been reserved pending final regulatory approval. Net operating revenues in Marketing were $19.7 million, $3.7 million higher than the first quarter 2005, primarily attributable to storage asset optimization resulting from high gas price volatility in the quarter.
 
Operating expenses increased year over year to $37.8 million from $36.9 million. Higher operating expenses attributable to the rate case settlement totaled $2.3 million. Excluding the reserve adjustment of $1.7 million related to the rate case, operating expenses decreased slightly.
 
Equitable Supply
 
Equitable Supply had operating income for the quarter of $72.0 million, 10% higher than the $65.4 million earned in the same period last year. Total revenues were $122.4 million, $9.1 million higher than total operating revenue of $113.3 million in 2005, primarily due to a 7% increase in the average well-head sales price and an 11% increase in gathering revenues as higher gathering rates offset lower gathered volumes. Production revenues increased $6.4 million quarter over quarter to $95.5 million in 2006 from $89.1 million in 2005 and gathering revenues were $2.7 million higher at $26.9 million, compared with $24.2 million in 2005. Sales volumes were unchanged as the volumes from recent drilling offset the 0.9 Bcf from wells that were sold in May 2005 and the natural decline of production from base wells. Excluding property dispositions, sales volumes were up by 5%. The Company expects to sell between 76 and 77 Bcf of natural gas in 2006. Gathered volumes declined by 5.9 Bcf or 18%, primarily due to the
transfer of certain regulated gathering facilities to Equitable Utilities for segment reporting purposes, third-party customer volume shut-ins caused by extended unexpected maintenance projects on interstate pipelines and the sale of certain non-core gathering assets in May 2005. These factors were partially offset by increased gathered volumes for Equitable Supply production in the quarter.
 
 Operating expenses for the quarter were $50.5 million compared to $47.9 million last year. Production taxes were $2.8 million higher than last year, selling, general and administrative expenses were $0.7 million higher, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses were $0.5 million higher. Partially offsetting the higher expenses was a reduction in lease operating expenses of $0.8 million.
 
During the quarter, the Company drilled 133 wells, compared with the 66 wells for the same period in 2005. The Company expects to drill 550 wells in 2006.

The Company expects to receive the required regulatory approvals by the end of 2006. Equitable will finance the transaction through a combination of equity and debt issuances and possibly asset sales.
