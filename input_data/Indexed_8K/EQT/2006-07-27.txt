PITTSBURGH, July 27, 2006/ PRNewswire-FirstCall/  Equitable Resources, Inc. (NYSE: EQT) today announced second quarter 2006 earnings per diluted share (EPS) of $0.36, compared with $0.52 reported in the second quarter 2005. The second quarter 2005 results were dominated by a
Quarterly Results by Business
Equitable Utilities
Equitable Utilities had operating income for the second quarter of $13.9 million compared to $5.7 million reported for the same period last year.  Net operating revenues were $45.8 million compared to $42.1 million in 2005, as higher Pipeline and Marketing net revenues more than offset lower Distribution net revenues.
Total operating expenses for the quarter decreased by $4.5 million from $36.4 million in 2005 to $31.9 million in 2006.  During the quarter, the Company reversed $2.4 million of a $3.8 million second quarter 2005 charge for office relocations.  Other operating expense increases included $2.7 million of costs associated with planning for the integration of Peoples Gas and Hope Gas, a $0.7 million increase in gathering operating expense and a $0.6 million increase in post retirement benefit costs.  Major items partially offsetting these increases were a $1.9 million reduction in bad debt and the absence in 2006 of a $0.8 million severance charge in the second quarter 2005.
Equitable Supply
Equitable Supply's operating income for the 2006 second quarter totaled $65.4 million, 3.6% higher than the $63.2 million earned in the same period last year.  Total operating revenues were $119.3 million, $7.1 million higher than the previous year's total of $112.2 million.  Production sales volumes increased by 0.6 Bcfe to 19.1 Bcfe as volumes from new wells more than offset the 0.6 Bcfe from wells sold in May 2005.  Excluding property dispositions, sales volumes were up by 6.7%.  Partially offsetting revenues from higher sales volumes was a 1.3% reduction in average sales price.  The Company expects to sell between 76 and 77 Bcfe of natural gas in 2006.
Gathering revenues were $26.7 million, $4.2 million higher than the second quarter 2005 as the average gathering fee increased by 29.5% to $1.01 per Mcfe.  Gathered volumes declined by 2.7 Bcfe or 9.3%, primarily due to the transfer of certain regulated gathering facilities to Equitable Utilities for segment reporting purposes and the sale of non-core gathering assets in May 2005.  These factors were partially offset by increased gathered volumes for Equitable Supply production in the quarter.
SG&A expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and production taxes account for most of the increase in operating expenses.
Total operating expenses for the 2006 second quarter totaled $53.9 million compared to $49.0 million in the 2005 second quarter.  Higher
The Company drilled 142 wells in the second quarter for a total of 275 wells in the first half of 2006.
