Exhibit 99.1
 
PITTSBURGH, January 25/PRNewswire-FirstCall/  Equitable Resources, Inc. (NYSE: EQT) today announced 2006 annual earnings per diluted share (EPS) of $1.80 on net income of $220.3 million.  This compares with EPS of $2.10 on net income of $260.1 million in 2005.  Several non-operational factors, discussed below, should be considered when comparing 2006 and 2005 results, including a $110.3 million gain on the sale of Kerr-McGee Corporation (KMG) shares in 2005.
RESULTS BY SEGMENT
Equitable Utilities
Equitable Utilities had operating income of $125.2 million for 2006, compared with $98.3 million for 2005, a 27% increase.  Net revenues increased $21.6 million or 9% over the previous year.  Distribution net revenues were 9% lower as a result of record warm weather, which was 10% warmer than in 2005 and 15% warmer than the 30-year normal, as measured in heating degree-days.  Pipeline net revenues increased $18.8 million or 35% over the prior year resulting from revenue associated with the rate case settlement in the first quarter and higher gathering activity.  Marketing net revenues were $16.4 million higher than in 2005, benefiting from favorable storage asset optimization opportunities.
Total operating expenses for 2006 were 3% lower at $149.8 million, compared to $155.1 million in 2005.  Expenses planning for the acquisition of Peoples Gas and Hope Gas totaled $12.3 million in 2006.  Excluding these costs, lower pension-related expenses, lower bad debt expense and the partial reversal of a 2005 lease impairment were partially offset by higher pipeline expenses primarily associated with deferred rate-related costs and higher gathering expenses.
Operating income for the 2006 fourth quarter was $46.4 million, 23% higher than the $37.7 million earned in the year ago quarter.  Net revenues were $90.7 million, $14.8 million higher than fourth quarter 2005 revenues of $75.9 million.  Higher marketing and pipeline net revenues more than offset lower distribution net revenues resulting from warmer weather.  Operating expenses in the quarter increased $6.2 million, to $44.4 million in 2006.  The majority of that increase was due to $5.9 million spent in planning for the acquisition of Peoples Gas and Hope Gas.
Equitable Supply
Equitable Supply had operating income of $269.2 million in 2006, 8% lower than the $293.6 million in 2005. Total revenues for 2006 were $488.6 million, essentially flat in comparison with 2005 revenues.  Lower commodity prices offset increased revenues from higher gathering rates and higher production sales volumes.  Average well-head sales price declined 7% from $5.17 to $4.83 per Mcfe.  Production sales volumes increased by 2.3 Bcfe to 76.2 Bcfe.  Excluding 1.5 Bcfe from wells sold in May 2005, sales volumes increased by slightly over 5%.  Higher gathering revenues were driven by a 24% increase in average gathering rates, partially offset by lower throughput resulting from volumes now reported at Utilities and volumes from properties sold in 2005.
Operating expenses increased from $195.6 million in 2005 to $219.4 million in 2006.  Selling, general and administrative expenses were $9.2 million higher as the Company recorded reserves for a royalty dispute in West Virginia and bad debt costs totaling $9.9 million.  Gathering and compression expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense were also higher, consistent with higher overall operating activity levels.  Gathering and compression expense also included $3.3 million of pension and other post retirement benefits charges, in the fourth quarter, for an early retirement program.
Operating inco
me for the 2006 fourth quarter totaled $68.5 million, $16.7 million lower than the $85.2 million of operating income in the fourth quarter 2005.  Significantly lower commodity prices more than offset increased sales volumes.  Operating expenses totaled $57.3 million, $6.0 million higher than last year.  The factors driving increased costs for the full year also apply to the fourth quarter results; partially offsetting these increases were lower production taxes resulting from lower natural gas prices.
During 2006, the Company drilled 560 gross operated wells, including 5 horizontal wells, and 95 non-operated wells
.  The Company expects to drill approximately 650 gross operated wells in 2007, including at least 25 horizontal wells, a 16% increase.  Sales volumes are estimated to be between 80 and 81 Bcfe in 2007.

2005 Items
Kerr-McGee Corp.
In 2005, Equitable sold approximately 7 million KMG shares resulting in a net pre-tax gain of $110.3 million.  These totals include 0.7 million shares sold in the fourth quarter for a gain of $30.0 million.
Executive Performance Incentive Programs
Executive Performance Incentive Program expenses were $5.4 million for the quarter and $21.1 million for the year and $13.9 million and $43.8 million, respectively, for 2005.  There were two programs in effect during 2005 but only one program in 2006.
Tax
During 2005, the Company completed its review and implementation of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.  The Company recognized a $15.3 million tax loss disallowance under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Office Consolidation
In 2005, the Company completed its relocation to a new office building.  The Company recognized a loss of $7.8 million in 2005 related to the move, of which $3.8 million was allocated to Utilities.  Utilities reversed $2.4 million of the loss in the second quarter 2006 when it reutilized some of the vacated office space.
NORESCO
In December 2005, Equitable sold NORESCO for approximately $82 million.  The sale resulted in reclassifying NORESCO as "discontinued operations."  With amounts recorded net of tax, Equitable recorded income from discontinued operations in 2005 of $1.5 million.  In the fourth quarter 2006, Equitable recorded income from discontinued operations of $4.3 million, primarily resulting from a reduced tax liability on the sale.
