Item 7.01               Regulation FD Disclosure.
On May 14, 2007, the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania dismissed the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) complaint for a preliminary injunction to halt Equitable Resources, Inc.'s (the Company or Equitable) acquisition of the capital stock of The Peoples Natural Gas Company (Dominion Peoples) from Consolidated Natural Gas Company (Dominion), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dominion Resources, Inc.  On May 16, 2007, the FTC filed notice of its intent to appeal the dismissal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. The FTC also filed a motion requesting the issuance of a preliminary injunction pending appellate review.
Also on May 14, 2007, the Public Service Commission of West Virginia issued an order in connection with five consolidated cases, including the Company's proposed acquisition of the capital stock of Hope Gas, Inc. (Dominion Hope).  The order initiates a focused management audit on two Dominion Hope applications to adjust purchased gas costs, which has the likely result of extending the administrative review schedule for the acquisition beyond June 30, 2007.  The existing stock purchase agreement for Dominion Hope and Dominion Peoples may be terminated by either party after June 30, 2007.
