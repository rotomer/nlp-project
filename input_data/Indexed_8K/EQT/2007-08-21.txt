Murry Gerber, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Equitable Resources, Inc. (the Company), is scheduled to present at Enercom's The Oil & Gas Conference on Wednesday, August 22, 2007. The presentation will be broadcast live (commencing at 6:50 pm ET (4:50 pm MT)) on the Company's website (http://www.eqt.com) and will be available for replay for seven days. The slides for this presentation are furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein.
 
The information in this Item 7.01 of Form 8-K shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), or otherwise subject to the liability of such section, nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act) or the Exchange Act, regardless of the general incorporation language of such filing, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
 
The Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only proved reserves that a company has demonstrated by actual production or conclusive formation tests to be economically and legally producible under existing economic and operating conditions. The Company uses the terms "probable" and "possible" and other descriptions of volumes of reserves potentially recoverable through additional drilling or recovery techniques that the SEC's guidelines would prohibit us from including in filings with the SEC. These estimates are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved reserves and, accordingly, are subject to substantially greater risk of being actually realized. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our Form 10-K and Form 10-Qs, available at www.eqt.com. You can also obtain these forms on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.
 
and throughout the Company's most recent Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q
Disclosures in this Form 8-K contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Exchange Act and Section 27A of the Securities Act. Statements that do not relate strictly to historical or current facts are forward-looking. A variety of factors could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the Company's forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties that may affect the operations, performance and results of the Company's business and forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those set forth under Item 1A, "Risk Factors"
