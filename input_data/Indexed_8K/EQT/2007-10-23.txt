Item 5.03               Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws; Change in Fiscal Year.
 
Effective October 17, 2007, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Equitable Resources, Inc. (the "Company") approved amendments to Section 8.01 of the Company's By-Laws to make the By-Laws consistent with the Company's Articles of Incorporation with respect to the level of shareholder approval required for amendments to the By-Laws that have been approved by two-thirds of the members of the Board. The amendments provide that such shareholder approval requires the vote specified by law for valid shareholder action, which has the effect under current law of requiring the approval of a majority of the votes cast at a shareholder meeting. Similar amendments to the Company's Articles of Incorporation were approved by the Company's shareholders at the 2007 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
 
The complete text of the Company's By-Laws, as amended and restated effective October 17, 2007, is filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.

Directors of the Company at a meeting of shareholders may be made by the Board of Directors or by any shareholder of the Company entitled to vote for the election of directors at such meeting who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 3.07. Such nominations, other than those made by or on behalf of the Board of Directors, shall be made by notice in writing delivered or mailed by first class United States mail, postage prepaid, to the Secretary, and received not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the anniversary date of the previous year's annual meeting; provided, however, that if the Company changes the date of its annual meeting by more than 30 days from the anniversary date of the prior years' annual meeting, then such proposal shall have been received on or before the later of (x) during the period commencing 120 days and ending 90 days before the date of the annual meeting of (y) the close of business on the 10 day following the earlier of the date on which the Company gave notice of or publicly disclosed the date of the meeting.

The Chairman of the meeting may, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the foregoing procedure, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.
 
No Director of this Company shall be permitted to serve in that capacity after the date of the annual meeting of shareholders next following his or her seventy-fourth (74th) birthday.

No Director shall be personally liable for monetary damages as such (except to the extent otherwise provided by law) for any action taken, or any failure to take any action, unless such Director has breached or failed to perform the duties of his or her office under Title 42, Chapter 83, Subchapter F of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes (or any successor
Section 3.09
                               
statute relating to Directors' standard of care and justifiable reliance); and the breach or failure to perform constitutes self-dealing, willful misconduct or recklessness.
 
If the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes are amended after May 22, 1987, the date this section received shareholder approval, to further eliminate or limit the personal liability of Directors, then a Director shall not be liable, in addition to the circumstances set forth in this section, to the fullest extent permitted by the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes, as so amended.
 
The provisions of this section shall not apply to any actions filed prior to January 27, 1987, nor to any breach of performance of duty, or any failure of performance of duty, by any Director occurring prior to January 27, 1987.
 
  (a) In order for any person to become a nominee for election by shareholders as a Director of the Company, such person must have submitted to the Board of Directors prior to the time of such person's nomination an irrevocable conditional resignation from the Board, to take effect upon the occurrence of all of the following conditions:  () such person having been elected a director in the upcoming election, where the number of nominees did not exceed the number of directors to be elected; () such person having received a greater number of votes "withheld" from his or her election than votes "for" such election; and () such resignation having been accepted by the Board. Not later than 90 days after the certification of an election by shareholders satisfying clauses (i) and (ii)  the Board of Directors will decide, after receipt of a recommendation of the Corporate Governance Committee, whether to accept such conditional resignation.

(b)  Any determination by the Board of Directors and the Corporate Governance Committee under subsection (a) shall be made without the participation of any Director whose resignation is under consideration with respect to the election. If there are not sufficient
unaffected members of the Corporate Governance Committee to form a quorum, the unaffected independent Directors shall name a committee made up solely of unaffected independent Directors to make recommendations to the Board as to the acceptance of tendered resignation(s). If the number of unaffected independent Directors is three or fewer, all Directors may participate, with or without the naming of such committee as the Directors may deem appropriate, in the decision as to whether to accept the tendered resignations.
 
(c)  In considering the question of whether to accept a Director nominee's resignation, the Corporate Governance Committee and the Board of Directors shall be entitled to consider such facts and circumstances as deemed appropriate, including (i) whether the concerns raised by shareholders that led to the withhold votes can or should be cured, (ii) whether resignation of the nominee is an appropriate response to the concerns raised by the shareholders, (iii) the Director nominee's historical and anticipated future commitment and contribution to the Board, (iv) whether the Director's service on the Board of Directors is consistent with applicable regulatory requirements and listing standards, and without limitation (v) other matters in the interests of the Company. The Board of Directors' explanation of its decision shall be promptly disclosed on Form 8-K furnished to or filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
Directors, officers, agents, and employees of the Company shall be indemnified as of right to the fullest extent not prohibited by law in connection with any actual or threatened action, suit or proceeding, civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other (whether brought by or in the right of the Company or otherwise) arising out of their service to the Company
Section 4.01
                               
or to another enterprise at the request of the Company. The Company may purchase and maintain insurance to protect itself and any such Director, officer, agent or employee against any liability asserted against and incurred by him or her in respect of such service, whether or not the Company would have the power to indemnify him or her against such liability by law or under the provisions of this section. The provisions of this section shall be applicable to persons who have ceased to be Directors, officers, agents, and employees and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, and administrators of persons entitled to indemnity hereunder.
 
Indemnification under this section shall include the right to be paid expenses incurred in advance of the final disposition of any action, suit or proceeding for which indemnification is provided, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the indemnified person to repay such amount if it ultimately shall be determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company. The indemnification rights granted herein are not intended to be exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification may be entitled and the Company may enter into contractual agreements with any Director, officer, agent or employee to provide such individual with indemnification rights as set forth in such agreement or agreements, which rights shall be in addition to the rights set forth in this section.
 
The provisions of this section shall be applicable to actions, suits or proceedings commenced after the adoption hereof, whether arising from acts or omissions occurring before or after the adoption hereof.
 
The Board of Directors shall have authority to appoint an Executive Committee, a Finance Committee, an Audit Committee, and such other committees as it
Section 5.01
                               
deems advisable, each to consist of two (2) or more Directors, and from time to time to define the duties and fix the number of members of each committee. In the absence or disqualification of any member of any such committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not constituting a quorum, may unanimously appoint another Director or Directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member or members.
 
The principal officers of the Company shall be chosen by the Board of Directors and shall be a Chief Executive Officer, a President, a Secretary, and a Treasurer.

Any officer or agent may be removed by the Board of Directors whenever in its judgment the best interests of the Company will be served thereby. Such removal, however, shall be without prejudice to the contract rights of the person so removed. If the office of any officer becomes vacant for any reason, the vacancy may be filled by the Board of Directors.

If any stock certificate is signed by a Transfer Agent or Registrar, the signature of any such officer and the corporate seal upon any such certificate may be a facsimile, engraved or printed.
Section 7.03
                               
New certificates for shares of stock may be issued to replace certificates lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated upon such terms and conditions as the Board may from time to time determine.
 
(a)  The Board of Directors may make, amend, and repeal the By-Laws with respect to those matters which are not, by statute, reserved exclusively to the shareholders, subject always to the power of the shareholders to change such action as provided herein. No By-Law may be made, amended or repealed by the shareholders unless such action is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than eighty percent (80%) of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote in an annual election of Directors, voting together as a single class, unless such action has been previously approved by a two-thirds vote of the whole Board of Directors, in which event (unless otherwise expressly provided in the Articles or the By-Laws) the vote specified by applicable law for valid shareholder action shall be required.
Section 8.01
                               
 
(b)  Unless otherwise provided by a By-Law, by the Restated Articles or by law, any By-Law may be amended, altered or repealed, and new By-Laws may be adopted, by vote of a majority of the Directors present at any regular or special meeting duly convened, but only if notice of the specific sections to be amended, altered, repealed or added is included in the notice of meeting. No provision of the By-Laws shall vest any property or contract right in any shareholder.
Subchapter G  Control Share Acquisitions and Subchapter H  Disgorgement by Certain Controlling Shareholders Following Attempts to Acquire Control of Title 15, Chapter 25, of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes, shall not be applicable to the Company.
