PITTSBURGH, January 31/PRNewswire-FirstCall/  Equitable Resources, Inc. (NYSE: EQT) today announced 2007 annual earnings per diluted share (EPS) of $2.10 on net income of $257.5 million.  This compares with EPS of $1.80 on net income of $220.3 million in 2006.  Several non-operational factors, discussed below, should be considered when comparing 2007 and 2006 results, including the sale of reserves in the second quarter 2007 and expenses incurred in 2006 and 2007 in connection with the terminated acquisition of The Peoples Natural Gas Company and Hope Gas, Inc.
 
RESULTS BY SEGMENT
 
Equitable Supply
 
Equitable Supply had operating income of $263.5 million in 2007, 2.1% lower than the $269.2 million in 2006. Total revenues for 2007 were $501.7 million, 2.7% higher than $488.6 in 2006, due to higher realized prices and higher sales volumes.  Average well-head sales price increased 3.1% from $4.83 to $4.98 per Mcfe resulting from a higher percentage of unhedged gas sales and a higher realized hedged price.  Sales volumes increased by 0.9 Bcfe to 77.1 Bcfe with daily sales of approximately 210 MMcfe per day at year end.  Adjusting for the sale of reserves in the second quarter 2007, sales volumes increased by 5.4%.  Gathering revenues declined by 3.5% to $107.1 million from $110.9 million, as a result of the gathering asset contribution to Nora Gathering, LLC in the second quarter 2007.  Adjusting for the Nora transaction, gathered volumes increased 3.3%.  The average gathering fee increased 11.8% from $1.02 per Mcfe to $1.14 per Mcfe.
 
Operating expenses increased from $219.4 million in 2006 to $238.1 million in 2007.  Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were higher mainly from increased reserves for certain royalty disputes in the first quarter and other legal expenses.  Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, and lease operating expense were also higher, consistent with higher overall operating activity levels, but were partially offset by lower production taxes.  At Gathering, higher depreciation, gathering and compression expense and SG&A were offset by the absence of expenses attributable to the transferred Nora gathering assets and lower production taxes.
 
Operating income for the 2007 fourth quarter totaled $75.3 million, $6.8 million higher than the $68.5 million of operating income in the fourth quarter 2006. Revenue increased by 4.4% resulting from higher NYMEX natural gas prices and higher sales volumes, partially offset by the loss of Nora gathering revenues.  Sales volumes increased by 0.6% to 19.4 Bcfe.  Adjusting for the sale of reserves in the second quarter, sales volume for the quarter increased 7.5% over the prior year quarter.  Operating expenses totaled $56.0 million, $1.3 million lower than last year.  Higher operating expenses were more than offset by the transferred Nora related gathering expenses and a pension related charge in the fourth quarter 2006.
 
Horizontal drilling continued to meet or exceed the company's expectations in the fourth quarter. Equitable drilled 38 horizontal wells. In Kentucky, Equitable drilled 26 Devonian shale wells, 5 targeting the Cleveland shale and 21 targeting the Huron shale.  In West Virginia, the company drilled 10 Devonian shale wells, 8 targeting the Huron shale, 1 targeting the low pressure Marcellus shale in southern West Virginia and 1 targeting the Rhinestreet shale.  In Virginia, the company drilled 2 horizontal wells in the Lower Huron shale, 1 in Nora and 1 in Roaring Fork.  The production from the horizontal wells turned-in-line is consistent with the expected decline curve included in the company's analyst presentation.
 
Since January 1, 2008, the company has spud 17 horizontal wells, including its first Marcellus well in Pennsylvania, its first multi-lateral well in Kentucky and its first horizontal well in the Berea sand.  The company is targeting drilling of between 250-300 horizontal wells in 2008.
 
During 2007, the company drilled 634 gross wells, consisting of 88 horizontal shale wells; 266 coal bed methane wells and 280 vertical wells. The drilling program developed 165 Bcfe, a 38% increase over 2006, driven by the higher productivity of horizontal wells compared to vertical wells.
 
Production Guidance
 
In 2008, the total sales for the year are forecast to be 80-81 Bcfe.  Daily sales volumes are expected to hit 235 MMcfe by year end, a 12% increase over the year end 2007 run rate.
 
Equitable Utilities
 
Equitable Utilities had operating income of $113.4 million for 2007, compared with $125.2 million for 2006, a 9.4% decrease.  Net revenues increased $10.3 million or 3.7% over the previous year.  Distribution net revenues were 4.5% higher as a result of increased throughput from weather which was 7% colder than 2006, but 9% warmer than the 30-year normal.  The pipeline net operating revenues declined by $5.1 million in 2007, primarily attributable to a rate case settlement of $7.0 million in the first quarter of 2006, partially offset by higher rates in 2007.  Marketing net revenues were $8.9 million higher than in 2006, benefiting from favorable storage asset optimization opportunities that were captured at a time of unusually high commodity price and volatility and settled in the first quarter 2007.
 
Total operating expenses for 2007 were 14.7% higher at $171.8 million, compared to $149.8 million in 2006.  Expenses for the acquisition of Peoples Gas and Hope Gas, which was terminated in January 2008, totaled $21.0 million in 2007, including a $10.1 million write down of previously deferred transaction costs.  In addition to transaction costs, increases in labor and legal expenses contributed to the year-over-year increase.
 
Operating income for the 2007 fourth quarter was $29.3 million, 36.9% lower than the $46.4 million earned in the year ago quarter.  Net revenues were $84.7 million, $6.0 million lower than fourth quarter 2006 revenues of $90.7 million primarily due to a reduction in marketing net revenues.  Lower marketing net revenues are explained by unusually favorable market conditions in the fourth quarter 2006 that persisted through the first quarter 2007. Operating expenses in the quarter increased $11.0 million, to $55.4 million in 2007.  This increase includes the $10.1 million write-off of the deferred acquisition costs.
 
Other Business
 
Organizational Restructuring
 
In order to better reflect the drivers necessary to execute the company's growth strategy, Equitable is changing from a two segment reporting structure to a three segment reporting structure. Effective January 1, 2008, the company's segment reporting will be adjusted to reflect the three new segments: Equitable Production, Equitable Midstream and Equitable Distribution.
 
Equitable Production will drill and maintain wells, including both the horizontal drilling program and coal bed methane program, as well as explore for economic reserves of hydrocarbons in formations deeper than currently productive horizons.
 
Equitable Midstream encompasses physical infrastructure downstream of the wells including gathering pipelines, compressor stations, gas processing facilities, storage and FERC-regulated pipelines.
 
Equitable Distribution serves 275,000 residential, commercial and industrial customers in western Pennsylvania and West Virginia.
 
2007 Capital Expenditures
 
Equitable invested $805 million in capital projects during 2007.  This included $322 million for well development, $394 million for Supply infrastructure, $88 million for Equitable Utilities, and $1 million for Corporate.

2007 Items
 
Nora Field
 
During 2007, the company sold approximately 74 Bcfe of proved reserves and contributed its Nora gathering assets to a limited liability company, which is 50% owned by the company.  Equitable recorded a gain of $154.5 million on the transaction, of which $6.7 million closed in the fourth quarter, and a loss of $28.4 million for the year as the company reduced its hedge position.
 
Operating Income
 
The company reports operating income by segment in this press release.  Both interest and income taxes are controlled on a consolidated, corporate-wide basis, and are not allocated to the segments.
 
The following table reconciles operating income by segment as reported in this press release to the consolidated operating income reported in the company's financial statements:
 
 
 
Unallocated expenses are primarily due to incentive compensation.  For each period presented, the difference between equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments as reported on the company's statements of consolidated income and on Equitable Supply's operational and financial report is the earnings from the company's ownership interest in Appalachian Natural Gas Trust.  Other segment financial measures identified in this press release are reconciled to the most comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP on the attached operational and financial reports.
 
Equitable's teleconference with securities analysts, which begins at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time today, will be broadcast live via Equitable's website, http://www.eqt.com and will be available for replay for a seven day period.
