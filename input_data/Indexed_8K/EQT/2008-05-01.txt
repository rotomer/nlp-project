Item 7.01.
              Regulation FD Disclosure.
 
Equitable Resources, Inc. (the "Company") is furnishing this Form 8-K to recast certain historical business segment financial and operational data for each of the three month periods ended March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, 2007, to reflect a change in organizational structure and segment reporting effective for 2008.  The historical data was furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Forms 8-K dated April 26, July 26, and October 25, 2007 and January 31, 2008, respectively, to which the Company's earnings press releases were attached. The data contained herein has not been updated to reflect any financial results or other changes subsequent to 2007.
 
On March 7, 2008, the Company filed a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "March Form 8-K") to recast its historical business segment information for the year ended December 31, 2007.  The information in this Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1, should be read in conjunction with the March Form 8-K and the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 22, 2008.
 
Exhibit 99.1, which is incorporated herein by reference, sets forth certain segment related financial and operating information.  The Company's management believes that the presentation of this segment information provides useful information to management and investors regarding the financial condition, operations and trends of each of the Company's segments without being obscured by the financial condition, operations and trends for the other segments, or by the effects of corporate allocations of interest and income taxes.  In addition, management uses these measures for budget planning purposes.
 
The information in this Form 8-K, including the accompanying Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liability of such section, nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, regardless of the general incorporation language of such filing, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
