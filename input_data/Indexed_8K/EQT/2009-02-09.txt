(i)
                 
.  Except as provided in this Section 2.1, the holders of the Common Stock shall have exclusive voting rights for the election of Directors and for all other purposes and shall be entitled to one vote for each share held.
2.1
Voting Rights
                    
 
The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have no voting rights except as may be provided with respect to any particular series of the Preferred Stock by the Board of Directors pursuant to Subdivision 1.1 of Division A hereof.  On any matter on which the holders of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to vote, they shall be entitled to vote as established by the Board of Directors pursuant to Subdivision 1.1 of Division A hereof.
 
In all elections for Directors, every stockholder entitled to vote shall have the right, in person or by proxy, to multiply the number of votes to which such stockholder may be entitled by the number of Directors for the election of whom he is entitled to vote at such meeting, and such stockholder may cast the whole number of such votes for one candidate or may distribute them among any two or more candidates.  The candidates receiving the highest number of votes up to the number of Directors to be elected shall be elected.  The foregoing provisions of this paragraph shall not be changed with respect to any class of stock unless the holders of record of not less than two-thirds of the number of shares of such class of stock then outstanding shall consent thereto in writing or by voting therefor in person or by proxy at the meeting of stockholders at which any such change is considered.
 
.  Upon any issue for money or other consideration of any stock of the Company that may be authorized from time to time, no holder of stock, irrespective of the kind of such stock, shall have any pre-emptive or other right to subscribe for, purchase, or receive any proportionate or other share of the stock so issued, but the Board of Directors may dispose of all or any portion of such stock as and when it may determine, free of any such rights, whether by offering the same to stockholders or by sale or other disposition as said Board may deem advisable; provided, however, that if the Board of Directors shall determine to offer any new or additional shares of Common Stock, or any security convertible into Common Stock, for money, other than (i) by a public offering of all of such shares or offering of all of such shares to or through underwriters or investment bankers who shall have agreed promptly to make a public offering of such shares, or (ii) pursuant to any employee compensation, incentive or other benefit program adopted by the Board of Directors, the same shall first be offered pro rata to the holders of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company at a price not less favorable than the price at which the Board of Directors issues and disposes of such stock or securities to other than such holders of Common Stock before deducting reasonable commissions or compensation that may be paid by the Company in connection with the sale of any such stock and securities; and provided, further, that the time within which such pre-emptive rights shall be exercised may be limited by the Board of Directors to
2.2
Pre-emptive Rights
                    
 
such time as the said Board may deem proper, not less, however, than ten days after mailing of notice that such stock rights are available and may be exercised.  The foregoing provisions of this Subdivision 2.2 shall not be changed unless the holders of record of not less than two-thirds of the number of shares of the Common Stock then outstanding shall consent thereto in writing or by voting therefor in person or by proxy at the meeting of stockholders at which any such change is considered.
 
.  The Board of Directors may make, amend and repeal the By-Laws with respect to those matters which are not, by statute, reserved exclusively to the shareholders, subject always to the power of the shareholders to change such action as provided herein. No By-Law may be made, amended or repealed by the shareholders unless such action is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than 80% of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote in an annual election of directors, voting together as a single class, unless such action has been previously approved by a two-thirds vote of the whole Board of Directors, in which event (unless otherwise expressly provided in the Articles or the By-Laws) the vote specified by applicable law for valid shareholder action shall be required.
2.3
Amendments to By-Laws
                    
 
.  Subject to the voting rights given to any particular series of the Preferred Stock by the Board of Directors pursuant to Subdivision 1.1 of Division A hereof, and except as may be specifically provided to the contrary in any other provision in the Articles with respect to amendment or repeal of such provision, the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than 80% of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote in an annual election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend the Articles of the Company or repeal any provision thereof, unless such action has been previously approved by a two-thirds vote of the whole Board of Directors, in which event (unless otherwise expressly provided in the Articles) such shareholder approval as may be specified by law shall be required.
2.4
Amendments to Articles
                    
 
.  The Company may issue and dispose of any of its authorized shares for such consideration as may be fixed by the Board of Directors subject to the laws then applicable and to the provisions of Subdivision 2.2 of this Division B.
2.5
General
                    
The business and affairs of the Company shall be managed by a Board of Directors comprised as follows:
3.1
                    
 
The Board of Directors shall consist of not less than 5 nor more than 12 persons, the exact number to be fixed from time to time by the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority vote of the directors then in office.
(a)
              
 
Directors of the Company shall be classified with respect to the time for which they shall severally hold office by dividing them into three classes:  Class 1; Class 2; and Class 3, as nearly equal in number as possible.  At the special meeting of shareholders at which the amendment adding this Division C shall be adopted, the then current directors shall be assigned to the three classes in accordance with resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors.  Class 1 directors shall not be elected at such special meeting but shall continue to hold office until the annual meeting of shareholders in 1984.  Class 2 directors shall be elected by shareholders at such special meeting to extended terms of office, to serve until the annual meeting in 1985.  Class 3 directors shall be elected by shareholders at such special meeting to extended terms of office, to serve until the annual meeting in 1986.  Each class of directors to be elected at such special meeting shall be elected in a separate election.  At each succeeding annual meeting of shareholders, the class of directors then being elected shall be elected to hold office for a term of three years.  Each director shall hold office for the term for which elected and until his or her successor shall have been elected and qualified.
(b)
             
 
Any director, any class of directors or the entire Board of Directors may be removed from office by shareholder vote at any time, without assigning any cause, but only if shareholders entitled to
(c)
              
 
cast at least 80% of the votes which all shareholders would be entitled to cast at an annual election of directors or of such class of directors shall vote in favor of such removal; , that no individual director shall be removed without cause (unless the entire Board of Directors or any class of directors be removed) in case the votes cast against such removal would be sufficient, if voted cumulatively for such director, to elect him or her to the class of directors of which he or she is a member.
provided, however
 
Vacancies in the Board of Directors, including vacancies resulting from an increase in the number of directors, shall be filled only by a majority vote of the remaining directors then in office, though less than a quorum, except that vacancies resulting from removal from office by a vote of the shareholders may be filled by the shareholders at the same meeting at which such removal occurs.  All directors elected to fill vacancies shall hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of shareholders at which the term of the class to which they have been elected expires.  No decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director.
(d)
             
 
Whenever the holders of any class or series of preferred stock shall have the right, voting separately as a class, to elect one or more directors of the Company, none of the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.1 shall apply with respect to the director or directors elected by such holders of preferred stock.
(e)
              
 
Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, the Articles or the By-Laws of the Company, the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than 80% of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote in an annual election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend, alter, change or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with, this Division C, unless such action has been previously approved by a two-thirds vote of the whole Board of Directors.
3.2
                    
 
No Director shall be personally liable for monetary damages as such (except to the extent otherwise provided by law) for any action taken, or any failure to take any action, unless such Director has breached or failed to perform the duties of his or her office under Title 42, Chapter 83, Subchapter F of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes (or any successor statute relating to Directors' standard of care and justifiable reliance); and the breach or failure to perform constitutes self-dealing, willful misconduct or recklessness.
3.3
                    
 
If the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes are amended after May 22, 1987, the date this section received shareholder approval, to further eliminate or limit the personal liability of Directors, then a Director shall not be liable, in addition to the circumstances set forth in this section, to the fullest extent permitted by the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes, as so amended.
 
The provisions of this section shall not apply to any actions filed prior to January 27, 1987 nor to any breach of performance of duty, or any failure of performance of duty, by any Director occurring prior to January 27, 1987.
.
4.1
Votes Required; Exceptions

(a)

(A)
         
 
a proxy or information statement describing the proposed Business Combination and complying with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, whether or not the Company is then subject to such requirements, shall have been mailed to all shareholders of the Company.  The proxy or information statement shall contain at the front thereof, in a prominent place, the position of the Continuing Directors as to the advisability (or inadvisability) of the Business Combination and, if deemed advisable by a majority of the Continuing Directors, the opinion of an investment banking firm selected by the Continuing Directors as to the fairness of the terms of the Business Combination, from the point of view of the holders of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company other than any Related Person.
(B)
           
 
Such 80% vote shall in any such instance be required notwithstanding the fact that no vote may be required or that a lesser percentage may be specified by law or in any agreement with any national securities exchange or otherwise.
(b)

Section 4.04
                               
such indemnified person against the Company under this Article.  With respect to any such action, suit or proceeding, the Company will be entitled to participate therein at its own expense and may assume the defense thereof.
