Murry S. Gerber Retirement as Full Time Employee
 
Effective May 10, 2011, Murry S. Gerber, who had served as the Company's Executive Chairman, retired as a full-time employee of EQT Corporation (the "Company").  Mr. Gerber will continue to serve as a member of the Company's Board of Directors.
 
On May 10, 2011, the Company and Mr. Gerber entered into an Executive Alternative Work Arrangement Employment Agreement ("Agreement"), a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.   Pursuant to its terms, Mr. Gerber will serve as part-time employee of the Company through January 3, 2012, at which time he will cease to be an employee.  Mr. Gerber will be paid a salary of $7,056 per two-week pay period during the term of the Agreement. He will remain subject to non-competition, non-solicitation and confidentiality obligations to the Company through the later of January 3, 2014 and one year after the date Mr. Gerber ceases to serve on the Company's Board of Directors.  Mr. Gerber will not receive compensation for his service as a member of the Company's Board of Directors until he ceases to be employed by the Company.
 
Approval of EQT Corporation 2011 Executive Short-Term Incentive Plan
 
On May 10, 2011, the shareholders of the Company at the 2011 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the "Annual Meeting") approved the EQT Corporation 2011 Executive Short-Term Incentive Plan (the "Executive STIP"), which was adopted by the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors on December 1, 2010.  The purposes of the Executive STIP are to maintain a competitive level of total cash compensation and to align the interests of the Company's executive employees with those of the Company's shareholders and customers and with the strategic direction of the Company.  Shareholder approval of the Executive STIP permits the continued qualification of the Executive STIP as "performance-based" compensation, which is excepted from the limit on executive officer compensation deductibility under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
 
The Executive STIP as approved by the shareholders is largely as previously in effect.  Key changes from the prior plan include the following:
 
the list of available performance criteria on which tax-deductible incentive awards may be granted was expanded;
               
certain refinements were made to the procedure for establishing incentive targets;
               
a procedure for measuring the fair market value of shares of the Company's common stock issued in substitution for a cash payment was added;
               
the description of the tax consequences was updated; and
               
a provision requiring that any incentive award paid shall be subject to the terms and conditions of any compensation recoupment policy adopted from time to time by the Board of Directors or any committee of the Board, to the extent such policy is applicable to annual incentive compensation, was included.
               
A complete copy of the Executive STIP is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Amendment to Stock Option Terms and Conditions
 
On May 10, 2011, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved an amendment to the terms and conditions of all of the Company's outstanding stock options to provide that upon an optionee's termination of service from the Company for any reason other than for cause, the optionee's outstanding options, to the extent vested on the date of such termination of service, shall remain exercisable for the entire remaining original term.  Previously such options would have expired upon the optionee's termination of service.  The Compensation Committee expects to incorporate these terms and conditions into all future stock option award agreements.
 
Item 3.03.  Material Modifications to Rights of Security Holders
 
Item 5.03.  Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
 
Amendment to Restated Articles of Incorporation
 
On May 10, 2011, the Company's Board of Directors amended the Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation to update the address of the Company's registered office.   In addition, at the Annual Meeting on the same date, the shareholders of the Company approved amendments to the Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation to:
 
adopt a majority voting standard for uncontested director elections and eliminate cumulative voting;
               
provide that a person elected by the Board of Directors to fill a vacancy in the Board of Directors will hold office for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of shareholders held immediately following such person being elected to fill the vacancy and that thereafter such person will hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of shareholders at which the term of the class to which such person has been elected expires; and
               
eliminate shareholder pre-emptive rights in their entirety.
               
 
 
Each of the amendments (other than the change to the registered office) is more fully described in the Company's proxy statement dated March 24, 2011.  All amendments were filed with the Department of State of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and became effective on May 10, 2011.  A copy of the Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended May 10, 2011, is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Amendment to By-Laws
 
On May 10, 2011, the Board of Directors approved certain amendments to the Company's By-Laws to conform to the shareholder approved amendments to the Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation described above.  More specifically, the By-Laws were amended to:
adopt a majority voting standard for uncontested director elections, including a resignation policy; and
          
provide that a person elected by the Board of Directors to fill a vacancy in the Board of Directors will hold office for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of shareholders held immediately following such person being elected to fill the vacancy and that thereafter such person will hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of shareholders at which the term of the class to which such person has been elected expires.
          
 
The Board of Directors also amended the Company's By-Laws to:
 
provide that the Chairman of the Board of Directors shall preside at annual shareholder meetings;
          
update the advance notice provisions by (i) centralizing all advance notice provisions in one location, (ii) requiring greater disclosure regarding hedging, vote selling and other situations where there is a dislocation of a  person's economic interest and voting rights, and (iii) clarifying the application of the advance notice provisions to special meetings;
          
eliminate the By-Law requirement that the salaries of all officers of the Company be fixed by the Board of Directors; and
          
make other procedural and administrative changes and clarifications.
          
 
The By-Law amendments did not require shareholder approval.  Clean and marked versions of the complete text of the Company's By-Laws, as amended May 10, 2011, are attached hereto as Exhibits 3.2 and 3.3 and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 5.07.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
 
At the Company's Annual Meeting, the Company's shareholders considered eight proposals, each of which is described in more detail in the Company's definitive proxy statement dated March 24, 2011.  The final vote results for each proposal were as follows:
 
 
 
 
Based on these results, and consistent with the Company's recommendation, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has determined that the Company will hold an advisory vote on executive compensation every year until the next shareholder advisory vote on the frequency of say-on-pay proposals.
 
Item 7.01.  Regulation FD Disclosure.
 
Effective May 10, 2011, David L. Porges, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, was elected Chairman of the Board of Directors.  Mr. Porges succeeded Mr. Gerber as Chief Executive Officer of the Company on April 21, 2010 and has served on the Board of Directors since May 2002.

Directors of the Company shall be classified with respect to the time for which they shall severally hold office by dividing them into three classes:  Class 1; Class 2; and Class 3, as nearly equal in number as possible.  At the special meeting of shareholders at which the amendment adding this Division C shall be adopted, the then current directors shall be assigned to the three classes in accordance with resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors.  Class 1 directors shall not be elected at such special meeting but shall continue to hold office until the annual meeting of shareholders in 1984.  Class 2 directors shall be elected by shareholders at such special meeting to extended terms of office, to serve until the annual meeting in 1985.

(d)
           
Vacancies in the Board of Directors, including vacancies resulting from an increase in the number of directors, shall be filled only by a majority vote of the remaining directors then in office, though less than a quorum, except that vacancies resulting from removal from office by a vote of the shareholders may be filled by the shareholders at the same meeting at which such removal occurs.  A person elected by the directors to fill a vacancy in the Board of Directors shall hold office for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of shareholders held immediately following such person being elected to fill the vacancy.  Thereafter, such person shall hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of shareholders at which the term of the class to which such person has been elected expires.  No decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director.
 
(e)
           
Whenever the holders of any class or series of preferred stock shall have the right, voting separately as a class, to elect one or more directors of the Company, none of the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.1 shall apply with respect to the director or directors elected by such holders of preferred stock.
 
3.2

3.3
                 
No Director shall be personally liable for monetary damages as such (except to the extent otherwise provided by law) for any action taken, or any failure to take any action, unless such Director has breached or failed to perform the duties of his or her office under Title 42, Chapter 83, Subchapter F of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes (or any successor statute relating to Directors' standard of care and justifiable reliance); and the breach or failure to perform constitutes self-dealing, willful misconduct or recklessness.
 
If the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes are amended after May 22, 1987, the date this section received shareholder approval, to further eliminate or limit the personal liability of Directors, then a Director shall not be liable, in addition to the circumstances set forth in this section, to the fullest extent permitted by the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes, as so amended.
 
The provisions of this section shall not apply to any actions filed prior to January 27, 1987 nor to any breach of performance of duty, or any failure of performance of duty, by any Director occurring prior to January 27, 1987.

Exhibit 10.1
 
This is an Executive Alternative Work Arrangement Employment Agreement ("Agreement") entered into between EQT Corporation (the "Company") and Murry S. Gerber ("Employee").
 
WHEREAS, Employee is an executive officer of the Company who desires to relinquish that status and discontinue full-time employment with the Company but continue employment with the Company on a part-time basis; and
 
WHEREAS, the Company is interested in continuing to retain the services of Employee on a part-time basis during the term of this Agreement;
 
WHEREAS, Employee has elected to modify his employment status to Executive Alternative Work Arrangement;
 
WHEREAS, in connection with a Confidentiality, Non-Solicitation and Non-Competition Agreement between Employee and the Company, Employee and the Company agreed to a form of Executive Alternative Work Arrangement Employment Agreement (the "Original Form Agreement")  that would govern their relationship while Employee is in the Executive Alternative Work Arrangement status;
 
WHEREAS, Employee and the Company have agreed to modify and amend, in certain respects, the Original Form Agreement and all such modifications and amendments have been set forth in this Agreement, which sets forth the entire agreement of the parties;
 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the respective representations, acknowledgements, and agreements of the parties set forth herein, and intending to be legally bound, the parties agree as follows:
 
1.         The term of this Agreement is for the period commencing on the day after Employee's full-time status with the Company ceases and ending on January 3, 2012 (the "Term").  During the Term, Employee will hold the position of an EAW employee of the Company and shall have the title of Executive Director  Special Projects.
 
2.         During the Term, Employee shall be paid salary at a rate per regularly scheduled pay period of $7,056, less applicable withholding taxes, and payable in accordance with the Company's normal payroll practices.  In the event that Employee works a partial pay period, Employee shall be paid on a pro rata basis for such days worked.
 
3.         During the Term, Employee shall be eligible to continue to participate in the group medical, prescription drug, dental and vision programs in which Employee participated immediately before the classification change to Executive Alternative Work Arrangement (as such plans might be modified by the Company from time-to-time), but Employee will be
 
required to pay 100% of the Company's premium rates to the carriers (the active employee premium rates as adjusted year-to-year) for participation in such group insurance programs.  Employee will be allowed to participate in such group insurance programs at 100% of the then-applicable active employee premium rates, even though Employee is no longer employed by the Company, until Employee reaches age 65 or, if such programs are provided to a later age to other current or future participants in the executive alternative work arrangement program, to such later age but in no event later than the Medicare eligibility age.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company's obligation to provide the benefits set forth in this Section 3 shall cease and be of no further force or effect if Company reasonably believes Employee is or has engaged in any activity that violates the covenants set forth in Sections 12 or 13 below, regardless of whether such covenants remain in force and effect at such time.
 
4.         For a period of one-year following the date of this Agreement, the Company will provide Employee with office space and shared administrative support at an office location in downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania selected by the Company.  The Company will also, for a period of one-year following the date of this Agreement, forward emails received for Employee on the Company's email system to a personal email address provided by Employee to Company.
 
5.         During the Term, Employee will continue to receive service credit for purposes of calculating the value of the Medical Spending Account.
 
6.         Employee shall not be eligible to participate during the Term in the Company's life insurance and disability insurance programs, 401(k) Plan, ESPP, or any other retirement or welfare benefit programs or perquisites of the Company.  Likewise, Employee shall not be eligible during the Term for any paid vacation, paid holidays or car allowance.
 
7.         During the Term, Employee shall not be eligible to receive bonus payments under any short-term incentive plans of the Company, and he shall not be eligible to receive any new grants under the Company's long-term incentive plans, programs or arrangements.
 
8.         During the Term, the Company shall continue to pay for Employee's Blackberry (or its equivalent) service and shall provide reasonable access to the Company's Help Desk; provided, however, if the provision of such service will result in taxable income to Employee, then no such taxable service shall be provided until the first day following the six-month anniversary of Employee's separation from service if Employee is a specified employee at the time of separation from service, all within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.
 
9.         During the Term, Employee shall maintain an ownership level of Company stock equal to not less than one-half of the value last required as a full-time Employee.  In the event that at any time during the Term Employee does not maintain the required ownership level, Employee shall promptly notify the Company and increase his ownership to at least the required level.  Any failure of Employee to maintain at least the required ownership level for more than three months during the Term shall constitute and be deemed to be an immediate termination by Employee of his Executive Alternative Work Arrangement.
10.       This Agreement sets forth all of the payments, benefits, perquisites and entitlements to which Employee shall be entitled upon assuming Executive Alternative Work Arrangement employment status.  Employee shall not be entitled to receive any gross-up payments for any taxes or other amounts with respect to amounts payable under this Agreement.
 
11.       Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or prohibit the Company from modifying any of its employee benefits plans, programs, or policies.
 
The covenants as to non-competition and non-solicitation contained in Section 1 of the Confidentiality, Non-Solicitation and Non-Competition Agreement between the Company and Employee dated September 8, 2008 (hereinafter the "Non-Competition Agreement") and in paragraph 8 of the Change of Control Agreement dated September 8, 2008 ("Change of Control Agreement) shall remain in effect through the later of January 3, 2014 and one year after the date Employee ceases to serve on the Company's Board of Directors.
12.       . 
Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation
 
13.       .  Employee acknowledges and agrees that Employee's employment by the Company necessarily involves Employee's knowledge of and access to confidential and proprietary information pertaining to the business of the Company and its subsidiaries.  Accordingly, Employee agrees that at all times during the term of this Agreement and for as long as the information remains confidential after the termination of Employee's employment, Employee will not, directly or indirectly, without the express written authority of the Company (unless directed by applicable legal authority having jurisdiction over Employee) disclose to or use, or knowingly permit to be so disclosed or used, for the benefit of Employee, any person, corporation or other entity other than the Company and its subsidiaries (i) any information concerning any financial matters, customer relationships, competitive status, supplier matters, internal organizational matters, current or future plans, or other business affairs of or relating to the Company and its subsidiaries; (ii) any management, operational, trade, technical or other secrets or any other proprietary information or other data of the Company or its subsidiaries; or (iii) any other information related to the Company or its subsidiaries which has not been published and is not generally known outside of the Company.  Employee acknowledges that all of the foregoing constitutes confidential and proprietary information, which is the exclusive property of the Company.
Confidential Information and Non-Disclosure
 
14.       The Company may terminate this Agreement and Employee's employment at any time for Cause.  Solely for purposes of this Agreement, "Cause" shall mean:
 
15.       It is understood and agreed that upon Employee's discontinuation of full-time employment and transition to Executive Alternative Work Arrangement employment status hereunder, Employee has no continuing rights under the Change of Control Agreement or under Section 3 of the Non-Competition Agreement, and that otherwise the Change of Control Agreement (except for Sections 8 and 11) and Section 3 of the Non-Competition Agreement shall have no further force or effect.
 
16.       The provisions of this Agreement are severable.  To the extent that any provision of this Agreement is deemed unenforceable in any court of law, the parties intend that such provision be construed by such court in a manner to make it enforceable.
 
17.       This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the Company.
 
18.       This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania without regard to conflict of law principles.
 
19.       This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings between the Company and Employee with respect to the subject matter hereof (oral or written), including but not limited to the Change of Control Agreement and Section 3 of the Non-Competition Agreement.  It is understood and agreed, however, that the covenants as to non-competition, non-solicitation and confidentiality contained in Sections 1-2 of the Non-Competition Agreement and in Section 8 of the Change of Control Agreement remain in effect as modified herein, along with the provisions in Sections 4-8 of the Non-Competition Agreement and Section 11 of the Change of Control Agreement.  It is further understood and agreed that the parties shall have no obligations under, and each party forfeits all rights in connection with, the Original Form Agreement.
 
20.       This Agreement may not be changed, amended, or modified except by a written instrument signed by both parties, provided that the Company may amend this Agreement from time to time without Employee's consent to the extent deemed necessary or appropriate, in its sole discretion, to effect compliance with Section 409A of the Code, including regulations and interpretations thereunder, which amendments may result in a reduction of benefits provided hereunder and/or other unfavorable changes to Employee.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement on the dates set forth below.

Exhibit 10.2
.  The main purposes of the EQT Corporation (the "Company") Executive Short-Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan") are to maintain a competitive level of total cash compensation and to align the interests of the Company's executive employees with those of the Company's shareholders and customers and with the strategic objectives of the Company.  By placing a portion of executive employee compensation at risk, the Company can reward performance based on the overall performance of the Company.

On an annual basis, the Committee shall designate the participants and determine the Performance Goals, as defined in Section 5 of the Plan, and the Incentive Targets, as defined in Section 6 of the Plan.  Prior to payment of any Incentive Awards, as defined in Section 6 of the Plan, the Committee shall certify in writing that the Performance Goals and other material terms were satisfied, which writing may include meeting minutes of the Committee.

Section 4.
                                  
Administration of the Plan
 
.
Section 5.
                                  
Performance Goals
 
Each participant shall have specific performance goals (the "Performance Goals") determined for his or her position for the subject Plan Year.  These Performance Goals will support the approved business plan of the Company, affiliate or business unit, as applicable, and be based upon the specific performance measures established by the Committee for the Plan Year.
(a)
                              
 
A copy of each participant's Performance Goals shall be determined in writing by the Committee not later than 90 days after the commencement of the Plan Year to which they relate; provided that in no event will Performance Goals be established after 25 percent of the Plan Year has elapsed or when the outcome of such Performance Goals is no longer substantially uncertain.
(b)
                             
 
The Performance Goals determined by the Committee will be objectively determinable goals based upon one or more of the following performance measures: earnings per share, earnings per share growth, revenue growth, revenues, expenses, return on equity, return on total capital, return on assets, earnings (such as net income, EBIT and similar measures), earnings growth, cash flow (such as EBITDA, EBITDAX and similar measures), share price, economic value added, gross margin, operating income, volumes metrics (such as volumes sold, volumes produced, volumes transported and similar measures), drilling and well metrics (such as number of gross or net wells drilled, number of horizontal wells drilled, cost per well and similar measures), reserve metrics, operating efficiency metrics (such as lease operating expense and other unit operating expense measures, general & administrative expense ("G&A") per mcf, marketing expense per mcf, G&A per customer and other G&A metrics, unit gathering and compression expenses and other midstream efficiency measures, lost and unaccounted for gas metrics, compressor or processing downtime, days from completed well to flowing gas and similar measures), customer services measures (such as wait time, on-time service, calls answered and similar measures), safety and environmental performance or total shareholder return.  The Performance Goals may be based either on the performance of the Company, a subsidiary or subsidiaries or other affiliates, any branch, department, business unit, or other portion thereof under such measure for the Plan Year and/or upon a comparison of such performance with the performance of a peer group of corporations, prior Company performance or other comparative measure selected by the Committee at the time of making an Incentive Award.  Performance Goals may be specified in absolute terms, in percentages, or in terms of growth from period to period or growth rates over time, as well as measured relative to the performance of a group of comparator companies, or a published or special index, or a stock market index, that the Committee deems appropriate. Performance Goals need not be based upon an increase or positive result under a business criterion and could include, for example, the maintenance of the status quo or the limitation of economic losses (measured, in each case, by reference to a specific business criterion).
(c)
                              
 
When the Performance Goals are determined by the Committee, the Committee shall specify the manner in which the Performance Goals shall be calculated and may also determine that unusual items or certain specified events or occurrences, including changes in accounting standards or tax laws, shall be excluded from the calculation of the Performance Goal.
(d)
                             
 
.
Section 6.
                                  
Incentive Targets and Awards
 
Incentive compensation targets ("Incentive Targets") shall be determined by the Committee in writing not later than 90 days after the commencement of each Plan Year.  The Incentive Targets shall be based upon the level of achievement of the Performance Goals.  Incentive Targets may be expressed as a range of outcomes, such as "threshold," "target" and "maximum," based on the level of achievement of the Performance Goals.
(a)
                              
 
Incentive awards ("Incentive Awards") may be earned by participants during a Plan Year; provided, however, that payment of any Incentive Award under the Plan to a participant (i) shall be contingent upon the attainment of the Performance Goals established by the Committee for the Plan Year and (ii) may not exceed the participant's maximum Incentive Target established for the actual level of achievement attained.
(b)
                             
The Committee shall have no discretion to increase any Incentive Award that would otherwise be payable based upon attainment of the Performance Goals, but the Committee may in its discretion reduce or eliminate such Incentive Award; provided, however, that the exercise of such negative discretion shall not be permitted to result in any increase in the amount of any Incentive Award payable to any other participant.
(c)
                              
 
The maximum Incentive Award payable to any participant for any Plan Year is $5,000,000.
(d)
                             
 
Except as provided in Section 7 of the Plan, Incentive Awards shall be paid in cash within 2 months after the end of a Plan Year in which the right to payment is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture; provided, further, that the Committee has determined and certified in writing the extent to which the Performance Goals have been attained and the Incentive Awards have been earned.
(e)
                              
 
.  The Committee may, in its discretion, determine to satisfy, in whole or in part, an obligation for any Incentive Award by issuing, in substitution for a cash payment, shares of Company common stock having a fair market value (measured as of the date of the Committee's determination of the payment amount) equal to the cash payment, under and pursuant to the terms of the Company's 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan, or any successor or substitute plan.
Section 7.
                                  
Form of Payment
 
.  Payments under the Plan shall not be considered as earnings for purposes of the Company's qualified retirement plans or any such retirement or benefit plan unless specifically provided for and defined under such plans or as otherwise determined by the Committee.
Section 8.
                                  
Impact on Benefit Plans
 
.
Section 9.
                                  
Tax Consequences
 
It is intended that nothing in this Plan shall cause the participants in the Plan to be taxed currently under the Constructive Receipt or Economic Benefit Doctrines and as expressed in Sections 451 and 83 of the Code. The terms, requirements and limitations of this Plan shall be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with such intent.
(a)
                              
 
It is intended that the Incentive Awards payable under the Plan shall be exempt from the deduction limits of Section 162(m) of the Code as performance-based compensation.  The terms, requirements and limitations of this Plan shall be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with such intent.
(b)
                             
 
It is intended that the Incentive Awards payable under the Plan shall either be exempt from the application of, or comply with, the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.  The Plan shall be construed in a manner that effects such intent.  Nevertheless, the tax treatment of the benefits provided under the Plan or any Incentive Award is not warranted or guaranteed.  None of the Company, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees or advisers shall be held liable for any taxes, interest, penalties or other monetary amounts owed by any participant or other taxpayer as a result of the Plan or any Incentive Award.
(c)
                              
 
Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, to the extent that any Incentive Award would constitute non-exempt "deferred compensation" for purposes of Section 409A of the Code and would be payable or distributable
(d)
                             
under the Plan by reason of the occurrence of a Change of Control, or the participant's disability or separation from service, such amount or benefit will not be payable or distributable to the participant by reason of such circumstance unless the circumstances giving rise to such Change of Control, disability or separation from service meet any description or definition of "change in control event", "disability" or "separation from service", as the case may be, in Section 409A of the Code and applicable regulations (without giving effect to any elective provisions that may be available under such definition).  This provision does not prohibit the vesting of any Incentive Award upon a change of control, disability or separation from service, however defined.  If this provision prevents the payment or distribution of any Incentive Award, such Incentive Award shall be made on the payment date that would have applied absent such designated event or circumstance.
 
Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, to the extent that any Incentive Award would constitute non-exempt "deferred compensation" for purposes of Section 409A of the Code and would otherwise be payable under this Plan by reason of a participant's separation from service during a period in which the participant is a Specified Employee (as defined below), then, subject to any permissible acceleration of payment by the Committee under Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ii) (domestic relations order), (j)(4)(iii) (conflicts of interest), or (j)(4)(vi) (payment of employment taxes): (i) the amount of such non-exempt deferred compensation that would otherwise be payable during the six-month period immediately following the participant's separation from service will be accumulated through and paid or provided on the first day of the seventh month following the participant's separation from service (or, if the participant dies during such period, within 30 days after the participant's death) (in either case, the "Required Delay Period"); and (ii) the normal payment or distribution schedule for any remaining payments or distributions will resume at the end of the Required Delay Period.  For purposes of this Plan, the term "Specified Employee" has the meaning given such term in Code Section 409A and the final regulations thereunder, , that, as permitted in such final regulations, the Company's Specified Employees and its application of the six-month delay rule of Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) shall be determined in accordance with rules adopted by the Board or any committee of the Board, which shall be applied consistently with respect to all nonqualified deferred compensation arrangements of the Company, including this Plan.
(e)
                              
provided, however
 
.  In making decisions regarding employees' participation in the Plan, the Committee may consider any factors that they may consider relevant.  The following guidelines are provided as general guidelines regarding employee status changes:
Section 10.
                          
Change of Status
 
.  A newly hired employee qualifying for participation will participate in the Plan Year following the year in which he or she is hired, unless otherwise specified in the employment offer.  An employee who is promoted or transferred during the first 90 day period of the Plan Year to a position qualifying for participation may be recommended for a pro rata Incentive Award under the Plan based on the level of participation in his or her previous annual incentive program and the percentage of the Plan Year the employee is in the participating position under this Plan.  This includes employees who leave positions that qualify for incentive payments in other Company business segments.  These potential payments shall be considered when determining the employee's Incentive Target and Incentive Award under this Plan; provided, however, that no amounts of deferred compensation under other plans and
(a)
                              
New Hire, Transfer, Promotion
arrangements may be substituted for or in respect of amounts payable under the Plan.
 
.  No Incentive Award shall be paid to an employee who has been demoted during the Plan Year because of performance.  If the demotion is due to an organizational change, a pro rata Incentive Award may be made, provided the employee otherwise qualifies for payment of an Incentive Award.
(b)
                             
Demotion
 
.  No Incentive Award shall be paid to any employee whose services are terminated during the Plan Year for reasons of misconduct, failure to perform, or other cause.  If the termination is due to reasons such as reorganization, and not due to the fault of the employee, the employee may be considered for a pro rata Incentive Award, provided the employee otherwise qualifies for payment of an Incentive Award.
(c)
                              
Termination
 
.  No Incentive Award shall be paid to an employee who resigns for any reason before Incentive Awards are paid; provided, however, if the employee has voluntarily terminated his or her employment with the Company's consent a pro rata Incentive Award may be made, provided the employee otherwise qualifies for payment of an Incentive Award.
(d)
                             
Resignation
 
.  An employee whose status as an active employee is changed during the Plan Year for any reason other than the reasons cited above, including termination for death or disability, may be considered for a pro rata Incentive Award, provided the employee otherwise qualifies for payment of an Incentive Award.  In the event that an Incentive Award is paid on behalf of an employee who has terminated employment by reason of death, any such payments or other amounts due shall be paid to the employee's estate.
(e)
                              
Death and Disability
 
Nothing in the Plan or in any Incentive Target or Incentive Award shall confer any right on any employee to continue in the employ of the Company, its affiliates or any business unit.  In the event any payments are made under the guidelines provided in this Section 10, the timing of such payments shall be in accordance with the provisions of Section 6(e) or, if applicable, Section 9(e).
 
.  In the event of a Change of Control of the Company, as then defined under the Company's 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan, or its successor, the Plan Year shall end on the date of the Change of Control, the Performance Goals shall be deemed to have been achieved for the pro-rata portion of the calendar year that elapsed through the date of the Change of Control, at target levels or, if, actual performance is greater, at actual levels.  In such event, any Incentive Awards earned shall be paid to participants on such pro-rata basis in accordance with the provisions of Section 6(e) or, if applicable, Section 9(d), but subject to the Committee's overall discretion as provided in Section 6(c).
Section 11.
                          
Change of Control
 
..  Any Incentive Awards paid to participants hereunder shall be subject to the terms and conditions of any compensation recoupment policy adopted from time to time by the Board or any committee of the Board, to the extent such policy is applicable to annual incentive compensation.
Section 12
                          
Compensation Recoupment Policy
 
.  The following is the exclusive procedure to be followed by all participants in resolving disputes arising from payments made under this Plan.  All disputes relative to a given Plan Year must be presented to the Committee within thirty (30) days following the payment date of the Incentive Award for that Plan Year, or the participant's right to dispute a payment will be irrevocably waived.  The employee with the concern will be
Section 13.
                          
Dispute Resolution
given an opportunity to present his or her issues to the Committee.  A decision will be rendered by the Committee within thirty (30) business days of the meeting.  The Chairperson of the Committee will be responsible for preparing a written version of the decision.  The decision by the Committee regarding the matter is final and binding on all Plan participants.
 
.  The Company's Board of Directors and the Committee shall each have the right to amend or terminate the Plan at any time, provided, however, that the material terms of the Performance Goals, including any amendments to the class of employees eligible to receive compensation pursuant to, or participate in, the Plan, the criteria upon which the Performance Goals are based and the maximum amount of compensation payable to any employee hereunder, may not be amended without shareholder approval.  No employee or participant shall have any vested right, interest or entitlement to any Incentive Award hereunder prior to its payment.  The Company shall notify affected employees in writing of any amendment or Plan termination.
