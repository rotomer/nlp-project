On October 20, 2011, EQT Corporation (the "Company") received from Barbara S. Jeremiah, a director of the Company, written notice that she will not stand for re-election as a director of the Company when her current term expires at the Company's next annual meeting in April 2012. Ms. Jeremiah's determination was not the result of any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company's operations, policies or practices.  Ms. Jeremiah does, however, believe that all boards should periodically have the planned opportunity to introduce new members with different perspectives and experiences.
