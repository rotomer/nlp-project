Cash. 
 
At the closing of the transaction, Peoples will transfer certain natural gas midstream assets (the "") to EQT, including certain equipment upgrades to be completed by Peoples prior to closing.  To effect this transfer, EQT and Peoples have entered into an Asset Exchange Agreement whereby EQT will receive the Midstream Assets in exchange for its and its subsidiaries' interests in certain of the assets of Equitable Gas (the "").  The parties intend to treat this transaction as a like-kind exchange for U.S. federal income tax purposes in accordance with Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code.
                
Assets. 
Midstream Assets
Asset Exchange Agreement
 
Simultaneously with the execution of the Master Purchase Agreement and Asset Exchange Agreement, EQT (or, where applicable, affiliates of EQT) and Peoples (or, where applicable, affiliates of Peoples) have entered into a suite of commercial agreements, including, but not limited to, gas transportation agreements, gas transportation and storage agreements, and a gas purchase and sales agreement, pursuant to which EQT will provide gas transmission and storage services and supply natural gas to Peoples.  At the closing of the transaction, subject to the terms and conditions of the Master Purchase Agreement, EQT (or, where applicable, affiliates of EQT) and Peoples (or, where applicable, affiliates of Peoples) will, among other things, (i) enter into a gas purchase and sales agreement pursuant to which EQT will supply natural gas to Equitable Gas, (ii) extend the term of existing gas transportation and storage agreements pursuant to which EQT provides gas transportation and storage services to Equitable Gas, and (iii) enter into a transition services agreement.
                
Commercial arrangements. 
 
The transfer of Equitable Gas and Homeworks and the receipt of the Midsteam Assets are cross-conditioned, such that neither transaction will occur unless both transactions can be completed.  The transactions are subject to various customary conditions, including clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act, receipt of the approval of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, the West Virginia Public Service Commission and the Kentucky Public Service Commission, and issuance to EQT of a certificate from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission with respect to the Midstream Assets.  The parties expect to receive the required approvals by the end of the fourth quarter of 2013.
 
 
The Master Purchase Agreement and the Asset Exchange Agreement contain certain customary representations and warranties between EQT and Holdco, on the one hand, and PNG Companies, on the other. The parties have also agreed to a variety of customary covenants and agreements, including, among other things, that during the period between the execution of the Master Purchase Agreement and Asset Exchange Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by these agreements, (i) Equitable Gas and Homeworks will conduct their respective businesses, and PNG Companies will operate the Midstream Assets, in the ordinary course consistent with past practice and (ii) Equitable Gas, Homeworks, and with respect to Midstream Assets, PNG Companies, will not engage in certain kinds of transactions.
 
The representations, warranties and covenants made by EQT, Holdco and PNG Companies in the Master Purchase Agreement and the Asset Exchange Agreement are qualified by, among other things, information in disclosure schedules that the parties delivered to one another in connection with the execution of the Master Purchase Agreement and the Asset Exchange Agreement.  Representations and warranties may be used as a tool to allocate risks between the parties to the Master Purchase Agreement and Asset Exchange Agreement, including where the parties do not have complete knowledge of all facts.  As a consequence, investors and others should not rely on the representations, warranties or covenants as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of EQT, Holdco, Equitable Gas, Homeworks, PNG Companies or Peoples.
 
The foregoing description of the Master Purchase Agreement and the Asset Exchange Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such documents, which are filed as Exhibit 2.1 and Exhibit 2.2 to this report and incorporated herein by reference.

Governing Law
 
This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to the choice of law principles thereof.  Each Party consents to personal jurisdiction in any action brought in any court, federal or state, within the State of Delaware having subject matter jurisdiction arising under this Agreement, and each of the Parties hereto agrees that any action instituted by either of them against the other with respect to this Agreement will be instituted exclusively in a court, federal or state, within the State of Delaware.
(a)
                                                      
 
Each of the Parties to this Agreement irrevocably waives any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
(b)
                                                     
 
Each Party to this Agreement waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to receive damages from any other Party based on any theory of liability for any special, indirect, consequential (including lost profits), exemplary or punitive damages.
(c)
                                                      
 
.  Each of PNG and EQT acknowledges and agrees that in the event of any breach of this Agreement by EQT, PNG would be irreparably and immediately harmed and could not be made whole by monetary damages.  It is accordingly agreed that (a) EQT will waive, in any action for specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at Law and (b) PNG shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled at Law or in equity, to compel specific performance of this Agreement and to injunctive relief, and EQT further agrees to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any such specific performance or injunctive relief.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that PNG shall be entitled to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches of or enforce compliance with those covenants of EQT that require EQT to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. PNG's pursuit of specific performance at any time will not be deemed an election of remedies or waiver of the right to pursue any other right or remedy to which PNG may be entitled, including the right to pursue remedies for liabilities or damages incurred or suffered by PNG in the case of a breach of this Agreement involving fraud or willful or intentional misconduct. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement or otherwise, PNG shall have no rights by virtue of this provision or otherwise to any remedy by any of EQT's lenders, investors, Affiliates, or other Persons not party to this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
PITTSBURGH, PA
(December 20, 2012) -- EQT Corporation (NYSE: EQT) today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement for the transfer of its natural gas distribution business, Equitable Gas Company, LLC, to Peoples Natural Gas.  As part of the transaction, EQT will receive cash proceeds of $720 million, subject to certain purchase price adjustments, and select midstream assets and commercial arrangements, which are expected to generate at least $40 million in EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) per year.
 
Concurrent with this announcement, EQT will also reduce its annual dividend, effective January 2013.  The new dividend rate of $0.12 per share reflects the blend of EQT's two remaining core businesses  a dividend-supporting midstream business, and a capital-intensive, rapidly growing production business.
 
"Today's announcement allows us to focus on and reinvest in our rapidly growing natural gas production and midstream businesses. The proposed transaction provides capital to accelerate the monetization of our reserves beyond 2013 and also adds to our Marcellus midstream assets," stated David Porges, Chief Executive Officer of EQT Corporation.
 
As part of the transaction, EQT will receive approximately 200 miles of regulated transmission pipelines, as well as four storage pools that have a total of 15.1 Bcf working gas capacity.  These assets are strategically located across multiple counties in Pennsylvania and connect to EQT's existing transmission assets, which will increase the Company's transportation and storage capabilities.
 
Peoples Gas has also agreed to enter long-term contracts for gas transmission, supply, and storage services with EQT. These agreements will secure supply of local, Marcellus gas of approximately 35 Bcf per year to Peoples.
 
Morgan O'Brien, President and CEO of Peoples Natural Gas states, "The combined utility will yield substantial benefits to the Western Pennsylvania community by creating significant operational efficiencies, relative to the pipeline systems; promoting greater competition for gas marketers; and continuing to support local gas producers."  O'Brien continues, "Combining the companies' respective pipeline systems will result in a more streamlined and efficient operating system for customers.  Furthermore, the greater aggregation of customers will be more attractive to marketers and is expected to attract more marketers that will create greater competition for customers' supply needs."
 
Equitable Gas provides natural gas distribution services to approximately 275,000 customers in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Kentucky; and owns approximately 4,000 miles of pipeline.
 
The transaction requires regulatory approvals from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, West Virginia Public Service Commission, Kentucky Public Service Commission, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; and is also subject to review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.  EQT expects to receive the required approvals by the end of 2013.  Therefore, this transaction will not impact EQT's previously announced 2013 capital program.
 
EQT will host a brief teleconference with security analysts beginning at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time today.  EQT's teleconference with security analysts will be webcast live via www.eqt.com, and will be available for replay on the website for seven days.
 
Lazard Freres & Co. LLC acted as a financial advisor to EQT on this transaction.  Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP; Baker Botts L.L.P.; and Bracewell & Giuliani LLP were counsel to EQT on the transaction.

Cautionary Statements
Disclosures in this press release contain certain forward looking statements. Words such as "may,"  "will," "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe," "target," "forecast," and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future plans, actions, or events identify forward-looking statements. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, forward-looking statements contained in this press release specifically include, but are not limited to, statements regarding: plans, strategies, and objectives of the transaction; guidance regarding the expected form and amount of assets to be exchanged for Equitable Gas Company, LLC; the expected EBITDA to be generated from the midstream assets and commercial arrangements transferred by or entered into with Peoples Natural Gas; uses of capital provided by the transaction, including the impact to EQT's 2013 capital program; the timing of receipt of required approvals; and the expected amount and timing of the reduction to EQT's dividend. EQT has based these forward-looking statements on current expectations and assumptions about future events.  These statements are not guaranties of future performance or events and are subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond EQT's control; that could cause actual results to differ materially from projected results. With respect to the proposed transaction, these risks and uncertainties include, among others, the ability to obtain regulatory approvals for the transaction on the proposed terms and schedule; disruption to EQT's business, including customer, employee and supplier relationships resulting from the transaction; risks that the conditions to closing may not be satisfied; and impact of the transaction on EQT's future operating income, 2013 capital program and dividend.   Additional risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those set forth under Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of EQT's Form 10-K filed for the year ended December 31, 2011, as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs.
EQT is unable to provide a reconciliation of projected EBITDA to projected net income, the most comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, due to the unknown effect, timing and potential significance of certain income statement items.
 
EBITDA is defined as operating income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization expense less gains on dispositions; and is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). EBITDA is a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure that Company management and external users of the Company's financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, may use to assess: (i) the Company's performance versus prior periods; (ii) the Company's operating performance as compared to other companies in its industry; (iii) the ability of the Company's assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to its investors; (iv) the Company's ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and (v) the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.
 
Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and EQT undertakes no obligation to correct or update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
