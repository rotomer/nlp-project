Exhibit 99.1
On July 20, 2011, Express Scripts, Inc. ("ESI") entered into a definitive merger agreement (the "Merger Agreement") with Medco, which was amended by Amendment No. 1 thereto on November 7, 2011, providing for the combination of ESI and Medco Health Solutions, Inc. ("Medco") under a new holding company, Express Scripts Holding Company ("Express Scripts"). The transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the "Mergers") were consummated on April 2, 2012. For financial reporting and accounting purposes, ESI was the acquirer of Medco.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations presented below is derived from the historical statements of operations of ESI and Medco, adjusted to give effect to the Mergers and the financing transactions entered into in order to fund the Mergers (the "Related Financing Transactions"). The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations should be read in conjunction with the historical audited financial statements and accompanying notes of ESI and Medco for the year ended December 31, 2011.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 gives effect to the Mergers and the Related Financing Transactions as if they had occurred on the first day of that period.
The pro forma adjustments are preliminary and have been made solely for informational purposes. The actual results reported by the combined company in periods following the Mergers may differ significantly from that reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for a number of reasons, including but not limited to cost savings from operating efficiencies, synergies and the impact of the incremental costs incurred in integrating the two companies. As a result, the pro forma condensed combined statement of operations is not intended to represent and does not purport to be indicative of what the combined company's results of operations would have been had the Mergers and the Related Financing Transactions been completed on the applicable dates of this pro forma condensed combined statement of operations. In addition, the pro forma condensed combined statement of operations does not purport to project the future results of operations of the combined company.
The pro forma condensed combined statement of operations is based on various assumptions, including assumptions relating to the allocation of consideration paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Medco based on preliminary estimates of fair value. The pro forma assumptions and adjustments are described in the accompanying notes presented on the following pages. Pro forma adjustments are those that are directly attributable to the transaction, are factually supportable and are expected to have a continuing impact on the consolidated results. The final purchase price allocation may differ from that reflected in the pro forma condensed combined statement of operations after final valuation procedures are performed and estimates are refined.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations does not reflect any cost savings from operating efficiencies, synergies or other restructurings that could result from the Mergers.
 
 
 
Note 1Basis of Presentation
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations was prepared using the acquisition method of accounting and was based on the historical audited financial statements of ESI and Medco as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011. ESI's historical information for the year ended December 31, 2011 represents a calendar year beginning on January 1, 2011, while Medco's historical financial information for 2011 represents a fiscal year of 53 weeks beginning on December 26, 2010. Certain reclassifications have been made to the historical financial statements of Medco to conform to Express Scripts' presentation, including the presentation of claims and rebates payable as a separate line item from accounts payable and condensing Medco's receivable balances into one line item. Additionally, Medco's product revenues and service revenues have been combined into a single line item and amortization of intangibles has been included in selling, general and administrative expenses to conform to Express Scripts' presentation. Finally, the following adjustments have been made to Medco's revenues, cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expense:
 
 
 
The acquisition method of accounting is based on authoritative guidance for business combinations and uses the fair value concepts defined in authoritative guidance. We prepared the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations using the acquisition method of accounting under these existing U.S. GAAP standards.
The pro forma adjustments described below have been developed based on assumptions and estimates, including assumptions relating to the allocation of consideration paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Medco based on preliminary estimates of fair value. The final purchase price allocation may differ from that reflected in the pro forma condensed combined statement of operations after final valuation procedures are performed and amounts are finalized.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations is provided for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what the actual consolidated results of operations of Express Scripts would have been had the Mergers and the Related Financing Transactions occurred on the dates assumed, nor is it necessarily indicative of future consolidated results of operations.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations does not reflect any cost savings from operating efficiencies, synergies or other restructurings that could result from the Mergers.
ESI has been determined to be the acquirer under the acquisition method of accounting based on various considerations. Upon closing of the Mergers, ESI stockholders own approximately 59% of the combined company and Medco stockholders own approximately 41%. Additionally, Express Scripts transferred cash and issued common stock as the merger consideration to Medco stockholders. Further, the Board of Directors and senior management of Express Scripts are comprised primarily of ESI board members and senior management, respectively.
Express Scripts performed a review of Medco's accounting policies, to determine whether any adjustments were necessary to ensure comparability in the pro forma condensed combined statement of operations. At this time, Express Scripts is not aware of any unadjusted differences that would have a material impact on the pro forma condensed combined statement of operations.
Note 2Preliminary Purchase Price
The total consideration for the transaction is $30.1 billion, composed of $74.56 per share in cash and Express Scripts' stock (valued based on the opening price of Express Scripts stock on April 2, 2012, the closing date), including $28.80 in cash and 0.81 shares for each Medco share outstanding. The purchase price for the business combination is estimated as follows:
 
 
 
Note 3Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation
The combined company allocated the purchase price paid by ESI to the fair value of the Medco assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition. Express Scripts retained third-party valuation advisors to conduct analyses of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to assist in the determination of the preliminary purchase price allocation. The preliminary purchase price allocation may be subject to further refinement and may result in significant changes. These changes will primarily relate to the fair value of obligations acquired. Express Scripts expects that if any refinements become necessary, they will be completed by April 2013. There can be no assurance that such finalization will not result in material changes.
The estimated intangible assets are comprised of customer contracts with an estimated weighted average useful life of 16 years trade names with an estimated weighted average useful life of 10 years and miscellaneous intangible assets with an estimated weighted average useful life of 5 years, which is consistent with the estimated benefit period. The residual amount of the purchase price after preliminary allocation to identifiable intangibles has been allocated to goodwill. The actual amounts recorded when the final valuation is complete may differ materially from the amounts presented below (in millions):
 
 
Note 4Unaudited Pro Forma Adjustments
Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statement of Operations
(A) Revenues and Cost of revenues
Adjustments have been included in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations to eliminate $348.5 million revenues and cost of revenues from transactions between ESI and Medco. ESI's and Medco's pharmacies may be included in the pharmacy networks of the other respective company in order to fulfill members' prescriptions for certain drugs that are under limited or exclusive distribution contracts with manufacturers.
(B) Selling, general and administrative
 
 
(C) Interest Expense
For the purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations, ESI partially funded the Mergers through drawing $4.0 billion under the Term Loan Facility, drawing $0.4 billion under the Revolving Loan Facility, and using the approximately $7.6 billion of net proceeds from Senior Notes issued by Express Scripts in November 2011 and February 2012 for $4.1 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively. Subsequent to the Merger, Express Scripts paid off the $0.4 billion under the Revolving Loan Facility and pays quarterly principal payments on the Term Loan Facility. The estimated interest rates for the Revolving Loan Facility and the Term Loan Facility were calculated using the prime rate plus a margin of 0.55% and 0.75%, respectively, based on ESI's consolidated leverage ratio as of December 31, 2011. Adjustments have also been made for the historical interest expense related to Medco's $2.0 billion of debt outstanding under its unsecured credit agreements that was repaid at the closing of the Mergers.
 
The adjustment to interest expense reflects the following (in millions):
 
(D) Income taxes
The pro forma condensed combined income tax provision has been adjusted for the tax effect of adjustments to income before income taxes at the estimated blended effective rate for the periods presented as the effective rate approximates the statutory rate for the periods presented. The effective tax rate of the combined company could be significantly different depending on post-acquisition activities.
(E) Basic and diluted shares
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined basic and diluted earnings per share calculations are based on the combined basic and diluted weighted-average shares. The historical basic and diluted weighted average shares of Medco are assumed to be replaced by the shares issued by Express Scripts at an exchange ratio of 0.81 per Medco share for purposes of determining the pro forma weighted average shares for Express Scripts. In periods following consummation of the Mergers, basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding may differ from the amounts used in these pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for various reasons, including but not limited to the impact of share repurchases that occurred in 2011, the exercise of stock options and settlement of restricted stock units, and differences in the dilutive impact of awards granted under either of ESI's or Medco's share-based compensation arrangements.
 

Exhibit 99.2
On July 20, 2011, Express Scripts, Inc. ("ESI") entered into a definitive merger agreement (the "Merger Agreement") with Medco, which was amended by Amendment No. 1 thereto on November 7, 2011, providing for the combination of ESI and Medco Health Solutions, Inc. ("Medco") under a new holding company, Express Scripts Holding Company ("Express Scripts"). The transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the "Mergers") were consummated on April 2, 2012. For financial reporting and accounting purposes, ESI was the acquirer of Medco.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations presented below is derived from the historical statements of operations of Express Scripts and Medco, adjusted to give effect to the Mergers and the financing transactions entered into in order to fund the Mergers (the "Related Financing Transactions"). The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations should be read in conjunction with the historical audited financial statements and accompanying notes of ESI and Medco for the year ended December 31, 2011 and the historical unaudited financial statements of Express Scripts as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and Medco as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2012.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 gives effect to the Mergers and the Related Financing Transactions as if they had occurred on the first day of that period.
The pro forma adjustments are preliminary and have been made solely for informational purposes. The actual results reported by the combined company in periods following the Mergers may differ significantly from that reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for a number of reasons, including but not limited to cost savings from operating efficiencies, synergies and the impact of the incremental costs incurred in integrating the two companies. As a result, the pro forma condensed combined statement of operations is not intended to represent and does not purport to be indicative of what the combined company's results of operations would have been had the Mergers and the Related Financing Transactions been completed on the applicable dates of this pro forma condensed combined statement of operations. In addition, the pro forma condensed combined statement of operations does not purport to project the future results of operations of the combined company.
The pro forma condensed combined statement of operations is based on various assumptions, including assumptions relating to the allocation of consideration paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Medco based on preliminary estimates of fair value. The pro forma assumptions and adjustments are described in the accompanying notes presented on the following pages. Pro forma adjustments are those that are directly attributable to the transaction, are factually supportable and are expected to have a continuing impact on the consolidated results. The final purchase price allocation may differ from that reflected in the pro forma condensed combined statement of operations after final valuation procedures are performed and estimates are refined.
