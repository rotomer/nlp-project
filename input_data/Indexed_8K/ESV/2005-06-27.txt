Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On June 23, 2005, ENSCO International Incorporated (the "Company") amended and restated its existing $250 million Credit Agreement with a syndicate of lenders. The amended and restated agreement (the "2005 Credit Facility" or "Amended and Restated Credit Agreement") provides for a $350 million unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes. In consideration of the Company issuing a guaranty (the "Guaranty") in favor of the Administrative Agent, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, ENSCO Offshore International Company ("EOIC"), was also added as a Borrower, with a sublimit of $200 million for borrowings and letters of credit. The 2005 Credit Facility has a five-year term, expiring June 23, 2010, and replaces the Company's $250 million five-year Credit Agreement that was scheduled to mature on July 26, 2007. Advances under the 2005 Credit Facility bear interest at the Administrative Agent's base rate or at the LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin rate depending on the Company's credit rating. The Company pays an undrawn facility fee on the total $350 million commitment, which is also based on the Company's credit rating, and pays an additional utilization fee on outstanding advances if such advances exceed 50% of the total $350 million commitment. The Company is required to maintain certain financial covenants, including a specified level of interest coverage, and debt to total capitalization ratio. The Company also has the right to increase the commitments under the 2005 Credit Facility to an aggregate amount of up to $500 million. A copy of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and a copy of the Guaranty are attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and Exhibit 10.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.

1. . The Guarantor unconditionally guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether upon maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations (now or hereafter existing) of EOIC under the Credit Agreement, whether for principal, interest, fees, expenses or otherwise, in each case strictly in accordance with the terms thereof (all such obligations being the ""); provided that, if any Obligations are denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars, such amount will be increased to the extent that fluctuations of currency conversion rates occurring after the date hereof result in an increase in the equivalent of such Obligations in U.S. Dollars. If EOIC fails to pay any Obligation in full when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), the Guarantor will promptly pay the same to the Administrative Agent. The Guarantor will also pay to the Administrative Agent any and all expenses (including without limitation, reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by the Administrative Agent or any Bank in enforcing its rights under this Guaranty. This Guaranty is a guaranty of payment and not merely of collection.
Guaranty
Obligations
 
2. . The liability of the Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be irrevocable, absolute and unconditional irrespective of, and the Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now or hereafter acquire in any way relating to, any or all of the following: (i) any illegality, lack of validity or enforceability of any Obligation, (ii) any amendment, modification, waiver or consent to departure from the terms of any Obligation, including any renewal or extension of the time or change of the manner or place of payment, (iii) any exchange, substitution, release, non-perfection or impairment of any collateral securing payment of any Obligation, (iv) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of EOIC, or any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting EOIC or its assets or any resulting release or discharge of any Obligation, (v) the existence of any claim, set-off or other rights that the Guarantor may have at any time against EOIC, Administrative Agent or any of its affiliates, any Bank or any of its affiliates, or any other corporation or person, whether in connection herewith or any unrelated transactions, provided that nothing herein will prevent the assertion of any such claim by separate suit or compulsory counterclaim, (vi) any law, regulation, decree or order of any jurisdiction, or any other event, affecting any term of any Obligation or Administrative Agent's or any Bank's rights with respect thereto, including, without limitation: (A) the application of any such law, regulation, decree or order, including any prior approval, which would prevent the exchange of a Non-USD Currency (as hereinafter defined) for U.S. Dollars or the remittance of funds outside of such jurisdiction or the unavailability of U.S. Dollars in any legal exchange market in such jurisdiction in accordance with normal commercial practice; or (B) a declaration of banking moratorium or any suspension of payments by banks in such jurisdiction or the imposition by such jurisdiction or any governmental authority thereof of any moratorium on, the required rescheduling or restructuring of, or required approval of payments on, any indebtedness in such jurisdiction; or (C) any expropriation, confiscation, nationalization or requisition by such country or any governmental authority that directly or indirectly deprives EOIC of any assets or their use or of the ability to operate its

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Guarantor guarantees that it shall pay Administrative Agent strictly in accordance with the express terms of any document or agreement evidencing any Obligation, including in the amounts and in the currency expressly agreed to thereunder, irrespective of and without giving effect to any laws of the jurisdiction where EOIC is principally located in effect from time to time, or any order, decree or regulation in the jurisdiction where EOIC is principally located.
 
It is the intent of this Section 2 that the Guarantor's obligations hereunder are and shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances.
 
3. . The Guarantor waives promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance, notice of dishonor and any other notice with respect to any Obligation and this Guaranty and any requirement that Administrative Agent or any Bank exercise any right or take any action against EOIC or any collateral security or credit support.
Waiver
 
4. . This Guaranty will continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of any Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by Administrative Agent or any Bank upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of EOIC or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made.
Reinstatement
 
5. . The Guarantor will not assert, enforce or otherwise exercise any rights which it may acquire by way of subrogation under this Guaranty, by any payment made hereunder or otherwise, until payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of any and all Loan Documents (as defined in the Credit Agreement) under which Administrative Agent or any Bank is committed to provide extensions of credit.
