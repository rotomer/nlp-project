 On 25 May 2010, effective immediately before the General Meeting of Shareholders of Ensco plc (the Company) was called to order, David M. Carmichael retired as a Class II Director.  Under the Ensco Corporate Governance Policy, as a matter of policy, a Director shall not stand for re-election and will retire if he or she would be 70 years old or older when the new term of office would begin. Due to his retirement, the Board of Directors resolved to reduce its size to eight members.
