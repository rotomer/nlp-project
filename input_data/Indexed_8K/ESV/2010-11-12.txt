ENSCO 8503 Special Rate
            
Ensco plc announced today that a subsidiary of the Company has reached an agreement with Cobalt International Energy, L.P. regarding the drilling contract for ENSCO 8503.
                                          
Under the agreement, a special rate of $210,000 applies from the commencement date (currently anticipated in early 2011 following completion of rig acceptance procedures) until the time the rig begins mobilizing to the first drilling location designated by Cobalt.  The two-year term under the original ENSCO 8503 drilling contract with Cobalt will not be reduced by periods during which the special rate is effective.
                                                         
The approximately $520,000 day rate applicable under the original driling contract will apply once ENSCO 8503 begins mobilizing to Cobalt's first drilling location, or 365 days from the original commencement date, whichever date first occurs.
