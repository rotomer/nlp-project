Pursuant to the Merger Agreement and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into Pride (the "Merger"), with Pride as the surviving entity and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Ensco.
As a result of the Merger, each outstanding share of Pride's common stock (other than shares of common stock held directly or indirectly by Ensco, Pride or any wholly-owned subsidiary of Ensco or Pride (which will be cancelled as a result of the Merger), those shares with respect to which appraisal rights under Delaware law are properly exercised and not withdrawn and other shares held by certain U.K. residents if determined by Ensco) will be converted into the right to receive $15.60 in cash and 0.4778 American Depositary Shares (ADSs) representing Class A ordinary shares of Ensco. Under certain circumstances, UK residents may receive all cash consideration as a result of compliance with legal requirements.
At the effective time of the Merger, all outstanding equity awards of Pride will vest, restricted stock units will be paid to the holder in Pride common stock and will be converted to cash and Ensco ADSs on the same basis as other outstanding shares of Pride common stock, and all vested and unexercised Pride stock options will be assumed by Ensco and converted into equivalent options to acquire Ensco ADSs based on an exchange ratio equal to 0.4778 plus a fraction obtained by dividing $15.60 by the average closing price of Ensco ADSs for the five trading days ending three trading days before the closing of the Merger.
The completion of the Merger is subject to certain conditions, including, among others, (i) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the stockholders of Pride and the approval of the delivery of the ADSs by the shareholders of Ensco, (ii) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the absence of any pending governmental proceeding or order to restrain the transactions in specified jurisdictions, including the United States, (iii) subject to certain materiality exceptions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties made by Ensco, Pride, Delaware Sub and Merger Sub, respectively, and compliance by Ensco, Pride, Delaware Sub and Merger Sub with their respective covenants and agreements under the Merger Agreement, (iv) the declaration of the effectiveness by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") of the registration statements on Form S-4 and Form F-6 and, if applicable, the UK Listing Authority shall have approved Ensco's prospectus, (v) the Ensco ADSs to be delivered pursuant to the Merger shall have been authorized for listing on the New York Stock Exchange and (vi) other customary closing conditions.
Each of Ensco, Pride, Merger Sub and Delaware Sub has made representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement. Ensco and Pride have made covenants to conduct their businesses in the ordinary course between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and covenants not to engage in certain kinds of transactions during that period. Ensco and Pride have made certain additional covenants, including, among others, covenants, subject to certain exceptions, (i) not to solicit proposals regarding alternative business combination transactions, (ii) not to enter into discussions concerning, or provide confidential information in connection with, alternative business combination transactions, (iii) to cause shareholder meetings and stockholder meetings, respectively, to be held to approve the delivery of ADSs in connection with the Merger and the adoption of the Merger Agreement, respectively, and (iv) for their respective Boards of Directors to recommend approval of such proposals. In addition, Ensco has made covenants to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain financing on the same or more favorable terms as in the Commitment Letter described below.
The Merger Agreement may be terminated under certain circumstances, including if the Board of Directors of either Pride or Ensco has determined in good faith that it has received a superior proposal and otherwise complies with certain terms of the Merger Agreement. Upon the termination of the Merger Agreement, under specified circumstances, including the failure to obtain a party's shareholder approval, such party
 
will be required to pay a fee to the other party of $50 million. Upon the termination of the Merger Agreement under other specified circumstances, including (1) the decision to accept a superior proposal, (2) a change in board recommendation, or (3) a failure to obtain shareholder approval after public disclosure of an alternative business combination proposal before the shareholder meeting and either the Board of Directors determines such proposal to be a superior proposal or, within 12 months after termination of the Merger Agreement, the party enters into a definitive agreement or consummates an alternative business combination proposal, such party will be required to pay the other party a termination fee of $260 million.
Additionally, Ensco has agreed that it will cause two non-employee current directors designated by Pride to be appointed to the Board of Directors of Ensco at the closing of the Merger. Each designee will be appointed to the class of directors selected by Ensco and will stand for election for the remaining portion of the term of office, if any, for such class at the next annual general meeting of Ensco shareholders for which a notice of the meeting has not been sent at the time of the appointment. Ensco management will recommend to the nominating, governance and compensation committee of the Ensco Board of Directors that such designees be nominated for election at such annual general meeting.

No interest shall be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional
 
Parent ADSs or unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, payable to holders of Company Common Stock.
          (iii) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock (along with any cash in lieu of fractional Parent ADSs as provided in Section 2.2(e) and any unpaid dividends and distributions with respect to such Parent ADSs as provided in Section 2.2(c)) may be paid to a transferee if the Company Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer, including such signature guarantees as Parent or the Exchange Agent may request, and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.

Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares
          (d) . The Merger Consideration delivered and paid upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.2(c) or Section 2.2(e)) shall be deemed to have been delivered and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and from and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Treatment of Fractional Parent ADSs

The Parties acknowledge that payment of cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional Parent ADSs represented thereby was not separately bargained for consideration but represents merely a mechanical rounding off for purposes of simplifying the problems that would otherwise be caused by the delivery of fractional Parent ADSs and Class A Ordinary Shares represented thereby.
          (f) . Any portion of the Exchange Fund and cash held by the Exchange Agent in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.2 that remains unclaimed by the former stockholders of the Company as of the date that is twelve months following the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand. Thereafter, any former stockholders of the Company, other than Dissenting Stockholders, who have not theretofore complied with the provisions of this Section 2.2 shall look only to Parent and the Surviving Entity for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional Parent ADSs and any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent ADSs or Class A Ordinary Shares represented thereby (all without interest).
Termination of Exchange Fund

None of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Entity, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by former holders of Company Common Stock for a period of three years following the Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any governmental entity) shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of any claims or interest of any such holders or their successors, assigns or personal representatives previously entitled thereto.
No Liability
          (h) . If any Company Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Company Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claims that may be made against it with respect to such Company Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificate the Merger Consideration (along with any cash in lieu of fractional Parent ADSs pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and any unpaid dividends and distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(c)) deliverable with respect thereto pursuant to this Agreement.
Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Company Certificates

Any such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the former holder of Company Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made; that such amounts are duly and timely paid over to the appropriate tax authority.

Further, Parent shall offer, or cause its Subsidiaries to offer, at the Effective Time to each Affected Employee coverage under a group health plan (as defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code) which credits such Affected Employee towards the deductibles, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions imposed under such group health plan, for the year during which the Effective Time (or such later date as the Affected Employees participate in such group health plan) occurs, with any applicable expenses already incurred during such year under Parent's or the Company's group health plan.

The Company shall take any and all actions necessary or appropriate, including notification to the affected participants of the new purchase date and termination of the Company ESPP, to cause the Company ESPP to terminate on such final purchase date, after giving effect to the purchases of Company Common Stock contemplated by this Section 5.12(d), and shall not thereafter offer any plan, program or arrangement for the purchase of shares of Company Common Stock by means of payroll deductions.

          (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of any Parent Benefit Plan, Company Benefit Plan or compensation or benefit plan, program or arrangement of Parent or its Subsidiaries, or shall limit the right of Parent, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries, to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any such plan, program or arrangement. In the event that (i) a party other than Parent, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries makes a claim or takes other action to enforce any provision in this Agreement as an amendment to any such plan or arrangement, and (ii) such provision is deemed to be an amendment to such plan, program or arrangement even though not explicitly designated as such in this Agreement, then such provision shall lapse retroactively and shall have no amendatory effect.

Exhibit 99.2
     London, England and Houston, Texas  7 February 2011  Ensco plc (NYSE: ESV) and Pride International, Inc. (NYSE: PDE) jointly announced today that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement under which Ensco will combine with Pride in a cash and stock transaction valued at $41.60 per share based on Ensco's closing share price on 4 February 2011. The implied offer price represents a premium of 21% to Pride's closing share price as of the same date and a premium of 25% to the one month volume weighted average closing price of Pride. The definitive merger agreement was unanimously approved by each company's board of directors.
     Under the terms of the merger agreement, Pride stockholders will receive 0.4778 newly-issued shares of Ensco plus $15.60 in cash for each share of Pride common stock. Upon closing, and reflecting the issuance of new Ensco shares, Pride stockholders collectively will own approximately 38% of Ensco's outstanding shares.
     Ensco expects the combined company to realize annual pre-tax expense synergies of at least $50 million for full year 2012 and beyond. The combination is projected by Ensco management to be immediately accretive to Ensco's earnings and cash flow per share before synergies.
     The transaction will create the second largest offshore driller in the world with 74 rigs spanning all of the strategic, high-growth markets around the globe. The combined company will have 21 ultra-deepwater and deepwater rigs, forming the second largest/youngest fleet able to drill in water depths of 4,500' or greater. In addition, the combined company will have more active jackup rigs than any other driller. Mid-water rigs will represent 8% of the combined fleet.
     Based on the closing price of each company's shares on 4 February 2011, the estimated enterprise value of the combined company is $16 billion. The total estimated revenue backlog for the combined company is approximately $10 billion.
 
Continued Ensco plc News Release
Strategic Fit
     Ensco plc's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Dan Rabun stated, "The combination is an ideal strategic fit, as our rig types, markets, customers and expertise complement each other with minimal overlap. Pride has gained valuable expertise building and operating ultra-deepwater semisubmersibles and drillships and has strong relationships with leading customers in Brazil and West Africa, two of the fastest-growing deepwater markets in the world. Ensco is a leading provider of premium jackups and ultra-deepwater semisubmersible rigs with a major presence in the North Sea, Southeast Asia, North America and the Middle East. Together, we will form an even stronger company that is ideally positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities within our industry."
     Mr. Rabun added, "We share the same core values through our dedication to safety, ethics, operational excellence, employee development, customer satisfaction and disciplined risk management. These values form the foundation of our future growth."
     Pride International's President and Chief Executive Officer Louis Raspino added, "The combination of Pride and Ensco creates an offshore contract driller with many of the attributes needed to ensure long-term success in our business. I have always been an advocate of scale, believing that a company with critical mass is afforded numerous benefits, including operational efficiencies, marketing advantages and the ability to attract and retain talented individuals that will help to secure a strong future for our company.
     "The diverse composition of the fleet, with significant exposure to high-specification capabilities in both the floating and jackup rig segments, a solid and conservative approach to managing through the complexities of our business, aided by one of the industry's strongest balance sheets and proven leadership that has demonstrated consistent execution and commitment to growth, makes the combination of Pride International and Ensco plc a premier alternative for investors and the driller of choice for our clients.
     "Pride stockholders will receive newly-issued Ensco shares that provide them an ongoing interest in a world-class offshore driller with significant growth potential, as well as a cash component, that combined, represents a substantial premium for Pride's shareholders."
Combined Company Highlights
     The merger will combine two of the offshore drilling industry's premier companies, combining long and established histories of operational, engineering and technical expertise along with quality assets and infrastructure in a number of the world's prolific offshore drilling basins.
     The combined company's fleet will be among the most technologically advanced in the industry and meet the deep- and shallow-water drilling requirements of an expanded base of clients around the world. Within the fleet of 27 floating rigs (semisubmersibles and drillships) are 21 deepwater drilling rigs, including seven rigs delivered since 2008 and another five rigs expected to be delivered between now and 2013, establishing this fleet as among the youngest and most capable in the industry. Thirteen of the rigs are rated for operations in water depths of 7,500 feet and greater.
     Also, the combined company's jackup rig fleet, composed of 47 rigs, all with independent
 
Continued Ensco plc News Release
leg design, includes 27 units with water depth ratings of 300 feet and greater, with nine units delivered since 2000 and equipped with many of the advanced features requested by clients with shallow water drilling programs, such as increased leg length, expanded cantilever reach and greater hoisting capacity.
     The combined company will be among the most geographically diverse drillers with current operations and drilling contracts spanning more than 25 different countries on six continents in nearly every major deep- and shallow-water basin around the world. Regions will include major markets in Southeast Asia, the North Sea, Mediterranean, U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Mexico, Middle East and Australia, as well as the fastest-growing deepwater markets, Brazil and West Africa, where Pride has operated continuously for over 15 years and where some of the world's most prolific geology resides.
     Customers will include most of the leading national and international oil companies, plus many independent operators. In total, the combined company will have the second largest number of current customers of any offshore driller and will benefit from enhanced diversification given the minimal overlap between the two companies.
     Dan Rabun will remain Chairman, President and CEO and James W. Swent will continue as Senior Vice President and CFO. The remaining executive management team for the combined company will be named at a later date and is expected to be composed of executives from both Ensco and Pride.
     Ensco's eight board members will continue to serve as directors of the combined company and two Pride directors will be appointed to an expanded board effective at closing.
     The combined company, which will retain the name Ensco plc, will remain domiciled in the UK. Virtually all of the senior executive officers will be located in London. The combined company is anticipated to realize significant benefits similar to those already achieved by Ensco since its redomestication to the UK in 2009. These benefits include greater access to major customers, enhanced oversight of global operations due to improved time zone overlap, increased access to European institutional investors and a more competitive tax position.
     Ensco plc American Depositary Shares (ADS) will continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "ESV".
Transaction Details
     Pride shareholders will receive 0.4778 newly-issued Ensco shares plus $15.60 in cash for each Pride common share. The offer results in an implied offer price per diluted share of $41.60 based on Ensco's closing price of $54.41 on 4 February 2011. The offer represents a premium of approximately 21% to Pride's closing price of $34.39 on 4 February 2011 and a premium of 25% to the one-month volume weighted average closing price of Pride.
     Upon closing, Ensco and Pride shareholders will own an estimated 62% and 38%, respectively, of the combined company. The total number of Ensco diluted shares outstanding upon closing will be approximately 229 million.
 
Continued Ensco plc News Release
Financial Highlights
     Future revenue growth is anticipated as new opportunities are identified within the expanded customer base. As customers continue to invest in many of the largest and fastest-growing offshore basins, such as Brazil and numerous other emerging locations, new discoveries and development projects are expected to generate substantial additional demand for offshore drilling.
     Annual expense savings of at least $50 million are estimated to be realized in full year 2012 and beyond. Expense savings are anticipated from the consolidation of offices that include corporate staff departments, as well as the standardization of systems, policies and procedures across the combined organization.
     Ensco management anticipates that the planned combination will be accretive to earnings per share in 2011 and 2012. Excluding transaction-related costs and costs incurred to achieve ongoing expense synergy benefits, earnings per share for full year 2012 for the combined company is projected to be more than 10% accretive to the First Call earnings per share mean estimate of $5.11 for full year 2012 published by Thomson Reuters as of 6 February 2011 for Ensco plc. The 2011 accretion outlook does not include expense synergy benefits. For 2012, approximately $50 million of expense synergy benefits are included in the accretion estimate. The Company anticipates providing an initial full-year 2011 outlook for Ensco on a stand-alone basis during its fourth quarter 2010 earnings conference call scheduled for 24 February 2011.
     The transaction will be financed through a combination of existing cash on the balance sheet and newly-issued Ensco shares and debt. Total cash paid to Pride shareholders will be approximately $2.8 billion. Ensco has received commitments from Deutsche Bank AG Cayman Islands Branch and Citibank N.A. to finance the incremental debt required for the transaction. Given the number of rigs under construction, it is contemplated that cash flows initially will be dedicated to finance newbuild rigs; however, future cash flows also are expected to be used to pay down debt.
     The combined company is expected to have investment-grade ratings and approximately $10 billion in revenue backlog that are expected to support further strategic growth. Long-term debt as a percentage of total capital is anticipated to be approximately 30% following the closing, which is comparable to other investment-grade offshore drillers. The combined company's credit profile will benefit from increased scale and significantly enhanced diversification across markets, rig types, customers and expertise due to the complementary makeup of the respective businesses.
     In connection with the proposed Pride combination, Ensco's board of directors intends to maintain the $0.35 per share quarterly cash dividend ($1.40 per share annualized) following the closing of the transaction.
Conditions and Timing
     The transaction is subject to approval by the shareholders of Ensco and Pride, as well as other customary closing conditions. The transaction is not subject to any financing condition. Ensco and Pride intend to file a joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and

Exchange Commission as soon as possible. The companies anticipate that the transaction could close as soon as the second quarter of 2011.
Advisors
     Ensco's lead financial advisor and strategic advisor for the transaction is Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Citi also served as financial advisor, and its legal advisor is Baker & McKenzie LLP. The financial advisor for Pride is Goldman, Sachs & Co. and its legal advisors are Baker Botts L.L.P. and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz.
