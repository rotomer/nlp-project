On 6 February 2011, Ensco plc ("Ensco") entered into a bridge commitment letter (the "Bridge Commitment Letter") with Deutsche Bank AG Cayman Islands Branch ("DBCI"), Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. ("Citi"). Pursuant to the Bridge Commitment Letter, DBCI and Citi committed to provide Ensco a $2.75 billion unsecured bridge term loan facility. On 17 March 2011, Ensco completed a sale of $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.250% Senior Notes due 2016 and $1,500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.700% Senior Notes due 2021. Upon receipt of the proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes, Ensco determined that it had adequate cash resources to fund the cash component of the merger consideration payable in connection with the proposed acquisition of Pride International, Inc., and accordingly the Bridge Commitment Letter was terminated.
