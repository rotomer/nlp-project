Five-Year Credit Facility
 
On 12 May 2011, Ensco plc (the Company) and its subsidiaries, ENSCO International Incorporated, ENSCO Universal Limited, ENSCO Offshore International Company, ENSCO United Incorporated and ENSCO Global Limited, entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the 5-Year Credit Facility), with a syndicate of banks that are parties thereto, Citibank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. as Syndication Agent, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association and DnB NOR Bank ASA as Co-Documentation Agents, and Citibank, N.A., Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association and DnB NOR Bank ASA, each as an Issuing Bank.  If the Companys proposed acquisition of Pride International, Inc. (the Pride Merger) is completed, Pride International, Inc., and certain of its subsidiaries will become borrowers and/or guarantors of the 5-Year Credit Facility at the closing of the Pride Merger.
 
The 5-Year Credit Facility initially provides for a $700 million unsecured revolving credit facility to be used for general corporate purposes.  Upon satisfying certain conditions at the closing of the Pride Merger, the aggregate borrowing capacity will be increased to $1.45 billion.  The 5-Year Credit Facility has a five-year term, expiring 12 May 2016, and replaces the Companys $700 million five-year credit agreement with the lenders and other parties signatory thereto, which was scheduled to mature on 28 May 2014, and the related Guaranty made by the Company in favor of Citibank, N.A. (together, the Prior Credit Facility).
 
Advances under the 5-Year Credit Facility bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin rate depending on the Companys credit rating, and amounts repaid may be re-borrowed during the term. The Company is required to pay a quarterly undrawn facility fee on the total commitment, which also is based on the Companys credit rating.
 
The 5-Year Credit Facility contains customary restrictive covenants, including, among others, prohibitions on creating, incurring or assuming certain liens; entering into certain merger arrangements; selling, leasing, transferring or otherwise disposing of all or substantially all of its assets; making a material change in the nature of the business; and entering into certain transactions with affiliates. The Company is required to maintain a debt to total capitalization ratio less than or equal to 50%. There are no other financial covenants. The Company has the right, subject to lender consent, to increase the commitments under the 5-Year Credit Facility to an aggregate amount of up to $1.7 billion.
 
The 5-Year Credit Facility contains customary provisions regarding events of default, which could result in an acceleration in amounts due, including among others, payment default, failure to comply with covenants, material inaccuracy of representation or warranty, bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, cross-default to other debt obligations, change of control, certain judgments and ERISA matters.
 
In addition to the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries ENSCO International Incorporated, ENSCO Universal Limited and ENSCO Offshore International Company may also borrow under the 5-Year Credit Facility. The Company and three of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, ENSCO Global Limited, ENSCO United Incorporated and ENSCO International Incorporated, have issued the Third Amended and Restated Guaranty in favor of the lenders, pursuant to which each has guaranteed the payment of all obligations under the 5-Year Credit Facility.
 
The foregoing description of the 5-Year Credit Facility does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the 5-Year Credit Facility, a copy of which along with a copy of the Third Amended and Restated Guaranty are attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and Exhibit 10.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
 
 
364-Day Credit Facility
 
On 12 May 2011, the Company and its subsidiaries, ENSCO International Incorporated, ENSCO Universal Limited, ENSCO Offshore International Company, ENSCO United Incorporated and ENSCO Global Limited, entered into a 364-Day Credit Agreement (the 364-Day Credit Facility), with a syndicate of banks that are parties thereto, Citibank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. as Syndication Agent, and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Book Managers.  If the Pride Merger is completed, Pride International, Inc., and certain of its subsidiaries will become borrowers and/or guarantors of the 364-Day Credit Facility at the closing of the Pride Merger.
 
The 364-Day Credit Facility will not be available for borrowing until certain conditions at the closing of the Pride Merger are satisfied, at which point, the $450 million unsecured, revolving credit facility will become available to be used for general corporate purposes.  The 364-Day Credit Facility will expire on the earlier of 11 May 2012, or the date of the termination of the lender commitments as set forth in the 364-Day Credit Facility.  At the Companys election prior to maturity, amounts outstanding under the 364-Day Credit Facility may be converted into a term loan with a maturity date of 11 May 2013 upon payment of a fee equal to 1% of the amounts converted.
 
Advances under the 364-Day Credit Facility will bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin rate depending on the Companys credit rating, and amounts repaid may be re-borrowed during the term. The Company is required to pay a quarterly undrawn facility fee on the total commitment, which also is based on the Companys credit rating.
 
The 364-Day Credit Facility contains customary restrictive covenants, including, among others, prohibitions on creating, incurring or assuming certain liens; entering into certain merger arrangements; selling, leasing, transferring or otherwise disposing of all or substantially all of its assets; making a material change in the nature of the business; and entering into certain transactions with affiliates. The Company is required to maintain a debt to total capitalization ratio less than or equal to 50%. There are no other financial covenants. The Company has the right, subject to lender consent, to increase the commitments under the 364-Day Credit Facility to an aggregate amount of up to $550 million.
 
The 364-Day Credit Facility contains customary provisions regarding events of default, which could result in an acceleration in amounts due, including among others, payment default, failure to comply with covenants, material inaccuracy of representation or warranty, bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, cross-default to other debt obligations, change of control, certain judgments and ERISA matters.
 
In addition to the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries ENSCO International Incorporated, ENSCO Universal Limited and ENSCO Offshore International Company may also borrow under the 364-Day Credit Facility. The Company and three of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, ENSCO Global Limited, ENSCO United Incorporated and ENSCO International Incorporated, have issued the 364-Day Guaranty in favor of the lenders, pursuant to which each has guaranteed the payment of all obligations under the 364-Day Credit Facility.

If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent from any Loan Party in the Agreement Currency, such Loan Party agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Administrative Agent or the Person to whom such obligation was owing against such loss.  If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is greater than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent in such currency, the Administrative Agent agrees to return the amount of any excess to such Loan Party (or to any other Person who may be entitled thereto under applicable law).

EUI wishes to, and each of the Existing Guarantors wishes to continue to, guarantee the due payment and performance of the Obligations (as defined below) by amending and restating the Existing Guaranty in its entirety as hereinafter set forth through the execution of this Guaranty.
For good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and to induce the Administrative Agent and the Banks to enter into the Credit Agreement, each Guarantor agrees as follows and each Guarantor and the Administrative Agent hereby agree that the Existing Guaranty is amended and restated in its entirety as follows:
 
 
 
 
1.
 
.  Each Guarantor unconditionally, jointly, and severally guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether upon maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, all Obligations (now or hereafter existing); provided that, if any Obligations are denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars, such amount will be increased to the extent that fluctuations of currency conversion rates occurring after the date hereof result in an increase in the equivalent of such Obligations in U.S. Dollars.  If any Borrower fails to pay any Obligation in full when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), each Guarantor will promptly pay the same to the Administrative Agent.  Each Guarantor will also pay to the Administrative Agent any and all expenses (including without limitation, reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by the Administrative Agent or any Bank in enforcing its rights under this Guaranty.  This Guaranty is a guaranty of payment and not merely of collection.
Guaranty
 
2.
 
.  The liability of each Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be irrevocable, absolute and unconditional irrespective of, and each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now or hereafter acquire in any way relating to, any or all of the following: (i) any illegality, lack of validity or enforceability of any Obligation, (ii) any amendment, modification, acceleration, waiver or consent to departure from the terms of any Obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document, or any renewal or extension of the time or change of the manner or place of payment, including any increase in the Obligations resulting from any extension of additional credit or otherwise, (iii) any taking, exchange, substitution, release, non-perfection or impairment of any collateral securing payment of any Obligation, (iv) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of any Borrower, or any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting any Borrower or its assets or any resulting release or discharge of any Obligation, (v) the existence of any claim, set-off or other rights that the Borrowers or such Guarantor may have at any time against the Administrative Agent or any of its affiliates, any Bank or any of its affiliates, whether in connection herewith or any unrelated transactions, provided that nothing herein will prevent the assertion of any such claim or other rights by separate suit or compulsory counterclaim, (vi) any law, regulation, decree or order of any jurisdiction, or any other event, affecting any term of any Obligation or Administrative Agent's or any Bank's rights with respect thereto, including, without limitation: (A) the application of any such law, regulation, decree or order, including any prior approval, which would prevent the exchange of a Non-USD Currency (as hereinafter defined) for U.S. Dollars or the remittance of funds outside of such jurisdiction or the unavailability of U.S. Dollars in any legal exchange market in such jurisdiction in accordance with normal commercial practice; or (B) a declaration of banking moratorium or any suspension of payments by banks in such jurisdiction or the imposition by such jurisdiction or any governmental authority thereof of any moratorium on, the required rescheduling or restructuring of, or required approval of payments on, any indebtedness in such jurisdiction; or (C) any expropriation, confiscation, nationalization or requisition by such country or any governmental authority that directly or indirectly deprives any Borrower of any assets or its use or of the ability to operate its business or a material part thereof; or (D) any war (whether or not declared), insurrection, revolution, hostile act, civil strife or similar events occurring in such jurisdiction which has the same effect as the events described in clause (A), (B) or (C) above (in each of the cases contemplated in clauses (A) through (D) above, to the extent occurring or existing on or at any time after the date of this Guaranty), (vii) any claim that any Guarantor's obligations exceed or are more burdensome than those of the Borrowers; and (viii) any other circumstance (including, without limitation, any statute of limitations relating to a Borrower) or any existence of or reliance on any representation by Administrative Agent or any Bank that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a legal or equitable discharge of, any Borrower or any Guarantor or any other guarantor or surety.
Guaranty Absolute
 
2
 
 
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor guarantees that it shall pay Administrative Agent strictly in accordance with the express terms of any document or agreement evidencing any Obligation, including in the amounts and in the currency expressly agreed to thereunder, irrespective of and without giving effect to any laws of the jurisdiction where any Borrower or Guarantor is principally located in effect from time to time, or any order, decree or regulation in the jurisdiction where any Borrower or Guarantor is principally located.
 
It is the intent of this that each Guarantors' obligations hereunder are and shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances.
Section 2
3.
 
.  Each Guarantor waives (i) promptness, diligence, notice of protest, notice of acceptance, notice of dishonor and any other notice or demand of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to any Obligation and this Guaranty, (ii) any requirement that, or right to require the Administrative Agent or any Bank to, exercise any right or take any action against any Borrower or any collateral security or credit support, or pursue any other remedy in the Administrative Agent or the Bank's power whatsoever, and (iii) any benefit of and any right to participate in any security now or hereafter held by the Administrative Agent or any Bank.
Waiver
 
4.
 
.  This Guaranty will continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of any Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by Administrative Agent or any Bank upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made.

6.

Each Guarantor expressly assumes all responsibilities to remain informed of each Borrower's financial condition and any circumstances affecting (i) any Borrower's ability to perform its obligations under the Loan Documents to which it is a party or (ii) any collateral securing all or any part of the Obligations.

Any Contributing Guarantor making any payment to a Funding Guarantor pursuant to this Section 17 shall be subrogated to the rights of such Funding Guarantor to the extent of such payment.  No Guarantor shall have any right of subrogation, reimbursement, contribution or indemnity, nor any right of recourse to security for the Obligations unless and until 93 days shall have elapsed after the date on which the Obligations have been repaid in full and the Loan Documents (as defined in the Credit Agreement) have been terminated, without the filing or commencement, by or against any Borrower, of any state or federal action, suit, petition or proceeding seeking any reorganization, liquidation or other relief or arrangement in respect of creditors of, or the appointment of a receiver, liquidator, trustee or conservator in respect to, any Borrower or its assets.  This waiver is expressly intended to prevent the existence of any claim in respect to such subrogation, reimbursement, contribution or indemnity by the Guarantors against the estate of any Borrower within the meaning of Section 101 of the Bankruptcy Code, in the event of a subsequent case involving a Borrower.  If an amount shall be paid to any Guarantor on account of such rights at any time prior to termination of this Guaranty, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Banks and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent, to be credited and applied to the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents or otherwise as the Administrative Agent may elect.  The agreements in this Section 17 shall survive repayment of all of the Obligations and the termination or expiration of this Guaranty in any manner.

Section 5.01(k)
Banks
For good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and to induce the Administrative Agent and the Banks to enter into the Credit Agreement, each Guarantor agrees as follows:
1.
 
.  Each Guarantor unconditionally, jointly, and severally guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether upon maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, all Obligations (now or hereafter existing); provided that, if any Obligations are denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars, such amount will be increased to the extent that fluctuations of currency conversion rates occurring after the date hereof result in an increase in the equivalent of such Obligations in U.S. Dollars.  If any Borrower fails to pay any Obligation in full when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), each Guarantor will promptly pay the same to the Administrative Agent.  Each Guarantor will also pay to the Administrative Agent any and all expenses (including without limitation, reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by the Administrative Agent or any Bank in enforcing its rights under this Guaranty.  This Guaranty is a guaranty of payment and not merely of collection.
Guaranty
 
 
 
 
2.
 
.  The liability of each Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be irrevocable, absolute and unconditional irrespective of, and each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now or hereafter acquire in any way relating to, any or all of the following: (i) any illegality, lack of validity or enforceability of any Obligation, (ii) any amendment, modification, acceleration, waiver or consent to departure from the terms of any Obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document, or any renewal or extension of the time or change of the manner or place of payment, including any increase in the Obligations resulting from any extension of additional credit or otherwise, (iii) any taking, exchange, substitution, release, non-perfection or impairment of any collateral securing payment of any Obligation, (iv) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of any Borrower, or any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting any Borrower or its assets or any resulting release or discharge of any Obligation, (v) the existence of any claim, set-off or other rights that the Borrowers or such Guarantor may have at any time against the Administrative Agent or any of its affiliates, any Bank or any of its affiliates, whether in connection herewith or any unrelated transactions, provided that nothing herein will prevent the assertion of any such claim or other rights by separate suit or compulsory counterclaim, (vi) any law, regulation, decree or order of any jurisdiction, or any other event, affecting any term of any Obligation or Administrative Agent's or any Bank's rights with respect thereto, including, without limitation: (A) the application of any such law, regulation, decree or order, including any prior approval, which would prevent the exchange of a Non-USD Currency (as hereinafter defined) for U.S. Dollars or the remittance of funds outside of such jurisdiction or the unavailability of U.S. Dollars in any legal exchange market in such jurisdiction in accordance with normal commercial practice; or (B) a declaration of banking moratorium or any suspension of payments by banks in such jurisdiction or the imposition by such jurisdiction or any governmental authority thereof of any moratorium on, the required rescheduling or restructuring of, or required approval of payments on, any indebtedness in such jurisdiction; or (C) any expropriation, confiscation, nationalization or requisition by such country or any governmental authority that directly or indirectly deprives any Borrower of any assets or its use or of the ability to operate its business or a material part thereof; or (D) any war (whether or not declared), insurrection, revolution, hostile act, civil strife or similar events occurring in such jurisdiction which has the same effect as the events described in clause (A), (B) or (C) above (in each of the cases contemplated in clauses (A) through (D) above, to the extent occurring or existing on or at any time after the date of this Guaranty), (vii) any claim that any Guarantor's obligations exceed or are more burdensome than those of the Borrowers; and (viii) any other circumstance (including, without limitation, any statute of limitations relating to a Borrower) or any existence of or reliance on any representation by Administrative Agent or any Bank that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a legal or equitable discharge of, any Borrower or any Guarantor or any other guarantor or surety.
Guaranty Absolute
 
 
2
 
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor guarantees that it shall pay Administrative Agent strictly in accordance with the express terms of any document or agreement evidencing any Obligation, including in the amounts and in the currency expressly agreed to thereunder, irrespective of and without giving effect to any laws of the jurisdiction where any Borrower or Guarantor is principally located in effect from time to time, or any order, decree or regulation in the jurisdiction where any Borrower or Guarantor is principally located.
 
It is the intent of this that each Guarantors' obligations hereunder are and shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances.
Section 2
3.
 
.  Each Guarantor waives (i) promptness, diligence, notice of protest, notice of acceptance, notice of dishonor and any other notice or demand of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to any Obligation and this Guaranty, (ii) any requirement that, or right to require the Administrative Agent or any Bank to, exercise any right or take any action against any Borrower or any collateral security or credit support, or pursue any other remedy in the Administrative Agent or the Bank's power whatsoever, and (iii) any benefit of and any right to participate in any security now or hereafter held by the Administrative Agent or any Bank.
Waiver
 
4.
 
.  This Guaranty will continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of any Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by Administrative Agent or any Bank upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made.

[Reserved]
 
6.

If a Guarantor is required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder (i) the sum payable will be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) each of Administrative Agent and each Bank will receive an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Guarantor will make such deductions, and (iii) such Guarantor will pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law.  In addition, each Guarantor will pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies that arise from any payment made hereunder or from the execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Guaranty or the Obligations ("").  Such Guarantor will promptly furnish to the Administrative Agent or such Bank the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.  Each Guarantor will indemnify Administrative Agent and each Bank for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes paid by Administrative Agent or such Bank or any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted, within 30 days of Administrative Agent's or such Bank's request therefor.  Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement contained herein, the Guarantors' agreements and obligations contained in this Section will survive the payment in full of the Obligations, principal and interest hereunder and any termination of this Guaranty.

.  If any Obligation is payable in U.S. Dollars, each Guarantor agrees to make payment hereunder to Administrative Agent in U.S. Dollars at 1615 Brett Road, OPS III, New Castle, DE 19720.  If any Obligation is payable in a currency other than U.S. Dollars (a "") and/or at a place other than the United States, and such payment is not made as and when agreed, each Guarantor agrees to, at the Administrative Agent's option, either (i) make payment in such Non-USD Currency and at the place where such Obligation is payable, or (ii) pay the Administrative Agent in U.S. Dollars at 1615 Brett Road, OPS III, New Castle, DE 19720.  In the event of a payment pursuant to clause (ii) above, each Guarantor agrees to pay Administrative Agent the equivalent of the amount of such Obligation in U.S. Dollars calculated at the rate of exchange at which, in accordance with normal banking procedures, Administrative Agent may buy such Non-USD Currency in New York, New York on the date such Guarantor makes such payment; , , that the foregoing provisions of this sentence shall not apply to any payments hereunder in respect of Obligations that have been re-denominated into a Non-USD Currency as a result of the application of any law, order, decree or regulation in any jurisdiction other than the United States, which Obligations shall, for purposes of this Guaranty, be deemed to remain denominated in U.S. Dollars and payable to the Administrative Agent in accordance with the first sentence of this Section 7.

The Administrative Agent or such Bank will promptly notify such Guarantor after any such set-off and application, provided that the failure to give such notice will not affect the validity of such set-off and application.  The Administrative Agent's and each Bank's rights under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of set-off) that the Administrative Agent or such Bank may have.

Notices; Addresses
Section 8.02
 
13.
 
.  Each Guarantor has, independently and without reliance on any representation or warranty by the Administrative Agent or any Bank and based on such documents and information as such Guarantor has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Guaranty.  Each Guarantor has adequate means to obtain from the Borrowers on a continuing basis information concerning the financial condition, operations and business of the Borrowers, and no Guarantor is relying on the Administrative Agent or any Bank to provide such information now or in the future.  Each Guarantor expressly assumes all responsibilities to remain informed of each Borrower's financial condition and any circumstances affecting (i) any Borrower's ability to perform its obligations under the Loan Documents to which it is a party or (ii) any collateral securing all or any part of the Obligations.  Each Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct and indirect benefit from the extensions of credit contemplated by this Guaranty.
Guarantors' Credit Decision, Etc
 
 
5
 
14.
 
.  If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in U.S. Dollars into a Non-USD Currency, each Guarantor agrees that the rate of exchange used will be that at which, in accordance with normal banking procedures, the Administrative Agent could purchase U.S. Dollars with such Non-USD Currency on the business day preceding that on which final judgment is given.  The obligation of each Guarantor in respect of any sum due hereunder will, notwithstanding any judgment in a Non-USD Currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the date such Guarantor makes payment to the Administrative Agent of any sum adjudged to be so due in such Non-USD Currency, the Administrative Agent may, in accordance with normal banking procedures, purchase U.S. Dollars with such Non-USD Currency; if the U.S. Dollars so purchased are less than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent in U.S. Dollars, each Guarantor agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Administrative Agent against such loss, and if the U.S. Dollars so purchased exceed the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent in U.S. Dollars, the Administrative Agent agrees to remit to such Guarantor such excess.
Judgment
 
15.
 
.  This Guaranty shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the law of the State of New York.
Governing Law
 
16.
 
.  Each Guarantor accepts joint and several liability hereunder for the Obligations of the Borrowers under the Credit Agreement in consideration for the Banks and the Administrative Agent entering into the Credit Agreement, for the mutual benefit, directly and indirectly, of each Guarantor.   If and to the extent that any Guarantor shall fail to make any payment with respect to any of the obligations hereunder as and when due, then each other Guarantor will make such payment with respect to such obligation.
Joint and Several Liability of the Guarantors
 
17.
 
.  In order to provide for just and equitable contribution among the Guarantors, each Guarantor agrees that in the event a payment shall be made on any date under this Guaranty by any Guarantor (the ""), each other Guarantor (each a "") shall indemnify the Funding Guarantor in an amount equal to the amount of such payment, in each case multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the net worth of the Contributing Guarantor as of such date and the denominator of which shall be the aggregate net worth of all the Contributing Guarantors together with the net worth of the Funding Guarantor as of such date.  Any Contributing Guarantor making any payment to a Funding Guarantor pursuant to this Section 17 shall be subrogated to the rights of such Funding Guarantor to the extent of such payment.
