The day rates reflected in this Fleet Status Report are the operating day rates charged to customers, which may include estimated contractual adjustments for changes in operating costs and/or reimbursable cost adjustments for ongoing expenses such as crew, catering, insurance and taxes. The day rates, however, do not include certain types of non-recurring revenues such as lump sum mobilization payments, revenues earned during mobilizations, revenues associated with contract preparation and other non-recurring reimbursable items such as mobilizations and capital enhancements, and the impact of the fair market value adjustments to Pride's drillingcontracts in place on the 31 May 2011 acquisition date. Routine and non-routine downtime may reduce the actual revenues recognized during the contract term. Additionally, the Company occasionally negotiates special rates with customers as noted in the comments that reduce revenues recognized during the contract term. Rig Names. We are in the process of completing name changes on some of our rigs, some of which may not be completed for some time. For the purpose of our Fleet Status Report, we are using the new names even when the name change has not been completed. Below is a legend showing the name changes.
