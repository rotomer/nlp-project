Ensco plc Reports First Quarter 2012 Results
02 May 2012
#1 in Total Customer Satisfaction
ENSCO DS-6 Contracted to BP for Five-Year Term
ENSCO 8506 Contracted to Anadarko in U.S. Gulf of Mexico
ENSCO DS-8 Ordered for Delivery in Third Quarter 2014
Dividend Increased by 7% Beginning March 2012
LONDON -- (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Ensco plc (NYSE: ESV) reported diluted earnings per share of $1.15 for first quarter 2012, compared to $0.45 per share in first quarter 2011. Professional fees, severance payments and other integration-related costs associated with the Pride International, Inc. acquisition totaled approximately $3 million, or $0.01 per share, in first quarter 2012. Professional fees incurred in first quarter 2011 related to preparations for the planned acquisition were approximately $8 million, or $0.06 per share.
On 31 May 2011, Ensco plc completed the acquisition of Pride International. Results from Pride International were included in Ensco's first quarter 2012 results with no corresponding amount in first quarter 2011.
As previously reported on 28 February 2012, the Board of Directors increased the regular quarterly cash dividend by 7% to $0.375 per share, or $1.50 per share annually. The dividend increase is supported by the Company's strong financial position and positive outlook for future earnings growth from rising utilization and day rates, coupled with organic growth from newbuild rigs.
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Dan Rabun stated, Customer demand for offshore drilling continues to strengthen. During the quarter, we contracted two of our newbuild ultra-deepwater rigs. Drillship ENSCO DS-6 was contracted with BP for an initial five-year term and semisubmersible ENSCO 8506 was contracted for an initial two-and-one-half year term with Anadarko in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Given our contracting success and positive outlook, we recently ordered a new ultra-deepwater drillship, to be named ENSCO DS-8, with options for two additional drillships. In total, we have six rigs under construction that will drive earnings growth well into the future. Given our strong financial position and positive growth outlook, our Board of Directors increased the regular cash dividend during the first quarter.
Mr. Rabun added, Once again, customers rated Ensco #1 for total customer satisfaction in the independent survey completed by EnergyPoint Research. In total, Ensco earned the top score in 13 of 17 categories. We are grateful for this recognition, which is the result of the hard work and dedication of our offshore crews and onshore personnel around the world.
Revenues in first quarter 2012 totaled $1.026 billion, compared to $362 million a year ago. Approximately $461 million of the increase was related to the Pride International acquisition. Higher utilization and average day rates in both the deepwater and jackup segments and the addition of new ultra-deepwater rigs to the active fleet also drove the increase in revenues. As required by generally accepted accounting principles, former Pride International drilling contracts were adjusted to their estimated fair market values at the acquisition date. Due to these required adjustments, first quarter 2012 revenues were increased by approximately $9 million.
1
Contract drilling expense was $520 million, up from $192 million in first quarter 2011. Excluding $269 million from the effect of the Pride International acquisition, contract drilling expense increased $59 million. Newly delivered ultra-deepwater rigs and higher costs from improved utilization in the jackup segment also increased expenses along with previously reported increases in average unit labor costs. First quarter 2012 contract drilling expense included approximately $1 million of severance costs related to the acquisition with no similar expense in first quarter 2011.
Depreciation expense rose to $139 million from $60 million a year ago. Excluding $71 million from the effect of the Pride International acquisition, the $8 million increase primarily was driven by the addition of new ultra-deepwater rigs to the fleet.
General and administrative expense was $38 million, compared to $30 million in first quarter 2011. The effect of the Pride International acquisition increased general and administrative expense year to year. Professional fees, severance payments and other integration-related costs associated with the Pride International acquisition totaled approximately $2 million in first quarter 2012, compared to approximately $8 million in first quarter 2011.
Interest expense in first quarter 2012 was $35 million, net of $23 million of interest that was capitalized, compared to interest expense of $4 million in first quarter 2011, net of $14 million of interest that was capitalized. Interest expense increased year to year due to additional debt incurred as a result of the acquisition of Pride International.
Segment Highlights
Deepwater
Deepwater segment revenues were $549 million in first quarter 2012, up from $98 million a year ago. Approximately $333 million of the $451 million increase was related to the effect of the Pride International acquisition. Two new ultra-deepwater semisubmersible rigs, ENSCO 8503 and ENSCO 8504, also contributed to the increase, along with ENSCO 7500 that commenced a multi-year contract in Brazil in late December 2011 after completing upgrades last year.
The average day rate was $383,000 and utilization was 87%, compared to $304,000 and 77%, respectively, in first quarter 2011. Excluding the impact of the Pride International acquisition, the average day rate increased to $406,000 and utilization was 87% in first quarter 2012. During first quarter 2011, certain deepwater rigs operating in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico earned lower standby or sublet rates following the Macondo incident.
Contract drilling expense was $260 million in first quarter 2012, up from $41 million in first quarter 2011. Approximately $178 million of the $219 million increase was due to the effect of the Pride International acquisition. The commencement of the ENSCO 7500 multi-year contract in Brazil and the addition of ENSCO 8503 and ENSCO 8504 to the fleet also contributed to the increase.
Midwater
Prior to the Pride International acquisition, Ensco had no midwater rigs. Therefore, midwater segment revenues totaling $91 million in first quarter 2012 were entirely related to the effect of the Pride International acquisition. The average day rate was $227,000 and utilization was 68% in first quarter 2012. Contract drilling expense in first quarter 2012 was $62 million.
Jackup
Jackup segment revenues were $365 million, up from $263 million a year ago. Higher utilization and average day rates drove the $102 million, or 39%, increase in revenues. The effect of the Pride International acquisition added approximately $16 million to revenues.
2
Utilization increased to 84% from 72% in the year ago period. The average day rate was $99,000 versus $97,000 in first quarter 2011. Excluding the effect of the Pride International acquisition, utilization improved more than twenty percentage points to 93% and the average day rate increased to $101,000.
Contract drilling expense increased $31 million to $182 million compared to a year ago. Significantly improved utilization drove the increase. The effect of the Pride International acquisition added approximately $14 million to contract drilling expense.
Other
Other includes managed drilling rig operations added through the Pride International acquisition and the ENSCO I barge rig that has been cold stacked. In first quarter 2012, revenue totaling $22 million and contract drilling expense equaling $17 million are due primarily to the effect of the Pride International acquisition.
Strong Financial Position - 31 March 2012
Ensco continues to maintain a strong financial position:
The $1.9 billion of available revolving credit facilities comprises a 364-day revolving credit facility in the amount of $450 million, which was recently extended for an additional year, and a five-year revolving credit facility in the amount of $1.45 billion, which has approximately four years remaining.
