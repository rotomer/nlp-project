Ensco plc Reports Second Quarter 2012 Results
Ordered Two Additional Ultra-Deepwater Drillships
Commenced ENSCO 8505 Initial Two-Year Contract
Hosted Naming Ceremony for ENSCO 8506 in Singapore
Promoted Executives as Part of Succession Planning Process
Sold Two More Jackups Reinforcing Continuous High-Grading Strategy
Celebrated One-Year Anniversary of Acquisition; Expense Synergies on Track
London--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ensco plc (NYSE: ESV) diluted earnings per share increased to $1.47 in second quarter 2012 from $0.59 in second quarter 2011. Professional fees, severance payments and other transaction-related costs to complete the 31 May 2011 acquisition were $25 million pre-tax, $0.14 per share, in second quarter 2011. Gains from the disposal of cold stacked jackup rigs were $13 million pre-tax, $0.06 per share, in second quarter 2012 and $13 million pre-tax, $0.02 per share, in second quarter 2011. Adjusted for these items, earnings per share approximately doubled to $1.41 in second quarter 2012.
Three months of operations from the 31 May 2011 acquisition are included in Ensco's second quarter 2012 results, compared to just one month in second quarter 2011.
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Dan Rabun stated, Our senior management team has done an excellent job over the past several years transforming Ensco to become the leading global offshore driller. Recently, we promoted several of our executives as part of Ensco's disciplined succession planning process. These promotions acknowledge their many achievements, including the successful integration of our acquisition, and we anticipate significant contributions from them in the future as we continue to grow our company.
Mr. Rabun added, During the quarter, ENSCO 8505 commenced its initial two-year contract and we held the naming ceremony for ENSCO 8506 that will commence its initial term contract in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico later this year. In light of continued growth in customer demand, we ordered two additional drillships that will extend the substantial earnings growth we achieved this quarter well into the future.
Revenues in second quarter 2012 were $1.072 billion, compared to $564 million a year ago. Excluding the effect of the acquisition, revenues grew $182 million, or 44%. A growing active fleet and increasing utilization and average day rates across the deepwater and jackup segments contributed to this increase.
Contract drilling expense was $490 million, up from $286 million in second quarter 2011. Excluding the effect of the acquisition, contract drilling expense increased $71 million, or 37%. More rigs in the active fleet and significantly higher utilization in the deepwater and jackup segments drove this increase along with a rise in unit labor costs.
Certain other items influenced contract drilling expense comparisons year to year: warranty claims received totaling $22 million related to incremental contract drilling expenses incurred in prior quarters reduced contract drilling expense in second quarter 2012; severance costs related to the acquisition increased contract drilling expense by $2 million, $0.01 per share, in second quarter 2011; and gains from asset disposals noted above in both second quarter 2012 and the year-ago period, each totaling $13 million, reduced contract drilling expense.
Projected synergies of approximately $50 million in contract drilling expense in 2012 related to the acquisition are on track.
1
Depreciation expense was $140 million, compared to $84 million a year ago. Excluding the effect of the acquisition, the $5 million increase was mostly due to the addition of ENSCO 8504 to the active fleet.
General and administrative expense declined to $36 million from $47 million in second quarter 2011. Professional fees, severance payments and other transaction-related costs associated with the acquisition were $23 million, $0.13 per share, in second quarter 2011. Adjusted for these items, general and administrative expense increased $11 million, mostly due to the effect of the acquisition. Projected synergies of approximately $50 million in general and administrative expense for 2012 related to the acquisition are on track.
Interest expense in second quarter 2012 was $30 million, net of $28 million of interest that was capitalized, compared to interest expense of $20 million in second quarter 2011, net of $22 million of interest that was capitalized. The increase in interest expense is due to additional debt incurred to finance the acquisition.
The effective tax rate in second quarter 2012 was 10.5%, compared to 19.6% in second quarter 2011. Excluding the impact of discrete tax items, the adjusted effective tax rates were approximately 11.3% and 14.6% for second quarter 2012 and 2011, respectively.
Segment Highlights
Deepwater
Deepwater segment revenues were $572 million in second quarter 2012, up from $232 million a year ago. Excluding the effect of the acquisition, revenues grew $93 million, or 71%. A new ultra-deepwater rig, ENSCO 8504, and significant increases in the average day rate and utilization contributed to this growth. In addition, ENSCO 7500 operated during second quarter 2012 but was undergoing an enhancement project in a shipyard during second quarter 2011.
The average day rate increased to $390,000 from $347,000 in second quarter 2011. Excluding the impact of the acquisition, the average day rate increased 25% to $422,000 in second quarter 2012, up from $337,000 a year ago. This average day rate increase was due in part to certain rigs earning lower standby or sublet rates in second quarter 2011 in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico following the Macondo incident.
Utilization improved five percentage points to 91% in second quarter 2012. Excluding the effect of the acquisition, utilization increased six percentage points to 89%, due mostly to the reactivation of ENSCO 7500. In second quarter 2012 and second quarter 2011, utilization for the Company's ENSCO 8500 Series
rigs was 96% and 99%, respectively. Ensco continues to benefit from standardization across rigs with uniform designs that provide more efficient construction, training, inventory management, daily operations and regulatory compliance.
Deepwater contract drilling expense was $233 million in second quarter 2012, up from $111 million in second quarter 2011. Warranty claims received lowered contract drilling expense by approximately $22 million in second quarter 2012 as noted above. Excluding the effect of the acquisition, contract drilling expense increased $32 million, or 63%. Adding ENSCO 8504 to the active fleet and the reactivation of ENSCO 7500 drove this increase.
Midwater
Prior to the acquisition, Ensco had no midwater rigs. The increase in revenues to $101 million from $36 million in second quarter 2011 is related to including a full quarter of the acquired company's midwater segment results in second quarter 2012 versus one month in second quarter 2011. The average day rate was $227,000 and utilization was 79% in second quarter 2012, compared to $237,000 and 79%, respectively, a year ago. Contract drilling expense in second quarter 2012 was $65 million, compared to $23 million in the prior year period. This increase also was related to including a full quarter of the acquired company's midwater segment results in second quarter 2012 versus one month in second quarter 2011.
2
Jackup
Jackup segment revenues grew 31% to $378 million, up from $289 million a year ago. The increase was mostly due to a $6,000 increase in the average day rate to $105,000 and an eight percentage point increase in utilization to 83%. The effect of the acquisition was negligible to revenue comparisons year to year.
Excluding the effect of the acquisition, the average day rate was $106,000 and utilization was 92%, compared to $99,000 and 77%, respectively, a year ago. A broad-based pickup in customer demand around the world drove the increase in utilization and average day rates.
Contract drilling expense increased by $31 million to $177 million, mostly due to a significant increase in utilization. Gains from asset disposals totaling $13 million in second quarter 2012 (ENSCO 59 and ENSCO 61) and $13 million in second quarter 2011 (ENSCO 95) reduced contract drilling expense in these periods. Excluding the effect of the acquisition and gains on disposals of rigs, the increase was $27 million, or 18%.
Other
Other is composed of managed drilling rig operations from the acquired company and the ENSCO I barge rig that has been cold stacked. The increase in revenues to $21 million from $7 million in second quarter 2011 is primarily related to the effect of including a full quarter of the acquired company's other segment results in second quarter 2012 versus one month in second quarter 2011. Similarly, contract drilling expense increased to $16 million from $7 million a year ago.
Strong Financial Position - 30 June 2012
Ensco maintained a strong financial position:
EVP and Chief Financial Officer Jay Swent commented, During the second quarter, we committed an incremental $1.3 billion to build two additional ultra-deepwater drillships in light of rising customer demand. These new rig orders were made following our February announcement of a 7 percent increase to our dividend that is now $1.50 per share on an annual basis.
Given our positive outlook for cash flow growth in the years ahead, Mr. Swent continued, we believe Ensco will have the flexibility to make further investments in our fleet and grow future dividends - all while maintaining a strong financial position. Capital management decisions will continue to be made with the clear objective to maximize shareholder returns.

Mr. Swent concluded, Our common stock now trades on the NYSE as ordinary shares following our conversion from American depository shares that we completed during the second quarter. We are now fully eligible to be reinstated into the S&P 500 Index, as previously reported.
