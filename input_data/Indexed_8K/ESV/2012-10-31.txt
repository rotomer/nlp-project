Ensco plc Reports Third Quarter 2012 Results
Record Revenue and Earnings
Earnings Per Share Grew 68%
Delivered ENSCO 8506 Ultra-Deepwater Semisubmersible
Sold Two More Rigs As Part of Continuous High-Grading Strategy
Celebrated 25-Year Anniversary
Ensco Added to S&P 500 Index
LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ensco plc (NYSE: ESV) diluted earnings per share increased 68% to $1.48 in third quarter 2012 from $0.88 a year ago. Earnings rose 68% to $344 million and operating income grew 59% to $415 million on record revenues of $1.124 billion in third quarter 2012. These increases were driven by a $22,000 increase in the average day rate and a seven percentage point increase in fleet-wide utilization, plus an 11% increase in deepwater segment rig days as new rigs were added to the active fleet.
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Dan Rabun stated, During the quarter, we delivered ENSCO 8506, the final rig in the ENSCO 8500 Series
. The rig will commence its initial term contract in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in January 2013 with Anadarko, a repeat customer that has contracted three of our ENSCO 8500 Series semisubmersibles. We and our customers are benefiting greatly from the advantages of standardization across our fleet, especially our 8500 Series rigs.
Mr. Rabun added, During the quarter, we celebrated Ensco's twenty-fifth anniversary. Our growth over the past quarter century has been remarkable and we now operate across six continents. Investments in our people and our fleet have been the key to our success. Ensco's growth will continue as we complete the construction of six additional rigs that will be delivered through the end of 2014.
Certain items influenced the year-to-year earnings per share comparisons. A loss of $8 million on the sale of ENSCO I and $4 million of impairments on certain property and equipment totaled $12 million, $0.05 per share, in third quarter 2012. Professional fees, severance payments and other acquisition-related costs in third quarter 2011 general and administrative expense totaled approximately $7 million, $0.03 per share. In addition, third quarter 2011 contract drilling expense included approximately $3 million, $0.01 per share, of severance and relocation costs related to the acquisition. Adjusted for these items, earnings per share increased approximately 66% year to year to $1.53 from $0.92.
Revenues grew 23% to $1.124 billion in third quarter 2012 from $916 million a year ago. A growing active fleet, as well as improved utilization and average day rates across the deepwater and jackup segments contributed to this increase.
Contract drilling expense was $523 million, up from $478 million in third quarter 2011. More rigs in the active fleet and significantly higher utilization in the deepwater and jackup segments drove this increase along with a rise in unit labor costs. Warranty claim settlements of $31 million related to lost revenues and costs incurred in prior periods reduced third quarter 2012 contract drilling expense, while an $11 million insurance claim settlement for ENSCO 69 reduced third quarter 2011 contract drilling expense. Adjusted for these items as well as the previously noted loss and impairments totaling $12 million in third quarter 2012, and acquisition-related costs equaling $3 million in third quarter 2011, contract drilling expense increased 12%.
1
Depreciation expense was $145 million, compared to $136 million a year ago. The $9 million increase was due to the addition of ENSCO 8504 and ENSCO 8505 to the active fleet.
General and administrative expense declined to $40 million from $41 million in third quarter 2011. In third quarter 2011, acquisition-related costs were $7 million as noted above.
Sequentially, general and administrative expense increased $4 million from $36 million in second quarter 2012, primarily due to additional compensation expense related to the previously announced retirement of a senior executive during third quarter 2012.
Interest expense in third quarter 2012 was $31 million, net of $26 million of interest that was capitalized, compared to interest expense of $31 million in third quarter 2011, net of $27 million of interest that was capitalized.
Segment Highlights
Deepwater
Deepwater segment revenues were $629 million in third quarter 2012, up 43% from $440 million a year ago. The commencement of ENSCO 8505, a full quarter of operations for ENSCO 8504, and increases in the average day rate and utilization contributed to this growth. The average day rate increased to $402,000 from $391,000 in third quarter 2011. Utilization improved sixteen percentage points to 90%. In addition, ENSCO 7500 operated during third quarter 2012 but was undergoing a shipyard enhancement project during third quarter 2011.
Deepwater contract drilling expense was $246 million in third quarter 2012, up from $233 million in third quarter 2011. More operating days for ENSCO 8505, ENSCO 8504 and ENSCO 7500 as well as improved utilization contributed to this increase. Adjusted for warranty claim settlements of $31 million noted above, contract drilling expense increased 19%.
Midwater
Midwater segment revenues declined to $94 million from $121 million in third quarter 2011. This decrease is due to a decline in utilization and average day rate. Utilization was 74% and the average day rate was $221,000 in third quarter 2012, compared to 89% and $239,000, respectively, a year ago. Contract drilling expense in third quarter 2012 was $65 million, compared to $72 million in the prior year period.
Jackup
Jackup segment revenues grew 15% to $381 million, up from $330 million a year ago. The increase was mostly due to a $9,000 increase in the average day rate to $109,000 and a six percentage point increase in utilization to 83%. A broad-based pickup in customer demand around the world drove the increase in utilization and average day rate.
Contract drilling expense increased $35 million to $190 million, mostly due to an increase in utilization. Third quarter 2011 contract drilling expense benefited from an $11 million gain from a cash settlement of the ENSCO 69 insurance claim. Adjusting for this item, contract drilling expense increased $24 million, or 14%.
Other
Other is composed of managed drilling rig operations and ENSCO I, a barge rig that was sold during third quarter 2012. Revenues decreased to $20 million from $24 million in third quarter 2011. This revenue decrease reflects a decline in average day rates to $66,000 from $87,000 a year ago.
Contract drilling expense was $22 million, compared to $18 million a year ago. Excluding an $8 million loss on the sale of ENSCO I, contract drilling expense declined $4 million year to year.

Strong Financial Position - 30 September 2012
Ensco maintained a strong financial position:
EVP and Chief Financial Officer Jay Swent commented, Capital expenditures for the first nine months of 2012 totaled $1.6 billion of which $1.2 billion, or 75%, was invested in new construction. These investments, coupled with $1.9 billion of remaining contractual commitments for rigs being constructed through 2014, will propel the future growth of our company.
We also continued to high-grade our fleet by selling a barge rig in the third quarter and a jackup rig in early October.
Mr. Swent concluded, Ensco was reinstated into the S&P 500 Index during the third quarter after we converted our NYSE listing to ordinary shares in the second quarter.
