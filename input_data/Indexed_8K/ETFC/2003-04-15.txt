(NYSE: ET) today announced results for its quarter ended March 31, 2003, reporting net income of $21 million, or $0.06 per share, compared to a net loss of $270 million, or $(0.78) per share, in the same quarter a year ago. The Company also reported net revenue for its quarter ended March 31, 2003 of $322 million, compared to $331 million for the same period a year ago. The Company reported net income from ongoing operations for the first quarter of $34 million or $0.10 per share, which was consistent with First Call estimates, compared to $27 million or $0.08 per share for the same period a year ago. In addition, the Company is reaffirming 2003 earnings guidance of $0.45-$0.55 per share from ongoing operations, or $0.30-$0.40 per share on a GAAP basis prior to restructuring charges of up to $(0.20) per Share. "E*TRADE Group's first quarter results demonstrate our ability to prudently manage operations and maximize growth opportunities, even amidst geopolitical concerns and challenging economic conditions," said Mitchell H. Caplan, Chief Executive Officer, E*TRADE Group, Inc. "Again this quarter, we have demonstrated the value of our diversified model. While brokerage revenue continued to show the impact of a challenging
E*TRADE Financial Results for the Quarter Ended March 31, 2003 Page 2 equities market, our fee and interest income from banking activities produced some of the best results we have experienced to date." Other highlights from the first quarter of 2003: o The Company increased free cash by $35 million over last quarter to $402 million and generated EBITDA(2) of $79 million. o E*TRADE Mortgage generated more than $2.5 billion in direct retail mortgage originations, with another $1.2 billion in the pipeline at quarter end. The Company also experienced growth in the correspondent side of its mortgage business producing more than $1.2 billion. o E*TRADE Bank grew net interest spread to 152 basis points, a 12 basis point increase from last quarter. o The Company continued to successfully cross-sell products and services, with 41 percent of FDIC-insured deposit products, 26 percent of mortgage products and 38 percent of home equity products sold into its existing household base. "We are committed to comprehensively evaluating everything we do to ensure we are creating value for our customers and shareholders," said Jarrett Lilien, President and Chief Operating Officer, E*TRADE Group, Inc. "As such, we will remain rigorous and disciplined in managing operations to deliver solid results, while continuing to introduce innovative products and services for our customers." The Company also announced its intent to finalize and implement a restructuring plan over the next two quarters based on a comprehensive evaluation of its businesses, products and services. Every business, initiative and investment was reexamined for adequate profitability. The plan maintains the infrastructure required to achieve the Company's growth potential when general economic conditions improve. The restructuring plan has two major elements: 1) The exit of unprofitable locations, including its E*TRADE Financial Center in New York, certain international locations and the consolidation of excess facilities, and reduction of excess square footage in offices located in Menlo Park and Rancho Cordova, CA. 2) The exit and write-off of unprofitable product offerings and initiatives - specifically, Stock Baskets, E*TRADE Financial Advisor and Personal Money Management. E*TRADE Group expects this plan to result in total pre-tax charges of up to $120 million dollars or $(0.20) per share over the next two quarters, providing for additional cost savings, estimated to total between $40 and $50 million dollars, or $0.07 to $0.08 per share annually. "The plan is designed to enhance short, intermediate and long-term profit performance," continued Lilien. "These savings better position the Company for continued sluggish economic conditions and create additional operating leverage when the markets return."

Explanation of Non-GAAP Measures and Certain Metrics In order to better assess the Company's financial operating results, management believes results from ongoing operations, ongoing operating margin, free cash, EBITDA and interest coverage are appropriate measures of evaluating the operating and liquidity performance of the Company. (1) Results From Ongoing Operations, Ongoing Operating Margin Results from ongoing operations exclude gain on early extinguishment of debt, amortization of other intangibles, acquisition-related expenses, the gain or loss on investments, unrealized losses on venture fund investments, the fair value adjustments of financial derivatives related to the impact of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, executive agreement and loan settlement, facility restructuring and other exit charges, and the cumulative effect of accounting changes. Ongoing operating margin excludes, in addition to the above, corporate interest income, corporate interest expense, equity in income of investments and other non-operating items. Management believes this measure to be appropriate in determining the operating performance of the Company's core business on an ongoing basis and represents the measure used by analysts and the investment community historically to evaluate company performance. With respect
E*TRADE Financial Results for the Quarter Ended March 31, 2003 Page 11 to 2003 guidance, the difference between earnings per share from ongoing operations and reported earnings estimates is based on the historical relationship between the two measures. The Company has determined that the use of historical relationships will likely provide the most accurate estimate of reported earnings rather than forecasting each of the components not included in calculating earnings from ongoing operations. These components are subject largely to changes in external events and are beyond the control of management and are therefore difficult to predict with appropriate accuracy. (2) Free Cash, EBITDA, Interest Coverage Free cash as defined by the Company represents cash held at the parent and excess regulatory capital at bank & brokerage, and is a metric used by management to measure business performance and liquidity. As a supplement to the GAAP cash flow provided in its Form 10-Ks and 10-Qs, management utilizes EBITDA, defined as net income (loss) before corporate interest expense, taxes, depreciation & amortization, and cumulative effect of accounting changes. Interest coverage is defined as EBITDA divided by corporate interest expense. It is important to note these metrics and non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, net income, operating margin, consolidated statements of cash flows, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
