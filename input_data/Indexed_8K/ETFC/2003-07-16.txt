(NYSE: ET) today announced results for its quarter ended June 30, 2003, reporting net income of $13 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, compared to net income of $33 million, or $0.09 per share, in the same quarter a year ago. This quarter's results include $76 million in restructuring and other exit charges, as announced last quarter. Also included in net income is $22 million in gain on investments primarily attributable to the Company's interest in E*TRADE Japan as a result of its recent merger with Softbank Investment Corporation. The Company reported net revenue for its quarter ended June 30, 2003 of $381 million, compared to $316 million for the same period a year ago. The Company reported net income from ongoing operations for the second quarter of $50 million or $0.14 per share, consistent with First Call estimates, compared to $39 million or $0.11 per share for the same period a year ago. Results for the quarter included a $7 million MJK litigation reserve in general and administrative expense. In addition, the Company
raised its 2003 earnings guidance to between $0.22-$0.27 per share on a GAAP basis including restructuring charges, or $0.52-$0.57 per share from ongoing operations. "E*TRADE Group's second quarter can be described in three words - validation, innovation and discipline," said Mitchell H. Caplan, Chief Executive Officer, E*TRADE Group, Inc. "The high-margin incremental revenue from increased trading activity we experienced this quarter, along with our cost discipline and product innovation, demonstrate our ability to deliver value to customers and shareholders. Further, this quarter's solid operating results reinforce the strength, flexibility and operating leverage of our diversified model." Other highlights from the second quarter of 2003: o E*TRADE Securities experienced a 41 percent sequential increase in daily average transactions supported by a 42 percent increase in trading volume among its active customers and a 40 percent increase among its main street customers during the quarter. o E*TRADE Mortgage generated $2.9 billion in direct retail mortgage originations, with another $1.7 billion in the pipeline at quarter end, an increase of 42 percent over the pipeline at the end of the first quarter. The Company also generated $1 billion in volume on the correspondent side of its mortgage business. o E*TRADE Bank's net interest spread for the quarter equaled 144 basis points, an 8 basis point decline from the first quarter. The results of its spread widening initiatives were dampened by the effect of continued prepayments, which helped drive mortgage volume. o The Company continued to successfully cross-sell products and services, with 26 percent of mortgage loan products and 36 percent of home equity loan products sold into its existing household base. "We continue to focus on building additional operating leverage into our business and are ahead of schedule in the implementation of our restructuring plan," said R. Jarrett Lilien, President and Chief Operating Officer, E*TRADE Group, Inc. "Moving forward, we will remain diligent in our efforts to reduce operating costs and are confident that these actions will provide long-term benefits to shareholders." In the second quarter, the Company progressed on its previously introduced restructuring plan. The Company took a restructuring and other exit charge of $76 million, and intends to take an additional charge of approximately $45 million next quarter, consistent with April's announcement. The second quarter charge includes: o Closure of its New York Center; o Elimination of unprofitable product offerings including stock baskets, E*TRADE FINANCIAL Advisor, and Personal Money Management; and o Closure of 43 E*TRADE FINANCIAL Target Zones. During the third quarter, the Company expects to complete its restructuring plan that will include: o Closure of its banking operations in Denmark;
o Discontinuation of local market equity trading in Hong Kong; and o Consolidation within its Menlo Park, Rancho Cordova and New York facilities. Through these and additional steps, E*TRADE Group expects to generate between $45 and $50 million in annual savings throughout the organization beginning in the second half of this year.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION AND ENDNOTES Explanation of Non-GAAP Measures and Certain Metrics In order to better assess the Company's financial operating results, management believes results from ongoing operations, ongoing operating margin, free cash, EBITDA and interest coverage are appropriate measures of evaluating the operating and liquidity performance of the Company. (1)Results From Ongoing Operations, Ongoing Operating Margin Results from ongoing operations exclude gain or loss on early extinguishment of debt, amortization of other intangibles, acquisition-related expenses, the gain or loss on investments, unrealized losses on venture funds, the fair value adjustments of financial derivatives related to the impact of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, executive agreement, restructuring and other exit charges, the cumulative effect of accounting changes and the adjustment to minority interest for the consolidating impact of E*TRADE FINANCIAL Advisor on restructuring and other exit charges and tax expense. Ongoing operating margin excludes, in addition to the above, corporate interest income, corporate interest expense, equity in income of investments and other non-operating items. Management believes this measure to be appropriate in determining the operating performance of the Company's core business on an ongoing basis and represents the measure used by analysts and the investment community historically to evaluate company performance. With respect to 2003 guidance, the difference between earnings per share from ongoing operations and reported earnings estimates is based on the historical relationship between the two measures. The Company has determined that the use of historical relationships will likely provide the most accurate estimate of reported earnings rather than forecasting each of the components not included in calculating earnings from ongoing operations. These components are subject largely to changes in external events, a number of which are beyond the control of management, and are therefore difficult to predict with appropriate accuracy. (2)Free Cash, EBITDA, Interest Coverage Free cash as defined by the Company represents cash held at the parent and excess regulatory capital at bank and brokerage, and is a metric used by management to measure business performance and liquidity.
