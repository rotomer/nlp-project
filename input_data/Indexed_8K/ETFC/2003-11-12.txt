"Under the guidance of Len Purkis, E*TRADE FINANCIAL has increased transparency in financial reporting, which has reinforced shareholder confidence while generating a more widespread understanding of the Company's diversified business model," said Mitchell H. Caplan, Chief Executive Officer, E*TRADE FINANCIAL. "I am extremely proud of what Len has accomplished during his more than five years with E*TRADE FINANCIAL, including the strength and depth of the finance team that he has built."
 
"As part of our commitment to sound succession planning, Len and I identified some time ago that Mr. Simmons was the natural successor to lead the finance organization. This year's strong corporate performance has established the right environment for a smooth transition," added Mr. Caplan. "The Board of Directors and I are confident in Rob's ability to lead ongoing efforts to ensure E*TRADE FINANCIAL's continued focus on transparency and financial discipline."
 
Mr. Simmons joined the Company in April 2001 as Treasurer. He has since served as Vice President, Finance and Corporate Treasurer, responsible for corporate finance, treasury and investor relations. Prior to joining the Company, Mr. Simmons held senior management positions at companies including Oracle and Iomega, where he lead public capital market and bank transactions during periods of rapid growth. He is a former Chairman of the Association for Financial Professionals, a 14,000-member organization dedicated to promoting best practices, education and
