SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION AND ENDNOTES
 
Explanation of Non-GAAP Measures and Certain Metrics
 
In order to better assess the Company's financial operating results, management believes operating margins, free cash, EBITDA and interest coverage are appropriate measures of evaluating the operating and liquidity performance of the Company.
 
Free Cash and Interest Coverage
 
Free cash as reported by the Company represents cash held at Parent and non-Bank or Brokerage subsidiaries less discretionary reserves and excess capital at Bank and Brokerage after regulatory capital requirements and the Company's own regulatory capital guidelines. The Company believes that free cash is a useful measure of the Company's liquidity as it excludes cash reflected on the balance sheet that may not be freely available to the Company. Interest coverage is defined as EBITDA divided by corporate interest expense.
 
It is important to note these metrics and other non-GAAP measures may involve judgment by management and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, net income, consolidated statements of cash flows, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
 
(1) For the three months ended March 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, diluted net income per share is calculated using the if converted' method, which includes the additional dilutive impact assuming conversion of the Company's subordinated convertible debt. Under the if converted' method the per share numerator excludes the interest expense and related amortization of offering costs from the convertible debt, net of tax, of $7.6 million and $7.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively. The denominator includes the shares issuable from the assumed conversion of the convertible debt of 45.4 million. For the three months ended March 31, 2003, the if converted' method is not used as its effect would be anti-dilutive.
 
(2) Eliminates intercompany payment made by Bank to Brokerage related to Sweep Deposit Account (SDA) relationships, swept daily from Brokerage to Bank, which began in the third quarter of 2003. Under this relationship, Bank pays Brokerage a negotiated rate that approximates market on the average SDA balance. Bank reflects this payment as advertising and market development expense and Brokerage reflects this payment as other revenues.
 
(3) Amounts and percentages may not calculate due to rounding.
 
(4) Consolidated operating margin is defined as income before other corporate items divided by net revenues. Operating margin for Brokerage and Bank is based on segment results.
 
(5) Q1'04 estimate.
 
(6) Amounts include a taxable equivalent increase in interest income of $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2004 and $0.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2003.
