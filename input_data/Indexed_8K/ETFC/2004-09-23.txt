Introduction
 
Purpose of the Code
 
Our employees, customers, potential customers, and shareholders expect the highest degree of ethics, honesty and fairness because they place their financial assets in our care.
 
The purpose of the Code of Professional Conduct (the "Code") is to protect and enhance the reputation and franchise of E*TRADE FINANCIAL
1
by setting standards for our behavior as its employees, officers, directors and agents.
 
The financial services industry is heavily regulated and simple adherence to the "letter of the law" is not what our employees, customers, potential customers, and shareholders expect. They expect the highest degree of ethics, honesty and fairness in all of our dealings because they place their financial assets in our care.
 
This Code  in concert with our corporate policies and procedures, applicable laws and regulations and sound judgment is critical to our continued success.
 
It is the responsibility of every employee to comply with all applicable laws and regulations and all provisions of the Code, as well as E*TRADE FINANCIAL's other corporate policies and procedures. All Company supervisors are responsible and accountable for monitoring the compliance of employees they manage.
 
CODE OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT
 
Implementing the Code
 
Exercising sound business judgment
 
E*TRADE FINANCIAL relies on you to exercise your best judgment and highest ethics in performing your job. When the Code articulates a specific standard of conduct, you must conform to it. However, no code of professional conduct can anticipate every legal or ethical issue that might arise in the course of our business.
 
In areas not specifically addressed in the Code, you must conduct yourself in the spirit of the Code, with the highest degree of ethics and with the aim of protecting E*TRADE FINANCIAL and its reputation. You should consider both whether a proposed course of action complies with all applicable laws and regulations and whether it could embarrass you or E*TRADE FINANCIAL.
 
You must therefore avoid not only actual misconduct but also the appearance of impropriety. Assume that any action you take will ultimately be publicized and consider how E*TRADE FINANCIAL (and you) would be perceived. When in doubt, seek guidance from your supervisor or appropriate E*TRADE FINANCIAL department.
 
Reporting Violations
 
You are E*TRADE FINANCIAL's first line of defense against civil or criminal liability and unethical business practices.
 
If you know of, observe, suspect or become aware of a violation of applicable laws or regulations or of the Code or E*TRADE FINANCIAL's related policies and procedures, you must report that information immediately to your direct supervisor or another appropriate representative of E*TRADE FINANCIAL's senior management. If appropriate or necessary, you must also report that information to Corporate Safety & Security, a more senior manager or to Human Resources, Legal or Compliance. If you believe that the person to whom you have so reported has not taken appropriate action, you must contact Human Resources, Legal or Compliance directly.
 
If you believe that you may have violated the law or E*TRADE FINANCIAL's standards, you must report your behavior to E*TRADE FINANCIAL immediately. The fact that you reported the violation, together with the degree of cooperation you display and whether the violation is intentional or unintentional, will be given consideration in an investigation and any resulting disciplinary action.
 
Upon learning of probable or actual misconduct, supervisors must notify Human Resources, Legal, Compliance, or Corporate Safety & Security, as appropriate, and, in consultation with the appropriate professional, take prompt, appropriate remedial action. Supervisors who fail to take appropriate action may be held responsible.
 
CODE OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT
 
The Company has engaged an outside firm to provide a confidential service through which you can anonymously report any suspected violations of law, concerns related to corporate governance, financial reporting (including Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance), sexual or other harassment, discrimination, theft, fraud, or threats to the safety of E*TRADE FINANCIAL employees. Contact information for making reports is available on Channel E*.
 
Unless responsible Company management learns of a problem, we cannot deal with it appropriately. Concealing improper conduct often compounds the problem and may delay or hamper responses that could prevent or mitigate actual damage.
 
You should contact your supervisor, Legal or Compliance with any questions about legal, regulatory or ethical issues.
 
Investigating Violations
 
All reported violations of applicable laws or regulations, the Code or E*TRADE FINANCIAL's related policies and procedures will be promptly investigated and will be treated confidentially to the extent required and practicable under the circumstances and consistent with enforcing the Code.
 
Preservation of Records
 
E*TRADE FINANCIAL is required by law and by industry regulation to maintain its books and records in good order and to memorialize the essential terms of a business agreement. Therefore, you should:
 
 
 
In conducting a review of your files, be careful not to discard:
 
 
 
 
CODE OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT
 
The Code of Professional Conduct and Your Employment
 
Code of Professional Conduct Is Not an Employment Contract
 
The policies and procedures of the Code form part of the terms and conditions of your employment. However, the Code is not a contract, express or implied, guaranteeing employment for any specific duration or entitling you to bonuses or other forms of compensation. Employment at E*TRADE FINANCIAL is "at will", meaning that either you or E*TRADE FINANCIAL may terminate this relationship at any time, with good cause or without cause.
 
Changes to the Code of Professional Conduct
 
E*TRADE FINANCIAL's policies and procedures stated in this Code are subject to change at the sole discretion of E*TRADE FINANCIAL. In addition, E*TRADE FINANCIAL may implement additional policies and procedures in the future that will be deemed part of the Code. It is your responsibility to be familiar at all times with the Code, as it may be revised or amended, and any other policies and procedures relevant to your responsibilities as an employee.
 
Consequences of Violating the Code of Professional Conduct
 
Violations of the Code may subject you to disciplinary action by E*TRADE FINANCIAL including  without limitation  warnings, reprimands, temporary suspensions, probation or termination of your employment. Disciplinary actions may be taken:
 
 
 
 
 
 
CODE OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT
 
E*TRADE FINANCIAL also must report certain activities to its regulators, which could give rise to regulatory or criminal investigations. The penalties for regulatory or criminal violations include significant fines, permanent bar from employment in the securities industry and, for criminal violations, incarceration.
 
Acknowledging the Code of Professional Conduct
 
When you have concluded your review of this revised Code, you must complete an acknowledgement form indicating that you have read the Code and that you understand and agree to abide by its requirements. New employees will also be required to acknowledge their receipt and understanding of the Code and their commitment to comply with it Failure to complete this acknowledgement may result in termination of your employment. Regardless of whether you have completed the acknowledgment, you must comply with the terms of the Code.
 
Abiding by the standards and procedures outlined in the Code and E*TRADE FINANCIAL's related policies and procedures is a condition of continued employment with E*TRADE FINANCIAL.
 
Questions
 
If you have any questions at any time concerning the Code or E*TRADE FINANCIAL's related policies and procedures, or feel the need to seek guidance with respect to a legal or ethical question, you should consult your supervisor, Human Resources, Legal or Compliance.
 
 
Standards of Conduct
 
General
 
Employees are responsible for reviewing and understanding the policies and procedures related to their work activities and are advised that the following summary is for general introductory purposes only.
 
The activities of E*TRADE FINANCIAL's employees must always be in full compliance with applicable laws and regulations and with the Code and E*TRADE FINANCIAL's related policies and procedures. If there is any doubt as to the legality of any proposed activity, seek advice from Legal or Compliance before the activity is undertaken.
 
This section of the Code outlines the general standards of conduct with respect to specific additional issues confronting employees, such as:
 
 
 
 
 
 
CODE OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT
 
Responsibilities under the Law
 
Many governmental and self-regulatory organizations ("SROs") supervise the activities of E*TRADE FINANCIAL and its employees. You must comply with all applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which E*TRADE FINANCIAL does business. To that end:
 
 
 
You may be held personally liable for improper or illegal acts committed during your employment. Such liability could subject you to civil or criminal penalties (fines or imprisonment), regulatory sanctions (censure, suspension or industry bar) and disciplinary action by E*TRADE FINANCIAL, up to and including termination of your employment.
 
The following is a general summary of the laws that apply to E*TRADE FINANCIAL. However, this summary cannot and does not address every possible situation that could arise in the course of E*TRADE FINANCIAL's business. Ignorance of the law or rules is neither a defense to nor an excuse from penalties or sanctions. Therefore, if you are uncertain about the laws of a particular jurisdiction or you are uncertain whether certain acts or practices comply with the law, you must contact Legal and Compliance.
 
Securities Laws
 
Because E*TRADE FINANCIAL is licensed and regulated in a number of jurisdictions, it is subject to numerous securities laws and rules. You must understand and obey all applicable laws.. Included among the many securities laws with which we must comply are rules concerning the proper reporting of financial information. We comply with generally accepted accounting principles in all of our filings. Any intentional effort to violate those principles, provide misleading financial information, improperly report revenue recognition, create "side letters", avoid revenue recognition or expense recognition will not be tolerated. Contact Brokerage Legal or Compliance for advice on specific transactions or issues.
 
Exchange and Self-Regulatory Organization Rules
 
E*TRADE FINANCIAL belongs to many exchanges and SROs that issue and enforce rules about trading in securities, commodities and related instruments, and about other aspects of E*TRADE FINANCIAL's business. You must be familiar with and abide by the rules applicable to your business unit. Violations of SRO rules can lead to penalties against you and E*TRADE FINANCIAL.
 
CODE OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT
 
Banking Laws and Regulations
 
Because E*TRADE FINANCIAL is licensed and regulated in a number of jurisdictions, it is subject to numerous banking laws and regulations. You must understand and obey all applicable laws. Contact Bank Legal or Compliance for advice on specific transactions or issues.
 
Licensing and Registration
 
Many jurisdictions require licensing or registration of individuals who perform certain activities in the financial services industry. These requirements apply to many individual E*TRADE FINANCIAL employees. If you have any questions about whether your activities require you to be licensed or registered, you should consult with your supervisor or Compliance.
 
For those employees who are registered, any material changes to the information provided at the time of registration (such as a change in name or residential address) must be provided to Compliance immediately.
 
Company Books and Records
 
E*TRADE FINANCIAL books and records must be correct in all significant respects. E*TRADE FINANCIAL expects you to be candid and accurate when providing information for these books and records. Every business transaction undertaken by E*TRADE FINANCIAL must be recorded correctly and in a timely manner in E*TRADE FINANCIAL books and records. You may not make any false or misleading entries.
 
Any payment made at your request on E*TRADE FINANCIAL's behalf must be supported by appropriate and correct documentation. In addition, corporate records must comply with regulatory requirements and Company policies.
 
Antitrust and Trade Regulation Laws
 
Many jurisdictions have enacted antitrust and trade regulation laws to ensure fair competition. Generally, these laws prohibit monopolization, price-fixing, overlapping boards of directors between certain types of companies, exclusive dealing and "tying" arrangements, price or service discrimination that diminishes competition, deceptive acts and unfair competition. Violations of these laws may result in civil or criminal liability and disciplinary action by E*TRADE FINANCIAL, up to and including termination of employment.
 
E*TRADE FINANCIAL operates in complex business environments and it is impossible to anticipate each circumstance in which antitrust and trade regulation issues may arise. Some forms of joint activities in the securities industry (underwriting syndicates, for example) are legally permissible, but others are not. You may confront antitrust and trade regulation issues in joint ventures, strategic investments, revenue sharing agreements, trade industry associations, and formal or informal meetings or conversations with competitors, suppliers and other third parties.
 
CODE OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT
 
Under no circumstances should you:
 
 
 
 
 
 
You should contact Legal if you have questions about any antitrust or trade regulation issue.
 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Anti-Bribery Statutes
 
If your job responsibilities include transactions with non-U.S. governments or government-controlled entities, public international organizations or non-U.S. political parties (including officials, employees or representatives of any of these entities), you should assume that the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") applies, regardless of where you are located.
 
The FCPA prohibits any payment or gift, or any offer or authorization of a payment or gift, to these entities or individuals in order to secure any improper business advantage, such as inducing the entity or individual to act favorably on, or influence others to act favorably on, business proposals or regulatory decisions. Such payments and gifts are forbidden even if they are customary in the country where they will be given.
 
The FCPA also prohibits payments to agents or intermediaries who would use the funds for prohibited purposes (and generally prohibit doing indirectly what may not be done directly). Therefore, E*TRADE FINANCIAL must select only reputable agents and must determine carefully their compensation amount. You must not hire an agent before you have obtained approval from Legal.
 
CODE OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT
 
Many countries in the world are now adopting statutes similar to the FCPA. In addition, virtually every country has a domestic anti-bribery statute, and many government agencies have their own rules governing the acceptance of gifts, travel or entertainment. Be aware that in some cases these statutes and rules may prohibit conduct that the FCPA would permit. Check with Legal and Compliance if you have any questions as to the acceptability of particular conduct under the FCPA or under the statutes or rules of any country in which you are doing business.
 
Economic Sanctions
 
The U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC") imposes economic sanctions against certain groups and countries, in order to further U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives. These countries and groups have included Cuba, North Korea, Libya, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Syria, Serbia and Montenegro, Liberia, Burma (Myanmar) and Zimbabwe. Sanctions may also apply to specifically designated nationals ("SDNs"), such as terrorists, narcotics traffickers, senior political figures, and persons designated as nationals of the sanctioned countries. Lists of all countries, groups and SDNs are published periodically by OFAC. You may access these lists at .
http://www.treas.gov/ofac
 
Under no circumstances may you open an account or undertake a transaction with a person or country on any OFAC list. If any person or entity on the OFAC list attempts to open an account or conduct a transaction with E*TRADE FINANCIAL, you must report this activity to Corporate Security Investigation or Risk Management. No business with any person or entity on the OFAC list will be permitted unless Legal and Compliance approve of the transaction. Countries and persons subject to sanctions are periodically added to or removed from the OFAC list. Therefore, you must keep current as to which countries and persons are subject to OFAC sanctions.
 
If you are located outside the U.S., different sanctions may be in force. You should consult local Legal, Compliance or Risk Management about potential sanctions.
 
Anti-Boycott Laws
 
U.S. law prohibits E*TRADE FINANCIAL from complying with or supporting a foreign country's boycott of a country "friendly" to the United States. Accordingly, employees who are U.S. residents or nationals, wherever located, may not refuse to do business with anyone for boycott-related reasons, furnish information requested for boycott reasons, or otherwise support a foreign boycott not sanctioned by the U.S.
 
If you are located outside the U.S., there may be local law that is the reverse of the U.S. anti-boycott law. You should consult local Legal and Compliance with any questions about the existence or effect of such laws.
 
CODE OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT
 
Currently, the best-known boycott with which U.S. law prohibits compliance is the Arab boycott of Israel and its nationals. With respect to this boycott, E*TRADE FINANCIAL is required to report annually all operations in or related to the boycotting countries  which may include Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Oman, Iraq, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Syria, Lebanon, United Arab Emirates, Libya, Republic of Yemen and others  to the U.S. Government. E*TRADE FINANCIAL must also report promptly any request to support or furnish information about this boycott, including any oral request received during a transaction.
 
Requests to support or furnish information about a boycott often arise during negotiations of contract terms. If you receive or learn of such a request, report it immediately to Legal.
 
Anti-Money Laundering Laws
 
The term "money laundering" covers any procedure that changes the identity of illegally obtained money so that it appears to have originated from a legitimate source. The USA PATRIOT Act and other federal laws require E*TRADE FINANCIAL to verify our customers' identities and to report any attempts to launder funds or conduct other suspicious activities.
 
Money laundering may occur not only in connection with new clients but also with new or existing accounts of established clients. Thus, you must be mindful of the problem of money laundering and constantly vigilant for signs of such activity. You must make every effort to know E*TRADE FINANCIAL's customers and to be aware at all times of what might constitute a suspicious transaction or behavior.
 
If you have grounds for suspecting money laundering, you should immediately inform Corporate Safety & Security and Risk Management. E*TRADE FINANCIAL's or its employees' conduct that assists money laundering could be a serious criminal offense. Failure to report suspicions of money laundering to the relevant authorities also may be an offense. Finally, do not alert the client of your suspicion, as this may also be an offense in certain jurisdictions.
 
If you have any questions concerning these issues, contact Legal, Corporate Safety & Security, or Risk Management.
 
Intellectual Property Protection
 
Most jurisdictions have some form of legal protection for intellectual property, including copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade secrets.
 
Copyright laws govern the display and reproduction of copyrighted material, which includes most books, magazines, newspapers, websites, research reports and software. You cannot display or reproduce copyrighted material without the permission of the copyright owner. Because copyright laws are complex, you should contact Legal with questions about displaying or reproducing material subject to copyright protection.
 
CODE OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT
 
Patent laws govern the right to make, use and sell a patented invention. Certain software applications and business methods may be subject to patent protection. If you develop a software application, business method or invention during the course of your employment with E*TRADE FINANCIAL, you should document the development and consult with your direct supervisor and Legal concerning its patentability. Similarly, before introducing a software application, business method or invention that is similar to that of another company, particularly in the financial services industry, you should consult with Legal about infringement risks.
 
Trademark laws govern the use of product or brand names, service marks, and trade names that the public associates with a particular product or service. You must obtain prior approval of all uses of E*TRADE FINANCIAL's trademarks, service marks and trade names from Legal or Compliance- Advertising Review as appropriate. In addition, before adopting any new names for product or service offerings, you must have Legal approval.
 
Trade secret protection governs the disclosure and use of information that the owner has endeavored to hold secret, usually because the information provides the owner with a competitive advantage. It is not necessary that the information be subject to copyright, patent or trademark protection in order to constitute a trade secret.
 
E*TRADE FINANCIAL policies govern situations in which you develop, create or receive any materials subject to intellectual property protection in the course of your employment for E*TRADE FINANCIAL. If you have any questions concerning these policies, review E*TRADE FINANCIAL's policy on "Handling Proprietary and Confidential Information", outlined in this Code, and consult with Legal.
 
Privacy Laws and Regulations
 
E*TRADE FINANCIAL employees are required as a term of their employment to agree to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive non-public customer and employee information to which they may be exposed from time-to-time during the course of their employment. It is advised that prior to providing any such information to business partners and/or any third party that internal policies and procedures be reviewed, such as E*TRADE FINANCIAL's privacy policy and any opt-out provisions which may be applicable, and should there still be questions about the release of the information, that advice of the Legal and Compliance departments be obtained. In addition to privacy policies, laws and regulations require that E*TRADE FINANCIAL maintain the confidentiality of customer information. Laws may prohibit sharing of customer data even among E*TRADE FINANCIAL entities. For questions regarding privacy contact Legal or Compliance.
 
CODE OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT
 
Reporting Inappropriate Activity
 
If at any time, you become aware of activity of any employee (including yourself) which you believe is or may be a violation of any law, rule or regulation, or that is a breach of our customer's faith in our integrity, you have an obligation to report that activity to your supervisor, Human Resources, Legal or Compliance immediately.
 
Any reported incident of inappropriate activity will be investigated promptly. The investigation may include individual interviews with the parties involved and when necessary, with individuals who may have observed the alleged conduct or may have other relevant knowledge. The investigation may also involve the review of any systems utilized in the alleged transaction and any relevant electronic or written information.
 
Retaliation is prohibited.
 
E*TRADE FINANCIAL prohibits retaliation against any individual who, in good faith, reports any inappropriate activity or any individual who participates in, or otherwise supports an investigation of such reports. Anyone who retaliates against an individual under such circumstances will be subject to disciplinary actions up to and including termination of employment.
 
Dealing with Third Parties
 
Authority to Act on Behalf of E*TRADE FINANCIAL
 
Do not commit E*TRADE FINANCIAL to any obligations unless you have the authority to do so. Except with respect to trading activities performed by registered brokers and customer service representatives on behalf of our brokerage customers in the regular course of business, only certain individuals (typically Members of the entity's Board of Directors, and its Officers, EVPs, or VPs) may enter into commitments on behalf of E*TRADE FINANCIAL, which includes signing contracts on behalf of any E*TRADE FINANCIAL entity. All contracts must be reviewed and approved by Procurement and/or Legal (depending on the subject of the agreement) before they are signed. Certain contracts also require approval of the Technology Infrastructure Committee or Finance. In addition, various business units and departments have special approval requirements for commitments of a certain size. You should consult with your supervisor to learn of any such policies. You should contact Legal with any questions regarding authority to bind E*TRADE FINANCIAL to obligations with third parties.
 
CODE OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT
 
Conflicts of Interest
 
Separate and apart from applicable laws and regulations, you have a primary business and ethical responsibility to E*TRADE FINANCIAL to avoid any activity or relationship that may interfere, or have the appearance of interfering, with the performance of your duties in a loyal, efficient manner to the best of your ability. Such activities and relationships, called "conflicts of interest", include any interest, relationship or activity that is incompatible or has the appearance of being incompatible with the best interests of E*TRADE FINANCIAL, or which potentially affects or has the appearance of affecting your objectivity as an employee.
 
Depending on your particular responsibilities, potential conflict of interest situations may include, but are not limited to:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CODE OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT
 
Your involvement in certain outside activities may require the prior approval of E*TRADE FINANCIAL. If you have any questions, consult E*TRADE FINANCIAL's policies on "Outside Business Activities" and contact Compliance.
 
Gifts to and from Customers, Suppliers and Others
 
You and your family members may not accept gifts or special favors (other than of nominal value) from any person or organization with which E*TRADE FINANCIAL has a current or potential business relationship. In addition, Company policy, applicable laws, regulations or SRO rules, may prohibit you from giving gifts in excess of specified monetary levels (or of any value) to third parties, including persons employed with a stock exchange, regulatory authority, financial institution, broker, dealer, or the news or financial information media. Contact Compliance about specific restrictions or the meaning of "nominal value".
 
When permitted by law and consistent with accepted business practices and ethical standards, you may give gifts of nominal value to customers, suppliers and persons who have referred business to E*TRADE FINANCIAL. No gifts should be given if public disclosure of the circumstances would embarrass you or E*TRADE FINANCIAL. Special restrictions often apply to gifts to and entertainment of government employees, even of nominal value.
 
Customer entertainment expenses are generally not considered gifts if employees are present, the provision of the entertainment is not routine, and the expense is not excessive. Contact your supervisor or Compliance for further details.
 
You must provide complete and accurate expense reports for all gifts and entertainment expenses paid for by E*TRADE FINANCIAL.
 
Selecting Suppliers
 
Evaluate competing suppliers by their long-term financial stability and the price and quality of the product or service. Personal relationships should not be (or be perceived to be) a factor in the decision to use a particular supplier. However, you may consider E*TRADE FINANCIAL's interest in developing mutually productive business relationships.
 
Requests for Legal, Financial or Tax Advice
 
Customers may request legal, financial or tax advice about securities or other issues because they assume that you are knowledgeable about those areas. Company policy generally prohibits customer service representatives, relationship managers, and brokers giving legal, financial or tax advice to a customer unless you are specifically approved to give investment advice as a member of the investment specialist group. Customers should be advised to consult their own counsel for legal advice and to consult their own tax advisors for tax guidance.
 
CODE OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT
 
Advertising
 
Only Marketing is authorized to arrange for advertising on E*TRADE FINANCIAL's behalf. All advertising, including announcements of Company transactions, must be coordinated, approved and placed by Marketing.
 
Charitable Contributions
 
E*TRADE FINANCIAL coordinates all of its charitable contribution programs including sponsorship or participation in charity events through local site leadership committees with oversight by the CEO and President in conjunction with Board approval.
 
Political Action Committee
 
E*TRADE FINANCIAL supports a Political Action Committee (the "E*TRADE PAC") as authorized by, and in accordance with, federal law. E*TRADE PAC funds are used to make contributions to candidates for federal office. Participation or membership in the E*TRADE PAC is completely voluntary. E*TRADE FINANCIAL does not require any of its employees to participate in the E*TRADE PAC and no employee should ever feel obligated in any way to participate. Participation in the E*TRADE PAC will not help or hinder the employee in any way, and E*TRADE FINANCIAL will not tolerate any reprisal, including physical force, job discrimination or any threat of employment retaliation or financial disadvantage to any employee who chooses not to participate. Any employee who feels that anyone has placed any undue pressure on them to participate in the E*TRADE PAC should immediately report the situation to a Human Resources representative, any representative of the Government Affairs office or Legal and the matter will be resolved as soon as possible.
 
Communications with the Media and other Third Parties
 
E*TRADE FINANCIAL values its relationships with the press and maintains routine, ongoing contact with key publications and broadcast outlets around the world.
 
Because our corporate communications strategy is coordinated across the Company's various business lines, and because our corporate messaging must be very concise and consistent, only trained and approved spokespersons, working in coordination with Corporate Communications, are authorized to represent the Company to the Media. Refer all unsolicited press inquiries to Corporate Communications. Do not initiate contact with the press without consulting Corporate Communications. This includes "letters to the editor" or comments to journalists about specific matters that relate to E*TRADE FINANCIAL's businesses and those that identify you as an employee of E*TRADE FINANCIAL. With respect to press inquiries about legal or regulatory matters or customer complaints, you should follow the procedures in the Code entitled "Your Duties Regarding Litigation, Investigations, Inquiries and Complaints".
 
CODE OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT
 
Corporate Communications must authorize participation in personal profiles or stories about "lifestyle" in which E*TRADE FINANCIAL is referenced. If you wish to appear in articles regarding your activities outside E*TRADE FINANCIAL (philanthropic activities or hobbies, for example), you may do so. However, do not identify yourself as an employee or use E*TRADE FINANCIAL's name or facilities in any way without approval from Corporate Communications.
 
All press releases mentioning E*TRADE FINANCIAL must be approved by Corporate Communications and Legal and Compliance before being released by E*TRADE FINANCIAL, its customers, suppliers or any other organization.
 
You may not endorse the products or services of suppliers or customers on behalf of E*TRADE FINANCIAL unless expressly authorized by Corporate Communications. This includes commenting in press articles (including in-house publications) and participating in testimonial advertising, promotional brochures or annual reports. In addition, you may not permit third parties to use E*TRADE FINANCIAL's name for endorsements of their products or services without the approval of Corporate Communications.
 
You may not participate in any chat room or bulletin board discussions (whether in real-time or not in real-time) in any way representing the business, activities and/or opinions of E*TRADE FINANCIAL.
 
Outside Lawyers
 
Our corporate legal strategy is coordinated across the lines of our business units to control costs and maintain consistent legal positions. For that reason you must obtain clearance from Legal before speaking to an outside lawyer or law firm on behalf of E*TRADE FINANCIAL. Only Legal can retain outside lawyers or law firms on E*TRADE FINANCIAL's behalf.
 
Treatment of Privileged Communications and Documents
 
Treat all communications and documents seeking or receiving legal advice and preparing for litigation as confidential and subject to attorney-client and/or work product privileges. This includes communications with, and documents created at the direction of, by or for, Legal or E*TRADE FINANCIAL's outside counsel. Communicate such information and documents within E*TRADE FINANCIAL on a strict need-to-know basis and only at the direction of Legal. Do not disclose such information or documents to anyone outside E*TRADE FINANCIAL unless specifically directed to do so by the Company's legal counsel.
 
Documents that are prepared for, or at the direction of, Legal or outside counsel, should be marked "Attorney-Client Communication, Privileged and Confidential". Note, however, that merely marking documents "Privileged" or "Confidential" does not provide legal protection from disclosure to a regulatory authority or a
 
CODE OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT
 
litigation adversary unless the document satisfies the legal requirements for the relevant privilege. Documents are not protected from disclosure to a regulator or in litigation merely because the author copies someone in Legal or because the author believes the documents are personal or private. Moreover, some jurisdictions do not have the legal concept of privilege.
 
If you have any questions about whether a communication or document is privileged, consult Legal.
 
Litigation, Investigations, Inquiries and Complaints
 
Notification
 
You must notify your direct supervisor and Legal and Compliance immediately in the event that you:
 
 
 
 
 
You must contact Legal and Compliance concerning the above matters at the earliest opportunity and provide updates and reports on the status of such matters on a regular basis. You must not take any action concerning E*TRADE FINANCIAL in the above matters without first contacting Legal and Compliance. Failure to do so may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of your employment.
 
Cooperation
 
During litigation, an internal investigation, or a governmental, regulatory or administrative inquiry, audit or exam involving E*TRADE FINANCIAL, you may be asked to provide information, including documents, testimony or statements to Legal, Compliance, E*TRADE FINANCIAL's outside counsel, or a governmental, regulatory or administrative authority. You may also be asked to meet with these entities or persons. As a term and condition of your employment, you must consider such a request your top priority and you must cooperate fully
 
CODE OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT
 
with any such request, in coordination with Legal and Compliance, and you must provide truthful information. You are not permitted to discuss any such request, or the substance of any discussions or requests, with any third party, especially including an individual who is the subject of an investigation or inquiry, without prior approval from Legal and Compliance. If you are contacted by an individual who is the subject of an investigation and are requested to provide information about the investigation, you must inform the individual that you are not permitted to disclose any information and you must contact Legal and Compliance to inform them of the contact. Failure to do so may subject you to civil or criminal liability and may be grounds for termination of your employment. In addition, E*TRADE FINANCIAL may provide information, including documents, testimony or statements, concerning you or your activities at E*TRADE FINANCIAL in connection with requests or inquiries by governmental, regulatory or administrative authorities. E*TRADE FINANCIAL strictly complies with all laws relating to the privacy of your personal information and will ordinarily provide you notice prior to producing any such information, however, it may not be appropriate to provide such notice in every circumstance. E*TRADE FINANCIAL retains the discretion to provide any information in accordance with applicable law.
 
Communication with Governmental and Regulatory Authorities
 
Legal and Compliance supervise all contacts with governmental and regulatory bodies and attorneys regarding subpoenas, investigations, inquiries and requests. Do not initiate any contacts with a governmental or regulatory body or attorney regarding such matters without the permission of Legal or Compliance. If you are contacted about a subpoena, investigation, inquiry or request, follow the procedures outlined above.
 
Government Affairs supervises all other contacts with government and legislative officials and regulatory bodies. Do not initiate any contacts with such entities or individuals without coordinating with Government Affairs. If you are contacted about public policy or political matters, do make any commitments or provide any substantive information unless and until Government Affairs has approved the response.
 
Communication with the Media and other Third Parties

If you believe that, you have experienced conduct that is contrary to this policy or have concerns about such matters, remember that often the first and most effective resource is to tell the individual that undertook the conduct that you felt the behavior was inappropriate.

Of course, at any time you may report the matter to your direct supervisor, Human Resources, Legal or Corporate Safety & Security or any individual at the Business Leader or Chief level with whom you feel comfortable.

The decision to accept such information may preclude E*TRADE FINANCIAL from doing other business involving the customer or counterparty. In general, do not accept information from a customer or counterparty beyond that which is necessary for the customer or counterparty to conduct its business with E*TRADE FINANCIAL. In addition, you should comply with any policies and preclearance procedures of your business unit or department concerning the acceptance of proprietary or confidential information.
 
Confidentiality Agreements
 
No E*TRADE FINANCIAL employee is authorized to enter into any confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement without prior review and approval of the agreement by Legal. When presented with information you believe may be "confidential" to the third party, determine if the party intends for the information to be protected by a confidentiality agreement. If so, do not accept that confidential information until the agreement has been reviewed and approved by Legal.
 
You must comply with the terms of any confidentiality agreement governing proprietary or confidential information in your possession or control, including procedures that call for the return or destruction of such information, consistent with E*TRADE FINANCIAL's document retention policies and applicable law.

Proprietary or confidential information learned from one customer cannot be used for any other purpose or for any other customer.
 
Handling Materials Containing Proprietary or Confidential Information
 
Do not display, review or discuss proprietary or confidential information in public places (such as elevators, restaurants, airplanes or other areas where you may be overheard) or in front of outside vendors or other third parties.

Proprietary or Confidential Information Concerning Securities
 
When proprietary or confidential information might affect the price of a security or other financial instrument, or the decision to buy or sell securities or other financial instruments, the laws concerning insider trading also govern your responsibilities. E*TRADE FINANCIAL has developed strict procedures to ensure compliance with the laws of each jurisdiction in which it does business. These procedures are critical to the protection of E*TRADE FINANCIAL franchise and are described in E*TRADE FINANCIAL policy on the "Treatment of Inside Information", which is outlined in this Code.

You may not disclose proprietary or confidential information of E*TRADE FINANCIAL or any third party outside of the Company at any time, including after termination of employment. You may not take such proprietary or confidential information when leaving E*TRADE FINANCIAL or use or disclose such information for your personal benefit or for the benefit of your new employer or prospective new employer. You may not permit its disclosure or use by any third party.
 
In exceptional circumstances, the Company may grant a written waiver of the prohibitions on post-employment disclosure. The grant of a waiver is in the sole discretion of E*TRADE FINANCIAL and will occur only if, among other things, the party receiving the proprietary or confidential information signs a formal non-disclosure agreement prepared by Legal.
 
This policy does not restrict you from obtaining employment in any capacity elsewhere, provided you do not use or disclose proprietary or confidential information.

Policy on the Treatment of Inside Information
 
Definition of Inside Information
 
(also called material non-public or price-sensitive information) is defined under federal, state and other jurisdictional laws as non-public information about a securities issuer (e.g., a public company) that may have an impact on the price of a security or other financial instrument or that a reasonable investor would be likely to consider important in making an investment decision.

INSIDE INFORMATION
 
 
 
 
Consider all facts and circumstances in determining whether an item is inside information. Contact Legal or Risk Management if you have any questions as to whether an item is inside information.
 
CODE OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT
 
Prohibited Uses of Inside Information
 
You may not trade, encourage others to trade, or recommend securities or other financial instruments based on inside information. In most jurisdictions, securities laws require those with inside information about a securities issuer to refrain from disclosing such information to others and desist from trading in or recommending the purchases or sale of securities or other financial instruments based upon such information. It is a violation of Company policy and the law of most jurisdictions for persons to whom insiders have communicated (or "tipped") inside information to disclose such information to others or to trade in or recommend securities or other financial instruments based on inside information.
 
Guidelines for Information about E*TRADE FINANCIAL
 
Publicly disclosed information about E*TRADE FINANCIAL must be accurate and not misleading. Do not discuss any inside information about E*TRADE FINANCIAL's business outside the Company. Refer all shareholder or securities analyst inquiries to Investor Relations.
 
Handling Rumors
 
You may be violating the law if you trade based on a rumor.
 
If you believe that a rumor or piece of unsubstantiated information may have been circulated deliberately to influence the market for securities or other financial instruments of a publicly trade company, report the situation promptly to Risk Management or Compliance. Do not trade based on the rumors or take any other action, without the prior approval of Compliance. You may discuss widely circulated unsubstantiated information if you disclose that it is unsubstantiated.
 
Consequences of Misusing Inside Information
 
The misuse of inside information may result in, among other things, regulatory inquiry, litigation, adverse publicity for E*TRADE FINANCIAL (and you) and disciplinary action by E*TRADE FINANCIAL, up to and including termination of your employment. Misusing inside information may also end your career in the securities industry and result in civil and criminal penalties, including incarceration.
 
The Restricted List
 
The Restricted List, which is maintained by and Compliance, is one of the tools E*TRADE FINANCIAL uses to monitor and ensure that regulatory requirements are met. Employees are not permitted to trade in the securities (or other instruments) of issues on the restricted list. Consult Compliance when questions arise or when you believe an exception is warranted. If you become aware of a violation, notify Compliance immediately. Corrective action should not be taken without Compliance approval.
 
A company may be on the Restricted List for many reasons. Therefore, you should not make any assumptions as to why an issuer has been listed. The Restricted List changes so you should consult the list before trading.
 
CODE OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT
 
The Restricted List is proprietary and confidential information. You may not distribute the Restricted List outside E*TRADE FINANCIAL. If you have a joint account or an account in your name that is managed by another pursuant to a power of attorney, it is your responsibility to ensure that no trades of securities on the Restricted List are made in these accounts.
 
 
Outside Business Activities
 
Laws and regulations restrict your ability to become an officer, director or employee of a company not affiliated with E*TRADE FINANCIAL or to engage in certain outside business activities.

Similarly, you do not need approval to purchase products or services of certain financial service companies, such as insurance policies.
 
Note that your involvement in an outside business activity that begins permissibly may evolve into a violation of applicable laws and regulations if the nature or scope of that business or your participation changes.

Unless permitted in writing in advance by Legal and Compliance, you may not, individually or in concert with other employees or other persons, directly own, or control a position in a public company that would require a filing under the securities laws and regulations. Filing obligations in some jurisdictions may start with a position of 3% or more of the outstanding equity of a public company.
 
You also are prohibited from trading in concert with other employees, even if taken together you and other employees control less than 3% of the outstanding equity in question.
 
Futures, Options on Futures and other Derivative Securities
 
Generally you may not trade in futures, options on futures, forward contracts, non-listed warrants, physical commodities, options on physical commodities and currencies. Exceptions must be approved by Compliance.
 
You may trade listed equity options, index options, listed foreign currency options and equity warrants, subject to Company and business unit or departmental trading policies. Employees in non-U.S. locations should also consult local policies.
 
CODE OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT
 
Information about Customer or Company Orders
 
You may not "front run" customer or Company orders (for example, trade for your own account before a customer or Company order in the same security or a derivative based on that security).
 
You may not "piggyback" or "shadow" on customer trades (for example, engage in trades identical to those that a customer has completed).
 
The Restricted List
 
You generally may not trade in securities on the Restricted List as outlined in this Code. Consult with Compliance if you have any questions about a restricted security.
 
Rules for Particular Accounts and Transactions
 
Transactions in E*TRADE FINANCIAL's Securities
 
E*TRADE FINANCIAL has specific rules, as set forth below, that govern your transactions in E*TRADE FINANCIAL's securities.
 
You must follow these specific rules:
 
 
 
 
Managed Accounts
 
With prior written approval of Compliance, you may appoint outside managers (for example, trust companies, banks or registered investment advisers) who exercise full discretion. If an outside manager handles an account, complete investment discretion must be granted. You may not participate, directly or
 
CODE OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT
 
indirectly, in individual investment decisions or be made aware of such decisions before transactions are executed. Trading on this account must still avoid any issuer on the Restricted List and there may be no trading in any securities except during an open window period.
 
This restriction does not preclude you from establishing investment guidelines for the manager, such as indicating industries in which you desire to invest, the types of securities you want to purchase or your overall investment objectives. However, those guidelines may not be changed so frequently as to give the appearance that you are actually directing account investments.
 
Money Market and Open-End Mutual Fund Accounts
 
You may maintain money market and mutual fund accounts away from E*TRADE FINANCIAL as long as the accounts have no brokerage facilities. However, you are strongly encouraged to maintain those accounts at E*TRADE FINANCIAL. You may trade money market and open-end mutual funds freely in your Company account. While you may invest in open-end mutual funds, you should consider the appearance of impropriety that may result from investments in sector funds.
 
Dividend Reinvestment Plans ("DRIPs")
 
You may open a dividend reinvestment plan account with an issuer. Your business unit or department employee trading policies and the Restricted List policy apply to the initial investment in a DRIP and any additional cash contributions to a DRIP.
 
So long as the issue is not on the Restricted List, you may liquidate the plan directly with the issuer.
 
Investment Clubs
 
You may not participate in investment clubs in which members pool their funds to make investments in securities without approval from Compliance.
 
Direct Purchase of U.S. Treasury Bills, Bonds or Notes
 
You may purchase U.S. Treasury bills, bonds or notes through E*TRADE FINANCIAL or by direct subscription to the Federal Reserve Bank. You may not purchase these instruments through other financial institutions.
 
Procedures for Employee Securities Accounts
 
Entry of Orders
 
All orders for Employee Securities Accounts must be entered through the web site or automated telephone system, and with rare exception (only if a problem arises) via a "live broker" through the Employee Branch. You may not enter orders yourself or by another employee in any other way.
 
CODE OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT
 
You may not view, or ask another employee to view, any other employee account for any reason without the express approval of Compliance. You may not ask any other employee to view your account for any reason without express approval of Compliance.
 
Review of Employee Transactions
 
Every transaction in an Employee Securities Account is or may be reviewed by Legal, Compliance or Corporate Safety & Security for the purpose of:
 
 
 
 
 
 
E*TRADE FINANCIAL also may provide information and materials concerning transactions in Employee Securities Accounts to regulatory and governmental authorities.
 
CODE OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT
 
 
I hereby acknowledge that I have received a copy of the E*TRADE FINANCIAL Code of Professional Conduct (the "Code") and that I have reviewed the contents of the Code.
 
I understand that as an E*TRADE FINANCIAL employee I am responsible for complying with all laws and regulations applicable to our business and all provisions of the Code, as well as all other corporate policies and procedures.
 
After reviewing the Code, if I realize there are any provisions with which I have not complied (for example, maintaining a brokerage or trading account with an outside broker without prior approval from Compliance, participating in an investment club or serving on the board of directors of an outside entity without prior approval from Compliance), I will promptly notify the appropriate department so that the matter can be brought in line with the requirements of the Code.
 
I understand that if I have any questions about the application of the Code in any situation, I should seek guidance from my supervisor or appropriate E*TRADE FINANCIAL department.
