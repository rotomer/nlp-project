The Company raised the lower end of its 2004 GAAP earnings guidance, thereby narrowing the range to between $0.92 and $0.97 per share from between $0.87 and $0.97 per share. Based on the $0.75 per share the Company earned through the third quarter, including a $0.07 gain on the sale of E*TRADE Access in the second quarter, the revised guidance implies a fourth quarter earnings range of between $0.17 and $0.22 per share.
 
"As we continue to achieve greater integration of our trading, investing, banking and lending solutions, we are strengthening our strategic position and increasing our competitive advantage through a differentiated value proposition," said Mitchell H. Caplan, Chief Executive Officer, E*TRADE FINANCIAL Corporation. "By remaining disciplined and focused, we achieved greater operational efficiencies and delivered strong results in the third quarter, despite the seasonal weakness in the brokerage environment."

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION AND ENDNOTES
 
Explanation of Non-GAAP Measures and Certain Metrics
 
In order to better assess the Company's financial operating results, management believes operating margins, free cash, EBITDA and interest coverage are appropriate measures of evaluating the operating and liquidity performance of the Company.
 
Free Cash, EBITDA and Interest Coverage
 
Free cash as reported by the Company represents cash held at Parent and non-Bank or Brokerage subsidiaries less discretionary reserves and excess capital at Bank and Brokerage after regulatory capital requirements and the Company's own regulatory capital guidelines. The Company believes that free cash is a useful measure of the Company's liquidity as it excludes cash reflected on the balance sheet that may not be freely available to the Company.
 
Additionally, management utilizes EBITDA and interest coverage to measure business performance. EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) from continuing operations before corporate interest expense, taxes and depreciation & amortization. Interest coverage is defined as EBITDA divided by corporate interest expense.
 
It is important to note these metrics and other non-GAAP measures may involve judgment by management and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, net income, consolidated statements of cash flows, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
 
(1) For the three months ended June 30, 2004 and the nine months ended September 30, 2004, diluted earnings per share is calculated using the if converted' method, which includes the additional dilutive impact assuming conversion of the Company's subordinated convertible debt. Under the if converted' method the per share numerator excludes the interest expense and related amortization of offering costs from the convertible debt, net of tax, of $7.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2004, and $17.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2004. The denominator includes the shares issuable from the assumed conversion of the convertible debt of 39.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2004 and 31.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2004. For all other periods presented the if converted' method is not used as its effect would be anti-dilutive.
 
(2) Eliminates intercompany payment made by Bank to Brokerage related to Sweep Deposit Account (SDA) relationships, swept daily from Brokerage to Bank, which began in the third quarter of 2003. Under this relationship, Bank pays Brokerage a negotiated rate that approximates market on the average SDA balance. Bank reflects this payment as advertising and market development expense and Brokerage reflects this payment as other revenues.
 
(3) Amounts and percentages may not calculate due to rounding.
 
(4) Consolidated operating margin is defined as income before other income, income taxes and discontinued operations divided by net revenues. Operating margin for Brokerage and Bank is based on segment results.
 
(5) Q304 estimate.

(6) Amounts include a taxable equivalent increase in interest income of $2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2004 and $0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2003.
