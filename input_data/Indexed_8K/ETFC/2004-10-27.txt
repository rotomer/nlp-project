Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
 
 
(i) Conforming changes made to reflect Delaware law. Certain provisions of the Bylaws have been amended to conform to Delaware law including provisions affecting notice requirements for stockholder meetings, adjourment of stockholder meetings and waiver of notice requirements. The changes do not adversely affect the rights of stockholders and include changes such as allowing for remote voting at meetings and electronic waivers of notice by stockholders. In addition, the provision regarding preparation of voting lists has been deleted as these rights are mandated by Delaware law and do not need to be specifically included in the Bylaws.
 
(ii) Shareholder proposals. Section 1.09 of the Bylaws has been amended to require certain additional information from stockholders who propose to bring business before an annual stockholders' meeting including the text of any proposed resolutions or amendments to the bylaws, the identity, stock ownership and any material interest in the proposal of any beneficial owner on whose behalf a proposal is being made, a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of the company's stock and intends to appear at the meeting and a representation that the stockholder intends to deliver a proxy statement or form of proxy to stockholders in support of a proposal.
 
(iii) Number of directors. The Bylaws have been amended to allow for at least six and no more than twelve directors, with the exact number of directors to be determined by the Board from time to time.
 
(iv) Officers. Article 3 of the Bylaws has been amended to allow the Board to define the specific powers and duties of the officers of the company from time to time.
 
(v) Indemnification. Article 5 of the Bylaws has been amended to allow the company to indemnify certain agents of the company who serve as a director, officer, employee or agent of another entity at the request of the Company as determined by the Board, consistent with Delaware law.
 
(vi) Interested Party Transactions. The provisions related to interested party transactions have been deleted for the avoidance of confusion as the company's Corporate Governance Guidelines and Code of Conduct address this and related topics. Both the Corporate Governance Guidelines and Code of Conduct are available on the company's website at www.etrade.com.
 
A copy of the Amended and Restated Bylaws as adopted as well as a version marked to show all modifications is furnished as an exhibit to this Form 8-K.

Unless otherwise provided by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (""), such notice shall be given not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting. Any meeting of stockholders may be adjourned to another time and to any other place at which a meeting of stockholders may be held under these Bylaws by the stockholders present or represented at the meeting and entitled to vote, although less than a quorum, or, if no stockholder is present, by any officer entitled to preside at or to act as Secretary of such meeting. When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place (whether or not a quorum is present), notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time, place, if any, thereof and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken.

To assure indemnification under this Article of all such persons who are determined by the corporation or otherwise to be or to have been "fiduciaries" of any employee benefit plan of the corporation which may exist from time to time, the provisions of this Article shall be interpreted as follows: an "other enterprise" shall be deemed to include such an employee benefit plan, including, without limitation, any plan of the corporation which is governed by the Act of Congress entitled "Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974," as amended from time to time; the corporation shall be deemed to have requested a person to serve an employee benefit plan where the performance by such person of his duties to the corporation also imposes duties on, or otherwise involves services by, such person to the plan or participants or beneficiaries of the plan; excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan pursuant to such Act of Congress shall be deemed "fines"; and action taken or omitted by a person with respect to an employee benefit plan in the performance of such person's duties for a purpose reasonably believed by such person to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan shall be deemed to be for a purpose which is not opposed to the best interests of the corporation.
 
The corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, provide indemnification and the advancement of expenses, to any agent of the corporation and to any person (other than directors and officers of the corporation, who shall be entitled to indemnification under the first paragraph of this Article 5) who is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, to the extent and to such effect as the Board of Directors shall determine to be appropriate and permitted by Delaware Law.
