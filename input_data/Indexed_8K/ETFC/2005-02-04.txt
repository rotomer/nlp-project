Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
Update of January 26, 2005 Announcement of Financial Results for Q4, 2004
 
On February 4, 2005, the Company revised preliminary financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2004.
 
As previously disclosed, the Company in October 2004 participated in an arbitration proceeding against its former Israeli licensee. The Company had terminated the Israeli company's technology license and sought damages based on failures to perform its obligations and the licensee had counterclaimed for unspecified damages for such termination. The Company has restructured or terminated all of its foreign licenses similar to those in Israel.
 
On February 1, 2005, the Company received notice of the Tribunal's partial award to the licensee of approximately $10.2 million, plus pre-judgment interest of approximately $1.5 million, and is currently evaluating a request for costs and attorneys fees. The Company strongly believes that the award is unjustified and is evaluating its options, which include a motion to vacate the award. Because the award represents a subsequent event under relevant accounting principles, the Company will record a charge to facility restructuring and other exit charges of approximately $14.5 million in its fourth quarter 2004 financial results.
 
Due to this subsequent event, the Company is reducing its earnings results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2004 by approximately $8.6 million, net of tax, or $0.02 per diluted share to net income of approximately $89.8 million or $0.24 per diluted share, and approximately $380.5 million or $0.99 per diluted share, respectively.
.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
