SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION AND ENDNOTES
 
Explanation of Non-GAAP Measures and Certain Metrics
 
In order to better assess the Company's financial operating results, management believes consolidated operating margins, free cash, EBITDA and interest coverage are appropriate measures of evaluating the operating and liquidity performance of the Company. We believe that the elimination of certain items from these measures is helpful to analysts and investors who may wish to use some or all of this information to analyze our current performance, prospects and valuation. Our management uses non-GAAP information internally to evaluate our operating performance and in formulating our budget for future periods.
 
Consolidated Operating Margin
 
Consolidated operating margin is defined as income before other income, income taxes and discontinued operations divided by net revenues. Operating margin for Retail and Institutional is based on segment results. Our consolidated statements of operations contain a reconciliation of income before other income, income taxes and discontinued operations to net income.
 
Free Cash
 
Free cash as reported by the Company represents cash held at Parent and non-Bank or Brokerage subsidiaries less discretionary reserves and excess capital at Bank and Brokerage after regulatory capital requirements and the Company's own regulatory capital guidelines. The Company believes that free cash is a useful measure of the Company's liquidity as it excludes cash reflected on the balance sheet that may not be freely available to the Company.
 
EBITDA
 
EBITDA represents net income from continuing operations before corporate interest expense, taxes and depreciation and amortization. Management believes that EBITDA provides a useful additional measure of our performance by excluding certain non-cash charges and expenses that are not directly related to the performance of our business.
 
Interest Coverage
 
Interest coverage represents EBITDA divided by corporate interest expense. Management believes that by excluding the charges and expenses that are excluded from EBITDA, interest coverage provides a useful additional measure of our ability to continue to meet our interest obligations and our liquidity.
 
It is important to note these metrics and other non-GAAP measures may involve judgment by management and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, net income, consolidated statements of cash flows, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. For complete information on the items excluded from these non-GAAP measures, please see our financial statements and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition" that will be included in the periodic report we expect to file with the SEC with respect to the financial periods discussed herein.
 
(1) Operating income is defined as income before other income, income taxes and discontinued operations.
 
(2) Operating margin is defined as income before other income, income taxes and discontinued operations divided by net revenues. Operating margin for Retail and Institutional is based on segment results.
 
(3) For the three months ended March 31, 2004, diluted earnings per share is calculated using the if converted' method, which includes the additional dilutive impact assuming conversion of the Company's subordinated convertible debt. Under the if converted' method, the per share numerator excludes the interest expense and related amortization of offering costs from the convertible debt, net of tax, of $7.6 million. The denominator includes the shares issuable from the assumed conversion of the convertible debt of 45.4 million. For all other periods presented the if converted' method is not used as its effect would be anti-dilutive.
 
(4) Reflects elimination of transactions between Retail and Institutional segments, which include deposit transfer pricing, servicing and orderflow rebates.
 
(5) Amounts and percentages may not calculate due to rounding.
 
(6) Q105 estimate.
 
(7) Amounts include a taxable equivalent increase in interest income of $2.6 million and $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
