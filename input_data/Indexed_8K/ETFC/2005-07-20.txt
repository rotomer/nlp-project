 E*TRADE FINANCIAL Corporation (NYSE: ET) today announced results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2005, reporting net income of $101.6 million, or $0.27 per diluted share. Consolidated net revenue for the second quarter increased 3 percent to $391.3 million from $381.5 million a year ago. The Company continued to see significant growth in net interest income, which increased 35 percent year over year to $208.2 million and represented 53 percent of Total Net Revenue. Total retail client assets increased to $96.8 billion, including $18.7 billion in retail customer cash, representing a 10 percent increase over the year ago period. Retail customer margin debt balances at quarter end also increased 10 percent from a year ago to $2.28 billion.
New York, July 20, 2005
 
In the second quarter, the Company made the strategic decision to exit the proprietary and hybrid trading business within E*TRADE Professional, and is in negotiations to sell its RV and marine loan origination and servicing business. The results of these businesses in the second quarter of 2005 are presented as a $6.7 million after-tax loss from discontinued operations. Therefore, net income from continuing operations increased to $0.29 in the second quarter from $0.26 a year ago. Prior periods presented have been adjusted for the discontinuation of these businesses.
 
The Company increased and narrowed its 2005 GAAP earnings guidance range to $0.96 - $1.06 per share.
 
"We continue to drive strong and steady performance by appealing to new customers with integrated product solutions, leveraging our ability to monetize customer cash across our Retail and Institutional segments and controlling operating expenses," said Mitchell H. Caplan, Chief Executive Officer, E*TRADE FINANCIAL Corporation. "Through this discipline, we have made decisions and delivered results that have put the Company on track to deliver a third consecutive year of record results, while moving us closer to our goal of delivering a consolidated return on equity of nearly 20 percent and an operating margin of 40 percent in fiscal 2006."

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION AND ENDNOTES
 
Explanation of Non-GAAP Measures and Certain Metrics
 
In order to better assess the Company's financial operating results, management believes consolidated operating margins, free cash, EBITDA and interest coverage are appropriate measures of evaluating the operating and liquidity performance of the Company. We believe that the elimination of certain items from these measures is helpful to analysts and investors who may wish to use some or all of this information to analyze our current performance, prospects and valuation. Our management uses non-GAAP information internally to evaluate our operating performance and in formulating our budget for future periods.
 
Consolidated Operating Margin
 
Consolidated operating margin is defined as income before other income, income taxes and discontinued operations divided by net revenues. Operating margin for Retail and Institutional is based on segment results. Our consolidated statements of operations contain a reconciliation of income before other income, income taxes and discontinued operations to net income.
 
Free Cash
 
Free cash as reported by the Company represents cash held at Parent and non-Bank or Brokerage subsidiaries less discretionary reserves and excess capital at Bank and Brokerage after regulatory capital requirements and the Company's own regulatory capital guidelines. The Company believes that free cash is a useful measure of the Company's liquidity as it excludes cash reflected on the balance sheet that may not be freely available to the Company.
 
EBITDA
 
EBITDA represents net income from continuing operations before corporate interest expense, taxes and depreciation and amortization. Management believes that EBITDA provides a useful additional measure of our performance by excluding certain non-cash charges and expenses that are not directly related to the performance of our business.
 
Interest Coverage
 
Interest coverage represents EBITDA divided by corporate interest expense. Management believes that by excluding the charges and expenses that are excluded from EBITDA, interest coverage provides a useful additional measure of our ability to continue to meet our interest obligations and our liquidity.
 
It is important to note these metrics and other non-GAAP measures may involve judgment by management and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, net income, consolidated statements of cash flows, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. For complete information on the items excluded from these non-GAAP measures, please see our financial statements and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition" that will be included in the periodic report we expect to file with the SEC with respect to the financial periods discussed herein.
 
(1) Operating margin is defined as income before other income, income taxes and discontinued operations divided by net revenues. Operating margin for Retail and Institutional is based on segment results.
 
(2) For the three and six months ended June 30, 2004, diluted earnings per share is calculated using the if converted' method, which includes the additional dilutive impact assuming conversion of the Company's subordinated convertible debt. Under the if converted' method, the per share numerator excludes the interest expense and related amortization of offering costs from the convertible debt, net of tax, of $7.4 million and $15.1 million, respectively. The denominator includes the shares issuable from the assumed conversion of the convertible debt of 39.9 million and 42.7 million, respectively. For all other periods presented the if converted' method is not used as its effect would be anti-dilutive.
 
(3) Reflects elimination of transactions between Retail and Institutional segments, which include deposit transfer pricing, servicing and orderflow rebates.
 
(4) Amounts and percentages may not calculate due to rounding.
 
(5) Q205 estimate.
 
(6) Amounts include a taxable equivalent increase in interest income of $2.7 million and $1.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
