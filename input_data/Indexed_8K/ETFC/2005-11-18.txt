Indemnity and Contribution
 
fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter, Forward Seller or Forward Counterparty furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter, Forward Seller or Forward Counterparty through you expressly for use therein; provided, however, that the foregoing indemnity shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter from whom the person asserting any such loss, claims, damages or liabilities purchased Shares, or any person controlling such Underwriter, if a copy of the applicable Prospectus (as then amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) was not sent or given by or on behalf of such Underwriter to such person at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the Shares to such person, and if the applicable Prospectus (as so amended or supplemented) would have cured the defect giving rise to such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, unless such failure is the result of noncompliance by the Company with Section 6(a) hereof.
 
(b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each Forward Seller, and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives, each person, if any, who controls any Forward Seller within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each affiliate of any Forward Seller within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to such Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto.
 
(c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 7(a) or 7(b), such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of
indemnified party
indemnifying party
 
more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 7(a), and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 7(b). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
 
(d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 7(a) or 7(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other hand from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 7(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 7(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company (which benefits shall include the proceeds to be received by the Company pursuant to the Forward Agreements), the Forward Sellers and the Underwriters in connection with the offering of the Shares shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Shares (before deducting expenses) received by the Company (which benefits shall include the proceeds to be received by the Company pursuant to the Forward Agreements), the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, and the spread received by the Forward Sellers, net of any costs associated therewith, as reasonably determined by the Forward Counterparties, bear to the aggregate Public Offering Price of the Shares. The relative fault of the Company, the Forward Sellers and the Underwriters shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such
 
statement or omission. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the respective number of Shares they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
 
(e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 7(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
pro rata
 
(f) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 7 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, Forward Seller or Forward Counterparty, any person controlling any Underwriter, Forward Seller or Forward Counterparty or any affiliate of any Underwriter, Forward Seller or Forward Counterparty or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Shares.
 
8. . The Underwriters may terminate this Agreement by notice given by you to the Company and each Forward Seller, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on, or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq National Market, the Chicago Board of Options Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade or in any other relevant exchange, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over the counter market, (iii) a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, (iv) any moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in your judgment, is material and adverse and which, singly or together with any other event specified in this clause (v), makes it, in your judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus.
Termination
 
9. . This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.

If, on the Closing Date or an Option Closing Date, as the case may be, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Shares that it has or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate number of Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one tenth of the aggregate number of the Shares to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the number of Firm Shares set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule I-A bears to the aggregate number of Firm Shares set forth opposite the names of all such non defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as you may specify, to purchase the Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; that in no event shall the number of Shares that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section 9 by an amount in excess of one ninth of such number of Shares without the written consent of such Underwriter. If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Firm Shares and the aggregate number of Firm Shares with respect to which such default occurs is more than one tenth of the aggregate number of Firm Shares to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to you and the Company for the purchase of such Firm Shares are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In any such case either you, the Company or each Forward Seller shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. If, on an Option Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Additional Shares and the aggregate number of Additional Shares with respect to which such default occurs is more than one tenth of the aggregate number of Additional Shares to be purchased on such Option Closing Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall have the option to (i) terminate their obligation hereunder to purchase the Additional Shares to be sold on such Option Closing Date or (ii) purchase not less than the number of Additional Shares that such non-defaulting Underwriters would have been obligated to purchase in the absence of such default. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
provided
 
If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters and the Forward Sellers (without duplication) or such Underwriters and the Forward Sellers as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out of pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters and Forward Sellers in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder.
 
10. . (a) In the event that (i) all of the conditions to effectiveness set forth in Section 3 of the applicable Forward Agreement are not satisfied on or prior to the Closing Date or the Option Conditions are not satisfied on the Option
Additional Issuance and Sale by the Company
 
Closing Date, as the case may be, and a Forward Seller elects, pursuant to Section 2(b) or 2(c), not to deliver the Firm Shares or the Additional Shares, or (ii) in the commercially reasonable judgment of a Forward Counterparty, its affiliated Forward Seller is unable to borrow and deliver for sale under this Agreement all of the Firm Shares or Additional Shares set forth in Schedule I-B opposite the name of such affiliated Forward Seller or if, in such Forward Counterparty's commercially reasonable judgment, it would entail a stock loan cost in excess of 62.5 basis points per annum, the Company shall issue and sell in whole but not in part a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of shares that such Forward Seller does not deliver. The Representatives shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date or an Option Closing Date, as the case may be, for a period not exceeding one (1) business day in order to effect any required changes in any documents or arrangements.
 
(b) A Forward Seller shall have no liability whatsoever for any Shares it does not deliver to the Underwriters or any other party if such Forward Seller (i) elects, pursuant to Section 2(b) or 2(c) not to deliver Shares because all of the conditions to effectiveness set forth in Section 3 of the applicable Forward Agreement or the Option Conditions, as applicable, have not been satisfied or (ii) is unable to borrow and deliver for sale under this Agreement all of the Shares it is required to deliver hereunder or if, in the relevant Forward Counterparty's commercially reasonable judgment, it would entail a stock loan cost in excess of a rate equal to 62.5 basis points per annum.
 
11. . (a) This Agreement, together with any contemporaneous written agreements and any prior written agreements (to the extent not superseded by this Agreement) that relate to the offering of the Securities, represents the entire agreement between the Company and the Underwriters with respect to the preparation of the Prospectus, the conduct of the offering, and the purchase and sale of the Securities.

7. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each affiliate of any Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use therein; , that the foregoing indemnity shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter from whom the person asserting any such loss, claims, damages or liabilities purchased Securities, or any person controlling such Underwriter, if a copy of the applicable Prospectus (as then amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) was not sent or given by or on behalf of such Underwriter to such person at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the Securities to such person, and if the applicable Prospectus (as so amended or supplemented) would have cured the defect giving rise to such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, unless such failure is the result of noncompliance by the Company with Section 6(a) hereof. The Company also agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Morgan Stanley and each person, if any, who controls Morgan Stanley within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act, or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments incurred as a result of Morgan Stanley's participation as a "qualified independent underwriter" within the meaning of Rule 2720 of the National Association of Securities Dealers' Conduct Rules in connection with the offering of the Securities, except for any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and judgments resulting from Morgan Stanley's, or such controlling person's, willful misconduct.
Indemnity and Contribution
provided, however
 
(b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity
 
from the Company to such Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto.
 
(c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 7(a) or 7(b), such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 7(a), and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 7(b). Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 7(a) hereof in respect of such action or proceeding, then in addition to such separate firm for the indemnified parties, the indemnifying party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of not more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for Morgan Stanley in its capacity as a "qualified independent underwriter" and all persons, if any, who control Morgan Stanley within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.

indemnifying party
 
(d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 7(a) or 7(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 7(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 7(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate Public Offering Price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of Securities they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
 
(e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 7(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
pro rata
 
(f) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 7 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this
 
Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, any person controlling any Underwriter or any affiliate of any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Securities.
 
8. . The Underwriters may terminate this Agreement by notice given by you to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on, or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq National Market, the Chicago Board of Options Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade or in any other relevant exchange, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over the counter market, (iii) a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, (iv) any moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in your judgment, is material and adverse and which, singly or together with any other event specified in this clause (v), makes it, in your judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus.
Termination
 
9. . This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
Effectiveness; Defaulting Underwriters
 
If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities that it has or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate principal amount of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule I bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as you may specify, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; that in no event shall the principal amount of Securities that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section 9 by an amount in excess of one ninth of such principal amount of Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter. If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities and the aggregate principal amount of Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to you and the Company for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In any such case either you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
provided
 
If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out of pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder.
 
10. . This Agreement, together with any contemporaneous written agreements and any prior written agreements (to the extent not superseded by this Agreement) that relate to the offering of the Securities, represents the entire agreement between the Company and the Underwriters with respect to the preparation of the Prospectus, the conduct of the offering, and the purchase and sale of the Securities.
Entire Agreement
 
11. The Company acknowledges that in connection with the offering of the Securities: (i) the Underwriters have acted at arms length, are not agents of, and owe no fiduciary duties to, the Company or any other person, (ii) the Underwriters owe the Company only those duties and obligations set forth in this Agreement and (iii) the Underwriters may have interests that differ from those of the Company. The Company waives to the full extent permitted by applicable law any claims it may have against the Underwriters arising from an alleged breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the offering of the Securities.
No Fiduciary Duty.

7. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each affiliate of any Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use therein; provided, however, that the foregoing indemnity shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased Securities, or any person controlling such Underwriter, if a copy of the applicable Prospectus (as then amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) was not sent or given by or on behalf of such Underwriter to such person at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the Securities to such person, and if the applicable Prospectus (as so amended or supplemented) would have cured the defect giving rise to such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, unless such failure is the result of noncompliance by the Company with Section 6(a) hereof. The Company also agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
Indemnity and Contribution
 
Morgan Stanley and each person, if any, who controls Morgan Stanley within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act, or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments incurred as a result of Morgan Stanley's participation as a "qualified independent underwriter" within the meaning of Rule 2720 of the National Association of Securities Dealers' Conduct Rules in connection with the offering of the Securities, except for any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and judgments resulting from Morgan Stanley's, or such controlling person's, willful misconduct.
 
(b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to such Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto.
 
(c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 7(a) or 7(b), such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 7(a), and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 7(b). Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 7(a) hereof in respect of such action or proceeding, then in addition to such separate firm for the indemnified parties, the indemnifying party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of not more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for Morgan Stanley in its capacity as a "qualified independent underwriter" and all persons, if any, who control Morgan Stanley within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding
indemnified party
indemnifying party
 
the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
 
(d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 7(a) or 7(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 7(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 7(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate Public Offering Price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the respective number of Securities they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
 
(e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 7(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.
pro rata
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
 
(f) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 7 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, any person controlling any Underwriter or any affiliate of any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Securities.
 
8. . The Underwriters may terminate this Agreement by notice given by you to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on, or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq National Market, the Chicago Board of Options Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade or in any other relevant exchange, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over the counter market, (iii) a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, (iv) any moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in your judgment, is material and adverse and which, singly or together with any other event specified in this clause (v), makes it, in your judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus.
Termination
 
9. . This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
Effectiveness; Defaulting Underwriters
 
If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities that it has or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate number of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one tenth of the aggregate number of the Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the number of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule I bears to the aggregate number of Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as you may specify, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; that in no event shall the number of Shares that any Underwriter
provided
 
has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section 9 by an amount in excess of one ninth of such number of Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter. If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities and the aggregate number of Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one tenth of the aggregate number of Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to you and the Company for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In any such case either you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
 
If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out of pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder.
 
10. . (a) This Agreement, together with any contemporaneous written agreements and any prior written agreements (to the extent not superseded by this Agreement) that relate to the offering of the Securities, represents the entire agreement between the Company and the Underwriters with respect to the preparation of the Prospectus, the conduct of the offering, and the purchase and sale of the Securities.
Entire Agreement
 
11. . The Company acknowledges that in connection with the offering of the Securities: (i) the Underwriters have acted at arms length, are not agents of, and owe no fiduciary duties to, the Company or any other person, (ii) the Underwriters owe the Company only those duties and obligations set forth in this Agreement and (iii) the Underwriters may have interests that differ from those of the Company. The Company waives to the full extent permitted by applicable law any claims it may have against the Underwriters arising from an alleged breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the offering of the Securities.
Fiduciary Duty
 
12. . This Agreement may be signed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.

(g) Counsel for the Remarketing Agent, shall have furnished to the Remarketing Agent its opinion, addressed to the Remarketing Agent and dated the applicable Remarketing Date, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Remarketing Agent.
 
(h) Subsequent to the Commencement Date and prior to the applicable Remarketing Date, there shall not have occurred any downgrading, nor does the Company have any knowledge of any threatened or pending downgrading, of the Company's or any of its subsidiaries' claims-paying ability rating or financial strength rating by A.M. Best Company, Inc., Standard & Poor's Rating Group, Moody's Investor Service, Inc., Fitch Ratings, Ltd. or any other "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act that currently has publicly released a rating of the claims-paying ability or financial strength of the Company or any subsidiary.
 
(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Remarketing Agent, each person, if any, who controls the Remarketing Agent within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and each affiliate of the Remarketing Agent within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus (if used within the period, if any, that delivery of such Registration Statement, Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus is required pursuant to the Securities Act and as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to the Remarketing Agent furnished to the Company in writing by the Remarketing Agent expressly for use therein; provided, however, that the foregoing indemnity agreement with respect to any Preliminary Prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of the Remarketing Agent, or any person controlling the Remarketing Agent or any affiliate of the Remarketing Agent within the meaning of Rule 405 of the Securities Act, if a copy of the Prospectus (as then amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendment or supplements thereto) was not sent or given by or on behalf of the Remarketing Agent to such person, if required by law so to have been delivered, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the Remarketed Notes to such person, and if the Prospectus (as so amended or supplemented) would have cured the defect giving rise to such loss, claim, damage or liability, unless such failure is the result of noncompliance by the Company with Section 5(a)(6) hereof.
 
(b) The Remarketing Agent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the directors of the Company, the officers of the Company who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but only with reference to information relating to the Remarketing Agent furnished to the Company in writing by the Remarketing Agent expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto.
 
(c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought
pursuant to Section 7(a) or Section 7(b), such person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for (i) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for the Remarketing Agent and all persons, if any who control the Remarketing Agent within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act or who are affiliates of the Remarketing Agent within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act and (ii) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either such Section, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. In the case of any such separate firm for the Remarketing Agent and such control persons and affiliates of the Remarketing Agent, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Remarketing Agent. In the case of any such separate firm for the Company and such directors, officers and control persons of the Company, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Company. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
 
 
(a) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 7(a) or Section 7(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to under such paragraph, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such
losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) if the indemnifying party is the Company, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the indemnified party or parties on the other hand from the Remarketing of the Remarketed Notes, (ii) if the Remarketing Agent is the indemnifying party, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the Remarketing Agent's relative fault on one hand and the indemnified party or parties on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities or (iii) if the allocation provided by Section 8(a)(i) or Section 8(a)(ii) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in Section 8(a)(i) above or the relative fault referred to in Section 8(a)(ii) above but also the relative fault (in cases covered by Section 8(a)(ii)) or the relative benefits (in cases covered by Section 8(a)(i)) of the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and of the indemnified party or parties on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on one hand, and the Remarketing Agent, on the other hand, in connection with the Remarketing shall be deemed to be in the same proportions as the aggregate principal amount of the Remarketed Notes less the Remarketing Fee on the one hand and the Remarketing Fee on the other hand bear to the aggregate principal amount of the Remarketed Notes. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agent on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Remarketing Agent and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
(b) The Company and the Remarketing Agent agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 8(a). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, the Remarketing Agent shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the Remarketing Fee exceeds the amount of any damages that the Remarketing Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in Section 7 and Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
 
(c) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in Section 7 and Section 8 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless
of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Remarketing Agent, any person controlling the Remarketing Agent or any affiliate of the Remarketing Agent or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Remarketed Notes.
 
 
The Remarketing Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder, and the Company may remove the Remarketing Agent, by giving 30 days' prior written notice, in the case of a resignation, to the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent and, in the case of a removal, to the removed Remarketing Agent and the Purchase Contract Agent; provided, however, that no such resignation nor any such removal shall become effective until the Company shall have appointed at least one nationally recognized broker-dealer as successor Remarketing Agent and such successor Remarketing Agent shall have entered into a remarketing agreement with the Company, in which it shall have agreed to conduct the Remarketing in accordance with the Transaction Documents in all material respects.
 
In any such case, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to appoint a successor Remarketing Agent and enter into such a remarketing agreement with such person as soon as reasonably practicable. The provisions of Section 7 and Section 8 shall survive the resignation or removal of any Remarketing Agent pursuant to this Agreement.
 
 
The Remarketing Agent, when acting as a Remarketing Agent or in its individual or any other capacity, may, to the extent permitted by law, buy, sell, hold and deal in any of the Remarketed Notes, Corporate Units, Treasury Units or any of the securities of the Company (together, the "Securities"). The Remarketing Agent may exercise any vote or join in any action which any beneficial owner of such Securities may be entitled to exercise or take pursuant to the Indenture with like effect as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder. The Remarketing Agent, in its individual capacity, either as principal or agent, may also engage in or have an interest in any financial or other transaction with the Company as freely as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder.
 
 
The duties and obligations of the Remarketing Agent shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents. No implied covenants or obligations of or against the Remarketing Agent shall be read into
this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents. In the absence of bad faith on the part of the Remarketing Agent, the Remarketing Agent may conclusively rely upon any document furnished to it, as to the truth of the statements expressed in any of such documents. The Remarketing Agent shall be protected in acting upon any document or communication reasonably believed by it to have been signed, presented or made by the proper party or parties except as otherwise set forth herein. The Remarketing Agent shall have no obligation to determine whether there is any limitation under applicable law on the Reset Rate on the Notes or, if there is any such limitation, the maximum permissible Reset Rate on the Notes, and it shall rely solely upon written notice from the Company (which the Company agrees to provide prior to the eighth Business Day before the Initial Remarketing Date) as to whether or not there is any such limitation and, if so, the maximum permissible Reset Rate. The Remarketing Agent, acting under this Agreement, shall incur no liability to the Company or to any holder of Remarketed Notes in its individual capacity or as Remarketing Agent for any action or failure to act, on its part in connection with a Remarketing or otherwise, except if such liability is judicially determined to have resulted from its failure to comply with the material terms of this Agreement or bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part. The provisions of this Section 11 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall survive the resignation or removal of any Remarketing Agent pursuant to this Agreement.
 
 
This Agreement shall automatically terminate (i) as to the Remarketing Agent on the effective date of the resignation or removal of the Remarketing Agent pursuant to Section 9 and (ii) on the earlier of (x) any Special Event Redemption Date, (y) the occurrence of a Termination Event and (z) the Business Day immediately following the Purchase Contract Settlement Date. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to any of the other provisions hereof, except as otherwise provided herein, the Company shall not be under any liability to the Remarketing Agent and the Remarketing Agent shall not be under any liability to the Company, except that if this Agreement is terminated by the Remarketing Agent because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Remarketing Agent for all of its out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of its counsel) reasonably incurred by it. Notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement, in the event there has been a Successful Remarketing, the obligations set forth in Section 4 hereof shall survive and remain in full force and effect until all amounts payable under said Section 4 shall have been paid in full. In addition, Sections 7, 8 and 11 hereof shall survive the termination of this Agreement or the resignation or removal of the Remarketing Agent.
 
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and:
 
 
 
 
Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect at the time of receipt thereof.
 
 
This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon each party hereto and its respective successors. This Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof are for the sole benefit of only those persons, except that (x) the representations, warranties, indemnities and agreements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall also be deemed to be for the benefit of the Remarketing Agent and the person or persons, if any, who control the Remarketing Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and (y) the indemnity agreement of the Remarketing Agent contained in Section 7 of this Agreement shall be deemed to be for the benefit of the Company's directors and officers who sign the Registration Statement, if any, and any person controlling the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act. Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any person, other than the persons referred to herein, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision contained herein.
 
 
The respective indemnities, representations, warranties and agreements of the Company and the Remarketing Agent contained in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall survive any Remarketing and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any of them or any person controlling any of them.
 
THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAW PROVISIONS THEREOF TO THE EXTENT A DIFFERENT LAW WOULD GOVERN AS A RESULT.
 
 
(a) Each party hereto expressly accepts and irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the United States Federal or New York State court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, New York, over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Remarketed Notes. To the fullest extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, each party hereto irrevocably waives and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise, any claim that it is not subject to the jurisdiction of any such court, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court and any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
 
(b) Each party hereto agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so under applicable law, that a judgment in any suit, action or proceeding of the nature referred to in Section 17(a) brought in any such court shall be conclusive and binding upon such party, subject to rights of appeal, and may be enforced in the courts of the United States of America or the State of New York (or any other court the jurisdiction to which the Company is or may be subject) by a suit upon such judgment.
 
 
This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts and, if executed in more than one counterpart, the executed counterparts shall each be deemed to be an original but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
 
 
The headings herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be part of, or to affect the meaning or interpretation of, this Agreement.
 
If any provision of this Agreement shall be held or deemed to be or shall, in fact, be invalid, inoperative or unenforceable as applied in any particular case in any or all jurisdictions because it conflicts with any provisions of any constitution, statute, rule or public policy or for any other reason, then, to the extent permitted by law, such circumstances shall not have the effect of rendering the provision in question invalid, inoperative or unenforceable in any other case, circumstance or jurisdiction, or of rendering any other provision or provisions of this Agreement invalid, inoperative or unenforceable to any extent whatsoever.
 
 
This Agreement may be amended by an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto. Each of the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent agrees that it will not enter into, cause or permit any amendment or modification of the Transaction Documents or any other instruments or agreements relating to the Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes, the Notes or the Corporate Units that would in any way adversely affect the rights, duties and obligations of the Remarketing Agent, without the prior written consent of the Remarketing Agent.
 
 
Except in the case of a succession pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, the rights and obligations of the Company hereunder may not be assigned or delegated to any other Person without the prior written consent of the Remarketing Agent. The rights and obligations of the Remarketing Agent hereunder may not be assigned or delegated to any other Person (other than an affiliate of the Remarketing Agent) without the prior written consent of the Company.
 
If the foregoing correctly sets forth the agreement by and between the Company, the Remarketing Agent and the Purchase Contract Agent, please indicate your acceptance in the space provided for that purpose below.

This confirmation constitutes a "Confirmation" as referred to in the ISDA Master Agreement specified below.
 
The definitions and provisions contained in the 2002 ISDA Equity Derivatives Definitions (as published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc.

GENERAL TERMS
 
 
 
:
Conditions to Effectiveness
 
The effectiveness of this Confirmation on the Effective Date shall be subject to (i) the condition that the representations and warranties of Party B contained in the Underwriting Agreement dated the date hereof among Party B, Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., as representatives of the
underwriters, and the other underwriters named therein (the "Underwriting Agreement"), and any certificate delivered pursuant thereto by Party B be true and correct on the Effective Date as if made as of the Effective Date, (ii) the condition that Party B have performed all of the obligations required to be performed by it under the Underwriting Agreement on or prior to the Effective Date, and (iii) the satisfaction of all of the conditions set forth in Section 5 of the Underwriting Agreement. In addition, if Party A, in its commercially reasonable judgment, is unable to borrow and deliver for sale a number of Shares equal to the Base Shares or if, in Party A's commercially reasonable judgment it would entail a stock loan cost of more than 62.5 basis points per annum with respect all or any portion of such Shares, the effectiveness of this Confirmation shall be limited to the number of Shares Party A may borrow at a cost of not more than 62.5 basis points per annum.
 
Party B hereby represents and warrants to, and agrees with, Party A as of the date hereof and on the Effective Date that:
Additional Representations, Warranties and Agreements of Party B:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Covenant of Party B:
 
The parties acknowledge and agree that any Shares delivered by Party B to Party A on any Settlement Date will be newly issued Shares and when delivered by Party A (or an affiliate of Party A) to securities lenders from whom Party A (or an affiliate of Party A) borrowed Shares in connection with hedging its exposure to the Transaction will be freely saleable without further registration or other restrictions under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, in the hands of those securities lenders, irrespective of whether such stock loan is effected by Party A or an affiliate of Party A to hedge Party A's exposure under the Transaction. Accordingly, Party B agrees that the Settlement Shares that it delivers to Party A on each Settlement Date will not bear a restrictive legend and that such Settlement Shares will be deposited in, and the delivery thereof shall be effected through the facilities of, the Clearance System.

An Acceleration Event shall occur if:
Acceleration Events:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Termination Settlement:
 
If a Settlement Date is specified following an Acceleration Event (a "Termination Settlement Date"), Physical Settlement shall apply with respect to such Termination Settlement Date as set forth above, and subject to the provisions described under "Limit on Beneficial Ownership" below. If, upon designation of a Termination Settlement Date by Party A, Party B fails to deliver the Settlement Shares relating to such Termination Settlement Date when due or otherwise fails to perform obligations within its control in respect of this Transaction, it shall be an Event of Default with respect to Party B and Section 6 of the Agreement shall apply. If an Acceleration Event occurs during an Unwind Period relating to a number of Settlement Shares to which Cash Settlement or Net Share Settlement applies, then on the Termination Settlement Date relating to such Acceleration Event, notwithstanding any election to the contrary by Party B, Cash Settlement or Net Share Settlement shall apply to the portion of the Settlement Shares relating to such Unwind Period as to which Party A reasonably determines it has unwound its hedge and Physical Settlement shall apply in respect of (x) the remainder (if any) of such Settlement Shares and (y) the Settlement Shares designated by Party A in respect of such Termination Settlement Date.
Rule 10b5-1:
 
It is the intent of Party A and Party B that the purchase of Shares by Party A during any Unwind Period comply with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c)(i)(B) of the Exchange Act and that this Confirmation shall be interpreted to comply with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c).
 
Party B acknowledges that, except as otherwise provided herein, (i) during any Unwind Period Party B does not have, and shall not attempt to exercise, any influence over how, when or whether to effect purchases of Shares by Party A (or its agent or affiliate) in connection with this Confirmation and (ii) Party B is entering into the Agreement and this Confirmation in good faith and not as part of a plan or scheme to evade compliance with federal securities laws including, without limitation, Rule 10b-5 promulgated under the Exchange Act.
 
Party B hereby agrees with Party A that during any Unwind Period Party B shall not communicate, directly or indirectly, any material non-public information (within the meaning of any applicable securities laws) to any Morgan Stanley Personnel. For purposes of this Transaction, "Morgan Stanley Personnel" means any marketers, traders or other front office employees engaged in Corporate Equity Derivatives of Party A or any of its Affiliates.
 
:
Maximum Share Delivery
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Confirmation, in no event will Party B be required to deliver on any Settlement Date, whether pursuant to Physical Settlement or Net Share Settlement, more than the number of Base Shares to Party A.
 
Assignment:
 
Party A may assign or transfer any of its rights or delegate any of its duties hereunder to any affiliate of Party A or any entity organized or sponsored by Party A without the prior written consent of Party B; , that such assignee's obligations shall be guaranteed by Morgan Stanley. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Confirmation to the contrary requiring or allowing Party A to purchase or receive any Shares from Party B, Party A may designate any of its affiliates to purchase or receive such Shares or otherwise to perform Party A's obligations in respect of this Transaction and any such designee may assume such obligations, and Party A shall be discharged of its obligations to Party B to the extent of any such performance.
provided, however
 
Guarantee of Party A:
 
Morgan Stanley shall guarantee all obligations of Party A under this Confirmation and shall execute a Guarantee in favor of Party B.
 
Matters Relating to Agent:
 
 
 
 
 
Indemnity:
 
Party B agrees to indemnify Party A and its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, agents and controlling parties (Party A and each such affiliate or person being an "Indemnified Party") from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities, joint and several, to which such Indemnified Party may become subject under, in connection with, relating to, or arising out of, this Agreement or Transaction with respect to the breach of any representation, warranty or covenant hereunder by Party B, and will reimburse any Indemnified Party for all reasonable expenses (including reasonable legal fees and reasonable expenses) as they are incurred in connection with the investigation of, preparation for, or defense of any pending or threatened claim or any action or proceeding arising therefrom, whether or not such Indemnified Party is a party thereto. Party B will not be liable under this Indemnity paragraph to the extent that any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense is found in a final nonappealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from Party A's gross negligence, fraud, bad faith and/or willful misconduct.
 
Miscellaneous:
 
 
 
Agreement Regarding Set-off:
 
Section 6(f) of the Agreement shall not apply with respect to the Transaction to the extent that any of the events described in Section 5(a)(vii) of the Agreement occurs with respect to Party B.
 
Bankruptcy Rights:
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the Agreement or in the Equity Definitions, upon the occurrence of an Insolvency, Insolvency Filing of Party B or an Event of Default of the type described in Section 5(a)(vii) of the Agreement (a "Bankruptcy") with respect to Party B, the Transaction shall automatically terminate on the date of such occurrence without further liability of either party under this Confirmation to the other party (except for any liability in respect of any breach of representation or covenant by a party under this Confirmation prior to the date of such Insolvency, Insolvency Filing or Bankruptcy).
 
:
Limit on Beneficial Ownership
 
Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, Party A shall not be entitled to receive Shares or any other class of voting securities of the Party B hereunder (whether in connection with the purchase of Shares on any Settlement Date or any Termination Settlement Date or otherwise) to the extent (but only to the extent) that such receipt would result in Party A directly or indirectly beneficially owning (as such term is defined for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) at any time in excess of 9% of the outstanding Shares or any other class of voting securities of the Party B. Any purported delivery hereunder shall be void and have no effect to the extent (but only to the extent) that such delivery would result in Party A directly or indirectly so beneficially owning in excess of 9% of the outstanding Shares or any other class of voting securities of the Party B. If any delivery owed to Party A hereunder is not made, in whole or in part, as a result of this provision, Party B's obligation to make such delivery shall not be extinguished and Party B shall make such delivery as promptly as practicable after, but in no event later than one Clearance System Business Day after, Party A gives notice to Party B that such delivery would not result in Party A directly or indirectly so beneficially owning in excess of 9% of the outstanding Shares or any other class of voting securities of the Party B.
If Net Share Settlement would result in Party A beneficially owning more than 9% of the outstanding Shares in connection with closing out its hedge position, Party A would be allowed to partially settle the Transaction based on its purchase of that amount of Shares, and then to purchase the amount or amounts of additional Shares necessary to settle the remainder of the Transaction, and to make the associated deliveries at such times as determined by the Calculation Agent.
 
:
Other Forward
 
Party A acknowledges that Party B has entered into a substantially identical forward transaction for its Shares on the date hereof (the "Other Forward") with an affiliate of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. Party A and Party B agree that if Party B designates a Settlement Date with respect to the Other Forward and the Unwind Period for the Other Forward coincides for any period of time with the Unwind Period for this Transaction (the "Overlap Unwind Period"), Party B shall notify Party A prior to the commencement of such Overlap Unwind Period and Party A shall only be permitted to purchase the Unwind Daily Share Amount on every other Scheduled Trading Day during such Overlap Unwind Period, commencing on the second day of such Overlap Unwind Period.
 
Severability:
 
If any term, provision, covenant or condition of this Confirmation, or the application thereof to any party or circumstance, shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part for any reason, the remaining terms, provisions, covenants, and conditions hereof shall continue in full force and effect as if this Confirmation had been executed with the invalid or unenforceable provision eliminated, so long as this Confirmation as so modified continues to express, without material change, the original intentions of the parties as to the subject matter of this Confirmation and the deletion of such portion of this Confirmation will not substantially impair the respective benefits or expectations of parties to this Agreement; , that this severability provision shall not be applicable if any provision of Section 2, 5, 6 or 13 of the Agreement (or any definition or provision in Section 14 to the extent that it relates to, or is used in or in connection with any such Section) shall be so held to be invalid or unenforceable.

Accordingly, Party B agrees that the Settlement Shares that it delivers to Party A on each Settlement Date will not bear a restrictive legend and that such Settlement Shares will be deposited in, and the delivery thereof shall be effected through the facilities of, the Clearance System.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Confirmation to the contrary requiring or allowing Party A to purchase or receive any Shares from Party B, Party A may designate any of its affiliates to purchase or receive such Shares or otherwise to perform Party A's obligations in respect of this Transaction and any such designee may assume such obligations, and Party A shall be discharged of its obligations to Party B to the extent of any such performance.
 
Matters Relating to Agent:
 
Each party agrees and acknowledges that (i) J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., as agent, (the "Agent") acts solely as agent on a disclosed basis with respect to the transactions contemplated hereunder, and (ii) the Agent has no obligation, by guaranty, endorsement or otherwise, with respect to the obligations of either Party B or Party A hereunder, either with respect to the delivery of cash or Shares, either at the beginning or the end of the transactions contemplated hereby.

Limit on Beneficial Ownership
 
Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, Party A shall not be entitled to receive Shares or any other class of voting securities of the Party B hereunder (whether in connection with the purchase of Shares on any Settlement Date or any Termination Settlement Date or otherwise) to the extent (but only to the extent) that such receipt would result in Party A directly or indirectly beneficially owning (as such term is defined for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) or having ownership or control (within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended) at any time in excess of 4.5% of the outstanding Shares or any other class of voting securities of the Party B.

If any delivery owed to Party A hereunder is not made, in whole or in part, as a result of this provision, Party B's obligation to make such delivery shall not be extinguished and Party B shall make such delivery as promptly as practicable after, but in no event later than one Clearance System Business Day after, Party A gives notice to Party B that such delivery would not result in Party A directly or indirectly so beneficially owning or having ownership or control in excess of 4.5% of the outstanding Shares or any other class of voting securities of the Party B. If Net Share Settlement would result in Party A beneficially owning or having ownership or control of more than 4.5% of the outstanding Shares in connection with closing out its hedge position, Party A would be allowed to partially settle the Transaction based on its purchase of that amount of Shares, and then to purchase the amount or amounts of additional Shares necessary to settle the remainder of the Transaction, and to make the associated deliveries at such times as determined by the Calculation Agent.

Incorporated.

If any term, provision, covenant or condition of this Confirmation, or the application thereof to any party or circumstance, shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part for any reason, the remaining terms, provisions, covenants, and conditions hereof shall continue in full force and effect as if this Confirmation had been executed with the invalid or unenforceable provision eliminated, so long as this Confirmation as so modified continues to express, without material change, the original intentions of the parties as to the subject matter of this Confirmation and the deletion of such portion of this Confirmation will not substantially impair the respective benefits or expectations of parties to this Agreement; , that this severability provision shall not be applicable if any provision of Section 2, 5, 6 or 13 of the Agreement (or any definition or provision in Section 14 to the extent that it relates to, or is used in or in connection with any such Section) shall be so held to be invalid or unenforceable.

With respect to the remarketed Separate Subordinated Notes, upon a Successful Remarketing, any proceeds of the Successful Remarketing attributable to the Separate Subordinated Notes will be remitted to the Custodial Agent for payment on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date to the holders of Separate Subordinated Notes who submitted such Separate Subordinated Notes for remarketing pursuant hereto.
 
(v) Following a Failed Remarketing on the Final Remarketing Date (a ""), as of the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, each Holder of any Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Subordinated Notes, unless such Holder has delivered the Purchase Price to the Securities Intermediary for deposit in the Collateral Account prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the second Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date in lawful money of the United States by certified or cashiers check or wire transfer in immediately available funds payable to or upon the order of the Securities Intermediary, shall be deemed to have exercised such Holder's Put Right with respect to the Subordinated Notes underlying such Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Subordinated Notes and to have elected to have a portion of the Proceeds of the Put Right set-off against such Holder's obligation to pay the aggregate Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be issued under the related Purchase Contracts in full satisfaction of such Holders' obligations under such Purchase Contracts. Following such set-off, each such Holder's obligations to pay the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock will be deemed to
Failed Final Remarketing
 
be satisfied in full, and the Collateral Agent shall cause the Securities Intermediary to release the Subordinated Notes underlying such Pledged Applicable Interests in Subordinated Notes from the Collateral Account and shall promptly transfer such Subordinated Notes to the Company. Thereafter, the Collateral Agent shall promptly remit the remaining portion of the Proceeds of the Holder's exercise of the Put Right in excess of the aggregate Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be issued under such Purchase Contracts to the Purchase Contract Agent for payment to the Holder of the Corporate Units to which such Applicable Ownership Interests in Subordinated Notes relate.
 
(vi) Not later than 20 Business Days prior to the Initial Remarketing Date, the Company shall request the Depositary or its nominee to notify the Beneficial Owners or Depositary Participants holding Units and Separate Subordinated Notes of the procedures to be followed in each Remarketing including, in the case of a Failed Final Remarketing, the procedures that must be followed by a holder of Separate Subordinated Notes if such Holder wishes to exercise its Put Right or by a Holder if such Holder elects not to exercise its Put Right.
 
(vii) The Company agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that, if required by applicable law, (x) a registration statement, including a prospectus, under the Securities Act with regard to the full amount of the Subordinated Notes to be remarketed in each Remarketing in each case in a form that may be used by the Remarketing Agent in connection with such Remarketing shall be effective with the Securities and Exchange Commission and (y) to make available copies of such prospectus.
 
(viii) The Company shall issue a press release and cause a notice of any Failed Final Remarketing to be published on its website (with a copy of such notice to be provided to the Purchase Contract Agent) before 9:00 a.m. New York City time on the Business Day immediately following such Failed Final Remarketing. The press release to be issued under this subsection shall be published by making a timely release to an appropriate news agency such as Bloomberg Business News or the Dow Jones News Service.
 
(c) In the case of a Treasury Unit or a Corporate Unit (if Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have replaced the Applicable Ownership Interests in Subordinated Notes as a component of such Corporate Unit), upon the maturity of the Pledged Treasury Securities or the appropriate Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio held by the Securities Intermediary on or prior to the Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the principal amount of the Treasury Securities or the appropriate Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio received by the Securities Intermediary shall be invested promptly in Permitted Investments. On the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, an amount equal to the Purchase Price for all related Purchase Contracts shall be remitted to the Company as payment of such Holder's Obligations under such Purchase Contracts without receiving any instructions from the Holder. In the event the sum of the Proceeds from either the related Pledged Treasury Securities or the related Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio and the Proceeds from such Permitted Investments is in excess of the aggregate Purchase Price, the Collateral Agent shall cause the Securities Intermediary to distribute such excess, when received by the Securities Intermediary, to the Purchase Contract Agent for the benefit of the Holder of the related Treasury Units or Corporate Units, as applicable.
 
(d) The obligations of the Holders to pay the Purchase Price are non-recourse obligations and, except to the extent satisfied by Early Settlement, Cash Merger Early Settlement or Cash Settlement or terminated upon a Termination Event, are payable solely out of the proceeds of any Collateral pledged to secure the obligations of the Holders, and in no event will Holders be liable for any deficiency between the proceeds of the disposition of Collateral and the Purchase Price.
 
(e) The Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock in respect of a Purchase Contract or deliver any certificates thereof to the Holder of the related Units unless the Company shall have received payment for the Common Stock to be purchased thereunder in the manner herein set forth.
 
Section 5.03 . Unless a Termination Event, an Early Settlement or a Cash Merger Early Settlement shall have occurred, subject to Section 5.04(b), on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date upon receipt of the aggregate Purchase Price payable on all Outstanding Units in accordance with Section 5.02 above, the Company shall issue and deposit with the Purchase Contract Agent, for the benefit of the Holders of the Outstanding Units, one or more certificates representing newly issued shares of Common Stock registered in the name of the Purchase Contract Agent (or its nominee) as custodian for the Holders (such certificates for shares of Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions for which a record date and payment date for such dividend or distribution has occurred after the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, being hereinafter referred to as the "") to which the Holders are entitled hereunder.
Issuance of Shares of Common Stock
Purchase Contract Settlement Fund
 
Subject to the foregoing, upon surrender of a Certificate to the Purchase Contract Agent on or after the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, Early Settlement Date or Cash Merger Early Settlement Date, as the case may be, together with settlement instructions thereon duly completed and executed, the Holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive forthwith in exchange therefor a certificate representing that number of newly issued whole shares of Common Stock which such Holder is entitled to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article 5 (after taking into account all Units then held by such Holder), together with cash in lieu of fractional shares as provided in Section 5.08 and any dividends or distributions with respect to such shares constituting part of the Purchase Contract Settlement Fund, but without any interest thereon, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Such shares shall be registered in the name of the Holder or the Holder's designee as specified in the settlement instructions provided by the Holder to the Purchase Contract Agent. If any shares of Common Stock issued in respect of a Purchase Contract are to be registered in the name of a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate evidencing such Purchase Contract is registered (but excluding any Depositary or nominee thereof), no such registration shall be made unless and until the Person requesting such registration has paid any transfer and other taxes (including any applicable stamp taxes) required by reason of such registration in a name other than that of the registered Holder of the Certificate evidencing such Purchase Contract or has established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax either has been paid or is not payable.
 
Section 5.04 . (a) Adjustments for Dividends, Distributions, Stock Splits, Etc.
Adjustment of each Fixed Settlement Rate
 
(i) In case the Company shall pay or make a dividend or other distribution on Common Stock in Common Stock, each Fixed Settlement Rate in effect at the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution shall be increased by multiplying each Fixed Settlement Rate by a fraction of which:
 
(A) the numerator shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of
 
business on the date fixed for such determination and the total number of shares constituting such dividend or other distribution; and
 
(B) the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination,
 
such increase in each Fixed Settlement Rate to become effective immediately at the opening of business on the Business Day following the date fixed for such determination. For the purposes of this paragraph (i), the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include any shares issuable in respect of any scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Company agrees that it shall not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company.
 
(ii) In case the Company shall issue rights, warrants or options, other than pursuant to any dividend reinvestment plans or share purchase plans, to all holders of its Common Stock entitling them, for a period expiring within 45 days after the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights, warrants or options, to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on the date of announcement of such issuance, each Fixed Settlement Rate in effect at the close of business on the date of such announcement shall be increased by multiplying such Fixed Settlement Rate by a fraction of which:
 
(A) the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date of such announcement the number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase; and
plus
 
(B) the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date of such announcement the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase in the manner described in this Section 5.04(a)(ii) would purchase at the Current Market Price on the date of such announcement,
plus
 
such increase in each Fixed Settlement Rate to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the Business Day following the date of such announcement. The Company agrees that it shall notify the Purchase Contract Agent if any issuance of such rights, warrants or options is cancelled or not completed following the announcement thereof and each Fixed Settlement Rate shall thereupon immediately be readjusted to the Fixed Settlement Rate that would then be in effect if such issuance had not been declared. For the purposes of this clause (ii), the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include any shares issuable in respect of any scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Company agrees that it shall not issue any such rights, warrants or options in respect of shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company.
 
(iii) In case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided or split into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, each Fixed Settlement Rate in effect at the close of business on the day preceding the day upon which such subdivision or split becomes effective shall be proportionately increased, and, conversely, in case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall each be combined into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, each Fixed Settlement Rate in effect at the close of business on the day preceding the day upon which such combination becomes effective shall be proportionately decreased, such increase or decrease, as the case may be, to become effective immediately at the opening of business on the Business Day following the day upon which such subdivision, split or combination becomes effective.
 
(iv) (w) In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock evidences of its indebtedness or assets (including shares of capital stock, securities, cash and property but excluding any rights, warrants or options referred to in Section 5.04(a)(ii) above, any dividend or distribution paid exclusively in cash and any dividend or distribution referred to in Section 5.04(a)(i) above) (any of the foregoing hereinafter in this Section 5.04(a)(iv) called the ""), each Fixed Settlement Rate in effect at the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution shall be adjusted by multiplying each Fixed Settlement Rate by a fraction of which:
Distributed Property
 
(A) the numerator shall be such Current Market Price per share of Common Stock; and
 
(B) the denominator shall be the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on the date fixed for such determination less the then fair market value of the portion of the assets or evidences of indebtedness so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and the basis for which shall be described in a Board Resolution),
 
such adjustment to each Fixed Settlement Rate to become effective at the opening of business on the Business Day following the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution; that if the fair market value of the Distributed Property applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than the Current Market Price on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Holder shall have the right to receive upon settlement the amount of Distributed Property such Holder would have received had such Holder settled each Purchase Contract on the date fixed for such determination as if the Purchase Contract Settlement Date were such date fixed for such determination. In any case in which this Section 5.04(a)(iv) is applicable, Section 5.04(a)(ii) shall not be applicable. In the event that such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, each Fixed Settlement Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Fixed Settlement Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
provided
 
(x) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Distributed Property distributed by the Company to all holders of its Common Stock consist of capital stock of, or similar equity interests in, a Subsidiary or other business unit of the Company, clause (w) above shall not apply and instead each Fixed Settlement Rate shall be increased so that each Fixed Settlement Rate shall be equal to the rate determined by multiplying each such rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the record date with respect to such distribution by a fraction of which,
 
(C) the numerator shall be the sum of (A) the average of the Closing Prices of the Common Stock for the ten (10) consecutive Trading Days commencing on and including the fifth Trading Day after the date on which "ex-dividend trading" commences for such dividend or distribution on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq National Market or such other national or regional exchange or market on which such securities are then listed or quoted (the "") (B) the average Closing Prices of the securities distributed in respect of each share of Common Stock for the ten (10) consecutive Trading Days commencing on and including the fifth Trading Day after the Ex-Dividend Date; and
Ex-Dividend Date
plus
 
(D) the denominator shall be the average of the Closing Prices of the Common Stock for the ten (10) consecutive Trading Days commencing on and including the fifth Trading Day after the Ex-Dividend Date,
 
such adjustment to each Fixed Settlement Rate to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the Business Day following the record date with respect to such distribution. In any case in which this paragraph (x) is applicable, Section 5.02(a)(i), Section 5.02(a)(ii) and paragraph (w) of this Section 5.04(a)(iv) shall not be applicable.
 
(y) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5.04(a), rights or warrants distributed by the Company to all holders of Common Stock entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Company's capital stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights, options or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events ("") (i) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of Common Stock; (ii) are not exercisable; and (iii) are also issued in respect of future issuances of Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this Section 5.04(a) (and no adjustment to each Fixed Settlement Rate under this Section 5.04(a) will be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event, whereupon such rights, options and warrants shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to each Fixed Settlement Rate shall be made under this Section 5.04(a)(iv). In addition, in the event of any distribution of rights, options or warrants, or any Trigger Event with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to each Fixed Settlement Rate under this Section 5.04(a) was made, (1) in the case of any such rights, options or warrants that shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, each Fixed Settlement Rate shall be readjusted upon such final redemption or repurchase to give effect to such distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder or holders of Common Stock with respect to such rights, options or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights, options or warrants), made to all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase, and (2) in the case of such rights, options or warrants that shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, each Fixed Settlement Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights, options and warrants had not been issued.
Trigger Event
 
(z) For purposes of this Section 5.04(a)(iv) and Section 5.02(a)(i) and Section 5.04(a)(ii), any dividend or distribution to which this Section 5.04(a)(iv) is applicable that also includes shares of Common Stock, or rights, options or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock (or both), shall be deemed instead to be (1) a dividend or distribution of the evidences of indebtedness, assets or shares of capital stock other than such shares of Common Stock or rights, options or warrants (and any
 
Settlement Rate adjustment required by this Section 5.04(a)(iv) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made) immediately followed by (2) a dividend or distribution of such shares of Common Stock or such rights, options or warrants (and any further Settlement Rate adjustment required by Section 5.04(a)(i) and Section 5.04(a)(ii) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made), except (A) the record date of such dividend or distribution shall be deemed to be "the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution", "the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights, options or warrants" and "the date fixed for such determination" within the meaning of Section 5.04(a)(i) and Section 5.04(a)(ii) and (B) any shares of Common Stock included in such dividend or distribution shall not be deemed "outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution" or "outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination" within the meaning of Section 5.04(a)(i).
 
(v) In case the Company shall make any dividend or distribution consisting exclusively of cash to all holders of outstanding shares of Common Stock (excluding any dividend or distribution in connection with the liquidation, dissolution or termination of the Company), then each Fixed Settlement Rate will be adjusted by multiplying each Fixed Settlement Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the record date with respect to such dividend or distribution by a fraction of which,
 
(A) the numerator is the Current Market Price on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution; and
 
(B) the denominator is such Current Market Price, the amount per share of such dividend or distribution,
minus
 
such adjustment to each Fixed Settlement Rate to be effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the Business Day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution; and that if the portion of the cash so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than the Current Market Price on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Holder shall have the right to receive upon settlement the amount of cash such Holder would have received had such Holder settled each Purchase Contract on the date fixed for such determination as if the Purchase Contract Settlement Date were such date fixed for such determination.
provided further
 
(vi) In case a tender or exchange offer made by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company for all or any portion of the Common Stock shall expire and such tender or exchange offer (as amended upon the expiration thereof) shall require the payment to stockholders of consideration per share of Common Stock having a fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a resolution of the Board of Directors) that as of the last time at which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as it may be amended) (the "") exceeds the Closing Price of a share of Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Time, each Fixed Settlement Rate shall be increased so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying each Fixed Settlement Rate in effect immediately prior to the Expiration Time by a fraction of which,
Expiration Time
 
(A) the numerator shall be equal to the sum of (1) the fair market value, as determined by the Board of Directors (as described above in this Section 5.04(a)(vi)), of the aggregate consideration payable for all shares of Common Stock that the Company or a subsidiary of the Company, as the case may be, purchased in such tender or exchange offer (the "") and (2) the product of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding, less any Purchased Shares, and the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Time, and
Purchased Shares
 
(B) the denominator shall be equal to the product of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding, including the Purchased Shares, and the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Time,
 
such adjustment to each Fixed Settlement Rate to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the Business Day following the Expiration Time. If the Company is obligated to purchase shares pursuant to any such tender or exchange offer, but the Company is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases or all such purchases are rescinded, each Fixed Settlement Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Fixed Settlement Rate that would then be in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made.
 
(vii) The reclassification of Common Stock into securities including securities other than Common Stock (other than any reclassification upon a Reorganization Event to which Section 5.04(b) applies) shall be deemed to involve:
 
(A) a distribution of such securities other than Common Stock to all holders of Common Stock (and the effective date of such reclassification shall be deemed to be "the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution" and the "date fixed for such determination" within the meaning of paragraph (iv) of this Section); and
 
(B) a subdivision, split or combination, as the case may be, of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such reclassification into the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately thereafter (and the effective date of such reclassification shall be deemed to be "the day upon which such subdivision or split becomes effective" or "the day upon which such combination becomes effective", as the case may be, and "the day upon which such subdivision, split or combination becomes effective" within the meaning of this Section 5.04(a)(iii).
 
(viii) [Reserved.]
 
(ix) All adjustments to each Fixed Settlement Rate shall be calculated to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share of Common Stock (or if there is not a
 
nearest 1/10,000th of a share, to the next lower 1/10,000th of a share). If any adjustments are made to each Fixed Settlement Rate pursuant to this Section 5.04(a), an adjustment shall also be made to the Applicable Market Value solely to determine which of clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of the definition of Settlement Rate in Section 5.01(a) will apply on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date or any Cash Merger Early Settlement Date. Such adjustment shall be made by multiplying the Applicable Market Value by the Adjustment Factor. The "Adjustment Factor" means, initially, a fraction the numerator of which shall be the Maximum Settlement Rate immediately after the first adjustment to each Fixed Settlement Rate pursuant to this Section 5.04(a) and the denominator of which shall be the Maximum Settlement Rate immediately prior to such adjustment. Each time an adjustment is required to be made to each Fixed Settlement Rate pursuant to this Section 5.04(a), the Adjustment Factor shall be multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the Maximum Settlement Rate immediately after such adjustment to each Fixed Settlement Rate pursuant to this Section 5.04(a) and the denominator of which shall be the Maximum Settlement Rate immediately prior to such adjustment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any adjustment to each Fixed Settlement Rate is required to be made pursuant to the occurrence of any of the events contemplated by this Section 5.04(a) during the period taken into consideration for determining the Applicable Market Value, the 20 individual Closing Prices used to determine the Applicable Market Value shall be adjusted rather than the Applicable Market Value and the Applicable Market Value shall be determined by (A) multiplying the Closing Prices for Trading Days prior to such adjustment to each Fixed Settlement Rate by the Adjustment Factor in effect prior to such adjustment, (B) multiplying the Closing Prices for Trading Days following such adjustment by the Adjustment Factor reflecting such adjustment, and (C) dividing the sum of all such adjusted Closing Prices by 20.
 
(x) The Company may, but shall not be required to, make such increases in each Fixed Settlement Rate, in addition to those required by this Section 5.04(a), as the Board of Directors considers to be advisable. The Company may make such a discretionary adjustment only if it makes the same proportionate adjustment to each Fixed Settlement Rate.
 
(xi) If the Company hereafter adopts any stockholder rights plan involving the issuance of preference share purchase rights or other similar rights (the "") to all holders of the Common Stock, a Holder shall be entitled to receive upon settlement of any Purchase Contract, in addition to the shares of Common Stock issuable upon settlement of such Purchase Contract, the related Rights for the Common Stock, unless such Rights under the future stockholder rights plan have separated from the Common Stock at the time of conversion, in which case each Fixed Settlement Rate shall be adjusted as provided in Section 5.04(a)(iv) on the date such Rights separate from the Common Stock.
Rights
 
(b) Adjustment for Consolidation, Merger or Other Reorganization Event.
 
(i) In the event of:
 
(A) any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into another Person (other than a merger or consolidation in which the Company is the continuing corporation and in which the shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger or consolidation are not exchanged for cash, securities or other property of the Company or another corporation);
 
(B) any sale, transfer, lease or conveyance to another Person of the property of the Company as an entirety or substantially as an entirety;
 
(C) any statutory share exchange of the Company with another Person (other than in connection with a merger or acquisition); or
 
(D) any liquidation, dissolution or termination of the Company other than as a result of or after the occurrence of a Termination Event (any event described in clauses (A), (B), (C) and (D), a ""),
Reorganization Event
 
each Holder will receive, in lieu of shares of Common Stock, on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date or any Early Settlement Date with respect to each Purchase Contract forming a part thereof, the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event (without any interest thereon, and without any right to dividends or distribution thereon if such dividends or distributions have a record date that is prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date) by a Holder of one share of Common Stock (the ""), multiplied by the applicable Settlement Rate. The kind and amount of Exchange Property will be determined assuming such holder of one Share of Common Stock is not a Person with which the Company consolidated or into which the Company merged or which merged into the Company or to which such sale or transfer was made, as the case may be (any such Person, a ""), or an Affiliate of a Constituent Person to the extent such Reorganization Event provides for different treatment of Common Stock held by Affiliates of the Company and non-affiliates and such Holder failed to exercise its rights of election, if any, as to the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event ( that if the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event is not the same for each share of Common Stock held immediately prior to such Reorganization Event by a Person other than a Constituent Person or an Affiliate thereof and in respect of which rights of election shall not have been exercised (""), then for the purpose of this Section 5.04(b)(i) the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event shall be deemed to be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the non-electing shares).

For purposes of determining the applicable Settlement Rate under this Section 5.04(b)(i) and Section 5.04(b)(ii), the term "Applicable Market Value" shall be deemed to refer to the "Applicable Market Value" of the Exchange Property, and such value shall be determined (A) with respect to any publicly traded securities that compose all or part of the Exchange Property, based on the Closing Price of such securities, (B) in the case of any cash that composes all or part of the Exchange Property, based on the amount of such cash and (C) in the case of any other property that composes all or part of the Exchange Property, based on the value of such property, as determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained by the Company for this purpose; that prior to the separation of the Rights or any similar stockholder rights from the Common Stock, such Rights or similar stockholder rights shall be deemed to have no value. For the purposes of this paragraph only, the term "Closing Price" shall be deemed to refer to the closing sale price, last quoted bid price or mid-point of the last bid and ask prices, as the case may be, of any publicly traded securities that comprise all or part of the Exchange Property and the term "Trading Day" shall be deemed to refer to any publicly traded securities that comprise all or part of the Exchange Property.
provided
 
In the event of such a Reorganization Event, the Person formed by such consolidation, merger or exchange or the Person that acquires the assets of the Company or, in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or termination of the Company, the Company or a liquidating trust created in connection therewith, shall execute and deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent an agreement supplemental hereto providing that each Holder of an Outstanding Unit shall have the rights provided by this Section 5.04(b)(i). Such supplemental agreement shall provide for adjustments which, for events subsequent to the effective date of such supplemental agreement, shall be, in the sole judgment of the parties executing such agreement, as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Section 5.04. The above provisions of this Section 5.04 shall similarly apply to successive Reorganization Events.
 
(ii) In the event, prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, of a consolidation or merger of the Company with or into another Person, any merger of another Person into the Company (other than a merger that does not result in any reclassification, conversion, exchange or cancellation of outstanding shares of Common Stock), or the sale by the Company of all or substantially all of its assets, in each case in which 30% or more of the total consideration paid to the Company's shareholders consists of cash or cash equivalents (a ""), then a Holder of a Unit may settle ("") its Purchase Contract, upon the conditions set forth below, at the Settlement Rate in effect immediately prior to the closing of the Cash Merger; that no Cash Merger Early Settlement will be permitted pursuant to this Section 5.04(b)(ii) unless, at the time such Cash Merger Early Settlement is effected, there is an effective Registration Statement with respect to any securities to be issued and delivered in connection with such Cash Merger Early Settlement, if such a Registration Statement is required (in the view of counsel, which need not be in the form of a written opinion, for the Company) under the Securities Act. If such a Registration Statement is so required, the Company covenants and agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to (x) have in effect a Registration Statement covering any securities to be delivered in respect of the Purchase Contracts being settled and (y) provide a Prospectus in connection therewith, in each case in a form that may be used in connection with such Cash Merger Early Settlement. The Company shall pay such amount as a credit against the amount otherwise payable by such Holder to effect such Cash Merger Early Settlement.

Within five Business Days of the completion of a Cash Merger, the Company shall provide written notice to Holders of such completion of a Cash Merger, which shall specify the deadline for submitting the notice to settle early in cash pursuant to this Section 5.04(b)(ii), the date on which such Cash Merger Early Settlement shall occur (which date shall be at least five days after the date of such written notice by the Company, but which shall in no event be later than the earlier of 20 days after the date of such written notice by the Company and the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date) (the ""), the applicable Settlement Rate and the amount (per share of Common Stock) of cash, securities and other consideration receivable by the Holder upon settlement.
Cash Merger Early Settlement Date
 
Corporate Units Holders (unless Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have replaced Applicable Ownership Interests in Subordinated Notes as a component of the Corporate Units) and Treasury Units Holders may only effect Cash Merger Early Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.04(b)(ii) in integral multiples of 40 Corporate Units or Treasury Units, as the case may be. If Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have replaced Applicable Ownership Interests in Subordinated Notes as a component of the Corporate Units, Corporate Units Holders may only effect Cash Merger Early Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.04(b)(ii) in multiples of [] Corporate Units.

Upon any such resignation or removal, the Company shall have the right to appoint a successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, which shall not be an Affiliate of the Purchase Contract Agent. If no successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary shall have been so appointed and shall have accepted such appointment within 45 days after the retiring Collateral Agent's, Custodial Agent's or Securities Intermediary's giving of notice of resignation or the Company's or the Purchase Contract Agent's giving notice of such removal, then the retiring or removed Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary may petition any court of competent jurisdiction, at the expense of the Company, for the appointment of a successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary.

Any resignation or removal of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary hereunder, at a time when such Person is also acting as the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement as the simultaneous resignation or removal of the Collateral Agent, the Securities Intermediary or the Custodial Agent, as the case may be.

Security Interest Absolute.

The Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock in respect of a Purchase Contract or deliver any certificates therefor to the Holder unless it shall have received payment of the aggregate Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be purchased thereunder in the manner set forth in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement.
 
Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby and all obligations and rights of the Company and the Holder thereunder shall terminate if a Termination Event shall occur.

Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, at the option of the Holder thereof, Purchase Contracts underlying Units may be settled early by effecting an Early Settlement as provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement in integral multiples of 40 Corporate Units, or if Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have replaced the Applicable Ownership Interests in Subordinated Notes as a component of the Corporate Units, in integral multiples of [] Corporate Units.
    
 
Upon Early Settlement of Purchase Contracts by a Holder of the related Units, the Subordinated Notes underlying the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Subordinated Notes or the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) underlying such Units shall be released from the Pledge as provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and the Holder shall be entitled to receive a number of shares of Common Stock on account of each Purchase Contract forming part of a Corporate Unit as to which Early Settlement is effected equal to the Minimum Settlement Rate.
 
Upon the occurrence of a Cash Merger, a Holder of Corporate Units may effect Cash Merger Early Settlement of the Purchase Contracts underlying such Corporate Units pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement in integral multiples of 40 Corporate Units, or if the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have replaced the Applicable Ownership Interests in
 
Subordinated Notes as a component of the Corporate Units, in integral multiples of [!] Corporate Units. Upon Cash Merger Early Settlement of Purchase Contracts by a Holder of the related Corporate Units, the Subordinated Notes underlying the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Subordinated Notes or the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) underlying such Corporate Units shall be released from the Pledge as provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and the Holder shall be entitled to receive a number of shares of Common Stock on account of each Purchase Contract forming part of a Corporate Unit as to which Cash Merger Early Settlement is effected equal to the applicable Settlement Rate.

(b) All accrued and unpaid interest, including interest thereon, will be due and payable on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date and may not be further deferred. The
 
Company may defer payments of interest for subsequent periods, subject to the other requirements specified herein, until the Maturity Date of the Subordinated Notes.
