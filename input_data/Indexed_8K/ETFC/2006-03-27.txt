Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Approval of Performance Goals/Business Criteria Under Executive Bonus Plan
At the 2005 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of E*TRADE Financial Corporation ("E*TRADE"), our stockholders approved our Executive Bonus Plan (the "Bonus Plan"), which provides incentives for senior executives to achieve certain performance metrics, determined by the Committee (or in the case of the Chief Executive Officer, by the independent members of the full Board of Directors), by rewarding such senior executives with annual cash-based or equity-based bonus awards.
On March 23, 2006, the E*TRADE Board of Directors established that for fiscal year 2006, we will pay bonuses of up to 2.5% of net income for our Chief Executive Officer, 1.75% of net income for our President and Chief Operating Officer and 1.0% of net income for our other named executive officers. A portion of the total bonus is likely to take the form of stock options or restricted stock (which has historically been granted outside the scope of the performance bonus plan), a certain amount of which will vest only if performance metrics are met. The Committee and Board may exercise discretion to reduce the actual payment to any or all of the participants under the plan based on the Company's performance against key metrics, including net revenue and earnings per share.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
