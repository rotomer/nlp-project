We believe that the elimination of certain items from the related GAAP measures is helpful to investors and analysts who may wish to use some or all of this information to analyze our current performance, prospects and valuation. Our management uses non-GAAP information internally to evaluate our operating performance and in formulating our budget for future periods. Free Cash Free cash represents cash held at the Company and its non-Bank and non-Brokerage subsidiaries, less discretionary reserves, plus excess capital at Bank and Brokerage after application of regulatory capital requirements and the Company's own regulatory capital guidelines. The Company believes that free cash is a useful measure of the Company's liquidity as it excludes cash reflected on the balance sheet that may not be freely available to the Company. EBITDA EBITDA represents net income from continuing operations before corporate interest expense, taxes and depreciation and amortization. Management believes that EBITDA provides a useful additional measure of our performance by excluding certain non-cash charges and expenses that are not directly related to the performance of our business. Interest Coverage Interest coverage represents EBITDA divided by corporate interest expense. Management believes that by excluding the charges and expenses that are excluded from EBITDA, interest coverage provides a useful additional measure of our ability to continue to meet our interest obligations and our liquidity. EPS Excluding Acquisition-Related Integration Expenses EPS excluding acquisition-related integration expenses represents net income plus acquisition-related integration expenses, net of tax divided by diluted shares. Management believes that excluding charges associated with the integration of our acquisitions from EPS provides a useful measure to assess the ongoing operating performance of the Company without the impact of nonrecurring charges associated with acquisitions. Enterprise Net Interest Income Enterprise Net Interest Income is taxable equivalent basis net operating interest income excluding corporate interest income and corporate interest expense, stock conduit interest income and expense and interest earned on customer cash held by third parties. Management believes this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors and analysts as it is a measure of the net operating interest income generated by our core operations. Enterprise Interest-Earning Assets Enterprise interest-earning assets consists of the primary interest-earning assets of the Company and includes: loans receivable, mortgage-backed and available-for-sale securities, margin loans, stock borrow balances, and cash required to be segregated under regulatory guidelines that earn interest for the Company. Management believes that this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors and analysts as it is a measure of the primary assets from which the Company generates net operating interest income. It is important to note these metrics and other non-GAAP measures may involve judgment by management and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, net income, consolidated statements of cash flows, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. For complete information on the items excluded from these non-GAAP measures, please see our financial statements and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition" that will be included in the periodic report we expect to file with the SEC with respect to the financial periods discussed herein. (1) EPS excluding acquisition-related integration expenses is a non-GAAP financial measure per applicable SEC regulations. The earnings of $0.36 per share was calculated as Net Income as reported of $153,249,000 plus the after-tax impact of acquisition-related integration expenses of $2,577,000 for pro forma Net Income of $155,826,000 divided by 438,883,000 diluted shares. (2) Reflects elimination of transactions between Retail and Institutional segments, which include deposit transfer pricing, servicing and order flow rebates. (3) Amounts and percentages may not calculate due to rounding. (4) Operating margin is the percentage of net revenue that goes to net income before other income (expense), income taxes, minority interest, discontinued operations and cumulative effect of accounting change. The percentage is calculated by dividing our income before other income (expense), income taxes, minority interest, discontinued operations and cumulative effect of accounting change by our total net revenue. (5) Enterprise net interest spread is the taxable equivalent rate earned on average enterprise interest-earning assets less the rate paid on average enterprise interest-bearing liabilities, excluding corporate interest-earning assets and liabilities, stock conduit and cash held by third parties. (6) Total customer cash and deposits, as well as total retail client assets, have been re-presented to account for a methodology change to settlement date from trade date reporting as of 12/31/05. (7) Q3-06 estimate. (8) Excludes loans to customers on margin. (9) Includes segregated cash balances. (10) Free credits are balances held in Brokerage customer accounts arising from deposits of funds and sales of securities. (11) Gross-up for tax-exempt securities. (12) Net operating interest income earned on average stock conduit assets of $0.03 billion, $0.4 billion and $0.7 billion for the quarters ended September 30, 2006, June 30, 2006, and September 30, 2005, respectively. (13) Includes interest earned on average customer assets of $3.6 billion, $3.4 billion and $1.7 billion for the quarters ended September 30, 2006, June 30, 2006 and September 30, 2005, respectively, held by parties outside E*TRADE FINANCIAL, including third party money market funds and sweep deposit accounts at unaffiliated financial institutions.
