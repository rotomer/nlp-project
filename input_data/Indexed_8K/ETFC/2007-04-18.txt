Total net revenue for the first quarter increased to a record $645.0 million from $598.3 million in the year ago period. "We are extremely pleased with the response to our marketing and service investments this past quarter which generated record net new accounts, with continued strong growth in our target segments, and record levels of customer assets and cash," said Mitchell H. Caplan, Chief Executive Officer, E*TRADE FINANCIAL Corporation. "The success we are seeing in attracting and retaining high-value customers is clearly beneficial to the long-term growth of the franchise." The Company also announced today that its Board of Directors has authorized an additional $250 million stock repurchase plan. In addition to this program, the Company has $34 million remaining in its active program originally announced in December 2004. Under the outstanding authorizations, repurchases may be made through open market and privately negotiated transactions at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate. "Although the broad based markets have been strong, the recent volatility in the macroeconomic environment has affected retail customer behavior and engagement levels. As a result, we are reducing our 2007 earnings estimate to better reflect the muted retail environment we are now experiencing as compared to our expectations at the end of 2006," continued Mr. Caplan. Other selected first quarter highlights: -- Generated 20 percent annualized growth in target segment accounts -- Experienced record Quick Transfer volume of over 400,000 transactions in March with record net cash inflows of more than $500 million -- Produced record levels of options trades in March - 14.5 percent of U.S. Daily Average Revenue Trade ("DART") volumes -- Generated record International retail trading volume of 29,000 DARTs during the quarter -- Launched Global Trading Platform pilot program, providing retail investors online access to foreign stocks and currencies in six major international markets with the ability to buy, hold and sell in the respective local currencies -- Launched Max-Rate Checking, a high-yield checking account that includes the full-functionality of a traditional checking account plus unlimited ATM fee refunds nationwide -- Expanded branch network to 25 locations with the addition of Garden City, New York -- Repurchased $23 million of common stock Historical monthly metric data from January 2003 to March 2007 can be found on the E*TRADE FINANCIAL investor relations site at www.etrade.com.

We believe that the elimination of certain items from the related GAAP measures is helpful to investors and analysts who may wish to use some or all of this information to analyze our current performance, prospects and valuation. Management uses non-GAAP information internally to evaluate our operating performance and in formulating our budget for future periods. Reporting Changes During the period ended March 31, 2007, the Company re-defined the line item "Service charges and fees" by reclassifying certain fee-like revenue items formerly reported in "Other revenue" into the "Service charges and fees" line item, now called "Fees and service charges". We also re-presented our balance sheet to report margin receivables and customer payables directly on the face of the balance sheet. The remaining components of brokerage receivables and brokerage payables are now reported in the "Other assets" and "Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities" line items, respectively. The Company has re-presented the income statement and balance sheet for the past two years on our Investor Relations website. Free Cash Free cash represents cash held at the Company and its non-Bank and non-Brokerage subsidiaries, less discretionary reserves, plus excess capital at Bank and Brokerage after application of regulatory capital requirements and the Company's own regulatory capital guidelines. The Company believes that free cash is a useful measure of the Company's liquidity as it excludes cash reflected on the balance sheet that may not be freely available to the Company. EBITDA EBITDA represents net income from continuing operations before corporate interest expense, taxes and depreciation and amortization. Management believes that EBITDA provides a useful additional measure of our performance by excluding certain non-cash charges and expenses that are not directly related to the performance of our business. Interest Coverage Interest coverage represents EBITDA divided by corporate interest expense. Management believes that by excluding the charges and expenses that are excluded from EBITDA, interest coverage provides a useful additional measure of our ability to continue to meet our interest obligations and our liquidity. EPS Excluding Acquisition-Related Integration Expenses EPS excluding acquisition-related integration expenses represents net income plus acquisition-related integration expenses, net of tax, divided by diluted shares. Management believes that excluding charges associated with the integration of our acquisitions from EPS provides a useful measure to assess the ongoing operating performance of the Company without the impact of nonrecurring charges associated with acquisitions. Enterprise Net Interest Income Enterprise net interest income is taxable equivalent basis net operating interest income excluding corporate interest income and corporate interest expense, stock conduit interest income and expense and interest earned on customer cash held by third parties. Management believes this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors and analysts as it is a measure of the net operating interest income generated by our core operations. Enterprise Interest-Earning Assets Enterprise interest-earning assets consists of the primary interest-earning assets of the Company and includes: loans receivable, mortgage-backed and available-for-sale securities, margin receivables, stock borrow balances, and cash required to be segregated under regulatory guidelines that earn interest for the Company. Management believes that this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors and analysts as it is a measure of the primary assets from which the Company generates net operating interest income. It is important to note these metrics and other non-GAAP measures may involve judgment by management and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, net income, consolidated statements of cash flows, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. For complete information on the items excluded from these non-GAAP measures, please see our financial statements and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition" that will be included in the periodic report we expect to file with the SEC with respect to the financial periods discussed herein. ENDNOTES (1) Reflects elimination of transactions between retail and institutional segments, which include deposit transfer pricing, servicing and order flow rebates. (2) Amounts and percentages may not calculate due to rounding. (3) Operating margin is the percentage of net revenue that results in income before other income (expense), income taxes and discontinued operations. The percentage is calculated by dividing our income before other income (expense), income taxes and discontinued operations by our total net revenue. (4) Enterprise net interest spread is the taxable equivalent rate earned on average enterprise interest-earning assets less the rate paid on average enterprise interest-bearing liabilities, excluding corporate interest-earning assets and liabilities, stock conduit and customer cash held by third parties. (5) Data prior to Q4 2006 is not available. (6) Target segment accounts are accounts with over $50,000 in assets and/or generating 30 or more trades per quarter. (7) Other retail accounts are accounts that (a) were opened less than 90 days prior to the end of the relevant quarter; (b) only include a lending relationship or (c) that otherwise do not meet the definition of a target segment account. (8) Net new client assets are total inflows to all new and existing client accounts less total outflows from all closed and existing client and closed accounts. Data prior to Q1 2007 is not available. (9) Q1 2007 estimate. Includes E*TRADE Clearing, LLC, which became E*TRADE Bank's subsidiary in Q1 2007. (10) Excludes loans to customers on margin. (11) Includes segregated cash balances. (12) Gross-up for tax-exempt securities. (13) Net operating interest income earned on average stock conduit assets of $2.7 million, $13.1 million and $824.0 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2007, December 31, 2006 and March 31, 2006, respectively. (14) Includes interest earned on average customer assets of $3.9 billion, $3.8 billion and $3.6 billion for the quarters ended March 31, 2007, December 31, 2006 and March 31, 2006, respectively, held by parties outside E*TRADE FINANCIAL, including third party money market funds and sweep deposit accounts at unaffiliated financial institutions.
