E*TRADE Financial Corporation ("the Company") is a participant in the
Securities and Exchange Commission's ("SEC") voluntary eXtensible
Business Reporting Language ("XBRL") filing program. Attached as Exhibit
100 to this report are documents that contain information from the
Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September
30, 2006 (the "10-Q"), filed on November 7, 2006 with the SEC, formatted
in XBRL. Also, attached to this report is the Company's Intelligent
Financial Statement(tm) which is a supplemental PDF that contains
information from the 10-Q and embeds XBRL financial data in a viewable
and printable document. By moving your computer mouse over the displayed
data, pop-up CoreFiling TagTips(tm) will show you how the data is
internally expressed as XBRL.
 
Users of this data are advised pursuant to Rule 401 of Regulation S-T that the information contained in the XBRL documents is unaudited and these are not the official publicly filed financial statements of the Company. The purpose of submitting these XBRL formatted documents is to test the related format and technology and, as a result, investors should continue to rely on the official version of the furnished documents and not rely on this information in making investment decisions.
 
In accordance with Rule 402 of Regulation S-T, the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 100 and the supplemental PDF, shall not be deemed to be filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, and shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing or other document pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing or document.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
