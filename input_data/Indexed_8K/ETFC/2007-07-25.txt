EXHIBIT 99.1 E*TRADE FINANCIAL Corporation Announces Second Quarter Results -- Earnings of $0.37 per share, or $0.42 per share excluding $0.05 per share of expense for certain legal and regulatory matters -- Record Total Net Revenue of $664 million -- Pre-tax Income of $241 million -- Net Income of $159 million -- Target Segment account growth of 29 percent on an annualized basis -- Record Total Retail Client Assets of $213 billion -- Total Customer Cash and Deposits growth of $1.9 billion Business Editors NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 25, 2007--E*TRADE FINANCIAL Corporation (NASDAQ: ETFC) today announced results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2007, reporting net income of $159 million, or $0.37 per share, compared to $156 million, or $0.36 per share a year ago. The results in the second quarter of 2007 produced a 39 percent operating margin(1) including approximately $35 million of pre-tax expense, or $0.05 per share, for certain legal and previously disclosed regulatory matters related to the Company's institutional equity business. Excluding the impact of these items, the Company generated earnings of $0.42 per share and achieved a 45 percent operating margin(1). Total net revenue for the second quarter increased 9 percent year over year to a record $664 million. Net operating interest income after provision for loan losses increased 15 percent year over year to a record $384 million - representing 58 percent of total net revenue. The Company's retail client assets increased to a record $213 billion including growth in total customer cash and deposits of $1.9 billion - a more than six-fold increase versus the year ago period. The Company also narrowed its 2007 pro-forma earnings guidance to a range of $1.58 - $1.72 per share from the previous range of $1.55 - $1.75, leaving the mid-point of $1.65 unchanged. This pro-forma range excludes the $0.05 per share of expense for certain legal and regulatory matters realized during the second quarter. Including these expenses, the Company now expects to earn $1.53 - $1.67 per share on a GAAP basis in 2007. "Our second quarter results demonstrate the strategic and economic success we have achieved through investments in product, service and marketing over the past several years," said Mitchell H. Caplan, Chief Executive Officer, E*TRADE FINANCIAL Corporation. "We delivered record performance in the quarter while improving the overall quality of revenue and earnings through continued growth and engagement led by our high-value, target segment accounts."

We believe that the elimination of certain items from the related GAAP measures is helpful to investors and analysts who may wish to use some or all of this information to analyze our current performance, prospects and valuation. Management uses non-GAAP information internally to evaluate our operating performance and in formulating our budget for future periods. Reporting Changes During the period ended March, 31, 2007, the Company re-defined the line item "Service charges and fees" by reclassifying certain fee-like revenue items formerly reported in "Other revenue" into the "Service charges and fees" line item, now called "Fees and service charges". We also re-presented our balance sheet to report margin receivables and customer payables directly on the face of the balance sheet. The remaining components of brokerage receivables and brokerage payables are now reported in the "Other assets" and "Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities" line items, respectively. The Company has re-presented the income statement and balance sheet for the past two years on our Investor Relations website. Free Cash Free cash represents cash held at the Company and its non-Bank and non-Brokerage subsidiaries, less discretionary reserves, plus excess capital at Bank and Brokerage after application of regulatory capital requirements and the Company's own regulatory capital guidelines. The Company believes that free cash is a useful measure of the Company's liquidity as it excludes cash reflected on the balance sheet that may not be freely available to the Company. EBITDA EBITDA represents net income from continuing operations before corporate interest expense, taxes and depreciation and amortization. Management believes that EBITDA provides a useful additional measure of our performance by excluding certain non-cash charges and expenses that are not directly related to the performance of our business. Interest Coverage Interest coverage represents EBITDA divided by corporate interest expense. Management believes that by excluding the charges and expenses that are excluded from EBITDA, interest coverage provides a useful additional measure of our ability to continue to meet our interest obligations and our liquidity. EPS Excluding Certain Legal and Regulatory Items EPS excluding certain legal and regulatory items represents net income plus certain legal and regulatory items, net of tax, divided by diluted shares. Management believes that excluding charges associated with certain legal and regulatory matters from EPS provides a useful measure to assess the ongoing operating performance of the Company without the impact of nonrecurring charges associated with certain legal and regulatory matters. Operating Margin Excluding Certain Legal and Regulatory Matters Operating margin excluding certain legal and regulatory items represents operating income plus legal and regulatory items, net of tax, divided by total net revenue. Management believes that excluding charges associated with certain legal and regulatory matters from operating margin provides a useful measure to assess the ongoing operating performance of the Company without the impact of nonrecurring charges associated with certain legal and regulatory matters. Enterprise Net Interest Income Enterprise net interest income is taxable equivalent basis net operating interest income excluding corporate interest income and corporate interest expense, stock conduit interest income and expense and interest earned on customer cash held by third parties. Management believes this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors and analysts as it is a measure of the net operating interest income generated by our core operations. Enterprise Interest-Earning Assets Enterprise interest-earning assets consists of the primary interest-earning assets of the Company and includes: loans receivable, mortgage-backed and available-for-sale securities, margin receivables, stock borrow balances, and cash required to be segregated under regulatory guidelines that earn interest for the Company. Management believes that this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors and analysts as it is a measure of the primary assets from which the Company generates net operating interest income. It is important to note these metrics and other non-GAAP measures may involve judgment by management and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, net income, consolidated statements of cash flows, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. For complete information on the items excluded from these non-GAAP measures, please see our financial statements and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition" that will be included in the periodic report we expect to file with the SEC with respect to the financial periods discussed herein. ENDNOTES (1) Operating margin is the percentage of net revenue that results in income before other income (expense), income taxes and discontinued operations. The percentage is calculated by dividing our income before other income (expense), income taxes and discontinued operations by our total net revenue. Our second quarter results include $35 million for certain legal and previously disclosed regulatory matters related to the Company's institutional equity business. Excluding the impact of these items, operating margin was 45 percent for the quarter and consolidated segment income per customer was $84. (2) Reflects elimination of transactions between retail and institutional segments, which includes deposit and customer payable transfer pricing, servicing and order flow rebates. (3) Amounts and percentages may not calculate due to rounding. (4) Enterprise net interest spread is the taxable equivalent rate earned on average enterprise interest-earning assets less the rate paid on average enterprise interest-bearing liabilities, excluding corporate interest-earning assets and liabilities, stock conduit and customer cash held by third parties. (5) Data prior to Q4 2006 is not available. (6) Target segment accounts are accounts held by customers with over $50,000 in assets and/or generating 30 or more trades per quarter. (7) Other retail accounts are accounts that (a) were opened less than 90 days prior to the end of the relevant quarter; (b) only include a lending relationship or (c) that otherwise do not meet the definition of a target segment account. (8) Net new client assets are total inflows to all new and existing client accounts less total outflows from all closed and existing client and closed accounts. Data prior to Q1 2007 is not available. (9) Q2 2007 estimate. Includes E*TRADE Clearing, LLC, which became an operating subsidiary of E*TRADE Bank in Q1 2007. (10) Excludes loans to customers on margin. (11) Includes segregated cash balances. (12) Gross-up for tax-exempt securities. (13) Net operating interest income earned on average stock conduit assets of $2.2 million, $2.7 million and $362.4 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2007, March 31, 2007 and June 30, 2006, respectively. (14) Includes interest earned on average customer assets of $4.0 billion, $3.9 billion and $3.4 billion for the quarters ended June 30, 2007, March 31, 2007 and June 30, 2006, respectively, held by parties outside E*TRADE FINANCIAL, including third party money market funds and sweep deposit accounts at unaffiliated financial institutions.
