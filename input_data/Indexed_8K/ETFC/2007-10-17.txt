Exhibit 99.1
E*TRADE FINANCIAL Corporation Announces Third Quarter Results    --  Net loss per share of $0.14, including $0.30 of asset-backed        securities write downs    --  Total Net Revenue of $321 million    --  Target Segment account growth of 16 percent annualized    --  Record Total Retail Client Assets of $218 billion    --  Total Customer Cash and Deposits growth of $1.7 billion to a        record $40 billion    --  Record third quarter Daily Average Revenue Trades of 194,000    --  Revised 2007 earnings guidance to a range of $0.75 to $0.90        per share    NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 17, 2007--E*TRADE FINANCIALCorporation (NASDAQ: ETFC) today announced results for its thirdquarter ended September 30, 2007, reporting a net loss of $58 million,or $0.14 per share, compared to net income of $153 million, or $0.35per share a year ago.    "While we are extremely pleased with the continued growth trendswe are generating throughout the retail business, we are clearlydisappointed with the overall Company performance as a result of thesevere volatility in the credit markets," said Mitchell H. Caplan,Chief Executive Officer, E*TRADE FINANCIAL Corporation. "We areworking diligently to execute our strategic plan to manage through thecredit challenges as quickly as possible and focus the Company on theopportunity and strength of our retail franchise."    The Company's Retail segment generated record revenue and incomein the quarter of $474 million and $224 million, respectively. Theseresults were driven by the continued growth and engagement of retailcustomers. Retail client assets rose 18 percent year-over-year to arecord $218 billion, including a 25 percent increase in total customercash and deposits. Daily Average Revenue Trades ("DARTs") rose 44percent over the year-ago period to a third-quarter record of 194,000.    The net loss in the quarter was primarily due to higher provisionfor loan losses and securities write downs in the Company'sInstitutional segment. Provision for loan losses in the quarterincreased to $187 million principally due to higher loan delinquenciesand net charge-offs. This increase was consistent with previousexpectations. Securities write downs in the quarter totaled $197million, pre-tax. This amount was previously forecasted to occur inthe second half of 2007 and throughout 2008, and was realized insteadin the third quarter rather than in future periods. Total net revenuefor the third quarter declined 45 percent year-over-year to $321million as a result of the higher provision and securities writedowns.    Based primarily on the realization of securities write downs inthe third quarter, the Company has revised its 2007 guidance. As abaseline, the Company is now forecasting 2007 earnings of $0.85 to$0.90 per share. This range includes an assumption of $80 million inprovision for loan losses and no additional securities write downs.However, the Company believes that in the current environment it isextremely difficult to accurately forecast credit-related items. As aresult, management believes it is prudent to include another $0.10 inits forecast for the possibility of further credit deterioration - insome combination of securities write downs and provision - for new2007 earnings guidance of $0.75 to $0.90 per share.    Other selected recent and third quarter highlights:- -- Delivered strong year-over-year Retail growth trends    -- Total accounts increased 6 percent    -- Total client assets increased 18 percent, with cash up 25       percent    -- Total DARTs increased 44 percent    -- International DARTs increased 76 percent    -- Margin debt increased 19 percent- -- Passed the 1,000,000 target segment account threshold - 28 percent   of retail accounts- -- Produced record trade levels for options at 16.7 percent of U.S.   DART volumes- -- Delivered record international DARTs of 33,000- -- Launched retail operations in Singapore- -- Repurchased $53 million of common stock    Note that the Company has updated its Supplemental PortfolioDisclosure to include data as of September 30, 2007.

We believe that the elimination of certainitems from the related GAAP measures is helpful to investors andanalysts who may wish to use some or all of this information toanalyze our current performance, prospects and valuation. Managementuses non-GAAP information internally to evaluate our operatingperformance and in formulating our budget for future periods.    Reporting Changes    During the period ended March, 31, 2007, the Company re-definedthe line item "Service charges and fees" by reclassifying certainfee-like revenue items formerly reported in "Other revenue" into the"Service charges and fees" line item, now called "Fees and servicecharges". We also re-presented our balance sheet to report marginreceivables and customer payables directly on the face of the balancesheet. The remaining components of brokerage receivables and brokeragepayables are now reported in the "Other assets" and "Accounts payable,accrued and other liabilities" line items, respectively. The Companyhas re-presented the income statement and balance sheet for the pasttwo years on our Investor Relations website.    Free Cash    Free cash represents cash held at the Company and its non-Bank andnon-Brokerage subsidiaries, less discretionary reserves, plus excesscapital at Bank and Brokerage after application of regulatory capitalrequirements and the Company's own regulatory capital guidelines. TheCompany believes that free cash is a useful measure of the Company'sliquidity as it excludes cash reflected on the balance sheet that maynot be freely available to the Company.    EBITDA    EBITDA represents net income from continuing operations beforecorporate interest expense, taxes and depreciation and amortization.Management believes that EBITDA provides a useful additional measureof our performance by excluding certain non-cash charges and expensesthat are not directly related to the performance of our business.    Interest Coverage    Interest coverage represents EBITDA divided by corporate interestexpense. Management believes that by excluding the charges andexpenses that are excluded from EBITDA, interest coverage provides auseful additional measure of our ability to continue to meet ourinterest obligations and our liquidity.    Enterprise Net Interest Income    Enterprise net interest income is taxable equivalent basis netoperating interest income excluding corporate interest income andcorporate interest expense, stock conduit interest income and expenseand interest earned on customer cash held by third parties. Managementbelieves this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors and analysts asit is a measure of the net operating interest income generated by ourcore operations.    Enterprise Interest-Earning Assets    Enterprise interest-earning assets consists of the primaryinterest-earning assets of the Company and includes: loans receivable,mortgage-backed and available-for-sale securities, margin receivables,stock borrow balances, and cash required to be segregated underregulatory guidelines that earn interest for the Company. Managementbelieves that this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors andanalysts as it is a measure of the primary assets from which theCompany generates net operating interest income.    It is important to note these metrics and other non-GAAP measuresmay involve judgment by management and should be considered inaddition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, net income,consolidated statements of cash flows, or other measures of financialperformance prepared in accordance with GAAP. For complete informationon the items excluded from these non-GAAP measures, please see ourfinancial statements and "Management's Discussion and Analysis ofResults of Operations and Financial Condition" that will be includedin the periodic report we expect to file with the SEC with respect tothe financial periods discussed herein.

We look first to the credit quality of a borrower, as indicated by FICO and similar measures, for repayment of a loan.  Should a loan become delinquent, realized future losses will be dependent on a number of factors including, but not limited to, cure rates(2), local real estate dynamics and resulting loan-to-value (LTV). The traditional method, as shown on previous pages, categorizes the entire loan balance at the highest dollar LTV. The Principal at Risk (PAR) method is an internal approach that we believe more appropriately depicts the unpaid principal balance by tranching it against the supporting collateral value at time of origination. The following example demonstrates how a $45,000 home equity loan classified under the traditional method at a 95% CLTV can be tranched to several PAR LTV thresholds under the PAR method.
