The description of the terms of the Citadel Investment Agreement, the BlackRock Purchase Agreement, the ABS Purchase Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement and the Rights Agreement Amendment, contained in this Item 1.01 is a summary and does not purport to be complete, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the copies of the Citadel Investment Agreement, the BlackRock Purchase Agreement, the ABS Purchase Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement and the Rights Agreement Amendment, attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 4.1 and 4.3, respectively, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.

Item 2.03.  Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
 
In connection with the issuance of the Springing Lien Notes, the Company and The Bank of New York, as trustee, entered into the Springing Lien Notes Indenture dated November 29, 2007 (the ).  Under the Indenture, the Company may issue up to $1,936,000,000 (plus capitalized interest, if any) aggregate principal amount of Springing Lien Notes.  A copy of the Indenture is filed herewith as Exhibit 4.2.
Indenture
 
The Springing Lien Notes bear interest at the rate of 12.5% per annum and will mature on November 30, 2017.  Interest on the Springing Lien Notes is payable in cash on May 31 and November 30 of each year beginning on May
 
 
31, 2008, provided, however, that the Company may capitalize interest payable on interest payment dates occurring on or before May 31, 2010 under certain circumstances.
 
The Company may redeem the Springing Lien Notes beginning on November 30, 2012 for redemption prices set forth in the Indenture.  In addition, prior to such date, the Company may redeem a portion of the outstanding principal amount of Springing Lien Notes using a portion of the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings.  Upon a change of control, as defined in the Indenture, the Company may be required to make an offer to purchase the Springing Lien Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Springing Lien Notes on the date of purchase, plus accrued interest.  Furthermore, prior to the eighteen-month anniversary of the Final Closing, the Company may redeem all (but not less than all) of the outstanding principal amount of Springing Lien Notes, at a premium set forth in the Indenture, in connection with the Company entering into a definitive agreement to consummate a change of control transaction.
 
The Springing Lien Notes are general senior obligations of the Company and are not guaranteed by the subsidiaries through which the Company currently conducts substantially all of its operations.  The Springing Lien Notes rank equal in right of payment with all of the Companys existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness, and rank senior in right of payment to all of the Companys existing and future subordinated indebtedness.  The Indenture will require the Company to secure the Springing Lien Notes in the future, up to the maximum amount of indebtedness as would not require any of the Companys existing senior notes due 2011, 2013 or 2015 becoming secured equally and ratably with the Springing Lien Notes, on the property and assets of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries as set forth in the Indenture.  The Company will also be required to cause its restricted subsidiaries to guarantee the notes on the date on which the Company is first required to secure the Springing Lien Notes or on the date on which such restricted subsidiaries guarantee other indebtedness of the Company.
 
The Indenture contains several restrictive covenants that are substantially similar to those contained in the indentures governing the Company's existing senior notes due 2011, 2013 and 2015, including, but not limited to the following:  (i) limitations on incurrence of additional indebtedness and issuances of preferred stock, (ii) limitations on restricted payments, (iii) limitations on distributions from regulated subsidiaries and restricted subsidiaries, (iv) limitations on the issuance or sale of capital stock of regulated subsidiaries and restricted subsidiaries, (v) limitations on transactions with affiliates, (vi) limitations on asset sales and sale-leaseback transactions, (vii) future subsidiary guarantees and (viii) limitations on liens, subject in each case to certain exceptions.  The Indenture also contains a covenant requiring certain bank regulated subsidiaries to be well capitalized under applicable regulatory standards.
 
The Indenture contains customary terms that upon certain events of default occurring and continuing, either the trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Springing Lien Notes then outstanding may declare the principal of the Springing Lien Notes and any accrued and unpaid interest through the date of such declaration immediately due and payable.  In the case of certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency relating to Company or any of its significant subsidiaries, the principal amount of the Springing Lien Notes together with any accrued and unpaid interest through the occurrence of such event shall automatically become and be immediately due and payable.
 
This description of the Springing Lien Notes and the related indenture are hereby incorporated by reference in Item 1.01.  The description of the Indenture and the Springing Lien Notes is a summary and does not purport to be complete, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the copy of the Indenture (including the form of Springing Lien Note), attached hereto as Exhibit 4.2, which is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.
 
The information set forth in Item 1.01 hereof is incorporated herein by reference.
 
The issuance and sale of the Springing Lien Notes and the Common Stock pursuant to the Citadel Investment Agreement and the BlackRock Investment Agreement is exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and/or Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933.  Each purchaser of the Springing Lien Notes and the Common Stock has represented to the Company that it is an accredited investor as defined in Regulation D and that the Springing Lien Notes and the Common Stock are
 
 
being acquired for investment.  The Company has not engaged in general solicitation or advertising with regard to the issuance and sale of the Springing Lien Notes and the Common Stock and has not offered securities to the public in connection with this issuance and sale.
 
Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
 
On November 29, 2007, the Company announced that Mitchell H. Caplan has stepped down from his position as Chief Executive Officer of the Company as of November 28.  At that time, the Company also announced that Mr. Caplan will remain with the Company in an advisory capacity and will remain a member of the Board of Directors.  The Board of Directors appointed R. Jarrett Lilien, President of the Company, as acting Chief Executive Officer.
 
In addition, on November 28, 2007, the Board of Directors elected Donald H. Layton to the Board of Directors and designated Mr. Layton as Chairman of the Board of Directors.

Section 2.1.
Shelf Registration
 
(a)           The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to keep such Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective under the Securities Act in order to permit the Prospectus forming a part thereof to be usable by Holders until the earlier of (i) the date as of which all Registrable Securities have been sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement or another Registration Statement filed under the Securities Act (but in no event prior to the applicable period referred to in Section 4(3) of the Securities Act and Rule 174 thereunder) and (ii) the date as of which each of the Holders is permitted to sell its Registrable Securities without Registration pursuant to Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act without volume limitation or other restrictions on transfer thereunder (such period of effectiveness, the Shelf Period). Subject to Section 2.1(c), the Company shall not be deemed to have used its reasonable best efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement effective during the Shelf Period if the Company voluntarily takes any action or omits to take any action that would result in Holders of Registrable Securities covered thereby not being able to offer and sell any Registrable Securities pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement during the Shelf Period, unless such action or omission is required by applicable Law. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to remain a well-known seasoned issuer (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) and to not become an ineligible issuer (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) during the Shelf Period.
 
(b)           The Company shall be entitled to postpone (but not more than once in any 6-month period), for a reasonable period of time not in excess of 60 days, the filing or initial effectiveness of, or suspend the use of, a Shelf Registration Statement if the Company delivers to the Holders Representative a certificate signed by both the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company certifying that, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, such registration, offering or use would reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect or materially interfere with any bona fide material financing of the Company or any material transaction under consideration by the Company or would require the disclosure of information that has not been, and is not otherwise required to be, disclosed to the public, the premature disclosure of which would materially adversely affect the Company. Such certificate shall contain, if requested by the Holders Representative (and subject to their entering into a customary confidentiality obligation as to such information), a reasonably detailed statement of the reasons for such postponement or suspension and an approximation of the anticipated delay.
 
 
           If any of the Registrable Securities to be sold pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement are to be sold in a firm commitment underwritten offering, and the managing underwriter(s) of such underwritten offering advise the Holders in writing that it is their good faith opinion that the total number or dollar amount of Registrable Securities proposed to be sold in such offering, together with any Other Securities proposed to be included by holders thereof which are entitled to include securities in such Registration Statement, exceeds the total number or dollar amount of such securities that can be sold without having an adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of the Registrable Securities to be so included together with all such Other Securities, then there shall be included in such firm commitment underwritten offering the number or dollar amount of Registrable Securities and such Other Securities that in the opinion of such managing underwriter(s) can be sold without so adversely affecting such offering, and such number of Registrable Securities and Other Securities shall be allocated for inclusion as follows:
(c)
 
           first, the Registrable Securities for which inclusion in such underwritten offering requested by the Holders, pro rata (if applicable), based on the number of Registrable Securities Beneficially Owned by each such Holder; and
(i)
 
           second, among any holders of Other Securities, pro rata, based on the number of Other Securities Beneficially Owned by each such holder of Other Securities.
(ii)
 
(d)           The Holders Representative shall have the right to notify the Company that it has determined that the Shelf Registration Statement be abandoned or withdrawn, in which event the Company shall promptly abandon or withdraw such Shelf Registration Statementand the Holders Representative shall promptly reimburse the Company for all Registration Expenses incurred by the Company in connection with such abandoned or withdrawn registration statement.
 
Section 2.2.               (a) If, following the six (6) month anniversary of the date hereof, the Company is unable to file, cause to be effective or maintain the effectiveness of a Shelf Registration Statement as required under Section 2.1, the Holders Representative shall have the right by delivering a written notice to the Company (a ) to require the Company to, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, register under and in accordance with the provisions of the Securities Act the number of Registrable Securities Beneficially Owned by any Holders and requested by such Demand Notice to be so registered (a ); , , that a Demand Notice may only be made if the sale of the Registrable Securities requested to be registered in a Demand Notice is reasonably expected to result in aggregate gross cash proceeds in excess of $50,000,000 (without regard to any underwriting discount or commission). A Demand Notice shall also specify the expected method or methods of disposition of the applicable Registrable Securities. Following receipt of a Demand Notice, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to file, as promptly as reasonably practicable, but not later than days after receipt by the Company of such Demand Notice (subject to paragraph (e) of this Section 2.2), a Registration Statement relating to the offer and sale of the Registrable Securities requested to be included therein by the Holders thereof in accordance with the methods of distribution elected by such Holders (a ) and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after the filing thereof.

(a)           The Notes will be issued in registered form only, without coupons, and the Company shall cause the Trustee to maintain a register (the Register) of the Notes, for registering the record ownership of the Notes by the Holders and transfers and exchanges of the Notes.
 
(b)           (1)           Each Global Note will be registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee and, so long as DTC is serving as the Depositary thereof, will bear the DTC Legend.
 
(2)           Each Global Note will be delivered to the Trustee as custodian for the Depositary. Transfers of a Global Note (but not a beneficial interest therein) will be limited to transfers thereof in whole, but not in part, to the Depositary, its successors or their respective nominees, except (1) as set forth in Section 2.09(b)(4) and (2) transfers of portions thereof in the form of Certificated Notes may be made upon request of an Agent Member (for itself or on behalf of a beneficial owner) by written notice given to the Trustee by or on behalf of the Depositary in accordance with customary procedures of the Depositary and in compliance with this Section 2.09 and Section 2.10.
 
(3)           Agent Members will have no rights under the Indenture with respect to any Global Note held on their behalf by the Depositary, and the Depositary may be treated by the Company,
 
-27-
 
the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee as the absolute owner and Holder of such Global Note for all purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Depositary or its nominee may grant proxies and otherwise authorize any Person (including any Agent Member and any Person that holds a beneficial interest in a Global Note through an Agent Member) to take any action which a Holder is entitled to take under the Indenture or the Notes, and nothing herein will impair, as between the Depositary and its Agent Members, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of the rights of a holder of any security.
 
(4)           If (x) the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for a Global Note and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of the notice or (y) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Trustee has received a request from the Depositary, the Trustee will promptly exchange each beneficial interest in the Global Note for one or more Certificated Notes in authorized denominations having an equal aggregate principal amount registered in the name of the owner of such beneficial interest, as identified to the Trustee by the Depositary, and thereupon the Global Note will be deemed canceled.
 
(c)           Each Certificated Note will be registered in the name of the holder thereof or its nominee.
 
(d)           A Holder may transfer a Note (or a beneficial interest therein) to another Person or exchange a Note (or a beneficial interest therein) for another Note or Notes of any authorized denomination by presenting to the Trustee a written request therefor stating the name of the proposed transferee or requesting such an exchange, accompanied by any certification, opinion or other document required by Section 2.10. The Trustee will promptly register any transfer or exchange that meets the requirements of this Section 2.09 by noting the same in the register maintained by the Trustee for the purpose; provided that
 
(x) no transfer or exchange will be effective until it is registered in such register; and
(y) the Trustee will not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Note for a period of 15 days before a selection of Notes to be redeemed or purchased pursuant to an Offer to Purchase, (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Note so selected for redemption or purchase in whole or in part, except, in the case of a partial redemption or purchase, that portion of any Note not being redeemed or purchased, or (iii) if a redemption or a purchase pursuant to an Offer to Purchase is to occur after a Regular Record Date but on or before the corresponding Interest Payment Date, to register the transfer of or exchange any Note on or after the Regular Record Date and before the date of redemption or purchase. Prior to the registration of any transfer, the Company, the Trustee and their agents will treat the Person in whose name the Note is registered as the owner and Holder thereof for all purposes (whether or not the Note is overdue), and will not be affected by notice to the contrary.
From time to time the Company will execute and the Trustee will authenticate additional Notes as necessary in order to permit the registration of a transfer or exchange in accordance with this Section 2.09.
 
No service charge will be imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of any Note, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith (other than a transfer tax or other similar governmental charge payable upon exchange pursuant to subsection (b)(4)).

(e)           (1)          .  If a beneficial interest in a Global Note is transferred or exchanged for a beneficial interest in another Global Note, the Trustee will (x) record a decrease in the principal amount of the Global Note being transferred or exchanged equal to the principal amount of such transfer or exchange and (y) record a like increase in the principal amount of the other Global Note. Any beneficial interest in one Global Note that is transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in another Global Note, or exchanged for an interest in another Global Note, will, upon transfer or exchange, cease to be an interest in such Global Note and become an interest in the other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer and exchange restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such an interest.
Global Note to Global Note
 
(2)           .

(3)           .  If a Certificated Note is transferred or exchanged for a beneficial interest in a Global Note, the Trustee will (x) cancel such Certificated Note, (y) record an increase in the principal amount of such Global Note equal to the principal amount of such transfer or exchange and (z) in the event that such transfer or exchange involves less than the entire principal amount of the canceled Certificated Note, deliver to the Holder thereof one or more new Certificated Notes in authorized denominations having an aggregate principal amount equal to the untransferred or unexchanged portion of the canceled Certificated Note, registered in the name of the Holder thereof.
Certificated Note to Global Note
 
(4)           .  If a Certificated Note is transferred or exchanged for another Certificated Note, the Trustee will (x) cancel the Certificated Note being transferred or exchanged, (y) deliver one or more new Certificated Notes in authorized denominations having an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such transfer or exchange to the transferee (in the case of a transfer) or the Holder of the canceled Certificated Note (in the case of an exchange), registered in the name of such transferee or Holder, as applicable, and (z) if such transfer or exchange involves less than the entire principal amount of the canceled Certificated Note, deliver to the Holder thereof one or
Certificated Note to Certificated Note
more Certificated Notes in authorized denominations having an aggregate principal amount equal to the untransferred or unexchanged portion of the canceled Certificated Note, registered in the name of the Holder thereof.
 
Section 2.10.           .  The transfer or exchange of any Note (or a beneficial interest therein) may only be made in accordance with Section 2.09 and Section 2.11 and, in the case of a Global Note (or a beneficial interest therein), the applicable rules and procedures of the Depositary.  The Trustee shall refuse to register any requested transfer or exchange that does not comply with the preceding sentence.

If, as of the first day of any calendar month, the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds not theretofore subject to an Offer to Purchase pursuant to this Section 4.11 totals at least $50 million, the Company must commence, not later than the fifteenth Business Day of such month, and consummate an Offer to Purchase from the Holders (and if required by the terms of any Indebtedness that is pari passu with the Notes (Pari Passu Indebtedness), from the holders of such Pari Passu Indebtedness) on a pro rata basis an aggregate principal amount of Notes (and Pari Passu Indebtedness) equal to the Excess Proceeds on such date, at a purchase price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus, in each case, accrued interest (if any) to the Payment Date.
 
To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Offer to Purchase is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Company may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for any other purpose which is permitted by the Indenture.
 
If the aggregate principal amount of Notes surrendered by holders thereof and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Trustee shall select the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness. Upon completion of such Offer to Purchase, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset to zero.

Section 6.04.      .  A Holder of any Note of any series may not institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture or that series of Notes, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless:

A Holder may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Holder of Notes of the same series or to obtain a preference or priority over such other Holder (it being understood that the Trustee does not have any affirmative duty to ascertain whether or not such actions or forbearances are unduly prejudicial to such Holders).
 
Section 6.05.       .  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder of a Note to receive payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, such Note or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment, on or after the due date expressed in the Notes, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of the Holder.
Rights of Holders to Receive Payment
 
Section 6.06.      .

The Trustee may also place an appropriate notation on any
Note thereafter authenticated. However, the effectiveness of the amendment, supplement or waiver is not affected by any failure to annotate or exchange Notes in this fashion.

The Trustee shall be provided with, and will be fully protected in conclusively relying upon, an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of any amendment, supplement or waiver authorized pursuant to this Article is authorized or permitted by the Indenture.

Subject to this Article 10, each of the Guarantors hereby, jointly and severally, unconditionally guarantees to each Holder of a Note and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, irrespective of the validity and enforceability of this Indenture, the Notes or the obligations of the Company hereunder or thereunder, that: (a) the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes will be promptly paid in full when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, redemption or otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes, if any, if lawful, and all other obligations of the Company to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder will be promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof; and (b) in the case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Notes or any of such other obligations, that the same will be promptly paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise. Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed or any performance so guaranteed for whatever reason, the Guarantors shall be jointly and severally obligated to pay the same immediately. Each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that this is a guarantee of payment and not a guarantee of collection.
Guarantees.
 
The Guarantors hereby agree that their obligations hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Notes or this Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder of the Notes with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the Company, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor. Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever and covenant that this
Guarantee shall not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in the Notes and this Indenture or pursuant to Section 10.04.
 
If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Company, the Guarantors or any custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to either the Company or the Guarantors, any amount paid by either to the Trustee or such Holder, this Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and effect.

Each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that it shall not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to the Holders in respect of any obligations guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all obligations guaranteed hereby. Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that, as between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article 6 for the purposes of this Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby, and (y) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such obligations as provided in Article 6, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for the purpose of this Guarantee. The Guarantors shall have the right to seek contribution from any non-paying Subsidiary Guarantor so long as the exercise of such right does not impair the rights of the Holders under the Guarantee.
 
Section 10.02.      .  Each Subsidiary Guarantor, and by its acceptance of Notes, each Holder, hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such parties that the Guarantee of such Guarantor not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to any Guarantee. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Trustee, the Holders and the Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under its Guarantee and this Article 10 shall be limited to the maximum amount as will, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Subsidiary Guarantor that are relevant under such laws, and after giving effect to any collections from, rights to receive contribution from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Subsidiary Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Subsidiary Guarantor under this Article 10, result in the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under its Guarantee to not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.

 E*TRADE FINANCIAL Corporation (NASDAQ: ETFC) today announced an agreement that will result in a cash infusion of $2.5 billion.  The transaction, led by affiliates of Citadel Investment Group, includes immediate funding of approximately $2.4 billion with the remaining $150 million expected to fund by January 15, 2008.  The investment fortifies the Companys balance sheet, allows the Company to focus on its core retail business and provides additional capital to manage credit risk.
New York, November 29, 2007
E*TRADE also announced that, effective immediately, R. Jarrett Lilien has been named acting Chief Executive Officer of the Company, succeeding Mitchell H. Caplan, who has stepped down from the position of CEO.  Mr. Caplan will serve as an advisor to the Company on transition matters through the end of the year.  Mr. Lilien, who is also a Director of the Company, has been E*TRADE FINANCIALs President and Chief Operating Officer, leading the retail business since 2003.  The Company will conduct an executive search for the CEO position, which will include Mr. Lilien and external candidates.
The Company also announced that Donald H. Layton, who has served as a special advisor to the E*TRADE FINANCIAL Board of Directors, will become Chairman of the Board, succeeding George A. Hayter who will remain a Director of the Company.  Mr. Layton retired in 2004 after 29 years at JP Morgan Chase and its predecessors, serving most recently as Vice Chairman, and as a member of its three person Office of the Chairman and its Executive Committee.
E*TRADEs core business is strong, said Mr. Lilien.  This transaction with Citadel is not only a major vote of confidence from one of the worlds leading financial institutions but also allows us
 
 
to directly address customer concerns and get back to our real business, which is providing industry leading products and services to our customers.
Mr. Layton said, E*TRADE FINANCIALs Board of Directors, in cooperation with our financial advisors, conducted a thorough and robust review of strategic alternatives.  As part of this process, the Company held discussions with potential strategic and financial partners.  In the end, the Board unanimously concluded that the transaction with Citadel clearly provides the greatest benefits to our shareholders and other constituencies.  The Company now has the financial strength to aggressively compete in the marketplace.
With its strong brand, solid business model and fortified balance sheet, we believe E*TRADE is well-positioned to execute on its growth strategy for its core retail business, said Ken Griffin, Founder and CEO of Citadel Investment Group. We believe this capital infusion will restore investor and customer confidence in the Company, and will allow the Board and management to continue to grow the business from a position of strength, creating value for all shareholders.
This transaction removes the assets with the greatest market risk from E*TRADEs consolidated balance sheet.  Effective today, E*TRADE has divested itself of its $3 billion asset-backed securities (ABS) portfolio, including its ABS collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and second lien securities.
E*TRADE FINANCIAL, with more than 4.7 million customer accounts worldwide and $227 billion of assets under management as of October 31, is a global financial services leader.  Its retail brokerage business is recognized for its customer service, product innovation and execution speed, and it maintains a well-capitalized status by regulatory standards.
MANAGEMENT CHANGES
In addition to his position as acting CEO, Mr. Lilien will retain his seat on the Companys Board of Directors.  Mr. Lilien joined E*TRADE FINANCIAL in August 1999.  Prior to his election as President and COO in March 2003, Mr. Lilien served as Chief Brokerage Officer and President, E*TRADE Securities LLC.  Mr. Lilien has also served the Company as Managing Director, Asia-Pacific and Latin America.  He spent 10 years as Chief Executive Officer of TIR Holdings, which E*TRADE FINANCIAL acquired in August 1999.  Prior to TIR, he held various positions at Paine Webber and Autranet, a former division of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, Inc.
Jarrett is a proven leader who has demonstrated vision and effectiveness in many positions throughout the Company, said Mr. Hayter.  We are confident that he is the right person to lead E*TRADE forward as we focus on our core retail business.
We value the contributions that Mitch has made to E*TRADE over the past seven years, and the Board thanks him for his dedication and service, continued Mr. Hayter.  Mitch played a vital role in reaching this agreement with Citadel, and his passion has helped revolutionize the online financial services industry, positioning E*TRADE as a leader in value, customer service and product innovation.
It has been an honor to work with E*TRADEs employees, management team, Board and customers as we transformed the Company.  I am proud of our accomplishments, said Mr. Caplan.  With todays transaction, I am pleased to pass on our Company as a strong, vibrant leader in financial services.
 
 
TRANSACTION TERMS
Under the terms of the Citadel transaction, E*TRADE will receive $2.5 billion in cash, of which $2.4 billion will fund today.  The terms include:
