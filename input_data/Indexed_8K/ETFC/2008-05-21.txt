Item 3.02  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
 
E*TRADE Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the Company), has entered into Exchange Agreements with certain existing holders of its outstanding debt securities (the Holders), pursuant to which the Company issued shares of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Common Stock), in consideration of and in exchange for the Companys debt securities held by such Holders (the Exchanged Notes).  Between May1, 2008 and May16, 2008, the Company issued shares of Common Stock in exchange of Exchanged Notes as set forth in the table below.  All shares of the Common Stock were issued without registration under the Securities Act of 1933 in reliance upon the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(9) thereunder.  No commission or remuneration was paid or given, directly or indirectly, for soliciting these transactions.
 
 
 
Item 5.03  Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year
 
(a)           Attached as Exhibit 3.1 is a copy of the Companys Certificate of Incorporation as amended by filing with the Secretary of State of Delaware on May 19, 2008.
 
Also attached as Exhibit 3.2 is the text of amendments to the bylaws (the Bylaws) of the Company.  Effective May16, 2008, the Board unanimously adopted resolutions amending and restating the Bylaws of the Company to change the voting standard for the election of directors in uncontested elections from a plurality to a majority voting standard.  The most significant modifications are as follows:
 
 
 
 
The Companys corporate governance guidelines have been revised to require each director to submit an advance, irrevocable contingent resignation to the Chair of the Governance Committee following the directors election or reelection to the Board.  This resignation would become effective if, in an uncontested election, the director failed to receive a majority of the votes cast with respect to his or her election.  The Governance Committee then would act on an expedited
 
basis to determine whether to accept the directors resignation, and submit its recommendation to the Board.  The Board would be required to publicly disclose its decision and, if the resignation is rejected, its rationale within 90 days following certification of the stockholder vote.  The revised corporate governance guidelines will be posted to the Companys website at .
www.etrade.com
 
The Company will obtain from each director a signed advance, irrevocable contingent resignation as required by the Companys revised corporate governance guidelines.
 
Item 8.01  Other Events
 
On May 16, 2008, the Board, acting pursuant to Section 2.02 of the Bylaws, unanimously adopted a resolution fixing the number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board at ten (10) directors.

Dividends and Distributions
(A)           The holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year (each such date being referred to as a ), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of any shares or fraction of a share of Series B Preferred Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (1) $1.00 and (2) subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 1000 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends or other distributions and 1000 times the aggregate per share amount of all non-cash dividends or other distributions (other than (x) a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Corporation or (y) a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise)), declared on the Common Stock since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series B Preferred Stock.

reclassification or otherwise) in to a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause 2(A)(2) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
(B)           The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Series B Preferred Stock as provided in Paragraph 2(a) above immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than as described in clauses 2(A)(2)(x) and 2(A)(2)(y) above); that if no dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the Common Stock during the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date (or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, the period between the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series B Preferred Stock and such first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date), a dividend of $1.00 per share on the Series B Preferred Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.
provided
(C)           Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares of Series B Preferred Stock, unless the date of issue of such shares is on or before the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and on or before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.  Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest.  Dividends paid on shares of Series B Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding.  The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of share of Series B Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall not be more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.
3.           .  In addition to any other voting rights required by law, the holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:
Voting Rights

If the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date pay any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock or effect a subdivision or combination of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the number of votes per share to which holders of shares of Series

B Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
(B)           Except as otherwise provided herein or by law, the holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock shall vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation.
(C)           (i)           If at any time dividends on any Series B Preferred Stock shall be in arrears in an amount equal to six quarterly dividends thereon, the occurrence of such contingency shall mark the beginning of a period (herein called a ) which shall extend until such time when all accrued and unpaid dividends for all previous quarterly dividend periods and for the current quarterly dividend period on all shares of Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding shall have been declared and paid or set apart for payment.  During each default period, all holders of Preferred Stock and any other series of Preferred Stock then entitled as a class to elect directors, voting together as a single class, irrespective of series, shall have the right to elect two Directors.
default period
(ii)           During any default period, such voting right of the holders of Series B Preferred Stock may be exercised initially at a special meeting called pursuant to subparagraph 3(C)(iii) hereof or at any annual meeting of stockholders, and thereafter at annual meetings of stockholders, that neither such voting right nor the right of the holders of any other series of Preferred Stock, if any, to increase, in certain cases, the authorized number of Directors shall be exercised unless the holders of 10 percent in number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding shall be present in person or by proxy.  The absence of a quorum of holders of Common Stock shall not affect the exercise by holders of Preferred Stock of such voting right.  At any meeting at which holders of Preferred Stock shall exercise such voting right initially during an existing default period, they shall have the right, voting as a class, to elect Directors to fill such vacancies, if any, in the Board of Directors as may then exist up to two Directors or, if such right is exercised at an annual meeting, to elect two Directors.  If the number which may be so elected at any special meeting does not amount to the required number, the holders of the Preferred Stock shall have the right to make such increase in the number of Directors as shall be necessary to permit the election by them of the required number.  After the holders of the Preferred Stock shall have exercised their right to elect Directors in any default period and during the continuance of such period, the number of Directors shall not be increased or decreased except by vote of the holders of Preferred Stock as herein provided or pursuant to the rights of any equity securities ranking senior to or with the Series B Preferred Stock.
provided
pari passu
(iii)           Unless the holders of Preferred Stock shall, during an existing default period, have previously exercised their right to elect Directors, the Board of Directors may order, or any stockholder or stockholders owning in the aggregate not less than 10 percent of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding, irrespective of series, may request the calling of a special meeting of holders of Preferred Stock, which meeting
 
5
 
shall thereupon be called by the President, a Vice President or the Secretary of the Corporation.  Notice of such meeting and of any annual meeting at which holders of Preferred Stock are entitled to vote pursuant to this paragraph 3(C)(iii) shall be given to each holder of record of Preferred Stock by mailing a copy of such notice to him or her at his or her last address as the same appears on the books of the Corporation.  Such meeting shall be called for a time not earlier than 20 days and not later than 60 days after such order or request or in default of the calling of such meeting within 60 days after such order or request, such meeting may be called on similar notice by any stockholder or stockholders owning in the aggregate not less than 10 percent of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding, irrespective of series.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph 3(C)(iii), no such special meeting shall be called during the period within 60 days immediately preceding the date fixed for the next annual meeting of stockholders.
(iv)           In any default period, the holders of Common Stock, and other classes of stock of the Corporation if applicable, shall continue to be entitled to elect the whole number of Directors until the holders of Preferred Stock shall have exercised their right to elect two Directors voting as a class, after the exercise of which right (x) the Directors so elected by the holders of Preferred Stock shall continue in office until their successors shall have been elected by such holders or until the expiration of the default period, and (y) any vacancy in the Board of Directors may (except as provided in paragraph 3(C)(ii) hereof) be filled by vote of a majority of the remaining Directors theretofore elected by the holders of the class of stock which elected the Director whose office shall have become vacant.  References in this paragraph 3(C) to Directors elected by the holders of a particular class of stock shall include Directors elected by such Directors to fill vacancies as provided in clause (y) of the foregoing sentence.
(v)           Immediately upon the expiration of a default period, (x) the right of the holders of Preferred Stock as a class to elect Directors shall cease, (y) the term of any Directors elected by the holders of Preferred Stock as a class shall terminate, and (z) the number of Directors shall be such number as may be provided for in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws irrespective of any increase made pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 3(C)(ii) hereof (such number being subject, however, to change thereafter in any manner provided by law or in the certificate of incorporation or Bylaws).  Any vacancies in the Board of Directors effected by the provisions of clauses (y) and (z) in the preceding sentence may be filled by a majority of the remaining Directors.
(D)           The Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation shall not be amended in any manner (whether by merger or otherwise) so as to adversely affect the powers, preferences or special rights of the Series B Preferred Stock without the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class.
(E)           Except as otherwise provided herein, holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights, and their consent shall not be required for taking any corporate action.
