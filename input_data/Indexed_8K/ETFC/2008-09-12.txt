On September 11, 2008, the Board of Directors of E*TRADE Financial Corporation (the Company) appointed Bruce P. Nolop to the position of Chief Financial Officer of the Company, effective September 12, 2008, reporting to Donald H. Layton, the Companys Chairman and CEO. Mr. Nolop assumes responsibility for all financial reporting, planning, control, corporate-related treasury functions, investor relations, tax, corporate development and purchasing activities.
Mr. Nolop, age 57, most recently served as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Pitney Bowes from 2000 until March 2008.  Mr. Nolop serves as a member of the Board of Directors of Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.
Pursuant to the Companys employment agreement with Mr. Nolop, he will receive an initial annual base salary of $500,000 and will be eligible for an annual bonus with a target bonus of 100% of his base salary, which will be guaranteed at the target level for 2008 (on a prorated basis) and 2009.  The Company has granted him stock options with an initial aggregate value of approximately $1.75 million (based on an option valuation methodology) and restricted stock awards with an initial aggregate value of approximately $1.75 million, which will vest with respect to 5/14 of the awards on December 31, 2009, 6/14 of the awards on December 31, 2010 and 3/14 on December 31, 2011.  It is anticipated that there would be no further equity awards prior to January 1, 2011.  Under the employment agreement, if Mr. Nolop is terminated without cause or resigns for good reason (including material reduction in duties or salary), he will receive severance pay equal to one times the sum of his salary and target bonus, a prorated bonus for the year of termination, and accelerated vesting of his initial equity awards (or, if the termination occurs before September 2009, only 4/7 of the equity awards will vest).  If the termination occurs in connection with or following a change in control, he will receive severance equal to two times the sum of his salary and target bonus, a prorated bonus for the year of termination, and full accelerated vesting of his equity awards.
