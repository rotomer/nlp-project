E*TRADE Financial Corporation (the "Company") is filing this Current Report on Form 8-K to update the historical financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007 (the "2007 Form 10-K") for discontinued operations. The discontinued operations relates to the sale of our Canadian brokerage business and the exit of our direct retail lending business. Both of these events met the requirements under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, ("SFAS No. 144") for classification as discontinued operations.
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
Under the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), the same classification as discontinued operations required by SFAS No. 144 is also required for previously issued financial statements included in the Company's currently filed 2007 Form 10-K, if those financial statements are incorporated by reference in filings with the SEC made under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, even though those financial statements related to periods prior to these businesses' operations being classified as discontinued operations.
On August 8, 2008 and November 5, 2008, the Company filed its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2008 ("June 2008 10-Q") and for the quarter ended September 30, 2008 ("September 2008 10-Q"), respectively, with the SEC. In the June 2008 10-Q and the September 2008 10-Q, the Company presented its results to reflect the discontinued operations.
The reclassification has no effect on the Company's reported net income for any reporting period and has no material effect on the Company's results of operations or financial condition.
This report includes our reclassified audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.
The reclassified consolidated financial information is attached to this current report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1. Because we are reclassifying certain financial information in the 2007 Form 10-K for discontinued operations, the revised sections of our 2007 Form 10-K included in this report have not been otherwise updated for events occurring after the date of our Consolidated Financial Statements, which were originally presented in the 2007 Form 10-K filed on February 28, 2008. All other information in the 2007 Form 10-K remains unchanged and is not being updated in this filing. This report should be read in conjunction with our 2007 Form 10-K (except for Items 6, 7 and 8 of Part II, which are contained in this report).
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.

GLOSSARY OF TERMS
In analyzing and discussing our business, we utilize certain metrics, ratios and other terms that are defined in the Glossary of Terms, which is located at the end of Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
OVERVIEW
Strategy
Our strategy centers on growing our global customer base and mitigating the risks associated with our balance sheet. We plan to grow our global customer base by appealing to retail investors, specifically those who are customers of large established financial institutions, by providing them with innovative, easy, low-cost financial solutions and service. Our financial solutions include a suite of trading, investing, banking and lending products.
Our plan to mitigate the risks associated with our balance sheet contains three core goals: reduce credit risk in our loan portfolio, reduce our level of corporate debt and reduce operating expenses. We believe that the successful completion of this plan will significantly improve our financial strength and will help restore customer and investor confidence in our franchise.
We are also focused on simplifying and streamlining the business by exiting and/or restructuring certain non-core operations, primarily in our lending and institutional businesses. We believe these changes will better align our business with the global retail investor.
Key Factors Affecting Financial Performance
Our financial performance is affected by a number of factors outside of our control, including:

Significant Events in 2007
Citadel Limited Partnership ("Citadel") Investment of $2.5 Billion Including Sale of Asset-Backed Securities Portfolio
The operating environment during 2007, particularly during the second half of the year, was extremely challenging as our exposure to the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets adversely impacted our financial performance and led to a disruption in our customer base. As a result, we believe it was necessary to obtain a significant infusion of cash, which would in turn stabilize our balance sheet and our customer base.
On November 29, 2007, we entered into an agreement to receive a $2.5 billion cash infusion from Citadel. In consideration for the cash infusion, Citadel received three primary items: substantially all of our asset-backed securities portfolio, 84.7 million shares of common stock

. We believe this transaction provided timely stability for our business and helped alleviate customer concerns.
Developed a Plan to Restore Customer Confidence and Return to Growth
We developed a plan focused on resolving the risks in our balance sheet and returning our primary focus to the retail investor. Our plan contains three core goals: reduce credit risk in our loan portfolio, reduce our level of corporate debt and reduce operating expenses to allow us to reinvest in growth initiatives within the core retail franchise. We believe the successful execution of this plan will restore customer confidence and return the Company back to a path of financial growth.
Launch of Global Trading Platform
We launched our Global Trading Platform, which provides the ability to buy, sell and hold foreign equities in local currencies to investors who seek liquidity and diversity in their portfolios. Our U.S. customers now have access to foreign stocks and currencies in six major international markets: Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United Kingdom.
International Expansion
We continued our expansion into international markets with the launch of operations in Norway, the Netherlands and Singapore. In Norway, we now offer online trading of all Norwegian stocks registered on the Norwegian exchange Oslo Brs, as well as stocks from Scandinavian markets in Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and the American markets. In the Netherlands and Singapore, we offer Dutch and Singapore investors direct access to the US stock markets through our Global Trading Platform.

Significant Events in 2006
direct
Harris
and BrownCo Customer Conversions
We converted Harris and BrownCo customers to the E*TRADE Financial platform in the first and second quarters of 2006, respectively, which was a key step in the integration of our newly acquired customer base. This allowed us to deliver our functionality and services to these customers while reducing the costs associated with maintaining the legacy platforms.

Enhancements to the Complete Investment Account
We launched a series of functionality enhancements to the E*TRADE Complete Investment Account designed to help retail customers optimize their investing and borrowing relationships while evaluating their portfolio risk, including the Intelligent Lending Optimizer and the Intelligent Investing Optimizer and Risk Analyzer. We believe these new free tools will help customers better manage their security holdings, cash and credit products.
Enhanced Distribution Network
We enhanced our distribution network by opening eight new E*TRADE Financial Branches in the United States during the period. With the addition of the branches in Seattle, WA; Farmington, MI; Garden City, NY; Torrance, CA; King of Prussia, PA; Roseville, CA; Fort Lauderdale, FL; and Scarsdale, NY, we increased the number of our nationwide financial branches to a total of 24.

The new site features intuitive navigation, demonstrations of some of our most popular products and tools, direct access to account opening and customer service on every page and quick access to our powerful quotes and research functionality.
 
Development of Automated Trading Strategies Functionality
We developed new conditional orders functionality for retail customers including trailing stops for options and group orders such as contingent, one-cancels-all, one-triggers-all and one-trigger-one-cancels-other orders. When combined with the conditional order functionality already available to customers, such as trailing stops and bracketed orders for stocks, we believe this functionality will allow our customers to better manage risk.
Move of Listing to the NASDAQ Global Select Market ("NASDAQ")
On December 27, 2006 we moved the listing of the Company's common stock from the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") to the NASDAQ under the symbol ETFC.

As an industry innovator, NASDAQ's value proposition parallels our own, leveraging technology to provide customers with low fees, superior service and fair, efficient and transparent market access and execution.
Summary Financial Results
Income Statement Highlights for the Year Ended December 31, 2007 (dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
 
The operating environment during 2007, particularly during the second half of the year, was extremely challenging as the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets adversely impacted our financial performance. The losses in our institutional segment caused by this crisis more than offset the considerable growth in our retail segment. Total net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 decreased 120% compared to the prior year due primarily to the $2.2 billion loss on the sale of our asset-backed securities portfolio and an increase in our provision for loan losses of $595.1 million to $640.1 million. As a result of the decrease in net revenue, net income declined by 329% from the prior year to a loss of $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007.
The retail segment delivered strong organic growth and overall results during the year ended December 31, 2007. Total retail segment income increased 13% to $794.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the prior year. This growth in the retail segment was primarily driven by a 11% increase in net operating interest income and a 13% increase in commission revenue compared to the same period in the prior year.
 
Balance Sheet Highlights (dollars in billions)
 
 
The increase in total assets was attributable primarily to an increase of $3.7 billion in loans receivable, net. The increase in loans receivable, net was due principally to growth in our one- to four-family loan portfolio during the first and second quarters of 2007. Beginning in the second half of 2007, we altered our strategy and halted our previous focus on growing our balance sheet. For the foreseeable future, we plan to allow our interest earning assets, particularly our mortgage-backed securities and home equity loans, to pay down, resulting in an overall decline in balance. During this period, we plan to increase our excess regulatory capital levels at E*TRADE Bank as we focus on mitigating the credit risk inherent in our home equity loan portfolio. In connection with this strategy and the Citadel Investment, we have updated our secondary market purchase policies to prohibit the acquisition of asset-backed securities, CDOs and certain other instruments with a high level of credit risk through January 1, 2010.
EARNINGS OVERVIEW
2007 Compared to 2006
Net income (loss) decreased 329% to a loss of $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The decrease in net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 was due principally to the $2.2 billion loss on the sale of our asset-backed securities portfolio and an increase in our provision for loan losses of $595.1 million to $640.1 million. These losses in our institutional segment more than offset the increase in our retail segment income, which increased $91.3 million to $794.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006.
We report corporate interest income and corporate interest expense separately from operating interest income and operating interest expense. We believe reporting these two items separately provides a clearer picture of the financial performance of our operations than would a presentation that combined these two items. Our operating interest income and operating interest expense is generated from the operations of the Company and is a broad indicator of our success in our banking, lending and balance sheet management businesses. Our corporate debt, which is the primary source of our corporate interest expense, has been issued primarily in connection with the Citadel Investment and acquisitions, such as Harris and BrownCo.
direct
Similarly, we report gain (loss) on sales of investments, net separately from gain (loss) on loans and securities, net. We believe reporting these two items separately provides a clearer picture of the financial performance of our operations than would a presentation that combined these two items. Gain (loss) on loans and securities, net are the result of activities in our operations, namely our lending and balance sheet management businesses, including impairment on our available-for sale mortgage-backed and investment securities portfolio. Gain (loss) on sales of investments, net relates to historical equity investments of the Company at the corporate level and are not related to the ongoing business of our operating subsidiaries.
 
The following sections describe in detail the changes in key operating factors and other changes and events that have affected our consolidated net revenue, expense excluding interest, other income (expense) and income tax expense (benefit).
Revenue
The components of net revenue and the resulting variances are as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
 
Total net revenue declined by 120% to negative revenue of $473.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. This decline was driven by the $2.2 billion loss on the sale of our asset-backed securities portfolio and an increase in the provision for loan losses of $595.1 million to $640.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006.
Net Operating Interest Income
Net operating interest income increased 14% to $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. Net operating interest income is earned primarily through holding credit balances, which includes margin, real estate and consumer loans, and by holding customer cash and deposits, which are a low cost source of funding. The increase in net operating interest income was due primarily to the increase in enterprise interest-earning assets. Average loans, net as a percentage of average enterprise interest-earning assets increased 6% to 55% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006.
The following table presents enterprise average balance sheet data and enterprise income and expense data for our operations, as well as the related net interest spread, yields and rates and has been prepared on the basis required by the SEC's Industry Guide 3, "" (dollars in thousands):
Statistical Disclosure by Bank Holding Companies
 
Reconciliation from enterprise net interest income to net operating interest income (dollars in thousands):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Average enterprise interest-earning assets increased 25% to $56.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. Average loans, net grew 39% to $30.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. Average loans, net grew as a result of our focus on growing real estate loan products in the first and second quarters of 2007. Beginning in the second half of 2007, we altered our strategy and halted the focus on growing the balance sheet. For the foreseeable future, we plan to allow our interest earning assets, particularly our mortgage-backed securities and home equity loans, to pay down, resulting in an overall decline in balances of these assets.
Average enterprise interest-bearing liabilities increased 26% to $53.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. The increase in average enterprise interest-bearing liabilities was primarily in retail deposits. Average retail deposits increased 30% to $26.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. Increases in average retail deposits were driven by growth in the Complete Savings Account. We expect average retail deposits to continue to grow and replace repurchase agreements and FHLB advances as they mature.
Enterprise net interest spread decreased by 21 basis points to 2.64% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. This decrease was primarily the result of a challenging interest rate environment throughout the past 12 months as well as growth in our Complete Savings Account, which pays a higher interest rate than the majority of our other deposit products. We expect this decline to subside, as we focus on reducing our wholesale borrowings, which have a higher cost of borrowing when compared to deposits.
Operating interest income and operating interest expense reflect income and expense on hedges that qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133, as amended, . The following table shows the income (expense) on hedges that are included in operating interest income and expense (dollars in thousands):
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
 
 
Provision for Loan Losses
Provision for loan losses increased $595.1 million to $640.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. The increase in the provision for loan losses was related primarily to deterioration in the performance of our home equity loan portfolio in the second half of 2007. We believe this deterioration was caused by several factors, which are described below. First, the combined impact of rising mortgage rates and home price depreciation in key markets contributed to the declining performance of our home equity loan portfolio. Second, concerns that began in the sub-prime mortgage loan market spread to the broader credit markets beginning in the second half of 2007, resulting in a significant deterioration in the overall credit markets. This deterioration led to a dramatic tightening of lending standards across the industry, and general liquidity pressure for many mortgage lenders, some of whom ultimately ceased operations as a result. The factors described above dramatically reduced the ability of borrowers to refinance their mortgage loans, specifically their home equity loans, therefore drastically increasing the risk of loss once a loan becomes delinquent. During the second half of 2007, we also observed a decline in the percentage of delinquent loans that cure prior to charge-off or foreclosure once they have become delinquent. We attribute this change in behavior to the factors described above, which have significantly limited borrowers' alternatives to avoid defaulting on their loans. In addition, because of the decline in value of the homes collateralizing our home equity loans, our ability to recover our investment by foreclosing on the underlying properties has diminished as well.
We believe the provision for loan losses will continue at historically high levels in future periods as the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets continues to impact the performance of our loan portfolio.
Commission
Commission revenue increased 11% to $663.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the same period in 2006, which was driven by an increase of $61.8 million, or 13%, in our retail commission revenue. The primary factors that affect our retail commission revenue are DARTs and average commission per trade, which is impacted by both trade types and the mix between our domestic and international businesses. Each business has a different pricing structure, unique to its customer base and local market practices, and as a result, a change in the relative number of executed trades in these businesses impacts average commission per trade. Each business also has different trade types (e.g. equities, options, fixed income, exchange-traded funds, contract for difference and mutual funds) that can have different commission rates. As a result, changes in the mix of trade types within either of these businesses may impact average commission per trade. Institutional commission revenue is also impacted by negotiated rates, which differ by customer. Our institutional customers are provided with global execution and settlement services as well as worldwide access to research provided by third parties in exchange for commissions based on negotiated rates. We expect our institutional commission revenue to decline substantially in 2008 as we plan to exit a significant portion of our institutional brokerage operations.
DARTs increased 16% to 177,900 for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. Our U.S. DART volume increased 13% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. Our international DARTs grew by 42% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006, driven entirely by organic growth. Our international operations continue to be a strong growth contributor within our retail trading business, and we believe that over time they will become a significant component of our entire business. In addition, option-related DARTs further increased as a percentage of our total U.S. DARTs and now represent 16% of U.S. trading volume versus 13% a year ago.
Average commission per trade decreased 2% to $11.72 for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. The decrease was primarily a function of the mix of customers. Main Street Investors, who generally have a higher commission per trade, traded less during the period compared to Active Traders and Mass Affluent, who generally have a lower commission per trade. Customer appreciation and win-back campaigns, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2007, also contributed to the decrease in average commission per trade.
Fees and Service Charges
During the first quarter of 2007, the Company re-defined the line item "Service charges and fees" by reclassifying certain fee-like revenue items formerly reported in "Other revenue" into the "Service charges and fees" line item, now called "Fees and service charges." The fee-like revenue streams moved include payment for order flow, foreign currency margin revenue, 12b-1 fees after rebates, fixed income product revenue and management fee revenue.
 
Fees and service charges increased 5% to $230.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. This increase was due to an increase in order flow payment, advisor management fees, foreign currency margin revenue, fixed income product revenue and mutual fund fees, partially offset by a decrease in account maintenance fees and mortgage servicing fees. We expect our account maintenance fee income to continue to decline over time as we have fewer customers who are subject to the fee.
Principal Transactions
Principal transactions decreased 7% to $102.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. The decrease in principal transactions resulted from lower institutional trading volumes. Our principal transactions revenue is influenced by overall trading volumes, the number of stocks for which we act as a market maker, the trading volumes of those specific stocks and the performance of our proprietary trading activities.
Gain (Loss) on Loans and Securities, Net
Gain (loss) on loans and securities, net decreased to a loss of $2.5 billion for 2007 compared to 2006, as shown in the following table (dollars in thousands):
 
The decrease in the total gain (loss) on loans and securities, net during the year ended December 31, 2007 was due primarily to the $2.2 billion loss on the sale of our asset-backed securities portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Other Revenue
Other revenue increased 36% to $47.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. The increase in other revenue was due to an increase in the cash surrender value of Bank-Owned Life Insurance (BOLI), an increase in fees earned in connection with distribution of shares during initial public offerings and software consulting fees from our Corporate Services business.
 
Expense Excluding Interest
The components of expense excluding interest and the year-over-year variances are as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
 
Expense excluding interest increased 20% to $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in expense excluding interest was driven primarily by increases in clearing and servicing, advertising and marketing development, impairment of goodwill and other expense.
Compensation and Benefits
Compensation and benefits increased 1% to $434.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. The slight increase resulted primarily from increased benefit costs slightly offset by lower incentive based compensation in the current year.
Clearing and Servicing
Clearing and servicing expense increased 11% to $270.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. This increase is due primarily to higher loan balances during the period, which resulted in higher servicing costs, and increased trading activity, which resulted in higher clearing expenses.
Advertising and Market Development
Advertising and market development expense increased 31% to $138.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. This planned increase is a result of expanded efforts to promote our products and services to retail investors.
Impairment of Goodwill
Impairment of goodwill was $101.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. This impairment represents the entire amount of goodwill associated with our balance sheet management business, which had a significant decline in fair value during the fourth quarter of 2007.
Facility Restructuring and Other Exit Activities
Facility restructuring and other exit activities expense was $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The majority of this expense was incurred during the fourth quarter of 2007 and was driven primarily by the shut down of the international portion of our institutional brokerage business.
 
Other
Other expense increased 53% to $200.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2007 is due primarily to higher expense for certain legal and regulatory matters and higher Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") premiums.
Other Income (Expense)
Other income (expense) increased to an expense of $123.1 million for 2007 compared to an expense of $72.0 million for 2006, as shown in the following table (dollars in thousands):
 
Total other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily consisted of corporate interest expense resulting from the senior notes and mandatory convertible notes issued by the Company. We expect corporate interest expense to increase significantly in 2008 in connection with the $1.8 billion of 12

% springing lien notes issued to Citadel. During 2007, we sold our investments in E*TRADE Australia and E*TRADE Korea, which resulted in $37.0 million in gain on sales of investments, net. During 2006, we sold shares of our investments in Softbank Investment Corporation ("SBI") and International Securities Exchange Holdings, Inc. ("ISE") resulting in gains of $71.7 million.
Income Tax Expense (Benefit)
The income tax benefit from continuing operations was $732.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to an income tax expense of $305.4 million for the same period in 2006. Our effective tax rate for 2007 was (33.7)% compared to 32.8% for 2006. For additional information, see Note 17-Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements.
The Company expects the 2008 effective tax rate to increase compared to the tax rates for 2006 and 2007. The two principal reasons for the increased effective tax rate in 2008 are the non-deductibility of a portion of the interest expense on the 12

% springing lien notes as well as a reduction in the amount of tax-exempt interest earned on state and local fixed income securities. Specifically, we expect the 2008 effective tax rate to be based on a pro-forma effective tax rate of approximately 37-38% plus an additional fixed amount of income tax expense between $15 and $20 million.
Discontinued Operations
Net income from discontinued operations was $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. During 2007 and 2006, discontinued operations included operating results from our Canadian brokerage business and our direct retail lending business. During 2006, discontinued operations also included the results from our professional agency business E*TRADE Professional Trading, LLC.
2006 Compared to 2005
Net income from continuing operations increased 47% to $626.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. We experienced strong growth in customer cash and deposits as well as in DARTs. We also experienced growth in customer margin balances. In addition, we were able to achieve this growth while increasing our operating margin to 43% in 2006 from 39% when compared to prior year.
 
Revenue
Net Operating Interest Income After Provision for Loan Losses
Net operating interest income after provision for loan losses increased 66% to $1.3 billion for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase in net operating interest income was due primarily to growth in enterprise interest-earning assets coupled with an increase in enterprise net interest spread. The growth in enterprise interest-earning assets was driven by increases in both loans, net and margin receivables. The increase in enterprise net interest spread was driven by changes in our mix of lending and funding sources. Average loans, net and margin receivables as a percentage of average enterprise interest-earning assets increased 8% to 64% for 2006 compared to 2005. Average retail deposits and customer payables as a percentage of average enterprise interest-bearing liabilities increased 9% to 62% for 2006 compared to 2005.
Provision for Loan Losses
Provision for loan losses decreased 17% to $45.0 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The decrease in the provision for loan losses was related primarily to a lower provision for our consumer loan portfolio in connection with the decline in the overall size of the consumer loan portfolio.
Commission
Retail and institutional commission revenue increased 37% to $597.1 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The primary factors that affect our commission revenue are DARTs and average commission per trade, which is impacted by both trade types and the mix between our domestic and international businesses. Each business has a different pricing structure, unique to its customer base and local market practices, and as a result, a change in the relative numbers of executed trades in these businesses impacts average commission per trade. Each business also has different trade types (e.g. equities, options, fixed income, ETFs, CFDs and mutual funds) that can have different commission rates. As a result, changes in the mix of trade types within either of these businesses may impact average commission per trade.
DARTs increased 61% to 153,146 for 2006 compared to 2005. Our U.S. DART volume increased 65% from 2005, driven by both our acquisitions of BrownCo and Harrisas well as organic customer growth and engagement. Our international DARTs grew by 33% compared to 2005, driven entirely by organic growth. In addition, option-related DARTs further increased as a percentage of total U.S. DARTs and represented 13% of trading volume versus 10% in 2005.
direct
Average commission per trade decreased 11% to $11.97 for 2006 compared to 2005. The decrease was primarily a function of the mix of customers. Main Street Investors, who generally have a higher commission per trade, traded less during 2006 compared to 2005 which resulted in a heavier weighting of Active Traders, who generally have a lower commission per trade.
Fees and Service Charges
Fees and service charges increased 21% to $219.9 million for 2006 compared to the 2005. The increase in service charges and fees for 2006 was due primarily to an increase in the advisory service fee income and higher payment for order flow from improved option and equity trading volumes. This increase was offset by a decrease in account maintenance fees as our retail customers became more engaged and a greater number of customers exceeded the minimum activity levels required to avoid account maintenance fees.
Principal Transactions
Principal transactions increased 11% to $110.1 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase in principal transactions resulted from higher trading volumes and market volatility which were offset slightly by a decrease in the average revenue earned per trade. Our principal transactions revenue is influenced by overall trading volumes, the number of stocks for which we act as a market maker, the trading volumes of those specific stocks and the performance of our proprietary trading activities.
Gain on Loans and Securities, Net
Gain on loans and securities, net decreased 48% to $22.7 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The decline in the total gain on loans and securities, net during 2006 was due primarily to higher losses on sales of mortgage and
 
consumer loans compared to 2005. The decline in gain on sales of consumer loans was also due in part to the sale of our consumer finance business in 2005. The increase in gain on sales of securities, net resulted from higher security sales volumes in 2006 compared to 2005.
Other Revenue
Other revenue increased 12% to $34.8 million for 2006 compared to 2005, due primarily to an increase in our software consulting fees from our Corporate Services business.
Expense Excluding Interest
Expense excluding interest increased 35% to $1.3 billion for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase in expense excluding interest was driven primarily by an increase in the number of employees in our service organization, higher trading volumes and loan balances, facility restructuring activities and an increase in fraud related losses.
Compensation and Benefits
Compensation and benefits increased 24% to $428.9 million for 2006 compared to 2005. This increase resulted primarily from a higher number of employees in our service organization, a full year of expensing stock option expense
(1)
and increased variable and incentive compensation expense. These increases in compensation are in line with the growth and performance of our business and our focus on enhancing customer service with additional representatives.
Clearing and Servicing
Clearing and servicing expense increased 32% to $244.3 million for 2006 compared to 2005. This increase was a result of higher trading volumes and higher loan balances during the period.
Communications
Communications expense increased 34% to $103.0 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase was due primarily to expenses associated with our newly acquired customers from Harris and BrownCo. In addition, we experienced higher variable expenses, such as quote services and trade confirmations, related to our increase in trading volume.
direct
Professional Services
Professional services increased 30% to $90.1 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase was due primarily to third party support services, including technology and transitional service agreements, associated with our acquisitions of Harris and BrownCo.
direct
Facility Restructuring and Other Exit Activities
Facility and restructuring costs were $22.9 million for 2006. During the year, we relocated certain functions out of the state of California. This expense represents certain facility costs as a result of ceasing operations at these locations in addition to severance charges for those employees to whom we communicated our plans and who were terminated as part of this relocation during the year.
Other
Other expenses increased 135% to $131.3 million for 2006 compared to 2005. These increases were due primarily to a 212% increase in fraud related losses to $31.2 million for 2006 and the favorable settlement of the Nomura Securities, Inc. ("Nomura") litigation, which reduced other expense by $35.0 million in 2005. The fraud related losses were primarily identity theft situations which arose from computer viruses that attacked the personal computers of our customers. We did not suffer from a breach of the security of our systems. We reimbursed
 
 
customers for their losses through our E*TRADE Complete Protection Guarantee. These fraud schemes have impacted our industry as a whole. While we believe our systems remain safe and secure, we have implemented technological and operational changes to deter unauthorized activity in our customer accounts.
Other Income (Expense)
Other income (expense) decreased to an expense of $72.0 million for 2006 compared to income of $26.3 million for 2005. Other expense for 2006 primarily consisted of corporate interest expense resulting from the funding of the Harris and BrownCo acquisitions beginning in late 2005. Offsetting corporate interest expense was $70.8 million in gain on sales and impairment of investments. During 2006, we sold shares of our investments in SBI and ISE resulting in gains of $71.7 million.
direct
Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense from continuing operations increased 38% to $305.4 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase in income tax expense was principally related to the increase in pre-tax income over the comparable periods. Our effective tax rate for 2006 was 32.8% compared to 34.1% for 2005. The decrease in the 2006 tax rate compared to the 2005 tax rate is primarily due to benefits recognized on state tax refunds filed in one of our jurisdictions as a result of recent favorable court decisions, a reversal of valuation allowance recorded in prior years related to international operations and a continued decrease in our overall effective state tax rate due to our changing geographic footprint.
Discontinued Operations
Our net income from discontinued operations was $1.9 million for 2006. During 2006 and 2005, our discontinued operations included operating results from our Canadian brokerage business, direct retail lending business, and professional agency business E*TRADE Professional Trading, LLC. We recognized a gain of approximately $2.6 million, net of tax, in 2006 related to the sale of E*TRADE Professional Trading. In 2005, discontinued operations also included operating losses from our consumer loan origination business and our proprietary trading business E*TRADE Professional Securities, LLC, both of which were sold or discontinued during 2005.
SEGMENT RESULTS REVIEW
Retail
The following table summarizes retail financial and key metrics for the periods ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 (dollars in thousands, except for key metrics):
 
 
Our retail segment generates revenue from trading, investing, banking and lending relationships with retail customers. These relationships essentially drive five sources of revenue: net operating interest income; commission; fees and service charges; gain on loans and securities, net; and other revenue. Other revenue includes results from our stock plan administration products and services, as we ultimately service retail customers through these corporate relationships.
2007 Compared to 2006
For the first three quarters of 2007, our retail segment performed extremely well. The core drivers of the business, including net new accounts, customer cash and deposits, DARTs, and retail client assets, were all on pace to end the year at record levels. However, we experienced a disruption in our customer base in the fourth quarter of 2007 which caused a decline in these core drivers. We believe this disruption was due to the uncertainty surrounding the Company in connection with the credit related losses in our institutional segment. While we continue to anticipate credit related losses, primarily in our home equity loan portfolio, we believe our retail customer base has stabilized, and will return to growth in 2008.
Retail segment income increased 13% to $794.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. This was due primarily to the growth in commission revenue and net operating interest income, slightly offset by a decrease in gains on loans and securities, net.
Retail net operating interest income increased 11% to $962.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. This increase was driven by customer cash and deposits, which generally translate into a lower cost of funds. The growth in customer cash and deposits during the first three quarters of 2007 was largely offset by the decline in customer cash during the fourth quarter of 2007.
Retail commission revenue increased 13% to $520.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. The increase in commission revenue was primarily the result of increased trading volumes in the overall domestic equity market and in our international commissions where DARTs increased 42% from 15,431 to 21,894 for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. Retail commission revenue represented 78% and 77% of total commission revenue for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Retail segment expense increased 9% to $947.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. This slight increase related to our targeted growth in marketing spend as we expanded efforts to promote our products and services to retail investors.
As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately 3.5 million active trading and investing accounts and 0.8 million active deposit and lending accounts. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, our retail trading and investing products contributed 67% and 69%, respectively, and our deposit products contributed 27% and 25%, respectively, of total retail net revenue. All other products contributed less than 10% of total retail net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.
2006 Compared to 2005
As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately 3.5 million active trading and investing accounts and 0.5 million active lending and deposit accounts. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, our retail trading and investing products contributed 69% and 68%, respectively, and our deposit products contributed 25% and 23%, respectively, of total retail net revenue. All other products contributed less than 10% of total retail net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005.
 
The increase in retail segment income during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005 was due to an increase in net operating interest income and commission revenue, offset by lower gain on sales of loans and securities, net. Retail net operating interest income after provision for loan losses increased 99% to $870.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. Average margin receivables increased 166% to $6.5 billion for 2006 compared to 2005. Higher margin balances generally translate into a higher interest rate earned on interest-earning assets. Customer cash and deposits increased 19% at December 31, 2006 compared to December 31, 2005. Higher customer cash and deposit balances generally translate into a lower cost of funds as deposits increased in comparison to other borrowings. Net operating interest income growth included the impact of the Harris and BrownCo acquisitions which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2005.
direct
Retail commission revenue increased $136.6 million for 2006 compared to 2005 due to higher volumes (DARTs), offset by lower average commission per trade. The increase in DART volumes was the result of the Harris and BrownCo acquisitions as well as strong organic growth in domestic equity, international equity and option trades. Offsetting these increases were lower gains on loans and securities, net of $3.4 million for 2006.
direct
Retail segment expense increased $320.1 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase for 2006 was related primarily to the $23.9 million restructuring charge, an increase in the compensation expense due to an increased number of employees in our service organization and increased fraud-related losses.
Institutional
The following table summarizes institutional financial and key metrics for the periods ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 (dollars in thousands, except for key metrics):
 
 
Our institutional segment generates revenue from balance sheet management activities, market-making and global execution and settlement services. Balance sheet management activities include purchasing loan receivables from the retail segment as well as third parties, and leveraging these loans and retail customer cash and deposit relationships to generate additional net operating interest income. Retail trading order flow is leveraged by the institutional segment to generate additional revenue for the Company.
 
2007 Compared to 2006
As a result of our exposure to the credit crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets, our institutional segment incurred a loss of $2.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007. The loss was driven primarily by losses in our asset-backed securities portfolio of approximately $2.5 billion as well as provision for loan losses for our loan portfolio of $640.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Following the Citadel transaction, we no longer have exposure to asset-backed securities; as such, we do not anticipate losses of this level to occur in future periods. However, we do continue to have exposure to mortgage loans and therefore expect the provision for loan losses to continue at historically high levels.
Net operating interest income increased 21% to $621.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. The increase in net operating interest income was due primarily to the increase in average interest earning assets of 25% to $56.1 billion as of December 31, 2007.
Net operating interest income after provision for loan losses decreased 104% to a loss of $19.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. This decrease was due to the increase in provision for loan losses which increased $595.1 million to $640.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. This increase was largely due to the deterioration in the performance of our home equity loan portfolio.
Institutional commission revenue increased 3% to $143.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. The increase was due to higher trading volumes as a result of volatility in global equity markets. Institutional commission revenue represented 22% and 23% of total commission revenue for year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We expect our institutional commission revenue, which is primarily earned through trade execution services, to decline significantly in future periods as we plan to discontinue providing institutional brokerage services.
Fees and service charges revenue decreased 15% to $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2007 is related to a $4.5 million decline in service fee income as a result of lower rates and lower home equity, credit card and CDO management fees.
Gain (loss) on loans and securities, net decreased to a loss of $2.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007. This decline was due primarily to the $2.2 billion loss on the sale of our asset-backed securities portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Total institutional segment expense increased 39% to $641.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 and was due primarily to the impairment of goodwill associated with our balance sheet management business. The increase was also driven by the expenses associated with certain legal and regulatory matters.
2006 Compared to 2005
Institutional segment income increased 62% to $301.2 million for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase was driven primarily by the growth in net operating interest income after provision for loan losses and commission revenue.
Net operating interest income after provision for loan losses increased 27% to $470.1 million for 2006 compared to 2005. This increase was primarily a result of growth in interest-earning assets, which were funded primarily by retail customer cash and deposit balances.
Institutional commissions increased 23% to $138.6 million for 2006 compared to 2005. This increase was due to a more favorable trading environment and the continued leveraging of our integrated institutional model with higher retail order flow.
The increase in net operating interest income after provision for loan losses and commission revenue was offset by a planned decrease in gain on loans and securities, net of approximately $15.9 million for 2006 compared to 2005. During 2006, we determined that we would not sell securities at similar levels as 2005 because we were focused on growing our balance sheet.
 
Total institutional segment expense increased 1% to $462.6 million for 2006 compared to 2005 and was predominantly volume-related. Compensation and benefits expense increased due to increases in variable- and performance-based compensation and expensing of stock options. Clearing and servicing expense increased due to increased overall trading volumes and the increase in our loan portfolio.
BALANCE SHEET OVERVIEW
The following table sets forth the significant components of our consolidated balance sheet (dollars in thousands):
 
 
 
 
During the first quarter of 2007, we re-presented our balance sheet to report margin receivables and customer payables directly on the face of the balance sheet. The remaining components of brokerage receivables and brokerage payables are now reported in the "Other assets" and "Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities" line items, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we re-presented our balance sheet to report "Investment in FHLB stock" directly on the face of the balance sheet. This item was previously reported in the "Available-for-sale mortgage-backed and investment securities" line item.
The increase in total assets was attributable primarily to an increase of $3.7 billion in loans receivable, net. The increase in loans receivable, net was due principally to growth in our one- to four-family real estate loan portfolio during the first and second quarters of 2007. Beginning in the second half of 2007, we altered our strategy and halted the focus on growing the balance sheet. For the foreseeable future, we plan to allow our interest earning assets, particularly our mortgage-backed securities and home equity loans, to pay down, resulting in an overall decline in balance. During this period, we plan to increase our excess regulatory capital levels at E*TRADE Bank as we focus on mitigating the credit risk inherent in our home equity loan portfolio.
The increase in total liabilities primarily was attributable to the increase in deposits, wholesale borrowings and corporate debt. The $1.8 billion increase in deposits was due primarily to the significant growth in money market and savings accounts during the first three quarters of 2007, which was largely offset by the decline in
 
deposits during the fourth quarter. The increase in wholesale borrowings contributed to the growth of the loans receivable, net during the first and second quarters of 2007. The $1.2 billion increase in corporate debt is due to the $1.8 billion of 12

Loans Receivable, Net
Loans receivable, net are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
Loans receivable, net increased 14% to $30.0 billion at December 31, 2007 from $26.4 billion at December 31, 2006. This increase was primarily due to growth in one- to four-family loans during the first and second quarters. Beginning in the second half of 2007, we altered our strategy and halted the focus on growing the balance sheet. Therefore, we do not expect to grow our loan portfolio for the foreseeable future. In addition, we intend to allow our home equity and consumer loan portfolios to decline over time.
As a general matter, we do not originate or purchase sub-prime
(1)
loans to hold on our balance sheet; however, in the normal course of purchasing large pools of real estate loans, we invariably end up acquiring a de minimis amount of these loans. As of December 31, 2007, sub-prime real estate loans represented less than one-fifth of one percent of our total real estate loan portfolio.
During the first quarter of 2007, we entered into a credit default swap ("CDS") on $4.0 billion of our first-lien residential real estate loan portfolio through a synthetic securitization structure. A CDS provides, for a fee, an assumption by a third party of a portion of the credit risk related to the underlying loans. The CDS we entered into provides protection for losses in excess of 10 basis points, but not to exceed approximately 75 basis points. In addition, our regulatory risk-weighted assets were reduced as a result of this transaction because we transferred a portion of our credit risk to an unaffiliated third party.
 
 
Available-for-Sale Mortgage-Backed and Investment Securities
Available-for-sale securities are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
Available-for-sale securities represented 20% and 25% of total assets at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Available-for-sale securities decreased 18% to $11.3 billion at December 31, 2007 compared to December 31, 2006, due primarily to the sale of our asset-backed securities portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2007. Substantially all mortgage-backed securities backed by U.S. Government sponsored and Federal agencies are "AAA" rated and the majority of the asset-backed securities portfolio consisted of "AA" or higher rated securities. In the future, we plan to allow our mortgage-backed securities portfolio to pay down, resulting in an overall decline in the available-for-sale securities balance.
Margin Receivables
The margin receivables balance is a component of the margin debt balance, which is reported as a key retail metric of $7.0 billion and $6.8 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The total margin debt balance is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
 
Deposits
Deposits are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
 
 
 
Deposits represented 48% and 49% of total liabilities at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Deposits increased $1.8 billion to $25.9 billion at December 31, 2007 compared to December 31, 2006, driven by a $2.4 billion increase in money market and savings accounts. Deposits generally provide us the benefit of lower interest costs, compared with wholesale funding alternatives.
During the first three quarters of 2007, the deposits balance increased $5.1 billion, primarily the result of the growth in our Complete Savings Account. This product created measurable growth in cash from new and existing customers; however, during the fourth quarter of 2007, we experienced a disruption in our customer base and the customer deposit balances began to decline. We believe this disruption was due to the uncertainty surrounding the Company in connection with the credit related losses in our institutional segment. While we continue to anticipate credit related losses, primarily in our home equity loan portfolio, we believe our retail customer base has stabilized, and will return to growth in 2008.
The deposits balance is a component of the total customer cash and deposits balance reported as a customer activity metric of $32.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007. The total customer cash and deposits balance is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
 
 
Wholesale Borrowings
Wholesale borrowings, which consist of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
Wholesale borrowings represented 30% and 31% of total liabilities at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in other borrowings of $2.1 billion during the year ended December 31, 2007 was due primarily to an increase in FHLB advances. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase coupled with FHLB advances are the primary wholesale funding sources of the Bank. During the first and second quarters of 2007, the Bank used these wholesale sources along with deposit growth to fund the increase in loans receivable. We expect total other borrowings to decline in future periods as we focus on replacing this funding with growth in retail deposits.
 
Corporate Debt
Corporate debt is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
 
Corporate debt increased to $3.0 billion at December 31, 2007 compared to $1.8 billion at December 31, 2006. The increase is related to the $1.8 billion of 12

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We have established liquidity and capital policies. The objectives of these policies are to support the successful execution of our business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity through the business cycle and during periods of financial distress. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we experienced a disruption in our customer base, which caused a significant decline in customer deposits. We believe this disruption was due to the uncertainty surrounding the Company in connection with the credit related losses in our institutional segment. Deposits are the primary source of liquidity for E*TRADE Bank, so this sudden and rapid decline created a substantial amount of liquidity risk. We followed our existing liquidity policies and contingency plans and successfully met our liquidity needs during this extraordinary period. We believe that our ability to meet liquidity needs during this time validates the effectiveness of the liquidity policies and contingency plans.
Capital is generated primarily through our business operations and our capital market activities. During the second half of 2007, our institutional segment incurred a significant amount of losses as a result of its exposure to the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets. Consequently, this segment required a significant capital infusion during the fourth quarter. The Company raised $2.5 billion in cash from the Citadel Investment, the majority of which was used to provide capital to the institutional segment. While this segment continues to have exposure to the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets, we believe that the proceeds from the Citadel Investment as well as capital generated in our retail segment will be sufficient to meet our capital needs for at least the next twelve months.
Changes in Cash and Equivalents
In 2007, the consolidated cash and equivalents balance increased to $1.8 billion for the period ended December 31, 2007. Cash and equivalents at E*TRADE Financial Corporation, on a standalone holding company basis, increased $112.1 million to $251.7 million due primarily to an increase in cash provided by operating activities of $448.8 million and by financing activities of $1.4 billion offset by a decrease in net cash used in investing activities of $1.8 billion. Additionally, Converging Arrows, Inc. ("Converging Arrows"), a subsidiary of the parent company, had $60.1 million of cash and investment securities available as a source of liquidity for the parent company.
Corporate Debt
Our current senior debt ratings are Ba3 by Moody's Investor Service, B (watch neg) by Standard & Poor's and BB by Dominion Bond Rating Service ("DBRS"). The Company's long-term deposit ratings are Ba2 by Moody's Investor Service, BB- (watch neg) by Standard & Poor's and BB (high) by DBRS. A significant change in these ratings may impact the rate and availability of future borrowings.
Liquidity Available from Subsidiaries
Liquidity available to the Company from its subsidiaries, other than Converging Arrows is limited by regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2007, Converging Arrows had $60.1 million of cash and investment securities available as a source of liquidity for the parent company. Converging Arrows is not restricted in its
 
dealings with the parent company and may transfer funds to the parent company without regulatory approval. In addition to Converging Arrows, brokerage and banking subsidiaries may provide liquidity to the parent; however, they are restricted by regulatory guidelines.
E*TRADE Bank is prohibited by regulations from lending to the parent company. At December 31, 2007, E*TRADE Bank had approximately $435.1 million of capital above the "well capitalized" level. In the current credit environment, we plan to increase the excess capital at E*TRADE Bank in order to increase our ability to absorb credit losses while still maintaining "well capitalized" status. Therefore, we do not expect to dividend this excess capital to the parent during the foreseeable future. E*TRADE Bank is also required by Office of Thrift Supervision ("OTS") regulations to maintain tangible capital of at least 1.50% of tangible assets. E*TRADE Bank satisfied this requirement at December 31, 2007 and 2006. However, events beyond management's control, such as a continued deterioration in residential real estate and credit markets, could adversely affect future earnings and E*TRADE Bank's ability to meet its future capital requirements.
Brokerage subsidiaries are required to maintain net capital equal to the greater of $250,000 or 2% of aggregate debit balances arising from customer transactions. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, all of our significant brokerage subsidiaries met their minimum net capital requirements. The Company's broker-dealer subsidiaries had excess net capital of $730.8 million at December 31, 2007, of which $509.6 million is available for dividend while still maintaining a capital level above regulatory "early warning" guidelines.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We enter into various off-balance-sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, primarily to meet the needs of our clients and to reduce our own exposure to interest rate risk. These arrangements include firm commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. Additionally, we enter into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business. For additional information on each of these arrangements, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Other Sources of Liquidity
In addition to the liquidity available from subsidiaries, the parent company held $251.7 million in cash available as a resource. We also maintain $451.0 million in uncommitted financing to meet margin lending needs. There were no outstanding balances, and the full $451.0 million was available at both December 31, 2007 and 2006.
We rely on borrowed funds, such as FHLB advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, to provide liquidity for the Bank. At December 31, 2007, the Bank had approximately $10.5 billion in additional borrowing capacity with the FHLB.
We have the option to make the interest payments of approximately $605 million on our springing lien notes in the form of either cash or additional springing lien notes through May 2010.
 
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
The following summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2007 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (dollars in thousands):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As of December 31, 2007, the Company had $6.3 billion of unused lines of credit available to customers under home equity lines of credit and $0.5 billion of unused credit card and commercial lines. As of December 31, 2007, outstanding commitments to originate and sell loans totaled $0.4 billion and $0.1 billion, respectively, while the Company had no commitments to purchase loans. The Company had a commitment to purchase and sell securities of $0.5 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. The Company also had equity funding commitments of $25.6 million as of December 31, 2007, based on investment plans of venture capital funds, low income housing tax credit partnerships and joint ventures. Additional information related to commitments and contingent liabilities is detailed in Note 23Commitments, Contingencies and Other Regulatory Matters.
Other Liquidity Matters
We currently anticipate that our available cash resources and credit will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. We may need to raise additional funds in order to support regulatory capital needs at our Bank, reduce holding company debt, support more rapid expansion, develop new or enhanced products and services, respond to competitive pressures, acquire businesses or technologies or take advantage of unanticipated opportunities.
 
RISK MANAGEMENT
As a financial services company, we are exposed to risks in every component of our business. The identification and management of existing and potential risks are the keys to effective risk management. Our risk management framework, principles and practices support decision-making, improve the success rate for new initiatives and strengthen the organization. Our goal is to balance risks and rewards through effective risk management. Risks cannot be completely eliminated; however, we do believe risks can be identified and managed within the Company's risk tolerance.
We manage risk through a governance structure involving the various boards, senior management and several risk committees. We use management level risk committees to help ensure that business decisions are executed within our desired risk profile.
The Corporate Risk Committee, consisting of senior management executives, monitors the risk process and significant risks throughout the Company. In addition to this committee, various enterprise risk committees and departments throughout the Company aid in the identification and management of risks. These departments include internal audit, compliance, finance, legal, treasury, credit and enterprise risk management.
Interest Rate Risk Management
Interest rate risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in interest rates. Interest rate risks are monitored and managed by the E*TRADE Bank's Asset Liability Committee ("ALCO"). The ALCO reviews balance sheet trends, market interest rate and sensitivity analyses. The analysis of interest sensitivity to changes in market interest rates under various scenarios is reviewed by ALCO. The scenarios assume both parallel and non-parallel shifts in the yield curve. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for additional information about our interest rate risks.
Credit Risk Management
Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from adverse changes in a borrower's or counterparty's ability to meet its financial obligations under agreed upon terms. Our primary sources of credit risk are our loan and securities portfolios, where it results from extending credit to customers and purchasing securities, respectively. The degree of credit risk associated with our loans and securities varies based on many factors including the size of the transaction, the credit characteristics of the borrower, features of the loan product or security, the contractual terms of the related documents and the availability and quality of collateral. Credit risk is one of the most common risks in financial services and is one of our most significant risks.
Credit risk is monitored by our Credit Risk Committee. The Credit Risk Committee's duties include monitoring asset quality trends, evaluating market conditions including those in residential real estate markets, determining the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses, establishing underwriting standards, approving large credit exposures, approving large portfolio purchases and delegating credit approval authority. The Credit Risk Committee uses detailed tracking and analysis to measure credit performance and reviews and modifies credit policies as appropriate.
Conditions in the residential real estate and credit markets deteriorated sharply during 2007, particularly in the second half of 2007. The significant and abrupt evaporation of secondary market liquidity for various types of mortgage loans, particularly home equity loans, has decreased the overall availability of housing credit. As a result, many borrowers, particularly those in markets with declining housing prices, have been unable to refinance existing loans. This combination of a decline in the availability of credit and a decline in housing prices creates significant credit risk in our loan portfolio, particularly in our home equity loan portfolio.
Underwriting Standards  Originated Loans
We originate loans that generally fall into two categories:
 
 
We originate loans primarily through our mortgage lending sales force. The loans are almost entirely secured by a primary residence for the purpose of purchase money, refinance, debt consolidation, or home equity loans. We originate both amortizing and interest-only mortgage loans; however, we do not originate negative amortization or option ARMs.
 
We price our loans based on the competitive environment as well as the risk elements inherent in the loan. We evaluate criteria such as, but not limited to: borrower credit score, loan-to-value ratio ("LTV"), documentation type, occupancy type and other risk elements. In the second half of 2007, we adjusted our loan origination practices and pricing to significantly curtail originations of higher risk loans, particularly home equity loans with FICO scores below 660 or a CLTV greater than 89%. In addition, during the second half of 2007, we exited our wholesale mortgage origination channel and no longer originate loans through brokers.
Our underwriting guidelines were established with a focus on both the credit quality of the borrower as well as the adequacy of the collateral securing the loan. We have designed our underwriting guidelines so that our one- to four-family loans are salable in the secondary market. These guidelines include limitations on loan amount, loan-to-value ratio, debt-to-income ratio, documentation type and occupancy type. We also require borrowers to obtain mortgage insurance on higher loan-to-value first lien mortgage loans.
The table below summarizes the underwriting guidelines for the major originated loan types that we offered as of December 31, 2007
(1)
. However, one- to four-family loans originated and held on our balance sheet, rather than sold to third party investors, are typically held to more stringent underwriting criteria. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we retained less than 10% of the total one- to four-family retail loans originated. All of our home equity loans originations were retained in 2007 and 2006.
 
 
 
 
Underwriting decisions are made based on the overall credit characteristics of the loan, and are not automatically approved if the loan meets the individual criteria. Therefore, the average credit characteristics of the loans we originate are stronger than the minimum criteria summarized in the table above. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2007, the average retail loan originated had a FICO of 750 and an average CLTV of 69%.
We supplement our loan underwriting process with a post-closing quality control process. Our quality control process consists of a re-verification of loan documentation, an underwriting and appraisal review, and other underwriting guideline reviews. This combination of an underwriting process and a quality control process allows us to evaluate and measure adherence to the prescribed underwriting guidelines.
Underwriting Standards  Purchased Loans
Our underwriting policies for purchased loans focus primarily on ensuring (i) adherence to the underwriting policies of the originator of the loan and (ii) that the loans meet certain minimum credit criteria.
In order to confirm adherence to the underwriting policies of the originator, we obtain a copy of the underwriting guidelines used to originate the loans prior to purchase. We perform an analysis on a sample of the loans to ensure compliance with these guidelines, with a focus on: appraisal methodology and type; equity methodology and calculation; debt-to-income methodology and calculation; credit characteristics, including documentation type and credit score; employment and income requirements; and the exception policy of the originator. To the extent loans do not adhere to the underwriting policies of the originator, they are excluded from the purchase.
 
When purchasing a portfolio of loans, primarily in the first half of 2007, our strategy was to attempt to exclude loans that we believe have a higher risk of credit loss. We review a detailed listing of the credit characteristics of the portfolio prior to purchase and attempt to identify higher risk loans. Our review criteria are not static and vary by purchase, but typically focus on excluding loans in the following categories: FICO scores below 640; combined loan-to-value ratios above 100%; debt-to-income ratios above 50%; and investor property loans. Even though our strategy focuses on excluding loans with a lower credit quality, we invariably end up purchasing an insignificant amount of loans that do not meet the credit criteria. This typically occurs in a portfolio purchase where the seller of the loans requires the purchaser of the loans to buy all loans in the pool.
In the second half of 2007, we altered our business strategy and halted the focus on growing the balance sheet. As a result, we do not anticipate purchasing a significant amount of loans in future periods. However, we have significantly tightened our underwriting policies for any future loan purchases that do occur. These criteria focus on limiting the acquisition of loans with a high risk of credit loss and require the exclusion of loans with the following attributes: second lien; home equity line of credit; combined loan-to-value ratio above 80%; FICO score below 700 at time of origination; and documentation type is not full documentation.
Loan Portfolio
We track and review many factors to predict and monitor credit risk in our loan portfolios, which are primarily made up of loans secured by residential real estate. These factors include, but are not limited to: borrowers' debt-to income ratio when loans are made, borrowers' credit scores when loans are made, loan-to-value ratios, housing prices, documentation type, occupancy type, and loan type. In economic conditions in which housing prices generally appreciate, we believe that loan type, loan-to-value ratios and credit scores are the key factors in determining future loan performance. In a deteriorating housing market with declining home prices and less credit available for refinance, we believe the loan-to-value ratio becomes a more important factor in predicting and monitoring credit risk.
We believe certain categories of loans inherently have a higher level of credit risk due to characteristics of the borrower and/or features of the loan. Two of these categories are sub-prime and option ARM loans. As a general matter, we do not originate or purchase these loans to hold on our balance sheet; however, in the normal course of purchasing large pools of real estate loans, we invariably end up acquiring a de minimis amount of sub-prime loans. As of December 31, 2007, sub-prime real estate loans represented less than one-fifth of one percent of our total real estate loan portfolio and we held no option ARM loans.
As noted above, we believe loan type, loan-to-value ratios and borrowers' credit scores are key determinates of future loan performance. Our home equity loan portfolio is primarily second lien loans
(1)
on residential real estate properties, which have a higher level of credit risk than first lien mortgage loans. We believe home equity loans with a combined loan-to-value ratio ("CLTV") of 90% or higher or a FICO score below 700 are the loans with the highest levels of credit risk in our portfolios.
The breakdowns by LTV/CLTV
(2)
and FICO score
(3)
of our two main loan portfolios, one-to four-family and home equity, are as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
 
 
 
The increases in one- to four-family loans with FICO scores above 680 were driven predominantly by the purchase of loans in those categories during the year ended December 31, 2007.
In addition to the factors described above, we monitor credit trends in loans by acquisition channel and vintage, which are summarized below as of December 31, 2007 (dollars in thousands):
 
Allowance for Loan Losses
The allowance for loan losses is management's estimate of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The estimate of the allowance for loan losses is based on a variety of factors, including the composition and quality of the portfolio; delinquency levels and trends; probable expected losses for the next twelve months; current and historical charge-off and loss experience; current industry charge-off and loss experience; the condition of the real estate market and geographic concentrations within the loan portfolio; the interest rate climate; the overall availability of housing credit; and general economic conditions. Determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for loan losses in future periods. We believe our allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2007 is representative of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date.
 
In determining the allowance for loan losses, we allocate a portion of the allowance to various loan products based on an analysis of individual loans and pools of loans. However, the entire allowance is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date.
The following table presents the allowance for loan losses by major loan category (dollars in thousands):
 
 
During the year ended December 31, 2007, the allowance for loan losses increased by $440.5 million from the level at December 31, 2006. This increase was driven primarily by the increase in the allowance allocated to the home equity loan portfolio, which deteriorated significantly during the second half of 2007. We believe this deterioration was caused by several factors, which are described below. First, the combined impact of rising mortgage interest rates and home price depreciation in key markets contributed to the declining performance of our home equity loan portfolio. Second, concerns that began in the sub-prime mortgage loan market spread to the broader credit markets beginning in the second half of 2007, resulting in a significant deterioration in the overall credit markets. This deterioration led to a dramatic tightening of lending standards across the industry, and general liquidity pressure for many mortgage lenders, some of whom ultimately ceased operations as a result. The factors described above dramatically reduced the ability of borrowers to refinance their mortgage loans, specifically their home equity loans, therefore drastically increasing the risk of loss once a loan becomes delinquent. During the second half of 2007, we also observed a decline in the percentage of delinquent loans that cure prior to charge-off or foreclosure once they have become delinquent. We attribute this change in behavior to the factors described above, which have significantly limited borrowers' alternatives to avoid defaulting on their loans. In addition, because of the likely decline in value of the homes collateralizing our home equity loans, our ability to recover our investment by foreclosing on the underlying properties has diminished as well.
The following table provides an analysis of the allowance for loan losses and net charge-offs for the past five years (dollars in thousands):
 
 
 
The following table allocates the allowance for loan losses by loan category (dollars in thousands):
 
 
Loan losses are recognized when it is probable that a loss will be incurred. Our policy is to charge-off closed-end consumer loans when the loan is 120 days delinquent or when we determine that collection is not probable. For one- to four-family loans, a charge-off is recognized when we foreclose on the property. For home equity loans, our policy is to charge-off loans when we foreclose on the property or when the loan has been delinquent for 180 days. For credit cards, our policy is to charge-off loans when collection is not probable or the loan has been delinquent for 180 days.
Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 increased by $158.9 million. The overall increase was primarily due to higher net charge-offs on home equity loans, which was driven mainly by the same factors as described above. The continued pressure in the residential real estate market, specifically home price depreciation combined with tighter mortgage lending guidelines, will likely lead to a higher level of charge-offs in the future. The following graph illustrates the net charge-offs by quarter:
 
Nonperforming Assets
We classify loans as nonperforming when they are 90 days past due. The following table shows the comparative data for nonperforming loans and assets (dollars in thousands):
 
 
 
During the year ended December 31, 2007, our nonperforming assets, net increased $376.7 million from $87.6 million at December 31, 2006. The increase was attributed primarily to an increase in nonperforming one- to four-family loans of $147.7 million and home equity loans of $197.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 when compared to December 31, 2006. We expect nonperforming loan levels to increase over time due to the weak conditions in the residential real estate and credit markets.
The following graph illustrates the nonperforming loans by quarter:
The allowance as a percentage of total nonperforming loans receivable, net increased from 91% at December 31, 2006 to 121% at December 31, 2007. This increase was driven primarily by the allowance for loan losses in our home equity loan portfolio.
In addition to nonperforming assets in the table above, we monitor loans where a borrower's past credit history casts doubt on their ability to repay a loan ("Special Mention" loans). Special Mention loans represented $612.2 million, or 2%, and $259.0 million, or 1%, of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and are generally secured by real estate assets, reducing the potential loss should they become nonperforming. These loans are actively monitored, continue to accrue interest and remain a component of the loans receivable balance. The increase in Special Mention loans was due primarily to an increase in the 30-day delinquency category of real estate loans. We expect migration from this category to more serious delinquency classifications to continue due to the weak conditions in the residential real estate and credit markets.
Loss Mitigation
Given the deterioration in the performance of our loan portfolio, particularly in our home equity loan portfolio, we formed a special credit management team to focus on the mitigation of potential losses in the home equity loan portfolio.
This group is focused on providing loan modification alternatives to borrowers who qualify through our servicers. These programs include forbearance arrangements, rate and term modifications, re-aging programs and short sale options. During 2007, an insignificant number of borrowers have utilized these programs.
We are also focused on managing the exposure of undrawn home equity lines of credit. These efforts include, but are not limited to:
 
 
 
In addition, we are reviewing our purchased home equity loan portfolio in order to identify loans to be repurchased by the originator. More specifically, home equity loans that become 30 days delinquent are reviewed for early payment defaults, violations of transaction representations and warranties, or material misrepresentation on the part of the seller. Any loans identified with these deficiencies are submitted to the original seller for repurchase. Historically, the majority of these repurchase requests were honored by the original seller; however, beginning in the third quarter of 2007 our repurchase rate declined substantially.
Securities
We focus primarily on security type and credit rating to monitor credit risk in our securities portfolios. We believe asset-backed securities represent our highest concentration of credit risk. The table below details the average credit ratings by type of asset as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 (dollars in thousands):
 
During the year ended December 31, 2007, we sold substantially all of our asset-backed securities portfolio in connection with the Citadel transaction on November 29, 2007. This sale was the primary reason for the decline in available-for-sale securities rated below "AA".
Operational Risk Management
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from fraud, inadequate controls or the failure of the internal control process, third party vendor issues, processing issues and external events. Operational risks exist in most areas of the Company from advertising to customer service. While we make every effort to protect against failures in the internal controls system, no system is completely fail proof.
The failure of a third party vendor to adequately meet its responsibilities could result in financial losses and reputation risks. The Vendor Risk Management group monitors our vendor relationships. Third party vendor arrangements are overseen by the Vendor Risk Management group. The vendor risk identification process includes evaluating contracts, renewal options and vendor performance. To ensure the financial soundness of providers, we conduct financial reviews of our large providers. In addition, onsite operational audits are conducted annually for significant providers.
Fraud losses result from unauthorized use of customer and corporate funds and resources. We monitor customer transactions and attempt to identify fraudulent transactions. However, new techniques are constantly being developed by perpetrators to commit fraud.
Among other security measures, we offer customers token based security. The tokens display a six digit code that changes every sixty seconds. The number on the display and a password must be used together to access the customers account. This system is an extremely effective tool for preventing unauthorized access to a customer's account.
 
Processing issues and external events may result in opportunity loss or actual losses depending on the situation. These types of losses include issues resulting from inadequate staffing, equipment failures, significant weather events or other related types of events. External events resulting in opportunity or actual losses could include the failure of a competitor to meet its customers' needs, Internet performance issues, legal, reputation, public policy and strategic risks.
SUMMARY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Note 1Organization, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of our significant accounting policies, many of which require the use of estimates and assumptions. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following are noteworthy because they are based on estimates and assumptions that require complex, subjective judgments by management, which can materially impact reported results. Changes in these estimates or assumptions could materially impact our financial condition and results of operation.
Allowances for Loan Losses
Description
The allowance for loan losses is management's estimate of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. At December 31, 2007, our allowance for loan losses was $508.2 million on $30.2 billion of loans designated as held-for-investment. In addition to our banking loans, we extend credit to brokerage customers in the form of margin receivables.
Judgments
The estimate of the allowance is based on a variety of factors, including the composition and quality of the portfolio, delinquency levels and trends, expected losses for the next twelve months, current and historical charge-off and loss experience, current industry charge-off and loss experience, the condition of the real estate market and geographic concentrations within the loan portfolio, the interest rate climate as it affects adjustable-rate loans and general economic conditions. Determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for loan losses in future periods.
Effects if Actual Results Differ
Although we have considerable experience in performing these reviews, if management's underlying assumptions prove to be inaccurate, the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses. If our estimates understate probable losses inherent in the portfolio, this would result in additional expense. A 10% increase or decrease in the allowances would result in a $50.8 million charge or credit to income, respectively.
Classification and Valuation of Certain Investments
Description
We generally classify our investments in debt instruments (including corporate, government and municipal bonds), mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and marketable equity securities as either available-for-sale or trading. We have not classified any investments as held-to-maturity. The classification of an investment determines its accounting treatment. Both unrealized and realized gains and losses on trading securities held by our banking subsidiaries are recognized in gain on sales of loans and securities, net. Securities held by our brokerage subsidiaries are for market-making purposes and gains and losses are recorded as principal transactions revenue. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are included in accumulated other comprehensive income. Declines in fair value that we believe to be other-than-temporary are included in gain on sales of loans and securities, net for our banking investments and gain on sales and impairment of investments for our brokerage (other than those held for market-making purposes) and corporate investments. We have investments in certain
 
publicly-traded and privately-held companies, which we evaluate for other-than-temporary declines in market value. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recognized $168.7 million, $2.8 million and $40.3 million, respectively, of losses from other-than-temporary declines in market value related to our investments.
Judgments
When possible, the fair value of securities is determined by obtaining quoted market prices. For illiquid securities, fair value is estimated by obtaining market price quotes on similar liquid securities and adjusting the price to reflect differences. For securities where market quotes and similar securities are not available, we use discounted cash flows. We also make estimates about the fair value of investments and the timing for recognizing losses based on market conditions and other factors. Other-than-temporary impairment is recorded based on management judgment. Management evaluates securities based on market conditions and all available information about the issuer or underlying collateral. This information is used to determine if impairment is other-than-temporary. The determination that impairment is other-than-temporary is judgmental. Based on the facts and circumstances, companies could have different conclusions regarding when securities are other-than-temporarily impaired. Impairment of mortgage-backed or asset-backed securities is recognized when management estimates the fair value of a security is less than its amortized cost and if the current present value of estimated cash flows has decreased since the last periodic estimate. If the security meets both criterion, we write the security down to fair value in the current period. Similarly, preferred stock is considered to be impaired and written down to fair value in the current period when in a continued loss position for a prolonged period of time and that loss position is deemed to be significant by management. We assess securities for impairment at each reported balance sheet date.
Effects if Actual Results Differ
Earnings could be influenced by the timing of management's decisions to recognize a security as other-than-temporarily impaired. Our estimates are based on the best available information. Over time additional information may become available and may influence future write-downs. If all securities with fair values lower than amortized book were written-down, we would record a loss of $501.2 million. Management believes that its estimates of other-than-temporary impairment are supportable and reasonable. See Note 6Available-For-Sale Mortgage-Backed and Investment Securities to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding securities.
Valuation and Accounting for Financial Derivatives
Description
The Bank's principal assets are residential mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, which typically pay a fixed interest rate over an extended period of time. However, the principal sources of funds for the Bank are customer deposits and other short-term borrowings with interest rates that are fixed for a shorter period of time, if at all. The Bank purchases interest rate derivatives, including interest rate swaps, caps and floors, to manage this difference between long-term and short-term interest rates and to convert fixed-rate assets or liabilities to variable rates.
Accounting for derivatives differs significantly depending on whether a derivative is designated as a hedge, which is a transaction intended to reduce a risk associated with a specific balance sheet item or future expected cash flow. In order to qualify for hedge accounting treatment, documentation must indicate the intention to designate the derivative as a hedge of a specific asset or liability or a future cash flow. Effectiveness of the hedge must be monitored over the life of the derivative. Substantially all derivatives held on December 31, 2007 were designated as hedges. As of December 31, 2007, we had derivative assets of $133.1 million and derivative liabilities of $200.3 million. As of December 31, 2006, we had derivative assets of $208.1 million and derivative liabilities of $78.7 million.
Judgments
Hedge accounting is complex and involves the interpretation of a significant amount of accounting literature. From time to time, new interpretations are issued, which result in new accounting methods applied to existing and new transactions. The implementation of SFAS No. 133, as amended, involves numerous judgments and Company-level interpretations. We must make assumptions and judgments about the continued effectiveness of our hedging strategies and the nature and timing of forecasted transactions. Judgment is necessary to determine the accounting for our hedging strategies.
 
Effects if Actual Results Differ
If our hedging strategies were to become significantly ineffective or our assumptions about the nature and timing of forecasted transactions were to be inaccurate, we could no longer apply hedge accounting and our reported results would be significantly affected. Revised accounting interpretations of existing literature could materially impact our financial results. If 10% of the fair value of derivatives classified in liabilities were determined to relate to derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the adjustment would reduce income by $20.0 million before taxes. Similarly, if 10% of the fair value of derivatives included in assets were determined to not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the result would be $13.3 million in additional pre-tax income. The most significant effect of not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment is the earnings volatility that would be created by marking the derivatives to market as interest rates change.
Estimates of Effective Tax Rates, Deferred Taxes and Valuation Allowances
Description
In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we calculate our income tax expense based on our interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. This requires us to estimate our current tax obligations and the realizability of uncertain tax positions and to assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, the net amount of which we show as other assets or other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. We must also assess the likelihood that each of our deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is not , we establish a valuation allowance. When we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a reporting period, we generally record a corresponding tax expense in our consolidated statement of income. Conversely, to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary, that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed, which generally reduces our overall income tax expense. At December 31, 2007 we had a net deferred tax asset of $550.2 million, net of a valuation allowance of $91.8 million. At December 31, 2006 we had a net deferred tax liability of $58.5 million, net of a valuation allowance of $38.3 million.
more likely than not
Judgments
Management must make significant judgments to determine our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset. Changes in our estimate of these taxes occur periodically due to changes in the tax rates, changes in our business operations, implementation of tax planning strategies, the expiration of relevant statutes of limitations, resolution with taxing authorities of uncertain tax positions and newly enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance. These changes in judgment as well as differences between our estimates and actual amount of taxes ultimately due, when they occur, affect accrued taxes and can be material to our operating results for any particular reporting period.
Effects if Actual Results Differ
These changes, when they occur, affect accrued taxes and can be material to our operating results for any particular reporting period.
Valuation of Goodwill and Other Intangibles
Description
We review goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually and whenever events or changes indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with SFAS No. 142. Our recorded goodwill at December 31, 2007 was $1.9 billion, and we will continue to evaluate it for impairment at least annually. Our recorded intangible assets at December 31, 2007 were $430.0 million, which have useful lives between three and thirty years.
Judgments
In connection with our annual impairment test of goodwill, the entire amount of goodwill associated with our balance sheet management business, which had a significant decline in fair value during the fourth quarter of 2007, was determined to be impaired. We also evaluate the remaining useful lives on intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization in
 
accordance with SFAS No. 142. Our estimates of fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets depend on a number of factors, including estimates of future market growth and trends, forecasted revenue and costs, expected useful lives of the assets, appropriate discount rates and other variables.
Effects if Actual Results Differ
If our estimates of goodwill fair value change due to changes in our businesses or other factors, we may determine that an impairment charge is necessary. Estimates of fair value are determined based on a complex model using cash flows and company comparisons. If management's estimates of future cash flows are inaccurate, the fair value determined could be inaccurate and impairment not recognized in a timely manner. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. If changes in the estimated underlying revenues occurs, impairment or a change in the remaining life may need to be recognized.
Valuation and Expensing of Share-Based Payments
Description
We value and expense employee share-based payments, which is primarily stock options, in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R). We value each granted option using an option pricing model using assumptions that match the characteristics of the granted options. We then assume a forfeiture rate that is used to calculate each period's compensation expense attributed to these options.
Judgments
We estimate the value of employee stock options using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. Assumptions necessary for the calculation of fair value include expected term and expected volatility. These assumptions are management's best estimate of the characteristics of the options. Additionally, forfeiture rates are estimated based on prior option vesting experience.
Effects if Actual Results Differ
If our estimates of employees' forfeiture rates are not correct at the end of the term of the option, we will record either additional expense or a reduction in expense in the period it completely vests. This adjustment may be material to the period in which it is recorded. In addition, option fair value is based on estimates of volatility determined by us. Many methods are available to determine volatility, so the determination is subjective. Applying a different method to determine volatility could impact earnings. A 10% change in volatility would increase or decrease stock option fair value by approximately 7%. A change in fair value would affect all amortization periods.
 
REQUIRED STATISTICAL DISCLOSURE BY BANK HOLDING COMPANIES
The following table outlines the information required by the SEC's Industry Guide 3, "" These disclosures are at the enterprise level.

Interest Rates and Operating Interest Differential
Increases and decreases in operating interest income and operating interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest-earning banking assets and liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates (rate). The following table shows the effect that these factors had on the interest earned on our interest-earning banking assets and the interest incurred on our interest-bearing banking liabilities. The effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in volume by the previous year's average yield/cost. Similarly, the effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in average yield/cost by the previous year's volume. Changes applicable to both volume and rate have been allocated proportionately (dollars in thousands):
 
 
 
 
Lending Activities
The following table presents the balance and associated percentage of each major loan category in our portfolio (dollars in thousands):
 
 
Approximately 38% and 36% of the Company's real estate loans were concentrated in California at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. No other state had concentrations of real estate loans that represented 10% or more of the Company's real estate portfolio.
The following table shows the contractual maturities of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2007, including scheduled principal repayments. This table does not, however, include any estimate of prepayments. These prepayments could significantly shorten the average loan lives and cause the actual timing of the loan repayments to differ from those shown in the following table (dollars in thousands):

Available-for-Sale and Trading Securities
Our portfolios of mortgage-backed securities and investments are classified into three categories in accordance with SFAS No. 115, : trading, available-for-sale or held-to-maturity. None of our mortgage-backed securities or other investments was classified as held-to-maturity during 2007, 2006 and 2005.
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities
Our mortgage-backed securities portfolio is composed primarily of:
 
 
 
 
 
We buy and hold mortgage-backed trading securities principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. These securities are carried at market value and any realized or unrealized gains and losses are reflected in our consolidated statement of income as gain on sales of loans and securities, net.
Our investments classified as available-for-sale are carried at estimated fair value with the unrealized gains and losses reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.

Borrowings
Deposits represent a significant component of our current funds. In addition, we borrow from the FHLB and sell securities under repurchase agreements.
We are a member of, and own capital stock in, the FHLB system. In part, the FHLB provides us with reserve credit capacity and authorizes us to apply for advances on the security of FHLB stock and various home mortgages and other assetsprincipally securities that are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States governmentprovided we meet certain creditworthiness standards. At December 31, 2007, our outstanding advances from the FHLB totaled $7.0 billion at interest rates ranging from 3.71% to 5.56% and at a weighted-average rate of 4.80%.
We also raise funds by selling securities to nationally recognized investment banking firms under agreements to repurchase the same securities. The investment banking firms hold the securities in custody. We treat repurchase agreements as borrowings and secure them with designated fixed- and variable-rate securities. We also participate in the Federal Reserve Bank's term investment option and treasury, tax and loan borrowing programs. We use the proceeds from these transactions to meet our cash flow or asset/liability matching needs.

MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
The management of E*TRADE Financial Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. E*TRADE Financial Corporation's internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company's management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company's board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that:
 
 
 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections or evaluations of effectiveness regarding future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.
E*TRADE Financial Corporation's management assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in "Internal ControlIntegrated Framework." Based on management's assessment, management believes as of December 31, 2007, that E*TRADE Financial Corporation's internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
E*TRADE Financial Corporation's Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued an audit report regarding E*TRADE Financial Corporation's internal control over financial reporting. The report of Deloitte & Touche LLP appears on the next page.
 
REPORTS OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
E*TRADE Financial Corporation
Arlington, Virginia
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of E*TRADE Financial Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
Internal Control  Integrated Framework
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on the criteria established in issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2007 of the Company and our report dated February 28, 2008 (December 30, 2008 as to Note 3) expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and included explanatory paragraphs regarding the Company's adoption of new accounting standards and the retrospective adjustment for discontinued operations.

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.

We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of E*TRADE Financial Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

NOTE 1ORGANIZATION, BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
E*TRADE Financial Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, "E*TRADE" or the "Company") is a global financial services company offering a wide range of financial solutions to consumers under the brand "E*TRADE Financial." The Company offers trading, investing, banking and lending products and services to its retail and institutional customers.
Organization
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. Entities in which the Company holds at least a 20% ownership or in which there are other indicators of significant influence are generally accounted for by the equity method. Entities in which the Company holds less than 20% ownership and does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are generally carried at cost. Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The Company evaluates investments including joint ventures, low income housing tax credit partnerships and other limited partnerships to determine if the Company is required to consolidate the entities under the guidance of FASB Interpretation No. 46 revised, ("FIN 46R").
Basis of Presentation
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities-an interpretation of ARB No. 51
Certain prior period items in these consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. As discussed in Note 3Discontinued Operations, the operations of certain businesses have been accounted for as discontinued operations in accordance with the SFAS No. 144, . Accordingly, results of operations from prior periods have been reclassified to discontinued operations. Unless noted, discussions herein pertain to the Company's continuing operations.
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
The Company reports corporate interest income and expense separately from operating interest income and expense. The Company believes reporting these two items separately provides a clearer picture of the financial performance of the Company's operations than would a presentation that combined these two items. Operating interest income and expense is generated from the operations of the Company and is a broad indicator of the Company's success in its banking, lending and balance sheet management businesses. Corporate debt, which is the primary source of the corporate interest expense has been issued primarily in connection with the Citadel Investment and acquisitions, such as Harris and BrownCo.
direct
Similarly, the Company reports gain (loss) on sales of investments, net separately from gain (loss) on loans and securities, net. The Company believes reporting these two items separately provides a clearer picture of the financial performance of its operations than would a presentation that combined these two items. Gain (loss) on loans and securities, net are the result of activities in the Company's operations, namely its lending and balance sheet management businesses, including impairment on our available-for sale mortgage-backed and investment securities portfolio. Gain (loss) on sales of investments, net relates to historical equity investments of the Company at the corporate level and are not related to the ongoing business of the Company's operating subsidiaries.
During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company re-defined the line item "Service charges and fees" by reclassifying certain fee-like revenue items formerly reported in "Other revenue" into the "Service charges and fees" line item, now called "Fees and service charges." The fee-like revenue streams moved include payment for order flow, foreign exchange margin revenue, 12b-1 fees after rebates, fixed income product revenues and management fee revenue.
New Income Statement Reporting Format
During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company re-presented its balance sheet to report margin receivables and customer payables directly on the face of the balance sheet. The remaining components of brokerage receivables and brokerage payables are now reported in the "Other assets" and "Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities" line items, respectively. The Company also re-presented its balance sheet to report "Investment in FHLB stock" directly on the face of the balance sheet. This item was previously reported in the "Available-for-sale mortgage-backed and investment securities" line item.
New Balance Sheet Reporting Format
 
The financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and related notes for the periods presented. Actual results could differ from management's estimates. Material estimates in which management believes near-term changes could reasonably occur include allowance for loan losses and uncollectible margin receivables; classification and valuation of certain investments; valuation of certain debt instruments; valuation and accounting for financial derivatives; estimates of effective tax rates; deferred taxes and valuation allowances; valuation of goodwill and other intangibles; and valuation and expensing of share-based payments.
Use of Estimates
The operating environment during 2007, particularly during the second half of the year, was extremely challenging as the Company's exposure to the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets adversely impacted its financial performance and led to a disruption in its customer base. As a result, the Company believes it was necessary to obtain a significant infusion of cash, which would in turn stabilize its balance sheet and its customer base.
Citadel Investment
On November 29, 2007, the Company entered into an agreement to receive a $2.5 billion cash infusion from Citadel. In consideration for the cash infusion, Citadel received three primary items: substantially all of our asset-backed securities portfolio (approximately $3.0 billion in amortized cost), 84.7 million shares of common stock

in the Company and approximately $1.8 billion in 12

.
The items in this transaction were negotiated at arms length and transacted simultaneously and in contemplation of one another. As a result, the $2.5 billion in proceeds were allocated to each item based on their relative fair values at the time of the transaction.
The key components of our accounting for this transaction were as follows:
 
 
 
Below are descriptions and accounting policies for the Company's financial statement categories.
Financial Statement Descriptions and Related Accounting Policies
For the purpose of reporting cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments with original or remaining maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase that are not required to be segregated under Federal or other regulations to be cash equivalents. Cash and equivalents are composed of interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, funds due from banks and Federal funds. Cash and equivalents included $54.2 million and $4.9 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, of overnight cash deposits that the Company is required to maintain with the Federal Reserve Bank.
Cash and Equivalents
Cash and investments required to be segregated under Federal or other regulations consist primarily of interest-bearing cash accounts. Certain cash balances, related to collateralized financing transactions by our brokerage subsidiaries, are required to be segregated for the exclusive benefit of our brokerage customers.
Cash and Investments Required to be Segregated Under Federal or Other Regulations
Certain trading securities and financial derivative instruments, that are not designated for hedge accounting, are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term and are carried at estimated fair value based on quoted market prices. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on securities classified
Trading Securities
 
 
 
 
as trading held by the Bank are included in the gain (loss) of loans and securities, net line item and are derived using the specific identification cost method. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading securities held by broker-dealers are recorded in the principal transactions line item and are also derived by the specific identification method.
The Company classified its debt, mortgage-backed securities and marketable equity securities as either trading or available-for-sale. None of the Company's mortgage-backed or investment securities were classified as held-to-maturity at December 31, 2007 or 2006.
Available-for-Sale Mortgage-Backed and Investment Securities
Available-for-sale securities consist of mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, publicly traded equity securities, retained interests from securitizations and other debt securities. Securities classified as available-for-sale are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI"), net of tax. Fair value is based on quoted market prices, when available. For illiquid securities, fair value is estimated by obtaining market price quotes on similar liquid securities and adjusting the price quotes to reflect differences between the two securities, such as credit risk, liquidity, term, coupon, payment characteristics and other information. Realized and unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities, except for publicly traded equity securities, are computed using the specific identification cost method. Realized and unrealized gains or losses on publicly traded equity securities are computed using the average cost method. Amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the life of the security. Realized gains and losses and declines in fair value judged to be other-than-temporary are included in gain (loss) on loans and securities, net; other amounts relating to corporate investments are included in gain on sales of investments, net line item in the consolidated statement of income (loss). Interest earned is included in operating interest income for banking, lending and balance sheet management operations or corporate interest income for corporate investments.
The Company regularly analyzes certain available-for-sale investments for other-than-temporary impairment when the fair value of the investment is lower than its book value. The Company's methodology for determining impairment involves projecting cash flows relating to each investment and using assumptions as to future prepayment speeds, losses and loss severities over the life of the underlying collateral pool. Assumptions about future performance are derived from actual performance to date and the Company's view on how the collateral will perform in the future. In projecting future performance, the Company incorporates the views of industry analysts, rating agencies and the management of the issuer, along with its own independent analysis of the issuer of the securities, the servicer, the economy and the relevant sector as a whole. If the Company determines impairment is other-than-temporary, it reduces the recorded book value of the investment by the amount of the impairment and recognizes a realized loss on the investment. The Company does not, however, adjust the recorded book value for declines in fair value that it believes are temporary. Management continues to monitor and evaluate these securities closely for impairment that is other-than-temporary.
Mortgage- and asset-backed securities that both have an unrealized loss and are rated below "AA" by at least half of the agencies that rate the securities, as well as interest-only securities that have unrealized losses, are evaluated for impairment in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") 99-20, ("EITF 99-20"). Accordingly, when the present value of a security's anticipated cash flows declines below the last periodic estimate, the Company recognizes an impairment charge in the gain (loss) on loans and securities, net line item in the consolidated statement of income (loss).
Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets
An asset securitization involves the transfer of financial assets to another entity in exchange for cash and/or beneficial interests in the assets transferred. Asset transfers in which the Company surrenders control over the financial assets are accounted for as sales to the extent that consideration, other than beneficial interests in the transferred assets, is received in the exchange in accordance with SFAS No. 140, . The carrying amount of the assets transferred is allocated between the assets sold in these transactions and the retained beneficial interests, based on their relative fair values at the date of the transfer. The Company records gains or losses for the difference between the allocated carrying amount of the assets sold and the net cash proceeds received. These gains or losses are recorded in the gain (loss) on loans and securities, net line item in the consolidated statement of income (loss). Fair value is determined based on quoted market prices, if available. Generally, quoted market prices are not available for beneficial interests; therefore, the Company estimates the fair value based on the present value of the associated expected future cash flows. In determining the present value of the associated expected future cash flows, management is required to make estimates and assumptions. Key
Asset Securitization and Retained Interests
Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities
 
estimates and assumptions include future default rates, credit losses, discount rates, prepayment speeds and collateral repayment rates. Retained beneficial interests are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 115, and EITF 99-20 and are included in the available-for-sale mortgage-backed and investment securities and trading securities in the consolidated balance sheet.
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities
Loans held-for-sale consist of mortgages acquired and loans originated by the Company that are intended for sale in the secondary market. These loans are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value, as determined on an aggregate basis, based on quoted market price for loans with similar characteristics. Net unrealized losses are recognized in a valuation allowance by charges to income. Premiums and discounts on loans held-for-sale are deferred and recognized as part of gain (loss) on sales of loans held-for-sale, which is reported in the gain (loss) on loans and securities, net line item in the consolidated statement of income (loss), and are not accreted or amortized.
Loans Held-for-Sale
Margin receivables represent credit extended to customers and non-customers to finance their purchases of securities by borrowing against securities they currently own. Receivables from non-customers represent credit extended to principal officers and directors of the Company to finance their purchase of securities by borrowing against securities owned by them. Margin receivables to the Company's principal officers totaled less than $1.0 million and $6.3 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Securities owned by customers and non-customers are held as collateral for amounts due on the margin receivables, the value of which is not reflected in the consolidated balance sheet. In many cases, the Company is permitted to sell or re-pledge these securities held as collateral and use the securities to enter into securities lending transactions, to collateralize borrowings or for delivery to counterparties to cover customer short positions. At December 31, 2007, the fair value of securities that the Company received as collateral in connection with margin receivables and stock borrowing activities, where the Company is permitted to sell or re-pledge the securities, was approximately $9.6 billion. Of this amount, $3.3 billion had been pledged or sold at December 31, 2007 in connection with securities loans, bank borrowings and deposits with clearing organizations.
Margin Receivables
Loans receivable, net consists of real estate and consumer loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity. These loans are carried at amortized cost adjusted for charge-offs, net, allowance for loan losses, deferred fees or costs on originated loans and unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans. Loan fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred and the net fee or cost is recognized in interest income using the interest method over the contractual life of the loans. Premiums and discounts on purchased loans are amortized or accreted into income using the interest method over the remaining period to contractual maturity and adjusted for actual prepayments. The Company classifies loans as nonperforming when full and timely collection of interest or principal becomes uncertain or when they are 90 days past due. Interest previously accrued, but not collected, is reversed against current income when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status and is considered nonperforming. Accretion of deferred fees is discontinued for nonperforming loans. Payments received on nonperforming loans are recognized as interest income when the loan is considered collectible and applied to principal when it is doubtful that full payment will be collected. One- to four-family loans are charged off to the extent that the carrying value of the loan exceeds the estimated net realizable value of the underlying collateral at the time of foreclosure. Home equity loans are charged-off at time of foreclosure or when the loan has been delinquent for 180 days. Credit cards are charged-off when the loan has been delinquent for 180 days. Consumer loans are charged-off when the loan has been delinquent for 120 days.

The allowance for loan losses is management's estimate of credit losses inherent in the Company's loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The estimate of the allowance is based on a variety of factors, including the composition and quality of the portfolio, delinquency levels and trends, probable expected losses for the next twelve months, current and historical charge-off and loss experience, current industry charge-off and loss experience, the condition of the real estate market and geographic concentrations within the loan portfolio, the interest rate climate; the overall availability of housing credit; and general economic conditions. Determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for loan losses in future periods. In general, the allowance for loan losses should be at least equal to twelve months of projected losses for all loan types. Management believes this level is representative of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. Loan losses are charged and recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses.
Allowance for Loan Losses
 
Property and equipment are carried at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, generally three to ten years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or lease terms. Buildings are depreciated over forty years. Land is carried at cost. Technology development costs are charged to operations as incurred. Technology development costs include costs incurred in the development and enhancement of software used in connection with services provided by the Company that do not otherwise qualify for capitalization treatment as internally developed software costs in accordance with Statement of Position ("SOP") 98-1,
Property and Equipment, Net
Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use.
In accordance with SOP 98-1, the cost of internally developed software is capitalized and included in property and equipment at the point at which the conceptual formulation, design and testing of possible software project alternatives are complete and management authorizes and commits to funding the project. The Company does not capitalize pilot projects and projects where it believes that future economic benefits are less than probable. Internally developed software costs include the cost of software tools and licenses used in the development of the Company's systems, as well as specifically identified payroll and consulting costs.
Goodwill and other intangibles, net represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired through the Company's business combinations. The Company tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on at least an annual basis or when certain events occur. The Company evaluates the remaining useful lives of other intangible assets with finite lives each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization.
Goodwill and Other Intangibles, Net
Servicing assets are recognized when the Company sells a loan and retains the related servicing rights. In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156, an amendment of SFAS No. 140. This statement establishes, among other things, the accounting for all separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities. The Company adopted this statement on January 1, 2007 and the impact was not material to the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. SFAS No. 156 amends SFAS No. 140 to require that all separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities be initially measured at fair value. For subsequent measurements, SFAS No. 156 permits companies to choose between using an amortization method or a fair value measurement method for reporting purposes. As of December 31, 2007, the Company continued to account for servicing rights under the amortization method. The fair value of the servicing retained is estimated based on market quotes for similar servicing assets. Servicing assets are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income. The Company measures impairment by stratifying the servicing assets based on the characteristics of the underlying loans and by interest rates. Impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance for each stratum. The valuation allowance is adjusted to reflect the excess of the servicing assets' cost basis for a given stratum over its fair value. Any fair value in excess of the cost basis of servicing assets for a given stratum is not recognized. The Company estimates the fair value of each stratum based on an industry standard present value of cash flows model. The Company recognizes both amortization of servicing rights and impairment charges in service charges and fees in the consolidated statement of income (loss). Servicing assets are included in the other assets line item in the consolidated balance sheet. As of January 1, 2008, the Company elected to account for servicing rights under the fair value measurement method. The transition adjustment to opening retained earnings as of January 1, 2008 related to the fair value measurement election did not have a material impact on the Company's financial condition. In addition, the Company does not expect the fair value measurement election to have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in future periods.

Included in the other assets line item in the consolidated balance sheet is real estate acquired through foreclosure and repossessed consumer assets. Real estate properties acquired through foreclosures, commonly referred to as REO and repossessed assets, are recorded at fair value, less estimated selling costs at acquisition.
Real Estate Owned and Repossessed Assets
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, , which prescribes the use of the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax asset or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets when it is that a portion or all of a given deferred tax asset will not be realized. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, income tax expense includes (i) deferred tax expense, which generally represents the net change in the deferred tax asset or liability balance during the year plus any change in valuation allowances and (ii) current tax expense, which represents the amount of tax currently payable to or receivable from a taxing authority. Uncertain tax positions are only recognized to the extent they satisfy the criteria under Interpretation No. 48,

Securities sold under agreements to repurchase similar securities, also known as repurchase agreements, are collateralized by fixed- and variable-rate mortgage-backed securities or investment grade securities. Repurchase agreements are treated as financings for financial statement purposes and the obligations to repurchase securities sold are reflected as such in the consolidated balance sheet.

The Company accounts for its mandatory convertible debt by allocating the proceeds using the relative fair value of the stock purchase contracts and the debt securities on the date of issuance. The issue costs are deferred and allocated to the debt securities and the stock purchase contracts based on their relative fair values at issuance date. The portion of issuance costs allocated to the debt is amortized to corporate interest expense over the life of the debt using the interest method.

Revenues and expenses are translated at the weighted average exchange rate during the period. The effects of foreign currency translation adjustments arising from differences in exchange rates from period to period are deferred and included in AOCI for subsidiaries whose functional currency is their local currency. Currency transaction gains or losses, derived on monetary assets and liabilities stated in a currency other than the functional currency, are recognized in current operations and have not been significant to the Company's operating results in any period.

Effective July 1, 2005, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R), and Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, , using the modified prospective application method to account for its share-based compensation plans. On November 10, 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 123(R)-3  , which the Company has elected to adopt. This allows the Company to use the alternative transition method provided for calculating the tax effects of share-based compensation pursuant to SFAS No. 123(R).
Share-Based Payments

Share-Based Payment
Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards
 
Under this transition method, compensation cost includes the portion of options and awards vesting in the period for (1) all share-based payments granted prior to but not vested as of July 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, and (2) all share-based payments granted subsequent to July 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). Compensation cost for options granted prior to July 1, 2005 is recognized on an accelerated amortization method over the vesting period of the options using an estimated forfeiture rate. Compensation cost for options granted on or after July 1, 2005 is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period using an estimated forfeiture rate.
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
Upon adoption, the Company began expensing options as compensation and benefits with a one-time pre-tax credit of $2.8 million in cumulative effect of accounting change related to estimated forfeitures on restricted stock awards. Results for prior periods have not been restated. Prior to July 1, 2005, the Company accounted for its employee stock options and awards under Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, , and related interpretations, and accordingly, did not record compensation costs for option grants to employees if the exercise price equaled the fair market value on the grant date. Additionally, for restricted stock awards, compensation was recorded on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the awards with forfeitures recorded as they occurred.
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
The following table illustrates the effect on the Company's reported net income and net income per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to stock-based employee compensation in periods prior to July 1, 2005 (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts):
 
The underlying assumptions to these fair value calculations are discussed in Note 20Employee Share-Based Payments and Other Benefits.
The Company's comprehensive income is comprised of net income (loss), foreign currency cumulative translation adjustments, unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale mortgage-backed and investment securities and the effective portion of the unrealized gains (losses) on financial derivatives in cash flow hedge relationships, net of reclassification adjustments and related taxes.
Comprehensive Income
Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. The mandatory convertible notes, as discussed in Note 15Corporate Debt, will be reflected in diluted earnings (loss) per share calculations using the treasury stock method as defined by SFAS No. 128, . Under this method, the number of shares of common stock used in calculating diluted earnings per share (based on the settlement formula applied at the end of the reporting period) is deemed to be increased by the excess, if any, of the number of shares that would be issued upon settlement of the purchase contracts less the number of shares that could be purchased by the Company in the market at the average market price during the period.
Earnings Per Share
Earnings per Share
The Company enters into derivative transactions to hedge against the risk of market price or interest rate movements on the value of certain assets, liabilities and future cash flows. The Company must also recognize certain contracts and commitments as derivatives, whether freestanding or embedded, when the characteristics of those contracts and commitments meet the definition of a derivative promulgated by SFAS No. 133as amended.
Financial Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
,
 
Each derivative is recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as a freestanding asset or liability. Financial derivative instruments in hedging relationships that mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of assets or liabilities are considered fair value hedges under SFAS No. 133, as amended. Financial derivative instruments designated in hedging relationships that mitigate the exposure to the variability in expected future cash flows or other forecasted transactions are considered cash flow hedges. The Company formally documents at inception all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items and the risk management objective and strategy for each hedge transaction.
Fair value hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the financial derivative instrument and the change in fair value of the asset or liability being hedged on the consolidated balance sheet with the net difference, or hedge ineffectiveness, reported as fair value adjustments of financial derivatives in other expense excluding interest in the consolidated statement of income (loss). Cash payments or receipts and related accruals during the reporting period on derivatives included in fair value hedge relationships are recorded as an adjustment to interest income on the hedged asset or liability. If a financial derivative in a fair value hedging relationship is no longer effective, de-designated from its hedging relationship or terminated, the Company discontinues fair value hedge accounting for the derivative and the hedged item. Changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments no longer designated in an accounting hedge relationship are recorded in gain (loss) on loans and securities, net, in the consolidated statement of income (loss). The accumulated adjustment of the carrying amount of the hedged interest-earning asset or liability is recognized in earnings as an adjustment to interest income over the expected remaining life of the asset using the effective interest method.
Cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the financial derivative instrument as either a freestanding asset or a freestanding liability in the consolidated balance sheet, with the effective portion of the change in fair value of the financial derivative recorded in AOCI, net of tax in the consolidated balance sheet. Amounts are then included in operating interest expense as a yield adjustment in the same period the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the financial derivative is reported as fair value adjustments of financial derivatives in other expense excluding interest in the consolidated statement of income (loss). If it becomes probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will not occur, amounts included in AOCI related to the specific hedging instruments are reported as gain (loss) on loans and securities, net in the consolidated statement of income (loss). Derivative gains and losses that are not held as accounting hedges are recognized as gain (loss) on loans and securities, net in the consolidated statement of income (loss) as these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133, as amended. If a financial derivative ceases to be highly effective as a hedge, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively and the financial derivative instrument continues to be recorded at fair value with changes in fair value being reported in the gain (loss) on loans and securities, net line item in the consolidated statement of income (loss).
Revenue Recognition
Operating interest income is recognized as earned on interest-earning assets, customer margin receivable balances, stock borrow balances, cash required to be segregated under regulatory guidelines and fees on customer assets invested in money market funds. Operating interest income includes the effect of hedges on interest-earning assets.
Operating Interest Income
Operating interest expense is recognized as incurred on interest-bearing liabilities, customer credit balances, interest paid to banks and interest paid to other broker-dealers through a subsidiary's stock loan program. Operating interest expense includes the effect of hedges on interest-bearing liabilities.
Operating Interest Expense
The Company derives commission revenue from its retail and institutional customers. Commission revenue from securities transactions are recognized on a trade date basis. The Company receives commissions for providing certain institutional customers with market research and other information, which is a common industry practice. Direct costs from these arrangements are expensed as the commissions are received, in proportion to the cost of the total arrangement. As a result, payments for independent research are deferred or accrued to properly match expenses at the time commission revenue is earned. For these arrangements, payments for independent research of $2.9 million were deferred and costs of $6.1 million were accrued at December 31, 2007 and payments of $5.2 million were deferred and costs of $16.6 million were accrued at December 31, 2006.
Commission
 
 Fees and service charges consist of account maintenance fees, servicing fee income, payments for order flow, foreign exchange margin revenue, 12b-1 fees after rebates, fixed income product revenue and management fee revenue. Account maintenance fees are charges to the customer either quarterly or annually and are accrued as earned. Payments for order flow are accrued in the same period in which the related securities transactions are completed or related services are rendered.
Fees and Service Charges
Principal transactions consist primarily of revenue from market-making activities. Market-making activities are the matching of buyers and sellers of securities and include transactions where the Company will purchase securities for its balance sheet with the intention of resale to transact the customer's buy or sell order.
Principal Transactions
Gains or losses on sales of originated loans are recognized at the date of settlement and are based on the difference between the cash received and the carrying value of the related loans sold, less related transaction costs. In cases where the Company retains the servicing rights associated with loans sold, the gain (loss) recognized is the difference between cash received and the allocated basis of the loans sold, less the related transaction costs. In accordance with SFAS No. 140, the allocated basis of the loans, which is determined at the sale date, is the result of the allocation of basis between the loans sold and the associated servicing right, based on the relative fair values of the loans at the date of transfer.
Gain (Loss) on Loans and Securities, Net
Gain (loss) on loans and securities, net includes gains or losses resulting from sales of loans purchased for resale; the sale or impairment of available-for-sale mortgage-backed and investment securities; and gains or losses on financial derivatives that are not accounted for as hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133, as amended. Gains or losses resulting from the sale of loans are recognized at the date of settlement and are based on the difference between the cash received and the carrying value of the related loans, less related transaction costs. Nonrefundable fees and direct costs associated with the origination of mortgage loans are deferred and recognized when the related loans are sold. Gains or losses resulting from the sale of available-for-sale securities are recognized at the trade date, based on the difference between the anticipated proceeds and the amortized cost of the specific securities sold.
Other revenue primarily consists of stock plan administration services and other revenue ancillary to the Company's retail customer transactions. Stock plan administration services are recognized in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, including Statement of Position 97-2, .

SFAS No. 157Fair Value Measurements
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157. This statement establishes, among other things, a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure requirements as they relate to fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The provisions of SFAS No. 157 are to be applied prospectively, except for changes in fair value measurements that result from the initial application of SFAS No. 157 to existing derivative financial instruments measured under EITF Issue No. 02-3, existing hybrid instruments measured at fair value and block discounts, which are to be recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings in the year of adoption. The Company adopted this statement on January 1, 2008 for financial assets and financial liabilities and for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the effects of which were not material to the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The Company elected to defer adoption of this statement until January 1, 2009 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis, for which the Company does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in future periods.

SFAS No. 159The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, . This Statement provides an option under which a company may irrevocably elect fair value as the initial and subsequent measurement attribute for certain financial assets and financial liabilities. This fair value option will be available on a contract-by-contract basis with changes in fair value recognized in earnings as those changes occur. The Company adopted this statement on January 1, 2008. The Company elected the fair value option for Federal National Mortgage Association ("FNMA") and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("FHLMC") preferred stock. The impact of this adoption was an after-tax decrease to opening retained earnings as of January 1, 2008 of approximately $86.9 million.

FIN No. 48Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan interpretation of FASB Statement 109
In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, which became effective for the Company on January 1, 2007. The interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company's reassessment of its tax positions in accordance with FIN 48 did not have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. The impact of adoption was a $14.9 million reduction to beginning retained earnings. For additional information regarding the adoption of FIN 48, see Note 17Income Taxes.
Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 109Written Loan Commitments Recorded at Fair Value Through Earnings
In November 2007, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 109, ("SAB No. 109"), which becomes effective for the Company January 1, 2008. SAB No. 109 supersedes SAB No. 105, ("SAB No. 105")and states, consistent with the guidance in SFAS No. 156 and SFAS No. 159, that the expected net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of the loan should be included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings. SAB No. 109 retains the view expressed in SAB No. 105 that internally developed intangible assets (such as customer relationship intangible assets) should not be recorded as part of the fair value of a derivative loan commitment and broadens its application to all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings. The Company does not expect the adoption of SAB No. 109 to have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

NOTE 3DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
In 2008, the Company sold its Canadian brokerage business and exited its direct retail lending business. Results of operations from these businesses have been reclassified to discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.
In 2006, the Company completed the sale of E*TRADE Professional Trading, LLC. In 2005, the Company sold its Consumer Finance Corporation and exited the institutional proprietary trading business conducted by E*TRADE Professional Securities, LLC. All of these transactions, except Consumer Finance Corporation's servicing operations, were accounted for as discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005.
Below is a table summarizing the gains (losses), net of taxes, resulting from the sale and closure of discontinued operations (dollars in thousands):
 
 
 
 
 
Sale of Canadian Brokerage Business
During the second quarter of 2008, the Company announced its decision to sell its Canadian brokerage business. The Company completed the sale to Scotiabank in the third quarter of 2008. The Company does not have significant continuing involvement in the operations of the Canadian brokerage business, and its operations and cash flows have been eliminated from the ongoing operations of the Company. As a result, the Canadian brokerage business qualifies as a discontinued operation in accordance with SFAS No. 144. The Company's results of operations, net of income taxes, include the Canadian brokerage business as a discontinued operation on the Company's consolidated statement of income (loss) for all periods presented.
Below is a table summarizing the carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities of the Canadian brokerage business operations as of December 31, 2007 (dollars in thousands):
 
The following table summarizes the results of discontinued operations for the Canadian brokerage business (dollars in thousands):
 
Exit of Direct Retail Lending Business
During the second quarter of 2008, the Company announced the exit of its direct retail lending business, which was the Company's last remaining loan origination channel (the Company exited the wholesale mortgage lending business in 2007). As such, the entire direct retail lending business met the requirements under SFAS No. 144 to be recorded and reported as a discontinued operation. The operations and cash flows of the direct retail lending business have been eliminated from the ongoing operations of the Company and the Company did not have any significant continuing involvement in the direct retail lending business after its closure. Therefore, the Company's results of operations, net of income taxes, include the direct retail lending business as a discontinued operation on the Company's consolidated statement of income (loss) for all periods presented.
 
The following table summarizes the results of discontinued operations for direct retail lending business (dollars in thousands):
 
E*TRADE Professional Securities, LLC and E*TRADE Professional Trading, LLC
In May 2005, the Company closed E*TRADE Professional Securities, LLC, a unit that conducted proprietary trading operations. This closure resulted in a $2.4 million loss, net of tax, on disposal of discontinued operations, which included employee terminations, facility closure and impairment of goodwill and other intangibles. In December 2005, the Company decided to sell its professional agency business, E*TRADE Professional Trading, LLC. The Company executed and settled this transaction during the year ended December 31, 2006 and recorded approximately $2.6 million in gain, net of tax, on the sale.
The Company does not have significant continuing involvement in the operations of either its proprietary trading or its professional agency businesses and does not continue any significant revenue-producing or cost-generating activities of these businesses. Therefore, the Company's results of operations, net of income taxes, include these businesses as discontinued operations on the Company's consolidated statement of income for all periods presented.
The following table summarizes the results of discontinued operations for the proprietary and agency trading businesses (dollars in thousands):
 
Consumer Finance Corporation
In October 2005, the Company completed the sale of the servicing and origination businesses of Consumer Finance Corporation. The exit of the servicing business did not qualify as a discontinued operation; however, the origination business did qualify as a discontinued operation. The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of $46.1 million upon close, $35.5 million relating to the servicing business and $10.6 million ($6.4 million, net of tax), relating to the origination business. In September 2006, the Company finalized certain post sale contingencies with the purchaser which resulted in a $0.2 million gain, net of tax.
The Company has not had significant continuing involvement in the operations of the servicing business but continues to have significant cost-generating activities in the form of a servicing agreement. As such, the servicing business does not qualify as a discontinued operation. The Company does not have significant continuing involvement in the operations of the origination business and does not continue any significant revenue-producing or cost-generating activities of the origination business. Therefore, the results of operations, net of income taxes, of this origination business are presented as discontinued operations on the Company's consolidated statement of income for all periods presented.
The following table summarizes the results of discontinued operations for the origination business (dollars in thousands):
 
 
NOTE 4FACILITY RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER EXIT ACTIVITIES
Restructuring liabilities are included in accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. The following table summarizes the expense recognized by the Company as facility restructuring and other exit activities for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):
 
Exit of Non-Core Operations
Toward the end of the third quarter in 2007, the Company announced a plan to simplify and streamline the business by exiting and/or restructuring certain non-core operations, including the institutional equity business.
Institutional Equity Business
In institutional, the Company has taken steps to restructure the institutional equity business to focus on areas that complement order flow generated by retail customers. As a result of this exit, the Company incurred costs of $9.1 million for facilities consolidation and asset write-off costs, $7.0 million in severance costs and $1.0 million of other costs related to the exit for the year ended December 31, 2007. The total charge for this exit activity is expected to be between $20.0 million and $25.0 million, all of which will be recorded to the institutional segment.
2003 Restructuring Plan
In April 2003, the Company announced a restructuring plan ("2003 Restructuring Plan") exiting and consolidating leased facilities and exiting and disposing of certain unprofitable product offerings and initiatives. The original 2003 facility consolidation charge primarily related to charges to exit the E*TRADE Financial Center in New York and consolidation of excess facilities located in Menlo Park and Rancho Cordova, California. The E*TRADE Financial Center in New York, encompassing approximately 31,000 square feet, was used by customers to access the Company's products and services and served as an introduction point for new customers to the Company's products and services. The Company exited this center as it was not cost effective to engage in these activities within a facility of its size, and subsequently, opened an approximately 2,000 square foot new center in New York that was more cost effective. The leased California facilities were used for corporate and administrative functions and were exited as the Company consolidated employees into nearby offices and moved certain functions to its offices in Virginia.
The other charges related to the exit or write-off of unprofitable product lines and the early termination of certain contracts, such as the revenue sharing agreements associated with 43 E*TRADE Zones located in Target stores. These unprofitable product lines consisted of our Stock Basket product offered to customers and our online advisory service, eAdvisor, a joint initiative with Enlight Holdings, LLC. The Company terminated its revenue sharing agreements associated with its Zones in Target stores to focus on other methods of reaching its current and potential customers.
 
In 2004, the Company completed its exit of the Enlight Holdings, LLC product offering resulting in adjustments to estimated costs associated with its exit. In 2007 and 2006, the Company made additional adjustments to previously estimated costs associated with the consolidation of facilities in California. The rollforward of the 2003 Restructuring Plan reserve is presented below (dollars in thousands):
 
2001 Restructuring Plan
In August 2001, the Company announced a restructuring plan ("2001 Restructuring Plan") aimed at streamlining operations primarily by consolidating facilities in the United States and Europe. The restructuring was designed to consolidate certain facilities, bring together key decision-makers and streamline operations. The original 2001 restructuring charge related to facility consolidation represents the undiscounted value of ongoing lease commitments, offset by anticipated third-party sublease revenues, the write-off of capitalized software, hardware and other fixed assets and other costs. Subsequent to 2001, the Company recognized additional facility consolidation adjustments, as a result of updated estimates of sublease income and sublease start dates, driven by economic circumstances. The rollforward of the 2001 Restructuring Plan reserve is presented below (dollars in thousands):
 
Exit of Consumer Finance Business
On October 31, 2005, the Company's retail segment completed the sale of the servicing and origination businesses of Consumer Finance Corporation to GE Capital resulting in a pre-tax gain of $46.1 million. The pre-tax gain from the servicing business of $35.5 million is reflected in other exit activity as the servicing business was not deemed to be a discontinued operation. (See Note 3Discontinued Operations for additional information).
 
Other Exit Activities
In the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company decided to consolidate and relocate certain of its facilities. The Company incurred $7.5 million related to facilities consolidation and relocation primarily related to the operating leases in Arlington, VA and Tampa, FL. Additionally, the Company incurred $3.1 million in connection with reorganizing the management structure of the Balance Sheet Management business, including changing the nature and focus of its operations.
In 2006, the Company decided to relocate certain functions out of the state of California as well as outsource certain clearing operations and costs related to the relocation of certain accounting functions. The Company incurred charges of $0.9 million and $29.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, related to costs for exiting those facilities. The total charge for this exit activity was $30.1 million, all of which has been recorded in the retail segment. The Company expects to incur charges in future periods as it periodically evaluates the estimates made in connection with this activity; however, the Company does not expect those costs to be significant.
For the year ended December 31, 2005, other exit activities were primarily related to the liquidation of the E*TRADE Money Market Funds, partially offset by the revision of previous estimates of various exit activities. The liquidation costs primarily related to customer notification, severance and reimbursement of losses taken on sales of securities.
Facility Consolidation Obligations
The components of the facility consolidation restructuring liabilities for the 2003 and 2001 Restructuring Plans and other exit activities at December 31, 2007 and their timing are as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
 
NOTE 5OPERATING INTEREST INCOME AND OPERATING INTEREST EXPENSE

NOTE 6AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MORTGAGE-BACKED AND INVESTMENT SECURITIES
The amortized cost basis and estimated fair values of available-for-sale mortgage-backed and investment securities are shown in the following tables (dollars in thousands):
 
 
Contractual Maturities
The contractual maturities of available-for-sale debt securities, including mortgage-backed and debt securities, at December 31, 2007 are shown below (dollars in thousands):
 
The Company pledged $10.1 billion and $11.1 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, of available-for-sale securities as collateral for federal reserves, repurchase agreements and short-term borrowings.
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment of Investments
The following tables show the fair values and unrealized losses on investments, aggregated by investment category, and the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position (dollars in thousands):
 
The Company does not believe that any individual unrealized loss as of December 31, 2007 represents an other-than-temporary impairment. The majority of the unrealized losses on mortgage-backed securities are attributable to changes in interest rates and a re-pricing of risk in the market. Substantially all mortgage-backed securities backed by U.S. Government sponsored and Federal agencies are "AAA" rated. The Company has the
 
intent and ability to hold the securities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2007 until the market value recovers or the securities mature. Municipal bonds, corporate bonds and other debt securities are evaluated by reviewing the credit-worthiness of the issuer and general market conditions.
Within the securities portfolio, the asset-backed securities portfolio had the greatest exposure to the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets. Based on its evaluation, the Company recorded other-than-temporary impairment charges for its asset-backed securities of $168.7 million in the second half of 2007. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we observed a significant decline in the fair value of our entire asset-backed securities portfolio. The declines in fair value followed a series of rating agency downgrades of securities in this sector, which we believe led to a substantial decline in secondary market liquidity for these securities.
In connection with the Citadel Investment in the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company sold the entire asset-backed securities portfolio for a loss of $2.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007. The Company recorded $2.8 million and $40.3 million of impairment charges in its securities portfolios for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
The detailed components of the gain (loss) on loans and securities, net and gain on sales of investments, net line items on the consolidated statement of income (loss) are shown below.
Gain (Loss) on Loans and Securities, Net
Gain (loss) on loans and securities, net, excluding amounts in discontinued operations are as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
Gain on Sales of Investments, Net
Gain on sales of investments, net are as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
 
In 2007, the gain on sales of publicly traded equity securities was primarily a result of the sales of the Company's holdings in E*TRADE Australia and E*TRADE Korea. In 2006, the gains on sales of publicly traded equity securities primarily included the sales of the Company's holdings in International Securities Exchange and Softbank Investment Corporation of $64.2 million and $7.5 million respectively. In 2005 the gain primarily included the sale of the Company's holdings in Softbank Investment Corporation.
 
NOTE 7LOANS, NET
Loans, net are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
In addition to these loans, the Company had commitments to originate, buy and sell loans at December 31, 2007 (see Note 23Commitments, Contingencies and Other Regulatory Matters).
The following table shows the percentage of adjustable and fixed-rate loans in the Company's portfolio (dollars in thousands):
 
 
The weighted-average remaining maturity of mortgage loans secured by one- to four-family residences was 337 and 340 months at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Additionally, all mortgage loans outstanding at December 31, 2007 and 2006 in the held-for-investment portfolio were serviced by other companies.
 
The Company actively sells loans including loans that it originally purchased from third parties. A summary of these activities is presented below (dollars in thousands):
 
Activity in the allowance for loan losses is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
During 2007, the allowance for loan losses increased by $440.5 million. This increase was driven primarily by an increase of $427.5 million in the allowance allocated to the home equity loan portfolio, which deteriorated significantly during the second half of 2007.
Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased by $158.9 million compared to the same period in 2006. The overall increase was primarily due to higher net charge-offs on home equity loans, which was driven mainly by the deterioration of the home equity loan portfolio, described above.
We classify loans as nonperforming when full and timely collection of interest or principal becomes uncertain or when they are 90 days past due. The following table provides the breakout of nonperforming loans by type (dollars in thousands):
 
 
If the Company's nonperforming loans at December 31, 2007 had been performing in accordance with their terms, the Company would have recorded additional interest income of approximately $19.9 million, $1.9 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. During 2007, we recognized $18.4 million in interest on loans that were in nonperforming status at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, there were no commitments to lend additional funds to any of these borrowers.
During the first quarter of 2007, the Company entered into a credit default swap ("CDS") on $4.0 billion of its first-lien residential real estate loan portfolio through a synthetic securitization structure. A CDS provides, for a fee, an assumption by a third party of a portion of the credit risk related to the underlying loans. The CDS the Company entered into provides protection for losses in excess of 10 basis points, but not to exceed approximately 75 basis points. In addition, the Company's regulatory risk-weighted assets were reduced as a result of this transaction because it transferred a portion of the Company's credit risk to an unaffiliated third party.
 
NOTE 8ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
The Company enters into derivative transactions to protect against the risk of market price or interest rate movements on the value of certain assets, liabilities and future cash flows. The Company is also required to recognize certain contracts and commitments as derivatives when the characteristics of those contracts and commitments meet the definition of a derivative as promulgated by SFAS No. 133, as amended.
Fair Value Hedges
Overview of Fair Value Hedges
The Company uses a combination of interest rate swaps, forward-starting swaps and purchased options on swaps to offset its exposure to changes in value of certain fixed-rate assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives and the related hedged items are recognized currently in earnings. To the extent that the hedge is ineffective, the changes in the fair values will not offset and the difference, or hedge ineffectiveness, is reflected in other expense excluding interest in the consolidated statement of income (loss).
The following table summarizes information related to financial derivatives in fair value hedge relationships (dollars in thousands):
 
 
 
De-designated Fair Value Hedges
During the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, certain fair value hedges were de-designated; therefore, hedge accounting was discontinued during those periods. The net gain or loss on the underlying transactions being hedged is amortized to operating interest expense or operating interest income over the original forecasted period at the time of de-designation. Changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments after de-designation of fair value hedge accounting were recorded in the gain (loss) on loans and securities, net line item in the consolidated statement of income (loss).
 
Cash Flow Hedges
Overview of Cash Flow Hedges
The Company uses a combination of interest rate swaps, forward-starting swaps and purchased options on caps and floors to hedge the variability of future cash flows associated with existing variable-rate liabilities and assets and forecasted issuances of liabilities. These cash flow hedge relationships are treated as effective hedges as long as the future issuances of liabilities remain probable and the hedges continue to meet the requirements of SFAS No. 133, as amended. The Company also enters into interest rate swaps to hedge changes in the future variability of cash flows of certain investment securities resulting from changes in a benchmark interest rate. Additionally, the Company enters into forward purchase and sale agreements, which are considered cash flow hedges, when the terms of the commitments exactly match the terms of the securities purchased or sold.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that hedge cash flows associated with repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and home equity lines of credit are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income as unrealized gains or losses. The amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income are then included in operating interest expense or operating interest income as a yield adjustment during the same periods in which the related interest on the funding affects earnings. During the upcoming twelve months, the Company expects to include a pre-tax amount of approximately $53.1 million of net unrealized gains that are currently reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income in operating interest expense as a yield adjustment in the same periods in which the related items affect earnings.
The following table summarizes information related to our financial derivatives in cash flow hedge relationships, hedging variable-rate assets and liabilities and the forecasted issuances of liabilities (dollars in thousands):
 
 
Under SFAS No. 133, as amended, the Company is required to record the fair value of gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet. In addition, during the normal course of business, the Company terminates certain interest rate swaps and options.
 
The following tables show: 1) amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges; 2) the notional amounts and fair values of derivatives terminated for the periods presented; and 3) the amortization of terminated interest rate swaps included in operating interest expense and operating interest income (dollars in thousands):
 
The gains (losses) accumulated in other comprehensive loss on the derivative instruments terminated shown in the preceding table will be included in operating interest expense and operating interest income over the periods the variable rate liabilities and hedged forecasted issuance of liabilities will affect earnings, ranging from 16 days to more than 14 years.
The following table shows the balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss attributable to open cash flow hedges and discontinued cash flow hedges (dollars in thousands):
 
Hedge Ineffectiveness
In accordance with SFAS No. 133, as amended, the Company recognizes hedge ineffectiveness on both fair value and cash flow hedge relationships. The amount of ineffectiveness recorded in earnings for cash flow hedges is equal to the excess of the cumulative change in the fair value of the actual derivative over the cumulative change in the fair value of a hypothetical derivative which is created to match the exact terms of the underlying instruments being hedged. These amounts are reflected in the other expense excluding interest line item in the consolidated statement of income (loss). Cash flow and fair value ineffectiveness are re-measured on a quarterly basis. The following table summarizes income (expense) recognized by the Company as fair value and cash flow hedge ineffectiveness (dollars in thousands):
 
Mortgage Banking Activities
The Company enters into commitments to originate loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined prior to funding. These commitments are referred to as Interest Rate Lock Commitments ("IRLCs"). IRLCs on loans that the Company intends to sell are considered to be derivatives and are, therefore, recorded at fair value
 
with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. For purposes of determining fair value, the Company estimates the fair value of an IRLC based on the estimated fair value of the underlying mortgage loan and the probability that the mortgage loan will fund within the terms of the IRLC. The fair value excludes the market value associated with the anticipated sale of servicing rights related to each loan commitment. The fair value of these IRLCs was a $0.06 million and a $0.02 million liability at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
The Company also designates fair value relationships of closed loans held-for-sale against a combination of mortgage forwards and short treasury positions. Short treasury relationships are economic hedges, rather than fair value or cash flow hedges. Short treasury positions are marked-to-market, but do not receive hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No. 133, as amended. The mark-to-market of the mortgage forwards is included in the net change of the IRLCs and the related hedging instruments. The fair value of the mark-to-market on closed loans was a $1.2 thousand and $1.7 million asset at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
IRLCs, as well as closed loans held-for-sale, expose the Company to interest rate risk. The Company manages this risk by selling mortgages or mortgage-backed securities on a forward basis referred to as forward sale agreements. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are included as gain (loss) on loans and securities, net in the consolidated statement of income (loss). The net change in IRLCs, closed loans, mortgage forwards and the short treasury positions generated a net loss of $2.4 million in 2007, a net gain of $1.6 million in 2006 and a net loss of $0.4 million in 2005.
Credit Risk
Credit risk is managed by limiting activity to approved counterparties and setting aggregate exposure limits for each approved counterparty. The credit risk, or maximum exposure, which results from interest rate swaps and purchased interest rate options is represented by the fair value of contracts that have unrealized gains at the reporting date. Conversely, we have $197.5 million of derivative contracts with unrealized losses at December 31, 2007. The Company pledged approximately $87.4 million of its mortgage-backed securities as collateral of derivative contracts.
While the Company does not expect that any counterparty will fail to perform, the following table shows the maximum exposure associated with each counterparty to interest rate swaps and purchased interest rate options at December 31, 2007 (dollars in thousands):
 
 
NOTE 9PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NET
Property and equipment, net consists of the following (dollars in thousands):
 
 
Depreciation and amortization expense related to property and equipment was $85.4 million, $73.8 million and $75.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Software includes capitalized internally developed software costs. These costs were $64.1 million, $37.3 million and $34.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Completed projects are carried at cost and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, generally four years. Amortization expense for the capitalized amounts was $28.8 million, $26.1 million and $31.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Also included in software at December 31, 2007 is $39.9 million of internally developed software in the process of development for which amortization has not begun.
NOTE 10GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES, NET
The following table discloses the changes in the carrying value of goodwill for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):
 
 
 
 
The following table discloses the changes in the carrying value of goodwill that occurred in the retail and institutional segments (dollars in thousands):
 
 
 
For the year ended December 31, 2007, the changes in the carrying value of goodwill are the result of the Company recognizing an impairment of goodwill related the Company's Balance Sheet Management business. The impairment of goodwill for this business occurred during the fourth quarter of 2007, and was due primarily to the crisis in the residential real-estate and credit markets. The method used for determining the fair value of Balance Sheet Management was a combination of prices for comparable businesses and the expected present value of future cash flows of the business. In addition, there was a write-off of goodwill related to certain exit activities (see Note 3Facility Restructuring and Other Exit Activities for further discussion). These decreases were slightly offset by purchase accounting adjustments related to earn outs and escrow releases on prior acquisitions that were made by the Company.
For the year ended December 31, 2006, the changes in the carrying value of goodwill are the result of the Company's completion of the purchase of RAA (see Note 2Business Combinations for further discussion). An additional $12.0 million of goodwill, primarily due to purchase accounting adjustments related to the 2005 acquisitions of BrownCo and Harris was also recorded during 2006.
direct,
Other intangible assets with finite lives, which are primarily amortized on an accelerated basis, consist of the following (dollars in thousands):
 
 
As part of the Company's purchase of RAA in 2006, the Company assigned $9.5 million to intangible assets with finite lives, of which $9.2 million was assigned to the customer list intangible asset class.
 
Assuming no future impairments of these assets or additional acquisitions, annual amortization expense will be as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
Amortization of other intangibles was $40.5 million, $46.2 million and $43.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

NOTE 12ASSET SECURITIZATION
Collateralized Debt Obligations ("CDO")
As of December 31, 2007, there were five outstanding CDOs issued by the Company (CDOs I, III, IV, V and VI; CDO II was called on November 1, 2006) with a combined carrying and fair value of approximately $0.1 million. CDOs I and III are static CDOs involving qualifying special purpose entities. CDOs IV-VI are managed CDOs involving special purpose entities in which the Company is not the primary beneficiary and did not have a variable interest that would absorb a majority of the entity's expected losses. The Company purchased only 20% of the equity interests (i.e., preference shares) in CDOs IV-VI and as Collateral Manager has the right to receive collateral management fees under each deal.
During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company reached an agreement to sell all of its residual interests in the CDOs as well as the collateral management agreements under which they serve as Collateral Manager to a third party. The closing of this sale is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2008.

The maturities of borrowings at December 31, 2007 and total borrowings at December 31, 2007 and 2006 are shown below (dollars in thousands):
 
Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase
The Company sells repurchase agreements which are collateralized by fixed- and variable-rate mortgage-backed securities or investment grade securities. Repurchase agreements are treated as financings for financial statement purposes and obligations to repurchase securities sold are reflected as borrowings in the consolidated balance sheet. The brokers retain possession of the securities collateralizing the repurchase agreements until maturity. At December 31, 2007, there were no counterparties with whom the Company's amount at risk exceeded 10% of its shareholders' equity.
Below is a summary of repurchase agreements and collateral associated with the repurchase agreements at December 31, 2007 (dollars in thousands):
 
Other Borrowings
The Company had $1.7 billion floating-rate and $5.3 billion fixed-rate FHLB advances at December 31, 2007. The floating-rate advances adjust quarterly based on the LIBOR. The Company is required to be a member of the FHLB System and maintain a FHLB investment at least equal to the greater of: one percent of the unpaid principal balance of its residential mortgage loans; one percent of 30 percent of its total assets; or one-twentieth of its outstanding FHLB advances. In addition, the Company must maintain qualified collateral equal to 110 to 115 percent of its advances, depending on the collateral type. These advances are secured with specific mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company pledged $16.8 billion and $12.9 billion, respectively, of the one- to four-family and home equity loans as collateral.
FHLB Advances
 
ETBH raises capital through the formation of trusts, which sell trust preferred stock in the capital markets. The capital securities must be redeemed in whole at the due date, which is generally 30 years after issuance. Each trust issued Floating Rate Cumulative Preferred Securities, at par with a liquidation amount of $1,000 per capital security. The trusts use the proceeds from the sale of issuances to purchase Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures issued by ETBH, which guarantees the trust obligations and contributes proceeds from the sale of its subordinated debentures to E*TRADE Bank in the form of a capital contribution.
Other
During 2007, ETBH formed three trusts, ETBH Capital Trust XXVIII, ETBH Capital Trust XXIX and ETBH Capital Trust XXX. These trusts issued a total of 60,000 shares of Floating Rate Cumulative Preferred Securities for a total of $60.0 million. Net proceeds from these issuances were invested in Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures that mature in 2037 and have variable rates of 1.90%, 1.95%, or 2.10% above the three-month LIBOR, payable quarterly.
During 2006, ETBH formed five trusts, ETBH Capital Trust XXIII through ETBH Capital Trust XXVII. These trusts issued a total of 95,000 shares of Floating Rate Cumulative Preferred Securities for a total of $95 million. Net proceeds from these issuances were invested in Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures that mature in 2036 or 2037 and have variable rates of 1.95% or 2.10% above the three-month LIBOR, payable quarterly.
In April 2007, ETBH called ETBH Capital Trust IV which had sold $10.0 million of trust preferred stock in the capital markets in 2002 and generated a loss of $0.3 million. In June 2007, ETBH called Telebank Capital Trust I which had sold $9.0 million of trust preferred stock in the capital markets in 1997, and generated a loss of $0.9 million. In December 2006, ETBH called ETBH Capital Trust III which had sold $15.0 million of trust preferred stock in the capital markets in 2001, and generated a loss of $0.5 million.
The face values of outstanding trusts at December 31, 2007 are shown below (dollars in thousands):
 
The Company also has multiple term loans from financial institutions. These loans are collateralized by equipment. Borrowings under these term loans bear interest at 1% above LIBOR, 0.68% above LIBOR or 9.30%. The Company had approximately $40 million of principal outstanding under these loans at December 31, 2007.
Other borrowings also includes $12.0 million of overnight and other short-term borrowings in connection with the Federal Reserve Bank's term investment option and treasury, tax and loan programs. The Company pledged $12.0 million of securities to secure these borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank.

Senior Notes
All of the Company's senior notes are unsecured and will rank equal in right of payment with all of the Company's existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness and will rank senior in right of payment to all our existing and future subordinated indebtedness.
8% Senior Notes Due June 2011
In 2005 and 2004, the Company issued an aggregate principal amount of $100 million and $400 million in senior notes due June 2011 ("8% Notes"), respectively. Interest is payable semi-annually and notes are non-callable for four years and may then be called by the Company at a premium, which declines over time. Debt issuance costs of $9.6 million are being amortized over the term of the senior notes.

% Notes.
Each purchase contract obligates the holder to purchase, and the Company to sell, at a purchase price of $25.00 in cash, a variable number of shares of the Company's common stock. The stock conversion ratio varies depending on the average closing price of the Company's common stock over a 20-day trading period ending on the third trading day immediately preceding November 18, 2008 ("Reference Price"). If the Reference Price is equal to or greater than $21.816 per share, the settlement rate will be 1.1459 shares of common stock. If the Reference Price is less than $21.816 per share but greater than $18.00 per share, the settlement rate is equal to $25.00 divided by the Reference Price. If the Reference Price is less than or equal to $18.00 per share, the settlement rate will be 1.3889 shares of common stock. The Company is obligated under the purchase contract to sell shares of its common stock under the agreement in November 2008. In November 2008, the aggregate principal amount of the subordinated notes will be remarketed, which may result in a change in the interest rate and maturity date of the subordinated notes. If the Company is unable to remarket the 6
 1
/
8
% Notes, the face value of the 6
 1
/
8
% Notes will be repaid through the Units conversion, which will, in effect, convert these notes to equity.
Before the purchase in November 2008, the Units will be reflected in diluted earnings per share calculations using the treasury stock method as defined by SFAS No. 128, . Under this method, the number of shares of common stock used in calculating diluted earnings per share (based on the settlement formula applied at the end of the reporting period) is deemed to be increased by the excess, if any, of the number of shares that would be issued upon settlement of the purchase contracts less the number of shares that could be purchased by the Company in the market at the average market price during the period using the proceeds to be received upon settlement. Therefore, dilution will occur for periods when the average market price of the Company's common stock for the reporting period is above $21.816.

Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility
In September 2005, the Company entered into a $250 million, three-year senior secured revolving credit facility. As a result of the Citadel Investment in November 2007, the facility was terminated and all unamortized debt issuance costs were expensed.
Corporate Debt Covenants
Certain of the Company's corporate debt described above have terms which include customary financial covenants. As of December 31, 2007, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants.
Early Extinguishment of Debt
In 2006, the Company called the entire remaining $185.2 million principal amount of its 6% Notes for redemption. The Company recorded a $0.7 million loss on early extinguishment of debt relating to the write-off of the unamortized debt offering costs. The Company did not have any early extinguishments of debt in 2005.
Other Corporate Debt
The Company also has multiple term loans from financial institutions. These loans are collateralized by equipment and are included within other borrowings on the consolidated balance sheet. See Note 14Securities Sold Under Agreement to Repurchase and Other Borrowings.
Future Maturities of Corporate Debt
Scheduled principal payments of corporate debt as of December 31, 2007 are as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
NOTE 16ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED AND OTHER LIABILITIES
Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities consist of the following (dollars in thousands):
 
 
NOTE 17INCOME TAXES
Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted FIN 48. As a result of the implementation, the Company recognized a $14.9 million increase to its liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which was accounted for as a reduction to the beginning balance of retained earnings. The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of January 1, 2007 was $150.4 million. Of this total amount at January 1, 2007, $51.6 million (net of the federal benefit on state issues) represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
At December 31, 2007, the unrecognized tax benefit was $74.9 million. Of this total amount, $52.5 million (net of federal benefits on state issues) represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective income tax in future periods.
The following table summarizes the tax years that are either currently under examination or remain open under the statute of limitations and subject to examination by the major tax jurisdictions in which the Company operates:
 
 
It is likely that certain examinations may be settled or the statute of limitations could expire with regards to other tax filings, in the next twelve months. In addition, proposed legislation could favorably impact certain of the Company's unrecognized tax benefits. Such events would generally reduce the Company's unrecognized tax benefits, either because the tax positions are sustained or because the Company agrees to the disallowance, by as much as $30.4 million, of which $28.8 million could affect the Company's total tax provision or the effective tax rate.
The Company's continuing practice is to recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to income tax matters in income tax expense. After the adoption of FIN 48, the Company has total gross reserves for interest and penalties of $15.1 million and $8.6 million as of January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2007, respectively. The tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes a reduction in the accrual for interest of $6.5 million, principally related to the reduction for reserves due to the filing of tax accounting method change requests with the IRS.
 
The components of income tax expense (benefit) from continuing operations are as follows (dollars in thousands)
 
The components of income (loss) before income taxes, minority interest, discontinued operations and cumulative effect of accounting change are as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
Deferred income taxes are recorded when revenues and expenses are recognized in different periods for financial statement and tax return purposes. Prior year balances for the deferred tax asset and liabilities have been re-presented to ensure consistency between periods. The adjustments relate to the presentation of the federal benefit of the state deferred assets and liabilities. The temporary differences and tax carry-forwards that created deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
 
The Company maintains a valuation allowance of $91.8 million and $38.3 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, against certain of its deferred tax assets, as it is more likely than not that they will not be fully realized. The Company's valuation allowance increased by $53.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The principal components of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been established include the following state and foreign country net operating loss carry-forwards and excess tax bases in certain illiquid investments:
 
 
 
During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company generated a federal net operating loss of approximately $2.4 billion. Of the $2.4 billion net operating loss, $970 million will be carried back to prior years, generating expected federal tax refunds of $320 million. The remaining $1.4 billion net operating loss will be carried forward and generally can be used to offset future taxable income. The Company has an additional federal net operating loss carryforward of $54 million relating to pre-acquisition losses from acquired subsidiaries which are subject to annual limitations in their use of $4.9 million per year in accordance with Internal Revenue Code Section 382. No valuation allowance has been provided for the $1.5 billion in carry-forwards of net operating losses. The carry-forwards expire through 2027. The extent to which the loss carry-forwards can be used to offset future taxable income may be limited, depending upon the extent of ownership changes within any three-year period. Accordingly, the extent to which the loss carry-forwards can be used to offset future taxable income may be limited.
The Company has provided for $8 million of deferred income taxes on certain earnings and profits of selected foreign subsidiaries that are expected to be distributed in 2008. The Company has not provided $15.7 million of deferred income taxes on $44.8 of undistributed earnings and profits in its foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2007 since the Company intends to permanently reinvest such earnings.
The effective tax rates differed from the Federal statutory rates as follows:
 
 
NOTE 18SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
Preferred Stock
The Company has 1.0 million shares authorized in preferred stock. None were issued and outstanding at December 31, 2007 and 2006.
Issuance of Common Stock
In 2007, the Company issued $339.0 million or 38.0 million shares of common stock in conjunction with the Citadel Investment. The 38.0 million shares of common stock were issued in increments: 14.8 million upon initial closing in November 2007 and 23.2 million upon Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act approval in December 2007. The Company expects to issue the remaining 46.7 million shares of common stock in the first quarter of 2008 as we have received all necessary regulatory approvals.
Mandatory Convertible Notes
In November 2005, the Company issued 18.0 million Units that are convertible into up to 25.0 million shares of common stock, on or before the purchase in November 2008. The conversion ratio depends on the market price of our common stock 20 trading days prior to conversion. Units are generally convertible only on or near the purchase in November 2008. (See Note 15Corporate Debt for additional details on the transaction.)
Share Repurchases
On April 18, 2007, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized an additional $250.0 million common stock repurchase program (the "April 2007 Plan"). The April 2007 Plan is open-ended and allows for the repurchase of common stock on the open market, in private transactions or a combination of both.
During 2007, the Company repurchased common stock under the April 2007 Plan and a $200.0 million repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors ("Board") in December 2004 (the "December 2004 Plan"). During the second quarter of 2007, the Company completed the December 2004 Plan. The table below shows the timing and impact of the repurchases during the year ended December 31, 2007 (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts):
 
 
NOTE 19EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE
The following table is a reconciliation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share (dollars and shares in thousands, except per share amounts):
 
For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company excluded from the calculations of diluted earnings per share 21.0 million shares of stock options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock units that would have been anti-dilutive, including 9.6 million shares that were anti-dilutive because of the Company's net loss for the period. Additionally, there were 46.7 million shares for the year ended December 31, 2007 that had not been issued in connection with the Citadel Investment of which 3.9 million shares were anti-dilutive because of the Company's net loss for the period. The Company excluded from the calculations of diluted earnings per share 5.3 million and 7.2 million shares of stock options that would have been anti-dilutive for the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Excluded from the calculations of diluted earnings per share are 2.2 million and 7.8 million shares of common stock for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, issuable under convertible subordinated notes as the effect of applying the treasury stock method on an if-converted basis would be anti-dilutive. There were not any shares issuable under convertible subordinated notes excluded from the year ended 2007, as all convertible subordinated notes outstanding had been redeemed in 2006. In addition, in 2005, 25.0 million shares of common stock potentially issuable related to the conversion of mandatory convertible notes were excluded from the calculations because it would be anti-dilutive.
 
NOTE 20EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS AND OTHER BENEFITS
Adoption of SFAS No. 123(R)
As discussed in Note 1Organization, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, effective July 1, 2005, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R). The adoption resulted in the recognition of or changes to the recognition method of expense for the Company's employee stock option plans, restricted stock awards and employee stock purchase plan. The combined impact of the adoption in 2005 was as follows: $13.7 million in compensation expense for stock options; $0.4 million compensation expense for the stock purchase plan; and a pre-tax credit of $2.8 million in cumulative effect of accounting change for 2005. Results for prior periods have not been restated. Total compensation expense for share-based compensation also includes $4.2 million for restricted stock awards, which were previously expensed by the Company under APB Opinion No. 25, prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R).
Employee Stock Option Plans
In 2005, the Company adopted and the shareholders approved the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan ("2005 Plan") to replace the 1996 Stock Incentive Plan ("1996 Plan") which provides for the grant of nonqualified or incentive stock options to officers, directors, key employees and consultants for the purchase of newly issued shares of the Company's common stock at a price determined by the Board at the date the option is granted. Options are generally exercisable ratably over a four-year period from the date the option is granted and expire within ten years from the date of grant. Beginning in 2006, most options that were granted have a contractual term of seven years. Certain options provide for accelerated vesting upon a change in control. Exercise prices are generally equal to the fair market value of the shares on the grant date. A total of 85.4 million shares had been authorized under the 1996 Plan. Under the 2005 Plan, the remaining unissued authorized shares of the 1996 Plan, up to 42.0 million shares, were authorized for issuance. Additionally, any shares that had been awarded but remained unissued under the 1996 Plan that were subsequently canceled, would be authorized for issuance under the 2005 Plan, up to 39.0 million shares. As of December 31, 2007, 27.1 million shares were available for grant under the 2005 Plan.
The Company recognized $25.4 million, $22.1 million and $13.7 million in compensation expense for stock options for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company recognized a tax benefit of $8.2 million, $7.8 million and $5.0 million related to the stock options for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model based on the assumptions noted in the table below. Expected volatility is based on a combination of historical volatility of the Company's stock and implied volatility of publicly traded options on the Company's stock. The expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The expected term is estimated using employees' actual historical behavior and projected future behavior based on expected exercise patterns. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bond where the remaining term equals the expected term. Dividend yield is zero as the Company has not, nor does it currently plan to, issue dividends to its shareholders.
 
The weighted-average fair values of options granted were $7.48, $8.60 and $4.57 for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Intrinsic value of options exercised were $50.6 million, $89.1 million and $67.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
 
A summary of options activity under the 2005 Plan is presented below:
 
As of December 31, 2007, there was $40.1 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.2 years.
Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Units
The Company issues restricted stock awards to its officers and senior executives and restricted stock units to international officers. These awards are issued at the fair market value on the date of grant and generally vest ratably over four years. However, certain awards vest on the fifth anniversary of the date of grant. The fair value is calculated as the market price upon issuance.
The Company recorded $9.4 million, $10.5 million and $4.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, in compensation expense related to restricted stock awards and restricted stock units. The Company recognized a tax benefit of $3.2 million, $4.0 million and $1.6 million related to restricted stock awards and restricted stock units for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Prior to its adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company recorded compensation expense for restricted stock awards on a straight-line basis over their vesting period. If an employee forfeited the award prior to vesting, the Company reversed out the previously expensed amounts in the period of forfeiture. As required upon adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company must base its accruals of compensation expense on the estimated number of awards for which the requisite service period is expected to be rendered. Actual forfeitures are no longer recorded in the period of forfeiture. In 2005, the Company recorded a pre-tax credit of $2.8 million in cumulative effect of accounting change, that represents the amount by which compensation expense would have been reduced in periods prior to adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) for restricted stock awards outstanding on July 1, 2005 that are anticipated to be forfeited.
A summary of non-vested restricted stock award and restricted stock unit activity is presented below:
 
As of December 31, 2007, there was $15.3 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested awards. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years. The total fair value of restricted shares and restricted stock units vested was $11.0 million, $7.5 million and $4.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The shareholders of the Company previously approved the 2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("2002 Purchase Plan"), and reserved 5,000,000 shares of common stock for sale to employees at a price no less than 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock at the beginning of the one-year offering period or the end of each of the six-month purchase periods. Under SFAS No. 123(R), the 2002 Purchase Plan was considered compensatory. Effective August 1, 2005, the Company changed the terms of its purchase plan to reduce the discount to 5% and discontinued the look-back provision. As a result, the purchase plan was not compensatory beginning August 1, 2005.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded $0.4 million in compensation expense for its employee stock purchase plan for the period in which the 2002 Plan was considered compensatory until the terms were changed August 1, 2005. At December 31, 2007, 757,123 shares were available for purchase under the 2002 Purchase Plan.
401(k) Plan
The Company has a 401(k) salary deferral program for eligible employees who have met certain service requirements. The Company matches certain employee contributions; additional contributions to this plan are at the discretion of the Company. Total contribution expense under this plan was $5.7 million, $5.7 million and $5.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
NOTE 21REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS
Registered Broker-Dealers
The Company's U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the Uniform Net Capital Rule (the "Rule") under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 administered by the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA"), which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital. The minimum net capital requirements can be met under either the Aggregate Indebtedness method or the Alternative method. Under the Aggregate Indebtedness method, a broker-dealer is required to maintain minimum net capital of the greater of 6
 2
/
3
% of its aggregate indebtedness, as defined, or a minimum dollar amount. Under the Alternative method, a broker-dealer is required to maintain net capital equal to the greater of $250,000 or 2% of aggregate debit balances arising from customer transactions. The method used depends on the individual U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary. The Company's international broker-dealer subsidiaries, located in Canada, Europe and Asia, are subject to capital requirements determined by their respective regulators.
As of December 31, 2007, all of the Company's significant broker-dealer subsidiaries met minimum net capital requirements. Total required net capital was $0.2 billion at December 31, 2007. In addition, the Company's broker-dealer subsidiaries had excess net capital of $0.7 billion at December 31, 2007.
The table below summarizes the minimum excess capital requirements for the Company's broker-dealer subsidiaries (dollars in thousands):
 
 
 
 
Banking
During the first quarter of 2007, ETC became a wholly-owned operating subsidiary of E*TRADE Bank. ETC continues to be an SEC-registered broker-dealer and is included in the minimum net capital requirements under the Rule. E*TRADE Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by Federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on E*TRADE Bank's financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action,
 
E*TRADE Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of E*TRADE Bank's assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. E*TRADE Bank's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.
Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require E*TRADE Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier I Capital to Risk-weighted assets and Tier I Capital to Adjusted total assets. As shown in the table below, at December 31, 2007, the OTS categorized E*TRADE Bank as "well capitalized" under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. E*TRADE Bank is also required by OTS regulations to maintain tangible capital of at least 1.50% of tangible assets. E*TRADE Bank satisfied this requirement at both December 31, 2007 and 2006. However, events beyond management's control, such as a continued deterioration in residential real estate and credit markets, could adversely affect future earnings and E*TRADE Bank's ability to meet its future capital requirements.
E*TRADE Bank's required actual capital amounts and ratios are presented in the table below (dollars in thousands):
 
 
NOTE 22LEASE ARRANGEMENTS
The Company completed the sale of its Canadian brokerage business in 2008; therefore, future lease payments related to Canadian facilities have been excluded from future commitments. The Company has non-cancelable operating leases for facilities through 2024. Future minimum lease payments and sublease proceeds under these leases are as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
Certain leases contain provisions for renewal options and rent escalations based on increases in certain costs incurred by the lessor. Rent expense including amounts reported in discontinued operations, net of sublease income, was $30.2 million, $28.6 million and $22.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
 
NOTE 23COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER REGULATORY MATTERS
Legal Matters
Litigation Matters
In June 2002, the Company acquired from MarketXT Holdings, Inc. (formerly known as "Tradescape Corporation") the following entities: Tradescape Securities, LLC; Tradescape Technologies, LLC; and Momentum Securities, LLC. Disputes subsequently arose between the parties regarding the responsibility for liabilities that first became known to the Company after the sale. On April 8, 2004, MarketXT filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company, certain of its officers and directors, and other third parties, including SBI and Softbank Corporation, alleging that defendants were preventing plaintiffs from obtaining certain contingent payments allegedly due, and as a result, claiming damages of $1.5 billion. On April 9, 2004, the Company filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against certain directors and officers of MarketXT seeking declaratory relief and unspecified monetary damages for defendants' fraud in connection with the 2002 sale, including, but not limited to, having presented the Company with fraudulent financial statements regarding the condition of Momentum Securities, LLC during the due diligence process. Subsequently, MarketXT was placed into bankruptcy, and the Company filed an adversary proceeding against MarketXT and others in January 2005, seeking declaratory relief, compensatory and punitive damages, in those Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York entitled, "In re MarketXT Holdings Corp., Debtor." In that same court, the Company filed a separate adversary proceeding against Omar Amanat in those Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings entitled, "In re Amanat, Omar Shariff." In October 2005, MarketXT answered the Company's adversary proceeding and asserted its counterclaims, subsequently amending its claims in 2006 to add a $326.0 million claim for "promissory estoppel" in which MarketXT alleged, for the first time, that the Company breached a prior promise to purchase the acquired entities in 1999-2000. In April 2006, Omar Amanat answered the Company's separate adversary proceeding against him and asserted his counterclaims. In separate motions before the Bankruptcy Court, the Company has moved to dismiss certain counterclaims brought by MarketXT including those described above, as well as certain counterclaims brought by Mr. Amanat. In a ruling dated September 29, 2006, the Bankruptcy Court in the MarketXT case granted the Company's motion to dismiss four of the six bases upon which MarketXT asserts its fraud claims against the Company; its conversion claim; and its demand for punitive damages. In the same ruling, the Bankruptcy Court denied in its entirety MarketXT's competing motion to dismiss the Company's claims against it. On October 26, 2006, the Bankruptcy Court subsequently dismissed MarketXT's "promissory estoppel" claim. By order dated December 18, 2007, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York approved a settlement agreement between the parties under the terms of which the Company agreed, without admitting liability, to pay $3,995,000 to the Trustee for the bankruptcy estate of MarketXT in exchange for a general release from MarketXT as well as its promise to defend and indemnify the Company in certain other actions up to a maximum of $3,995,000. By order dated January 8, 2008, the same Court subsequently approved a separate settlement agreement between the Company and the Trustee for the bankruptcy estate of Omar Amanat under the terms of which the Company paid to said Trustee the sum of $50,000 in exchange for a general release. Accordingly, these cases have been resolved, and the Company will no longer report them in its subsequent filings.
On October 27, 2000, a complaint was filed in the Superior Court for the State of California, County of Santa Clara, entitled, "Ajaxo, Inc., a Delaware corporation, Plaintiff, versus E*TRADE GROUP, INC., a Delaware corporation; and Everypath, Inc., a California corporation; and Does 1 through 50, inclusively, Defendants." Through this complaint, Ajaxo sought damages and certain non-monetary relief for the Company's alleged breach of a non-disclosure agreement with Ajaxo pertaining to certain wireless technology offered to the Company by Ajaxo as well as damages and other relief against both the Company and defendant Everypath, Inc., for their alleged misappropriation of Ajaxo's trade secrets. Following a jury trial, a judgment was entered in 2003 in favor of Ajaxo against the Company for $1.3 million dollars for breach of the Ajaxo non-disclosure agreement. Although the jury also found in favor of Ajaxo on its misappropriation of trade secrets claim against the Company and defendant Everypath, the trial court subsequently denied Ajaxo's requests for additional damages and relief on these claims. Thereafter, all parties appealed, and on December 21, 2005, the California Court of Appeal affirmed the above-described award against the Company for breach of the nondisclosure agreement but remanded the case to the trial court for the limited purpose of determining what, if any, additional damages Ajaxo may be entitled to as a result of the jury's previous finding in favor of Ajaxo on its misappropriation of trade secrets claim against the Company and defendant Everypath. Following the foregoing ruling by the Court of Appeal, defendant Everypath ceased operations and made an assignment for the benefit of its creditors in January, 2006. As a result, defendant
 
Everypath is no longer defending the case. Although the Company paid Ajaxo the full amount due on the judgment against it above, the case, consistent with the rulings issued by the Court of Appeal, has now been remanded back to the trial court, and the re-trial of this case is now set to commence on April 7, 2008, solely on the issue of what, if any, additional damages Ajaxo may be entitled to receive on its misappropriation of trade secrets claim. In specific, Ajaxo continues to seek unstated monetary damages and injunctive relief, lost profits in the amount of $500,000 per month since November, 1999, and punitive damages. The Company denies that Ajaxo is entitled to any further damages or relief of any kind and will vigorously defend itself against Ajaxo's renewed damage claims.
On October 2, 2007, a class action complaint alleging violations of the federal securities laws was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company and its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer entitled, "Larry Freudenberg, Individually and on Behalf of All Others Similarly Situated, Plaintiff, versus E*TRADE Financial Corporation, Mitchell H. Caplan and Robert J. Simmons, Defendants." Plaintiff contends, among other things, that between December 14, 2006, and September 25, 2007 (the "class period") defendants issued materially false and misleading statements and failed to disclose that the Company was experiencing a rise in delinquency rates in its mortgage and home equity portfolios; failed to timely record an impairment on its mortgage and home equity portfolios; materially overvalued its securities portfolio, which includes assets backed by mortgages; and based on the foregoing, lacked a reasonable basis for the positive statements it made about the Company's earnings and prospects. Plaintiff seeks to recover damages in an amount to be proven at trial, including interest and attorneys' fees and costs. Four additional class action complaints alleging similar violations of the federal securities laws and alleging either the same or somewhat longer class periods were filed in the same court between October 12, 2007 and November 21, 2007 by named plaintiffs William Boston, Robert D. Thulman, Wendy M. Davidson, and Joshua Ferenc, respectively. On January 23, 2008, the trial court heard motions from various plaintiffs seeking to be appointed lead plaintiff in these actions but has yet to issue its decision. Once the court rules on the lead plaintiff motions, the cases are to be consolidated. A consolidated amended complaint is expected to be filed within 60 days of the court's ruling. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against these claims.
Based upon the same facts and circumstances alleged in the Freudenberg class action complaint above, a verified shareholder derivative complaint was filed in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on October 4, 2007, against the Company's Chief Executive Officer, President/Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and individual members of its board of directors entitled, "Catherine Rubery, Derivatively on behalf of E*TRADE Financial Corporation, Plaintiff, versus Mitchell H. Caplan, R. Jarrett Lilien, Robert J. Simmons, George A. Hayter, Daryl Brewster, Ronald D. Fisher, Michael K. Parks, C. Catherine Raffaeli, Lewis E. Randall, Donna L. Weaver, and Stephen H. Willard, Defendants, -and- E*TRADE Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation, Nominal Defendant." Plaintiff alleges, among other things, causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets, unjust enrichment, and violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. The above shareholder derivative complaint has been consolidated with another shareholder derivative complaint brought in the same court and against the same named defendants entitled, "Marilyn Clark, Derivatively On Behalf of E*TRADE Financial Corporation, Plaintiff, versus Mitchell H. Caplan, et al., Defendants" (collectively, with the Rubery case, the "federal derivative actions"). Three similar derivative actions, based on the same facts and circumstances as the federal derivative actions but alleging exclusively state causes of action, have been filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County. These three cases have been ordered consolidated in that court under the caption "In re: E*Trade Financial Corporation Derivative Litigation, Lead Index No. 07-603736" (the "state derivative actions"). The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against the claims raised in the federal derivative actions and state derivative actions.
In addition to the matters described above, the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the normal course of business which could have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In each pending matter, the Company contests liability or the amount of claimed damages. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages, or where investigation or discovery have yet to be completed, the Company cannot predict with certainty the loss or range of loss related to such matters, how such matters will be resolved, when they will ultimately be resolved, or what any eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief might be. Subject to the foregoing, the Company believes that the outcome of any such pending matter will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of the Company, although the outcome could be material to the Company's or a business segment's operating results in the future, depending, among other things, upon the Company's or business segment's income for such period.
 
An unfavorable outcome in any matter that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, even if the ultimate outcomes are resolved in the Company's favor, the defense of such litigation could entail considerable cost or the diversion of the efforts of management, either of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operation.
Regulatory Matters
The securities and banking industries are subject to extensive regulation under Federal, state and applicable international laws. As a result, the Company is required to comply with many complex laws and rules, and its ability to comply is dependent in part on the establishment and maintenance of a qualified compliance system. From time to time, the Company has been threatened with or named as a defendant in, lawsuits, arbitrations and administrative claims involving securities, banking and other matters. The Company is also subject to periodic regulatory audits and inspections. Compliance and trading problems that are reported to regulators, such as the SEC, FINRA or OTS by dissatisfied customers or others are investigated by such regulators, and may, if pursued, result in formal claims being filed against the Company by customers or disciplinary action being taken against the Company or its employees by regulators. Any such claims or disciplinary actions that are decided against the Company could have a material impact on the financial results of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
The SEC, in conjunction with various regional securities exchanges, is conducting an inquiry into the trading activities of certain specialist firms, including the Company's subsidiary E*TRADE Capital Markets, LLC ("ETCM"), on various regional exchanges in order to determine whether such firms executed proprietary orders in a given security prior to a customer order in the same security (a practice commonly known as "trading ahead") during the period 1999 - 2005. ETCM was a specialist on the Chicago Stock Exchange during the period under review. The SEC has indicated that it will seek disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and penalties from any firm found to have engaged in trading ahead activity to the detriment of its customers during that time period. It is possible that such sanctions, if imposed against ETCM, could have a material impact on the financial results of the Company during the period in which such sanctions are imposed. The Company and ETCM are cooperating with the investigation.
On October 17, 2007, the SEC initiated an informal inquiry into matters related to the Company's loan and securities portfolios. That inquiry is continuing. The Company is cooperating fully with the SEC in this matter.
Insurance
The Company maintains insurance coverage that management believes is reasonable and prudent. The principal insurance coverage it maintains covers commercial general liability; property damage; hardware/software damage; cyber liability; directors and officers; employment practices liability; certain criminal acts against the Company; and errors and omissions. The Company believes that such insurance coverage is adequate for the purpose of its business. The Company's ability to maintain this level of insurance coverage in the future, however, is subject to the availability of affordable insurance in the marketplace.
Reserves
For all legal matters, reserves are established in accordance with SFAS No. 5. Once established, reserves are adjusted based on available information when an event occurs requiring an adjustment.
 
Commitments
In the normal course of business, the Company makes various commitments to extend credit and incur contingent liabilities that are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheet. Significant changes in the economy or interest rates influence the impact that these commitments and contingencies have on the Company in the future.
Loans
The Company had the following mortgage loan commitments (dollars in thousands):
 
 
Securities, Unused Lines of Credit and Certificates of Deposit
At December 31, 2007, the Company had commitments to purchase $0.5 billion and sell $2.0 billion in securities. In addition, the Company had approximately $4.0 billion of certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in less than one year and $6.8 billion of unfunded commitments to extend credit.
Guarantees
The Company provides guarantees to investors purchasing mortgage loans, which are considered standard representations and warranties within the mortgage industry. The primary guarantees are as follows:
 
 
 
Management has determined that quantifying the potential liability exposure is not meaningful due to the nature of the standard representations and warranties, which rarely result in loan repurchases. The current carrying amount of the liability recorded at December 31, 2007 is $0.2 million, which we consider adequate based upon analysis of historical trends and current economic conditions for these guarantees.
ETBH raises capital through the formation of trusts, which sell trust preferred stock in the capital markets. The capital securities are mandatorily redeemable in whole at the due date, which is generally 30 years after issuance. Each trust issues Floating Rate Cumulative Preferred Securities at par, with a liquidation amount of $1,000 per capital security. The proceeds from the sale of issuances are invested in ETBH's Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures.
During the 30-year period prior to the redemption of the Floating Rate Cumulative Preferred Securities, ETBH guarantees the accrued and unpaid distributions on these securities, as well as the redemption price of the securities and certain costs that may be incurred in liquidating, terminating or dissolving the trusts (all of which would otherwise be payable by the trusts). At December 31, 2007, management estimated that the maximum potential liability under this arrangement is equal to approximately $441.5 million or the total face value of these securities plus dividends, which may be unpaid at the termination of the trust arrangement.
 
NOTE 24SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION
The segments presented below reflect the manner in which the Company's chief operating decision maker assesses the Company's performance. The Company has two segments: retail and institutional.
Retail includes:
 
 
Institutional includes:
 
 
 
The retail segment originates loans through lending activities. Retail segment loan originations that are not sold directly to outside parties are sold at arm's length prices to the institutional segment which manages the Company's balance sheet. The Company evaluates the performance of its segments based on segment contribution (net revenue less expense excluding operating interest). All corporate overhead, administrative and technology charges are allocated to segments either in proportion to their respective direct costs or based upon specific operating criteria. Activities associated with discontinued operations have been excluded from the segment results.
 
Financial information for the Company's reportable segments is presented in the following tables (dollars in thousands):
 
 
 
 
 
 
Segment Assets
Total assets for each segment are shown in the following table (dollars in thousands):
 
 
Geographic Information
The Company operates in both United States and international markets. The Company's international operations are conducted through offices in Europe, Asia and Canada. Results of operations from the Canadian brokerage business and direct retail lending business have been reclassified to discontinued operations. Therefore, net revenue from these businesses has been excluded from total net revenue. The following information provides a representation of each region's contribution to the consolidated amounts (dollars in thousands):
 
No single customer accounted for greater than 10% of gross revenues for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.
NOTE 25FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
SFAS No. 107, , requires the disclosure of the estimated fair value of financial instruments. The following disclosure of the estimated fair value of financial instruments as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 is made by the Company using available market information and valuation methods which management believes are appropriate for each instrument. Quoted market prices, if available, are utilized as estimates of the fair value of financial instruments. If quoted market prices are not available, management estimates fair value based on the quoted market price of a financial instrument with similar characteristics or based on other valuation techniques. The estimation methods for individual classifications of financial instruments are described more fully below. Different market assumptions and estimation methodologies could significantly affect estimated fair value amounts.
Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The fair value of financial instruments whose estimated fair values were their carrying values is summarized as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
The fair value of financial instruments whose estimated fair values were different from their carrying values is summarized below (dollars in thousands):
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the normal course of business, the Company makes various commitments to extend credit and incur contingent liabilities that are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheet. Significant changes in the economy or interest rates influence the impact that these commitments and contingencies have on the Company in the future. Information related to such commitments and contingent liabilities is detailed in Note 23Commitments, Contingencies and Other Regulatory Matters.
 
NOTE 26CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION (PARENT COMPANY ONLY)
The following presents the Parent's condensed statement of income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss), balance sheet and cash flows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Parent Company Guarantees
Guarantees are contingent commitments issued by the Company for the purpose of guaranteeing the financial obligations of a subsidiary to a financial institution. The collective obligation of the corporation does not change by the existence of corporate guarantees. Rather, the guarantees shift ultimate payment responsibility of an existing financial obligation from a subsidiary to the parent company.
In support of the Company's brokerage business, the Company has provided guarantees on the settlement of its subsidiaries' financial obligations with several financial institutions related to its securities lending activities.
 
Terms and conditions of the guarantees, although typically undefined in the guarantees themselves, are governed by the conditions of the underlying obligation that the guarantee covers. Thus, the Company's obligation to pay under these guarantees coincides exactly with the terms and conditions of those underlying obligations. At December 31, 2007, no claims had been filed with the Company for payment under any guarantees. These guarantees are not collateralized.
In addition to guarantees issued on behalf of subsidiaries participating in securities lending programs, the Company also issues guarantees for the settlement of foreign exchange transactions. If a subsidiary fails to deliver currency on the settlement date of a foreign exchange arrangement, the beneficiary financial institution may seek payment from the Company. Terms are undefined, and are governed by the terms of the underlying financial obligation. At December 31, 2007, no claims had been made on the Company under these guarantees and thus, no obligations had been recorded. These guarantees are not collateralized.
NOTE 27SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
In January 2008, the Company issued an additional $150.0 million of springing lien notes in accordance with the terms of the agreement with Citadel. This is the final issuance under this agreement and brings the total springing lien notes to $1.9 billion. In connection with this issuance, the Company received $150.0 million in cash. Additionally, the Company received all required regulatory approvals in order to issue the remaining 46.7 million shares of common stock.
The Company entered into a definitive asset purchase agreement to sell substantially all of the assets of RAA to PHH Investments, Ltd for approximately $25 million. This transaction is subject to normal closing conditions and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2008.
NOTE 28QUARTERLY DATA (UNAUDITED)
The information presented below reflects all adjustments, which, in the opinion of management, are of a normal and recurring nature necessary to present fairly the results of operations for the periods presented (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts):
 
The operating environment during 2007, particularly during the second half of the year, was extremely challenging as the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets adversely impacted our financial performance. The decrease in net income for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2007 was due principally to the $2.2 billion loss on the sale of our asset-backed securities portfolio and $402.3 million in provision for loan losses.
