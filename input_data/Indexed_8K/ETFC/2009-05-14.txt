E*TRADE Financial Corporation (the "Company") is filing this Current Report on Form 8-K to update the historical financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 (the "2008 Form 10-K") for its revised segment financial reporting. As of January 1, 2009, the Company revised its segment financial reporting under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, ("SFAS No. 131") to reflect the manner in which the chief operating decision maker had begun assessing the Company's performance and making resource allocation decisions.
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information
Under Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") guidance, the revised segment financial reporting required by SFAS No. 131 should be provided for previously issued financial statements included in the Company's currently filed 2008 Form 10-K, if those financial statements are incorporated by reference in filings with the SEC made under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, even though those financial statements related to periods prior to the revised segment financial reporting.
On May 5, 2009, the Company filed its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 ("March 2009 10-Q") with the SEC. In the March 2009 10-Q, the Company presented its results to reflect the new segments.
The revised segment financial reporting did not change the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial condition for any periods presented.
The revised Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 is incorporated by reference in this Item 8.01 and is attached to this current report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1. The revised sections of our 2008 Form 10-K included in this report have not been otherwise updated for events occurring after the date of our Consolidated Financial Statements, which were originally presented in the 2008 Form 10-K filed on February 26, 2009. All other information in the 2008 Form 10-K remains unchanged and is not being updated in this filing.

GLOSSARY OF TERMS
In analyzing and discussing our business, we utilize certain metrics, ratios and other terms that are defined in the Glossary of Terms, which is located at the end of Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Overview
Strategy
Our strategy is to profitably grow our trading and investing customer franchise and mitigate the risks associated with our balance sheet. We plan to grow our customer franchise by offering online brokerage and related products and services, including investor-focused banking and asset gathering products and services. We believe we can accomplish this growth by appealing to investors, especially customers of traditional brokerages, who are attracted to our low-cost, easy to use and innovative capabilities.
Our plan to mitigate the risks associated with our balance sheet contains three core goals: reduce credit risk in our loan portfolio, reduce our level of corporate debt and reduce operating expenses. We believe that the successful completion of this plan will significantly improve our financial strength.
We are also focused on simplifying and streamlining the business by exiting and/or restructuring certain non-core operations. We believe these changes will better align our business with the investor.
Key Factors Affecting Financial Performance
Our financial performance is affected by a number of factors outside of our control, including:

Significant Events in 2008
Strengthening Our Core Asset  the Trading and Investing Customer
One of our key strategic objectives for 2008 was to strengthen our customer base and ensure the credit issues in our balance sheet did not negatively impact our customer base. We believe we have made significant progress in this area throughout 2008. Highlights of our progress during the year ended December 31, 2008 are as follows:
 
 
 
 
Execution of Our Capital Plan
 
 
 
Exit of the Direct Retail Lending Business
We announced the exit of our direct retail lending business, which was our last remaining loan origination channel (we exited our wholesale mortgage lending channel in 2007). Therefore, the results of operations of the entire direct retail lending business are reported as discontinued operations on our consolidated statement of income (loss) for all periods presented. In future periods, we plan to partner with a third party company to provide access to real estate loans for our customers.
Retirement of Corporate Debt
In November 2008, we retired the entire balance of our $450 million 6.125% subordinated notes due 2019. The notes were part of the mandatory convertible debt securities issued in 2005 and were retired in connection
 
 
with the issuance of 25 million shares of our common stock at $18 per share. Additionally, we exchanged $120.8 million in principal of our senior notes through debt for equity exchanges.
Completion of Citadel Investment
In January 2008, the Company issued an additional $150.0 million of springing lien notes in accordance with the terms of the agreement with Citadel. This was the final note issuance under the agreement with Citadel and brought the total springing lien notes outstanding to $1.9 billion in principal
(1)
. In connection with this issuance, the Company received $150.0 million in cash. Additionally, the Company issued to Citadel the remaining 46.7 million shares of common stock that had been required to be issued under the agreement.

Significant Events in 2007
Citadel Investment of $2.5 Billion Including Sale of Asset-Backed Securities Portfolio
The operating environment during 2007, particularly during the second half of the year, was extremely challenging as our exposure to the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets adversely impacted our financial performance and led to a disruption in our customer base. As a result, we believe it was necessary to obtain a significant infusion of cash, which would in turn stabilize our balance sheet and our customer base.
On November 29, 2007, we entered into an agreement to receive a $2.5 billion cash infusion from Citadel. In consideration for the cash infusion, Citadel received three primary items: substantially all of our asset-backed securities portfolio, 84.7 million shares of common stock

Summary Financial Results
Income Statement Highlights for the Year Ended December 31, 2008 (dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
 
 
The continued deterioration in the residential real estate and credit markets, as well as the nearly unprecedented turmoil in the global financial markets, had a significant impact on our financial performance during 2008. The losses in our balance sheet management segment caused by this deterioration more than offset the strong underlying performance of our trading and investing segment, resulting in a net loss from continuing operations of $809.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Our customer base showed positive growth trends during the year, including the addition of approximately 246,000 net new accounts and net inflows of customer assets of approximately $5.4 billion. We believe these are indications that our trading and investing segment has not only stabilized, but has returned to modest growth.
 
Balance Sheet Highlights (dollars in billions)
 
The decrease in total assets was attributable primarily to a decrease of $5.7 billion in loans, net and a decrease of $4.4 billion in margin receivables. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in cash and equivalents and cash and investments required to be segregated under federal or other regulations of $2.9 billion. For the foreseeable future, we plan to allow our home equity loans to pay down resulting in an overall decline in the balance of the loan portfolio. During this period, we plan to maintain excess regulatory capital at E*TRADE Bank as we focus on mitigating the credit risk inherent in our loan portfolios. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we increased our excess risk-based capital at E*TRADE Bank by 64% to $714.7 million compared to prior year. In connection with this strategy and the Citadel Investment, we have updated our secondary market purchase policies to prohibit the acquisition of asset-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations ("CDO") and certain other instruments with a high level of credit risk through January 1, 2010.
EARNINGS OVERVIEW
2008 Compared to 2007
We had a net loss from continuing operations of $809.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The loss for the year ended December 31, 2008 was due principally to an increase in our provision for loan losses of $943.6 million to $1.6 billion. In addition, we incurred losses of $153.8 million, net of hedges, on our preferred stock in Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae") and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac") during the period ended December 31, 2008. The losses in our balance sheet management segment, which included both of these items, more than offset our trading and investing segment income, which was $608.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
In the second quarter of 2008, we made the decision to sell our Canadian brokerage business and we decided to close our direct retail lending business. As a result, the financial results for both the Canadian brokerage business and the direct retail lending business have been reported in discontinued operations for all periods presented. Additionally, we re-defined "Total net revenue" by removing "Provision for loan losses" and separately stating it as its own line item and reclassified hedge ineffectiveness recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 133, as amended ("SFAS No. 133"), from "Other operating expense" to the "Gain (loss) on loans and securities, net" line item.
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
We report corporate interest income and corporate interest expense separately from operating interest income and operating interest expense. We believe reporting these two items separately provides a clearer picture of the financial performance of our operations than would a presentation that combined these two items. Our operating interest income and operating interest expense is generated from the operations of the Company. Our corporate debt, which is the primary source of our corporate interest expense, has been issued primarily in connection with the Citadel Investment and past acquisitions, such as Harris and BrownCo.
direct
Similarly, we report gain (loss) on sales of investments, net separately from gain (loss) on loans and securities, net. We believe reporting these two items separately provides a clearer picture of the financial performance of our operations than would a presentation that combined these two items. Gain (loss) on loans and
 
securities, net is the result of activities in our operations, namely our balance sheet management segment, including impairment on our available-for sale mortgage-backed and investment securities portfolio. Gain (loss) on sales of investments, net relates to historical equity investments of the Company at the corporate level and are not related to the ongoing business of our operating subsidiaries.
The following sections describe in detail the changes in key operating factors and other changes and events that have affected our consolidated net revenue, operating expense, other income (expense) and income tax expense (benefit).
Revenue
The components of net revenue and the resulting variances are as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
 
Total net revenue increased to $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. This increase was primarily due to the $2.2 billion loss on the sale of our asset-backed securities portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2007.
Net Operating Interest Income
Net operating interest income decreased 20% to $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to December 31, 2007. Net operating interest income is earned primarily through holding credit balances, which include margin, real estate and consumer loans, and by holding customer cash and deposits, which are a low cost source of funding. The decrease in net operating interest income was due primarily to the planned decline in enterprise interest-earning assets during 2008.
 
The following table presents enterprise average balance sheet data and enterprise income and expense data for our operations, as well as the related net interest spread, yields and rates and has been prepared on the basis required by the SEC's Industry Guide 3, "" (dollars in thousands):
Statistical Disclosure by Bank Holding Companies
 
Reconciliation from enterprise net interest income to net operating interest income (dollars in thousands):
 
 
 
Average enterprise interest-earning assets decreased 16% to $46.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007, primarily the result of a decrease in our available-for-sale portfolio, margin receivables and loans, net, offset by an increase in cash and equivalents. Average available-for-sale mortgage-backed and investment securities decreased 41% to $9.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. This decrease was primarily due to the sale of certain mortgage-backed securities in the first quarter of 2008 and the sale of our asset-backed securities portfolio towards the end of the fourth quarter of 2007. Average margin receivables decreased 17% to $5.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. We believe this decrease was due to customers deleveraging and reducing their risk exposure given the substantial volatility in the financial markets. Average loans, net decreased 10% to $27.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007 as a result of our focus on growing the one- to four-family loan portfolio in the first and second quarters of 2007. Beginning in the second half of 2007, we altered our strategy and halted the focus on growing the balance sheet. For the foreseeable future, we plan to allow our home equity loans to pay down resulting in an overall decline in the balance of the loan portfolio.
Average enterprise interest-bearing liabilities decreased 17% to $44.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The decrease in average enterprise interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to a decrease in repurchase agreements and other borrowings, FHLB advances and customer payables. Average repurchase agreements and other borrowings decreased 37% to $7.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. Average FHLB advances decreased 34% to $4.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. Repurchase agreements and other borrowings are the primary wholesale funding sources for our loans, net and available-for-sale securities portfolios. The decreases in these balances were the result of paying down these liabilities as we decreased the size of our balance sheet during 2008. Average customer payables decreased 25% to $4.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007, which was related primarily to the sale of our Canadian brokerage business during the third quarter of 2008.
Enterprise net interest spread decreased by 12 basis points to 2.52% for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. This decrease was driven in part by an atypical spread among two key benchmark interest rates: federal funds and the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"). The majority of our interest-earning assets and liabilities are linked, either directly or indirectly, to these benchmark interest rates. We believe this spread will return to more normalized levels in future periods. In addition, we plan to reduce the rates paid on our Complete Savings Account to be more consistent with current market rates. We believe the combined impact of these two items will result in a modest increase to our net interest spread in future periods.
 
Operating interest income and operating interest expense reflect income and expense on hedges that qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133, as amended. The following table shows the income (expense) on hedges that are included in operating interest income and expense (dollars in thousands):
 
 
Commission
Commission revenue decreased 22% to $515.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the same period in 2007. This decrease was due almost entirely to a decrease of $142.6 million, or 99%, in our balance sheet management commission revenue as a result of the exit of our institutional brokerage operations. Commission revenue from our trading and investing segment, which is the sole source of commission revenue in future periods, remained stable for the year ended December 31, 2008 declining by only 1% compared to 2007. The primary factors that affect our commission revenue are DARTs and average commission per trade, which is impacted by both trade types and the mix between our domestic and international businesses. Each business has a different pricing structure, unique to its customer base and local market practices, and as a result, a change in the relative number of executed trades in these businesses impacts average commission per trade. Each business also has different trade types (e.g. equities, options, fixed income, exchange-traded funds, contract for difference and mutual funds) that can have different commission rates. As a result, changes in the mix of trade types within either of these businesses may impact average commission per trade.
DARTs increased 6% to 188,116 for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. Our U.S. DART volume increased 5% and our international DARTs grew by 9% for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007, driven entirely by organic growth. In addition, option-related DARTs as a percentage of our total U.S. DARTs represented 15% and 16% of U.S. trading volume for the periods ending December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
Average commission per trade decreased 7% to $10.88 for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The decrease was primarily a function of the product and customer mix. The overall poor performance of the equity markets for the year ended December 31, 2008 disproportionately impacted higher commission products, such as corporate services transactions and mutual funds. Main Street Investors, who generally have a higher commission per trade, traded less during the period compared to Active Traders and Mass Affluent customers, who generally have a lower commission per trade. Customer appreciation, win-back and other promotional campaigns also contributed to the decrease in average commission per trade.
Fees and Service Charges
Fees and service charges decreased 13% to $200.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. This decrease was primarily due to a lower order flow revenue, advisory management fees and CDO
 
management fees. The decrease in advisory management fees was primarily due to our sale of RAA. The decrease in CDO management fees was due to the sale of our collateral management agreements during the first quarter of 2008.
Principal Transactions
Principal transactions decreased 17% to $84.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The decrease in principal transactions resulted from lower trading volumes. Our principal transactions revenue is influenced by overall trading volumes, the number of stocks for which we act as a market maker, the trading volumes of those specific stocks and the performance of our proprietary trading activities.
Loss on Loans and Securities, Net
Loss on loans and securities, net was $195.5 million and $2.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, as shown in the following table (dollars in thousands):
 
 
The loss on loans and securities, net during the year ended December 31, 2008 was due principally to losses on our preferred stock in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which experienced record price declines and volatility during the third quarter of 2008. Based upon our concerns about continuing market instability, all of our positions were liquidated during the third quarter of 2008, resulting in a pre-tax loss of $153.8 million, net of hedges, that was recognized in loss on trading securities, net.
We recognized $95.0 million of impairment on certain securities in our CMO portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2008, which was a result of the deterioration in the expected credit performance of the underlying loans in the securities. Further declines in the performance of our CMO portfolio could result in additional impairments in future periods. In addition, we recognized $7.7 million of impairment related to the funds held in the Reserve Funds' Primary Fund. For additional information about the Primary Fund, refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources on page 48.
The loss on loans and securities, net during the year ended December 31, 2007 was due primarily to the $2.2 billion loss on the sale of our asset-backed securities portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Other Revenue
Other revenue increased 12% to $52.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The increase in other revenue was due to income from the cash surrender value of Bank-Owned Life Insurance ("BOLI"), which was entered into during the third quarter of 2007.
 
Provision for Loan Losses
Provision for loan losses increased $943.6 million to $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The increase in the provision for loan losses was related primarily to deterioration in the performance of our home equity loan portfolio, which began in the second half of 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we also experienced deterioration in the performance of our one- to four-family loan portfolio. We believe the deterioration in both of these portfolios was caused by several factors, including: home price depreciation in virtually all key markets; growing inventories of unsold homes; rising foreclosure rates; sustained contraction in the availability of credit; and a severe downturn in the economy. While we do believe the provision for loan losses will be at historically high levels in future periods, we do not expect those levels to be in excess of those incurred in 2008.
Operating Expense
The components of operating expense and the year-over-year variances are as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
 
Operating expense decreased 18% to $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The decrease in expense excluding interest was driven primarily by decreases in compensation and benefits, clearing and servicing, impairment of goodwill and other expense. These decreases were offset slightly by an increase in advertising and market development expense.
Compensation and Benefits
Compensation and benefits decreased 12% to $383.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The decrease resulted primarily from lower salary expense due to a reduction in our employee base and decreased variable compensation during the year ended December 31, 2008 when compared to 2007.
Clearing and Servicing
Clearing and servicing expense decreased 32% to $185.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. This decrease is related primarily to the exit of our institutional brokerage operations, which resulted in lower clearing expenses.
 
Advertising and Market Development
Advertising and market development expense increased 26% to $175.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. This planned increase was aimed at restoring customer confidence as well as expanded efforts to promote our products and services to investors.
Impairment of Goodwill
Impairment of goodwill was $101.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. This impairment represents the entire amount of goodwill associated with our balance sheet management business, which had a significant decline in fair value during the fourth quarter of 2007. There was no such impairment for the year ended December 31, 2008.
Facility Restructuring and Other Exit Activities
Facility restructuring and other exit activities expense was $29.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. These costs were due primarily to the exit of certain facilities during the year ended December 31, 2008. Slightly offsetting the restructuring expense is the gain on the sale of RAA of $2.8 million which was recorded in the second quarter of 2008.
Other
Other expense decreased 37% to $122.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007, which was primarily due to items that are not expected to recur in future periods. During the first quarter of 2008, we sold our corporate aircraft related assets, which resulted in a $23.7 million gain on sale. During the second quarter of 2008, we realized approximately $13 million of insurance recoveries of fraud losses incurred in prior periods as well as other recoveries to legal reserves. The decrease is also due to $35.1 million in expense recorded for certain legal and regulatory matters for the year ended December 31, 2007.
Other Income (Expense)
Other income (expense) increased to an expense of $330.6 million for 2008 compared to an expense of $123.1 million for 2007, as shown in the following table (dollars in thousands):
 
 
Total other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2008 consisted primarily of corporate interest expense resulting from our corporate debt, which included the springing lien notes, senior notes and mandatory convertible notes. Corporate interest expense increased 110% to $362.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to the interest expense on the springing lien notes that were issued in the fourth quarter of 2007 and first quarter of 2008. During 2008, our wholly owned subsidiary, E*TRADE Mauritius, sold its equity shares in Investsmart for proceeds of approximately $145 million, which
 
resulted in a gain on sale of $22.3 million recorded in equity in income of investments and venture funds. During 2007, we sold our investments in E*TRADE Australia and E*TRADE Korea, which resulted in $37.0 million in gain on sales of investments, net.
The gain on early extinguishment of debt is primarily due to a gain of $21.5 million recognized on the exchange of our senior notes for shares of our common stock for the year ended December 31, 2008. The gain of $21.5 million is offset by a loss of $10.8 million related to the early extinguishment of FHLB advances and a loss of $0.6 million on the prepayment of debt related to the sale of the corporate aircraft.
Income Tax Benefit
The income tax benefit from continuing operations was $469.5 million and $732.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our effective tax rate for 2008 was (36.7)% compared to (33.7)% for 2007. For additional information, see Note 17Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements.
Our 2008 effective tax rate included a number of tax benefits and expenses which were incremental to the amount of tax accrued based on the statutory tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The most significant items are summarized in the following table (dollars in millions):
 
The Company expects the 2009 effective tax rate to increase when compared to the tax rates for 2008. More specifically, we expect the 2009 effective tax rate to be based on a pro-forma effective tax rate of approximately 37-38% plus an additional fixed amount of income tax expense between $25 and $30 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2008 we did not provide for a valuation allowance against our federal deferred tax assets. We are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and record a charge to income if we determine, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. If we did conclude that a valuation allowance was required, the resulting loss would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and our regulatory capital position at E*TRADE Bank. As of December 31, 2008, we had net deferred tax assets of $1.0 billion.
We did not establish a valuation allowance against our federal deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2008 as we believe that it is more likely than not that all of these assets will be realized. Our evaluation focused on identifying significant, objective evidence that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future. We
 
reviewed the estimated future taxable income for our trading and investing and balance sheet management segments separately and determined that our net operating losses in 2007 and 2008 were due solely to the credit losses in our balance sheet management segment. We believe these losses were caused by the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets which significantly impacted our asset-backed securities and home equity loan portfolios in 2007 and continued to generate credit losses in 2008. We estimate that these credit losses will continue in future periods; however, we ceased the business activities which we believe are the root cause of these losses. Therefore, while we do expect credit losses to continue in future periods, we do expect these amounts to decline when compared to our credit losses in 2007 and 2008. Our trading and investing segment generated substantial book taxable income for each of the last six years and we estimate that it will continue to generate taxable income in future periods at a level sufficient enough to generate taxable income for the Company as a whole. We consider this to be significant, objective evidence that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future.
Our analysis of the need for a valuation allowance recognizes that we are in a cumulative book taxable loss position as of the three-year period ended December 31, 2008, which is considered significant, objective evidence that we may not be able to realize some portion of our deferred tax assets in the future. However, we believe we are able to rely on our forecasts of future taxable income and overcome the uncertainty created by the cumulative loss position.
The crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets has created significant volatility in our results of operations. This volatility is isolated almost entirely to our balance sheet management segment. Our forecasts for this segment include assumptions regarding our estimate of future expected credit losses, which we believe to be the most variable component of our forecasts of future taxable income. We believe this variability could create a book loss in our overall results for an individual reporting period while not significantly impacting our overall estimate of taxable income over the period in which we expect to realize our deferred tax assets. Conversely, we believe our trading and investing segment will continue to produce a stable stream of income which we believe we can reliably estimate in both individual reporting periods as well as over the period in which we estimate we will realize our deferred tax assets.
In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we estimated future taxable income based on management approved forecasts. This process required significant judgment by management about matters that are by nature uncertain. If future events differ significantly from our current forecasts, a valuation allowance may need to be established, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and our regulatory capital position at E*TRADE Bank. In addition, a significant portion of the net deferred tax asset relates to a $2.3 billion federal tax loss carryforward, the utilization of which may be further limited in the event of certain material changes in the ownership of the Company. We will continue to monitor and update our assumptions and forecasts of future taxable income and assess the need for a valuation allowance.
 
Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax
During the year ended December 31, 2008, we sold our Canadian brokerage business to Scotiabank. The sale resulted in proceeds of approximately $515 million, including $54 million in repatriation of capital prior to the close and a pre-tax gain of $429.0 million. We also exited our direct retail lending business, which was our last remaining loan origination channel (we exited our wholesale mortgage lending channel in 2007). Therefore, the results of operations of our Canadian brokerage business, including the gain on sale, and the entire direct retail lending business are reported as discontinued operations on our consolidated statement of income (loss) for all periods presented. The following table outlines the components of discontinued operations (dollars of thousands):
 
 
The benefit of excess tax basis over book basis is related to our Canadian brokerage business, which resulted from the difference between the tax and financial reporting bases of the business. We recognized this difference in the second quarter of 2008 because a commitment to sell the Canadian brokerage business was in place. The sale of the Canadian brokerage business was completed in the third quarter of 2008 for a gain of $268.8 million, net of tax.
2007 Compared to 2006
Income (loss) from continuing operations was a loss of $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to income of $626.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 was due principally to the $2.2 billion loss on the sale of our asset-backed securities portfolio and an increase in our provision for loan losses of $595.1 million to $640.1 million. These losses in our balance sheet management segment more than offset the increase in our trading and investing segment income, which increased $91.3 million to $794.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006.
Revenue
Net Operating Interest Income
Net operating interest income increased 14% to $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in net operating interest income was due primarily to the increase in enterprise interest-earning assets. Average enterprise interest-earning assets increased 25% to $56.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. Average loans, net grew 39% to $30.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006 as a result of our focus on growing the one- to four-family loan portfolio in the first and second quarters of 2007. Beginning in the second half of 2007, we altered our strategy and halted the focus on growing the balance sheet.
Average enterprise interest-bearing liabilities increased 26% to $53.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in average enterprise interest-bearing liabilities was primarily in retail deposits. Average retail deposits increased 30% to $26.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. Increases in average retail deposits were driven by growth in the Complete Savings Account.
 
Enterprise net interest spread decreased by 21 basis points to 2.64% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. This decrease was primarily the result of a challenging interest rate environment throughout 2007 as well as growth in our Complete Savings Account, which pays a higher interest rate than the majority of our other deposit products.
Commission
Commission revenue increased 11% to $663.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006, which was driven by an increase of $61.8 million, or 13%, in our commission revenue.
DARTs increased 16% to 177,900 for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. Our U.S. DART volume increased 13% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. Our international DARTs grew by 42% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006, driven entirely by organic growth. In addition, option-related DARTs further increased as a percentage of total U.S. DARTs and represented 16% of trading volume versus 13% in 2006.
Average commission per trade decreased 2% to $11.72 for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The decrease was primarily a function of the mix of customers. Main Street Investors, who generally have a higher commission per trade, traded less during the period compared to Active Traders and Mass Affluent, who generally have a lower commission per trade. Customer appreciation and win-back campaigns, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2007, also contributed to the decrease in average commission per trade.
Fees and Service Charges
Fees and service charges increased 5% to $230.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. This increase was due to an increase in order flow payment, advisor management fees, foreign currency margin revenue, fixed income product revenue and mutual fund fees, partially offset by a decrease in account maintenance fees and mortgage servicing fees.
Principal Transactions
Principal transactions decreased 7% to $102.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The decrease in principal transactions resulted from lower trading volumes.
Gain (Loss) on Loans and Securities, Net
Gain (loss) on loans and securities, net was a loss of $2.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to a gain of $21.2 million for the same period in 2006. The decline in the total gain (loss) on loans and securities, net during 2007 was due primarily to the $2.2 billion loss on the sale of our asset-backed securities portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Other Revenue
Other revenue increased 36% to $47.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in other revenue was due to income from the cash surrender value of BOLI, an increase in fees earned in connection with distribution of shares during initial public offerings and software consulting fees from our Corporate Services business.
Provision for Loan Losses
Provision for loan losses increased $595.1 million to $640.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in the provision for loan losses was related primarily to deterioration in the performance of our home equity loan portfolio in the second half of 2007.
 
Operating Expense
Operating expense increased 19% to $1.6 billion for 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in expense excluding interest was driven primarily by increases in clearing and servicing, advertising and market development, impairment of goodwill and other expense.
Compensation and Benefits
Compensation and benefits increased 1% to $434.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The slight increase resulted primarily from increased benefit costs offset slightly by lower incentive based compensation in the current year.
Clearing and Servicing
Clearing and servicing expense increased 11% to $270.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. This increase is due primarily to higher loan balances during the period, which resulted in higher servicing costs, and increased trading activity, which resulted in higher clearing expenses.
Advertising and Market Development
Advertising and market development expense increased 31% to $138.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. This planned increase is a result of expanded efforts to promote our products and services to investors.
Impairment of Goodwill
Impairment of goodwill was $101.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. This impairment represents the entire amount of goodwill associated with our balance sheet management business, which had a significant decline in fair value during the fourth quarter of 2007.
Facility Restructuring and Other Exit Activities
Facility restructuring and other exit activities expense was $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The majority of this expense was incurred during the fourth quarter of 2007 and was driven primarily by the shut down of the international portion of our institutional brokerage business.
Other
Other expense increased 51% to $195.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2007 is due primarily to higher expense for certain legal and regulatory matters and higher FDIC premiums.
Other Income (Expense)
Other income (expense) increased 71% to $123.1 million for 2007 compared to 2006. Total other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2007 consisted primarily of corporate interest expense which increased 13% to $172.5 million, compared to 2006. The interest expense was partially offset by the sale of our investments in E*TRADE Australia and E*TRADE Korea, which resulted in $37.0 million in gain on sales of investments, net. During 2006, we sold shares of our investments in Softbank Investment Corporation and International Securities Exchange Holdings, Inc. resulting in gains of $71.7 million.
Income Tax Expense (Benefit)
The income tax benefit from continuing operations was $732.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to an income tax expense of $305.4 million for the same period in 2006. Our effective tax rate for
 
2007 was (33.7)% compared to 32.8% for 2006. For additional information, see Note 17Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements.
Discontinued Operations
Our income from discontinued operations, net of tax was $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $1.9 million for the same period in 2006. During 2007 and 2006, discontinued operations included operating results from our Canadian brokerage business and our direct retail lending business. During 2006, discontinued operations also included the results from our professional agency business, E*TRADE Professional Trading, LLC.
SEGMENT RESULTS REVIEW
Beginning in the first quarter of 2009, we revised our segment financial reporting to reflect the manner in which our chief operating decision maker had begun assessing the Company's performance and making resource allocation decisions. As a result, we now report our operating results in two segments: 1) "Trading and Investing", which includes the businesses that were formerly in the "Retail" segment and now includes our market-making business, and 2) "Balance Sheet Management", which includes the businesses from the former "Institutional" segment, other than the market-making business. Our segment financial information from prior periods has been reclassified in accordance with the new segment financial reporting.
Trading
and Investing
The following table summarizes trading and investing financial and key metrics for the periods ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 (dollars in thousands, except for key metrics):
 
 
Our trading and investing segment generates revenue from brokerage and banking relationships with investors and from market-making activities. This segment generates six primary sources of revenue: net operating interest income; commission; fees and service charges; principal transactions; gain (loss) on loans and securities, net; and other revenue. Other revenue includes results from our stock plan administration products and services, as we ultimately service customers through these corporate relationships.
2008 Compared to 2007
During the fourth quarter of 2007, we experienced a disruption in our customer base which caused a decline in the core drivers of our trading and investing segment, including: net new accounts, customer cash and deposits, DARTs, margin debt and customer assets. We believe this disruption was due to the uncertainty surrounding the Company in connection with the credit related losses in our balance sheet management segment. While we anticipate credit related losses will be at historically high levels in future periods, primarily in our home equity loan portfolio, we believe our customer base has stabilized. During
 
the year ended December 31, 2008, our customer base showed positive growth trends, including adding almost 246,000 net new accounts and growth in net new customer assets of approximately $5.4 billion ($6.4 billion excluding the sale of RAA). We believe these are indications that our trading and investing segment has not only stabilized but has returned to modest growth.
Trading and investing segment income decreased 21% to $623.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. This was due primarily to a decrease in net operating interest income.
Trading and investing net operating interest income decreased 14% to $830.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. This decrease was driven primarily by a decrease in margin debt as well as the above market rate on our Complete Savings Account. We plan to reduce the rate on this product in future periods which we believe will result in an improvement to trading and investing net operating interest income.
Trading and investing commission revenue decreased 1% to $514.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The slight decrease in commission revenue was primarily the result of a decrease in average commission per trade of 7%, offset by an increase in DARTs of 6%.
Trading and investing principal transactions decreased 16% to $84.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The decrease in principal transactions resulted from lower trading volumes. Our principal transactions revenue is influenced by overall trading volumes, the number of stocks for which we act as a market maker, the trading volumes of those specific stocks and the performance of our proprietary trading activities.
Trading and investing segment expense decreased 1% to $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. This decrease related primarily to $35.1 million in expense recorded for certain legal and regulatory matters for the year ended December 31, 2007 for which there was no similar expense in the year ended December 31, 2008. This decrease was partially offset by our planned growth in marketing spend as we expanded efforts to promote our products and services to investors.
As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately 2.6 million active brokerage accounts, 1.0 million active stock plan accounts and 0.9 million active banking accounts. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, our brokerage products contributed 63% for both years and our banking products contributed 27% and 26%, respectively, of total trading and investing net revenue. All other products contributed less than 10% of total trading and investing net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007.
2007 Compared to 2006
Trading and investing segment income increased 8% to $789.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in trading and investing segment income was due to an increase in net operating interest income and commission revenue.
Trading and investing net operating interest income increased 10% to $962.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. This increase was driven by customer cash and deposits, which generally translate into a lower cost of funds. The growth in customer cash and deposits during the first three quarters of 2007 was largely offset by the decline in customer cash during the fourth quarter of 2007.
Trading and investing commission revenue increased 13% to $520.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in commission revenue was primarily the result of increased trading volumes in the overall domestic equity market and in our international commissions.
Trading and investing segment expense increased 12% to $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. This increase related to our targeted growth in marketing spend as we
 
expanded efforts to promote our products and services to investors and to $35.1 million in expense recorded for certain legal and regulatory matters for the year ended December 31, 2007.
As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately 2.5 million active brokerage accounts, 1.1 million active stock plan accounts and 0.8 million active banking accounts. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, our brokerage products contributed 63% and 64%, respectively, and our banking products contributed 26% and 23%, respectively, of total trading and investing net revenue. All other products contributed less than 10% of total trading and investing net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.
Balance Sheet Management
The following table summarizes balance sheet management financial and key metrics for the periods ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 (dollars in thousands, except for key metrics):
 
Our balance sheet management segment generates revenue from managing loans previously originated or purchased from third parties, and leveraging these loans and customer cash and deposit relationships to generate additional net operating interest income.
2008 Compared to 2007
As a result of our exposure to the credit crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets, our balance sheet management segment incurred a loss of $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. The loss was driven primarily by an increase in our provision for loan losses for our loan portfolio of $943.6 million to $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007.
Net operating interest income decreased 30% to $437.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The decrease in net operating interest income was due primarily to the decrease in average enterprise interest-earning assets of 16% to $46.9 billion as of December 31, 2008 compared to 2007.
 
Balance sheet management commission revenue decreased to $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The decrease was a result of the exit of our institutional brokerage operations.
Fees and service charges revenue decreased 61% to $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The decrease is primarily the result of a decrease in CDO management fees, which are no longer a revenue stream due to the sale of our collateral management agreements during the first quarter of 2008.
The total loss on loans and securities, net during year ended December 31, 2008 was due principally to losses on our preferred stock in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which experienced record price declines and volatility during the third quarter of 2008. Based upon our concerns about continuing market instability, all of our positions were liquidated during the third quarter of 2008, resulting in a pre-tax loss of $153.8 million, net of hedges, that was recognized in loss on trading securities, net.
In addition, we recognized $95.0 million of impairment on certain securities in our CMO portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2008, which was a result of the deterioration in the expected credit performance of the underlying loans in the securities. Further declines in the performance of our CMO portfolio could result in additional impairments in future periods.
Provision for loan losses increased $943.6 million to $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The increase in the provision for loan losses was related primarily to deterioration in the performance of our home equity loan portfolio, which began in the second half of 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we also experienced deterioration in the performance of our one- to four-family loan portfolio. We believe the deterioration in both of these portfolios was caused by several factors, including: home price depreciation in virtually all key markets; growing inventories of unsold homes; rising foreclosure rates; sustained contraction in the availability of credit; and a severe downturn in the economy. While we do believe the provision for loan losses will be at historically high levels in future periods, we do not expect those levels to be in excess of those incurred in 2008.
Total balance sheet management segment expense decreased 52% to $253.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. This decrease was due primarily to the goodwill impairment recorded for the year ended December 31, 2007 for which there was no similar expense in the year ended December 31, 2008. There was also a decline in our clearing expense related to the exit of our institutional brokerage operations, as well as a reduction in corporate overhead expenses, the majority of which are allocated to the balance sheet management segment.
2007 Compared to 2006
As a result of our exposure to the credit crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets, our balance sheet management segment incurred a loss of $2.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007. The loss was driven primarily by losses in our asset-backed securities portfolio of approximately $2.5 billion as well as provision for loan losses for our loan portfolio of $640.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.
Net operating interest income increased 21% to $620.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in net operating interest income was due primarily to the increase in average interest-earning assets of 25% to $56.1 as of December 31, 2007.
Balance sheet management commission revenue increased 3% to $143.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The increase was due to higher trading volumes as a result of volatility in global equity markets in our institutional brokerage operations.
Fees and service charges revenue decreased 15% to $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2007 is related to a $4.5 million decline in service fee income as a result of lower rates and lower home equity, credit card and CDO management fees.
 
Gain (loss) on loans and securities, net decreased to a loss of $2.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007. This decline was due primarily to the $2.2 billion loss on the sale of our asset-backed securities portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Provision for loan losses increased $595.1 million to $640.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. This increase was largely due to the deterioration in the performance of our home equity loan portfolio.
Total balance sheet management segment expense increased 38% to $529.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006 and was due primarily to the impairment of goodwill associated with the decline in fair value of our balance sheet management business during the fourth quarter of 2007.
BALANCE SHEET OVERVIEW
The following table sets forth the significant components of our consolidated balance sheet (dollars in thousands):
 
 
The decrease in total assets was attributable primarily to a decrease of $5.7 billion in loans, net and a decrease of $4.4 billion in margin receivables for the period ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in cash of $2.9 billion. The decrease in loans, net is due to our strategy of reducing balance sheet risk and halting our previous focus on growing the balance sheet. For the foreseeable future, we plan to allow our home equity loans to pay down resulting in an overall decline in the balance of the loan portfolio. During this period, we plan to maintain excess regulatory capital at E*TRADE Bank as we focus on strengthening our capital position. We believe the decrease in our margin receivables is due to customers deleveraging and reducing their risk exposure due to the volatility in the financial markets and is not due to a specific issue with the terms or competitiveness of our margin product.
The decrease in total liabilities was attributable primarily to a decrease of $4.6 billion in wholesale borrowings, a decrease in customer payables of $1.8 billion and a decrease of $1.6 billion in accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities for the period ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. Repurchase agreements
 
and other borrowings are the primary wholesale funding sources for our loans, net and available-for-sale securities portfolios. The decreases in these balances were the result of paying down these liabilities as we decreased the size of our balance sheet during 2008. The decrease in our customer payables is related primarily to the sale of our Canadian brokerage business during the year ended December 31, 2008. In addition, stock loan, which is reported within the accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities line item, decreased $1.7 billion to $0.3 billion at December 31, 2008 compared to 2007.
Available-for-Sale Mortgage-Backed and Investment Securities
Available-for-sale securities are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
 
Available-for-sale securities represented 22% and 20% of total assets at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Available-for-sale securities decreased 4% to $10.8 billion at December 31, 2008 compared to December 31, 2007, due primarily to the sale of certain mortgage-backed securities in the first half of 2008, offset by the purchase of highly-rated securities backed by U.S. Government sponsored and federal agencies in the second half of 2008. All mortgage-backed securities backed by U.S. Government sponsored and federal agencies are AAA-rated.
 
Margin Receivables
The margin receivables balance is a component of the margin debt balance, which is reported as a key trading and investing metric of $2.8 billion and $7.0 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The total margin debt balance is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
 
We believe the decrease in our margin receivables is due to customers deleveraging and reducing their risk exposure given the substantial volatility in the financial markets and is not due to an issue with the terms or competitiveness of our margin product.
Loans, Net
Loans, net are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
 
Loans, net decreased 19% to $24.5 billion at December 31, 2008 from $30.1 billion at December 31, 2007. This decline was due primarily to our strategy of reducing balance sheet risk and halting our previous focus on growing the balance sheet. We do not expect to grow our loan portfolio for the foreseeable future. In addition, we plan to allow our home equity loans to pay down resulting in an overall decline in the balance of the loan portfolio.
In 2007, we entered into a credit default swap ("CDS") on $4.0 billion of our first-lien residential real estate loan portfolio through a synthetic securitization structure. As of December 31, 2008, the balance of the loans
 
covered by the CDS was $2.9 billion. A CDS provides, for a fee, an assumption by a third party of a portion of the credit risk related to the underlying loans. The CDS provides protection for losses in excess of $4.0 million, but not to exceed approximately $30.3 million. In addition, our regulatory risk-weighted assets were reduced as a result of this transaction because we transferred a portion of our credit risk to an unaffiliated third party. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized $1.6 million in losses on the portion of the loans covered under the CDS. We have not yet realized any recoveries from the CDS; however, the estimated recoveries from the CDS for the next twelve months were $13.9 million at December 31, 2008, which is reflected in the allowance for loan losses.
Deposits
Deposits are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
Deposits represented 57% and 48% of total liabilities at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Deposits increased $0.3 billion to $26.1 billion at December 31, 2008 compared to December 31, 2007, driven by a $2.7 billion increase in money market and savings accounts. This increase was offset by a decrease in certificates of deposit and brokered certificates of deposits by $2.4 billion. Deposits generally provide us the benefit of lower interest costs, compared with wholesale funding alternatives.
The deposits balance is a component of the total customer cash and deposits balance reported as a customer activity metric of $32.3 billion and $32.7 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The total customer cash and deposits balance is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
 
 
Wholesale Borrowings
Wholesale borrowings, which consist of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
Wholesale borrowings represented 26% and 30% of total liabilities at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in other borrowings of $3.1 billion for the period ended December 31, 2008 was due primarily to a decrease in FHLB advances. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase coupled with FHLB advances are the primary wholesale funding sources of the Bank. As a result, we expect these balances to fluctuate over time as our deposits and our interest-earning assets fluctuate.
Corporate Debt
Corporate debt is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
 
Corporate debt decreased to $2.8 billion at December 31, 2008 compared to $3.0 billion at December 31, 2007, primarily due to the retirement of the $450 million in mandatory convertible notes during the fourth quarter of 2008 and a decline in senior notes of $121 million in principal related to debt for equity exchanges. Offsetting these decreases was an additional $150.0 million of 12

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We have established liquidity and capital policies. The objectives of these policies are to support the successful execution of our business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity through the business cycle. These policies are especially important during periods of stress in the financial markets, which have been ongoing since the fourth quarter of 2007 and will likely continue for the foreseeable future. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we experienced a disruption in our customer base, which caused a significant decline in customer deposits. We believe this disruption was due to uncertainty in connection with the credit related losses in our balance sheet management segment. Deposits are the primary source of liquidity for E*TRADE Bank, so this sudden and rapid decline created a substantial amount of liquidity risk. We followed our existing liquidity policies and
 
contingency plans and successfully met our liquidity needs during this extraordinary period. We believe that our ability to meet liquidity needs during this time validates the effectiveness of the liquidity policies and contingency plans. While the liquidity risk associated with our customer deposits remains at historically high levels, we believe the current level of risk is substantially lower than it was during the fourth quarter of 2007.
Capital is generated primarily through our business operations and our capital market activities. During the second half of 2007, our balance sheet management segment incurred a significant amount of losses as a result of its exposure to the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets. Consequently, this segment required a significant capital infusion during the fourth quarter of 2007. The Company raised $2.5 billion in cash from Citadel, the majority of which was used to provide capital to the balance sheet management segment. While this segment continues to have exposure to the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets, our trading and investing segment remains profitable and continues to generate capital through retained earnings.
We maintain capital in excess of regulatory minimums at our regulated subsidiaries, the most significant of which is E*TRADE Bank. As of December 31, 2008, we held $714.7 million of risk-based capital at E*TRADE Bank in excess of the regulatory minimum level required to be considered "well capitalized."
We raised additional capital in 2008 by issuing shares of common stock in exchange for existing corporate debt, primarily our senior notes, commonly referred to as "3(a)9 exchanges." We completed several 3(a)9 exchanges in the first half of 2008, which resulted in a retirement of $120.8 million of existing corporate debt. We did not complete any of these transactions during the second half of 2008 as the relative prices of our common stock and corporate debt made it unattractive to do so.
In addition, we raised approximately $750 million in cash through non-core asset sales, including the sale of our Canadian brokerage business and our equity shares in Investsmart
(1)
.
We believe the combination of the capital generated in the transactions detailed above, the excess capital held at E*TRADE Bank and the capital that continues to be generated in our trading and investing segment will be sufficient to meet our capital needs for at least the next twelve months.
During the fourth quarter of 2008, we applied to the U.S. Treasury for funding under the TARP Capital Purchase Program. Our application remains under active consideration and we cannot predict when a final decision will be reached. We estimate this program could provide up to approximately $800 million in new preferred equity, at rates substantially discounted to current market rates. If our application is approved, it would likely be conditional upon additional capital raising activities by us, including possible transactions with existing security holders. Our ability to issue preferred equity under the TARP program would be dependent upon receiving approval from certain of our bond holders and possibly our shareholders. While we do not believe we need this capital to fund our operations, it does have the potential to significantly improve the capital position of both E*TRADE Bank and the parent company, which would enhance our ability to maintain the balance sheet at its current level.
 
 
Corporate Cash
Corporate cash is the primary source of liquidity at the parent company and is available to invest in our regulated subsidiaries. We define corporate cash as cash held at the parent company as well as cash held in certain subsidiaries that can distribute cash to the parent company without any regulatory approval. The components of corporate cash as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 are as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
 
Parent company cash decreased $35.1 million to $216.5 million as of December 31, 2008 when compared to December 31, 2007. The cash received from the sale of the Canadian brokerage business was offset by the $500 million in capital infusions made to E*TRADE Bank during the second half of 2008. The $157.6 million increase in cash to $218.3 million at Converging Arrows, Inc. and other as of December 31, 2008 when compared to December 31, 2007 was due almost entirely to the sale of E*TRADE Mauritius' equity shares in Investsmart.
Cash and Equivalents
The consolidated cash and equivalents balance increased by $2.1 billion to $3.9 billion at December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The majority of this balance is cash held in regulated subsidiaries, primarily our Bank and Brokerage, outlined as follows:
 
 
The cash held in our regulated subsidiaries serves as a source of liquidity for those subsidiaries and is not a primary source of capital for the parent company.
Cash and Equivalents Held in the Reserve Fund
At December 31, 2008, we held cash in The Reserve Funds' Primary Fund ("the Fund") of $146.3 million, which is included as a receivable in other assets line item on the balance sheet. On September 16, 2008, the Fund reported that its shares had fallen below the standard of $1 per share, which is commonly referred to as "breaking the buck." Prior to the fund "breaking the buck," we submitted a redemption request for our entire balance in the
 
fund. The following table details our cash held in the Fund at the date the Fund was reported as "breaking the buck" and at December 31, 2008 (dollars in thousands):
 
On October 31, 2008 and December 3, 2008, the Fund made a distribution to its investors of approximately $26 billion and $14 billion, respectively. We received $377.7 million and $209.2 million, respectively, in connection with these distributions. On December 3, 2008, the Reserve indicated that they are required to distribute the remaining assets of the Fund ratably among the holders of outstanding shares, irrespective of whether the investor made a redemption request before or after the Fund "breaking the buck." The statement indicated, assuming a pro-rata distribution, the net asset value per share would be $0.985. As a result of that statement, we no longer believe it is probable that we will receive the full amount of our remaining position in the Fund; therefore, we recorded an impairment charge of $11.2 million
(1)
related to this investment. The impairment charge of $3.5 million related to our corporate cash was included in gain (loss) on sales of investments, net line item. The impairment charge of $7.7 million related to our banking and brokerage subsidiaries is included in gain (loss) on loans and securities, net line item. The remaining amount of $146.3 million, net of the $11.2 million impairment charge, that we invested in the Fund is included as a receivable in the other assets line item.
On February 26, 2009, the Reserve announced that it had adopted a Plan of Liquidation for the orderly liquidation of the assets of the Fund. Under the terms of the plan, which is subject to the supervision of the SEC, the Reserve will continue to make interim distributions up to $0.9172 per share. The Reserve indicated in this announcement that they were taking this approach in order to provide liquidity to investors without prejudicing the legal rights and remedies of any shareholder's claims. This announcement does not change our belief that we will receive the full amount of our remaining position upon the ultimate distribution of the fund; however, we cannot state with certainty that we will not ultimately incur additional loss on our remaining position. In addition, we believe it will take a significant amount of time to eventually receive these funds.
Liquidity Available from Subsidiaries
Liquidity available to the Company from its subsidiaries, other than Converging Arrows, Inc. ("Converging Arrows") and E*TRADE Mauritius, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Converging Arrows, is limited by regulatory requirements.
Any loans by E*TRADE Bank to the parent company and its other non-bank subsidiaries are subject to various quantitative, arm's length, collateralization and other requirements. At December 31, 2008, E*TRADE Bank had approximately $714.7 million of risk-based capital above the "well capitalized" level. In the current credit environment, we plan to keep this significant amount of excess risk-based capital at E*TRADE Bank in order to enhance our ability to absorb credit losses while still maintaining "well capitalized" status. However, events beyond management's control, such as a continued deterioration in residential real estate and credit markets, could adversely affect future earnings and E*TRADE Bank's ability to meet its future capital requirements.
The Company's broker/dealer subsidiaries are subject to capital requirements determined by their respective regulators. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, all of our brokerage subsidiaries met their minimum net capital requirements. The Company's broker-dealer subsidiaries had excess net capital of $717.6
(2)
million at December 31, 2008. While we cannot assure that we would obtain regulatory approval to withdraw any of this excess net capital, $619.4 million is available for dividend while still maintaining a capital level above regulatory "early warning" guidelines.
 
 
Other Sources of Liquidity
We also maintain $325.0 million in uncommitted financing to meet margin lending needs. At December 31, 2008, there were no outstanding balances, and the full $325.0 million was available.
We rely on borrowed funds, such as FHLB advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, to provide liquidity for the Bank. Our ability to borrow these funds is dependent upon the continued availability of funding in the wholesale borrowings market. At December 31, 2008, the Bank had approximately $9.8 billion in additional borrowing capacity with the FHLB.
We have the option to make interest payments on our springing lien notes in the form of either cash or additional springing lien notes through May 2010. During the second quarter of 2008, we elected to make our first interest payment of approximately $121 million in cash. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we elected to make our second interest payment of $121 million in the form of additional springing lien notes. We expect to make our next three interest payments, which equates to all interest payments on the springing lien notes through May 2010 in the form of additional springing lien notes. The November 2010 payment is the first interest payment we are required to pay in cash.
Corporate Debt
Our current senior debt ratings are B2 by Moody's Investor Service, B (developing) by S&P and B (high) by Dominion Bond Rating Service ("DBRS"). The Company's long-term deposit ratings are Ba3 by Moody's Investor Service, BB- (developing) by S&P and BB by DBRS. A significant change in these ratings may impact the rate and availability of future borrowings.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We enter into various off-balance-sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, primarily to meet the needs of our customers and to reduce our own exposure to interest rate risk. These arrangements include firm commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. Additionally, we enter into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business. For additional information on each of these arrangements, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
The following summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2008 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (dollars in thousands):
 
 
 
As of December 31, 2008, the Company had $2.5 billion of unused lines of credit available to customers under home equity lines of credit and $0.5 billion of unused credit card and commercial lines. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had no commitments to originate, purchase or sell loans. The Company had a commitment to purchase and sell securities of $0.8 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. The Company also had equity funding commitments of $9.7 million as of December 31, 2008, based on investment plans of venture capital funds, low income housing tax credit partnerships and joint ventures. Additional information related to commitments and contingent liabilities is detailed in Note 23Commitments, Contingencies and Other Regulatory Matters.
Other Liquidity Matters
We currently anticipate that our available cash resources and credit will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. We may need to raise additional funds in order to support regulatory capital needs at our Bank, reduce holding company debt, support more rapid expansion, develop new or enhanced products and services, respond to competitive pressures, acquire businesses or technologies or take advantage of unanticipated opportunities.
RISK MANAGEMENT
As a financial services company, we are exposed to risks in every component of our business. The identification and management of existing and potential risks are the keys to effective risk management. Our risk management framework, principles and practices support decision-making, improve the success rate for new initiatives and strengthen the organization. Our goal is to balance risks and rewards through effective risk management. Risks cannot be completely eliminated; however, we do believe risks can be identified and managed within the Company's risk tolerance.
Our businesses expose us to the following four major categories of risk that often overlap:
 
 
 
 
We also are subject to other risks that could impact our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in future periods. See Part IItem 1A. Risk Factors.
We manage risk through a governance structure involving the various boards, senior management and several risk committees. We use management level risk committees to help ensure that business decisions are executed within our desired risk profile. A variety of methodologies and measures are used to monitor, quantify, assess and forecast risk. Measurement criteria, methodologies and calculations are reviewed periodically to assure that risks are represented appropriately. Risks are managed and controlled under policies and related limits that are approved by the Board of Directors and delegated to senior management.
The Finance and Risk Oversight Committee, which was established in the second quarter of 2008 and consists of members of the Board of Directors, monitors the risk process and significant risks throughout the
 
Company. In addition to this committee, various enterprise risk committees and departments throughout the Company aid in the identification and management of risks, including:
 
 
We use various departments throughout the Company to aid in the identification and management of risks. These departments include internal audit, compliance, finance, legal, treasury, credit and enterprise risk management. Risk reporting occurs at the business or operating units and is aggregated across the Company through the enterprise risk management process.
Credit Risk Management
Our primary sources of credit risk are our loan and securities portfolios, where it results from extending credit to customers and purchasing securities, respectively. The degree of credit risk associated with our loans and securities varies based on many factors including the size of the transaction, the credit characteristics of the borrower, features of the loan product or security, the contractual terms of the related documents and the availability and quality of collateral. Credit risk is one of the most common risks in financial services and is one of our most significant risks.
Credit risk is monitored by our Credit Risk Committee. The Credit Risk Committee uses detailed tracking and analysis to measure credit performance and reviews and modifies credit policies as appropriate.
Housing Market Conditions
Conditions in the residential real estate and credit markets, which deteriorated sharply during 2007, continued to be extremely challenging during 2008. The significant and abrupt evaporation of secondary market liquidity for various types of mortgage loans, particularly home equity loans, has decreased the overall availability of housing credit. As a result, many borrowers, particularly those in markets with declining housing prices, have been unable to refinance existing loans. This combination of a decline in the availability of credit and a decline in housing prices creates significant credit risk in our loan portfolio, particularly in our home equity loan portfolio.
Loss Mitigation
Given the deterioration in the performance of our loan portfolio, particularly in our home equity loan portfolio, we formed a special credit management team to focus on the mitigation of potential losses in the home equity loan portfolio.
This team's primary focus is reducing our exposure to open home equity lines. As of December 31, 2007, we had $6.3 billion of unused lines of credit available under home equity lines of credit. Through a variety of strategies, including voluntary line closures, automatically freezing lines on all delinquent accounts, and freezing lines on loans with materially reduced home equity, we have reduced this amount to $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2008.
The team has several other initiatives either in progress or in development which are focused on mitigating losses in our home equity loan portfolio. Those initiatives include improving collection efforts and practices of our servicers as well as increasing our loss recovery efforts to minimize the level of loss on a loan that goes to charge-off.
 
We also initiated a loan modification program that resulted in an insignificant number of minor modifications in 2008. Based on the programs we now have in place, we expect the number of modifications to increase significantly in 2009 when compared to 2008. On February 18, 2009, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced the Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan. The primary focus of this plan is to create requirements and provide incentives to modify mortgages with the goal of avoiding foreclosure. We are analyzing the details of this recently announced program and do not yet know whether it would have a significant impact on our current loan modification programs.
In addition, we continue to review our purchased mortgage loan portfolio in order to identify loans to be repurchased by the originator. Our review is primarily focused on identifying loans with early payment defaults, violations of transaction representations and warranties, or material misrepresentation on the part of the seller. Any loans identified with these deficiencies are submitted to the original seller for repurchase. During the year ended December 31, 2008, approximately $105.6 million of loans were repurchased by the original sellers.
Underwriting StandardsOriginated Loans
During the second half of 2007, we exited our wholesale mortgage origination channel and no longer originate loans through brokers. During the second quarter of 2008, we exited our retail mortgage origination business, which represented our last remaining loan origination channel.
We did not originate any loans during the second half of 2008. Prior to the exit of our retail mortgage origination business in the second quarter of 2008, we did originate approximately $158 million in one- to four-family loans during the first half of 2008. These loans were predominantly prime credit quality first-lien mortgage loans secured by a single-family residence.
We priced our loans primarily based on the risk elements inherent in the loan. We evaluated criteria such as, but not limited to: borrower credit score, loan-to-value ratio ("LTV"), documentation type, occupancy type and other risk elements. In the first quarter of 2008, we further adjusted our loan origination practices and pricing to significantly curtail originations of higher risk loans, particularly home equity loans with Fair Isaac Credit Organization ("FICO") scores below 700 or a combined loan-to-value ratio ("CLTV") greater than 80%.
Our underwriting guidelines were established with a focus on both the credit quality of the borrower as well as the adequacy of the collateral securing the loan. We designed our underwriting guidelines so that our one- to four-family loans were salable in the secondary market. These guidelines included limitations on loan amount, LTV ratio, debt-to-income ratio, documentation type and occupancy type. We also required borrowers to obtain mortgage insurance on higher loan-to-value first lien mortgage loans.
As of December 31, 2008, we did not offer any mortgage loan products to our customers. In the future, we expect to partner with a third party company to provide access to real estate loans for our customers.
Underwriting StandardsPurchased Loans
In the second half of 2007, we altered our business strategy and halted the focus on growing the balance sheet. As a result, we did not purchase loans during the year ended December 31, 2008 and we do not anticipate purchasing a significant amount of loans for the foreseeable future. However, we have significantly tightened our underwriting policies for any future loan purchases that do occur. These criteria focus on limiting the acquisition of loans with a high risk of credit loss and require the exclusion of loans with the following attributes: second lien; home equity line of credit; CLTV ratio above 80%; FICO score below 700 at time of origination; and documentation type is not full documentation.
 
Liquidity Risk Management
Liquidity risk is monitored and managed primarily by the ALCO. We have in place a comprehensive set of liquidity and funding policies that are intended to maintain our flexibility to address liquidity events specific to us or the market in general.
We believe liquidity risk management is especially important during periods of stress in the financial markets. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we experienced a disruption in our customer base, which caused a significant decline in customer deposits. These deposits are the primary source of liquidity for E*TRADE Bank, so this sudden and rapid decline created a substantial amount of liquidity risk. We followed our existing liquidity policies and contingency plans and successfully met our liquidity needs during this extraordinary period. We believe that our ability to meet liquidity needs during this time validates the effectiveness of our liquidity policies and contingency plans.
See Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional information.
Interest Rate Risk Management
Interest rate risks are monitored and managed by the ALCO. The analysis of interest sensitivity to changes in market interest rates under various scenarios is reviewed by ALCO. The scenarios assume both parallel and non-parallel shifts in the yield curve. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for additional information about our interest rate risks.
Operational Risk Management
Operational risks exist in most areas of the Company from clearing to customer service. While we make every effort to protect against failures in the internal controls system, no system is completely fail proof.
Loss of company and customer assets due to fraud represents one of our most significant operational risks. Fraud losses typically result from unauthorized use of customer and corporate funds and resources. We monitor customer transactions and use scoring tools which prevent a significant number of fraudulent transactions on a daily basis. However, new techniques and strategies are constantly being developed by perpetrators to commit fraud. In order to minimize this threat, we offer our customers various security measures, including a token based security system. This token creates a unique password which changes every sixty seconds and must be used along with the customer's self-selected password to access their account. We believe this system is an extremely effective tool for preventing unauthorized access to a customer's account.
The failure of a third party vendor to adequately meet its responsibilities could result in financial loss and impact our reputation. The Vendor Risk Management group monitors our vendor relationships and arrangements. The vendor risk identification process includes evaluating contracts, renewal options and vendor performance. To ensure the financial soundness of providers, we conduct financial reviews of our large providers. In addition, onsite operational audits are conducted annually for significant providers.
Processing issues and external events may result in opportunity loss depending on the situation. These types of losses include issues resulting from human error, equipment failures, significant weather events or other related types of events. External events resulting in actual losses could be due to Internet performance issues, litigation, change in public policy and our reputation.
CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK
Loans
We track and review many factors to predict and monitor credit risk in our loan portfolios, which are primarily made up of loans secured by residential real estate. These factors, which are documented at the time of
 
origination, include: borrowers' debt-to income ratio, borrowers' credit scores, housing prices, documentation type, occupancy type, and loan type. We also review estimated current LTV ratios when monitoring credit risk in our loan portfolios. In economic conditions in which housing prices generally appreciate, we believe that loan type, LTV ratios and credit scores are the key factors in determining future loan performance. In the current housing market with declining home prices and less credit available for refinance, we believe the LTV ratio becomes a more important factor in predicting and monitoring credit risk.
We believe certain categories of loans inherently have a higher level of credit risk due to characteristics of the borrower and/or features of the loan. Two of these categories are sub-prime and option ARM loans. As a general matter, we do not originate or purchase these loans to hold on our balance sheet; however, in the normal course of purchasing large pools of real estate loans, we invariably ended up acquiring a de minimis amount of sub-prime loans. As of December 31, 2008, sub-prime
(1)
real estate loans represented less than one-fifth of one percent of our total real estate loan portfolio and we held no option ARM loans.
As noted above, we believe loan type, LTV ratios and borrowers' credit scores are key determinants of future loan performance. Our home equity loan portfolio is primarily second lien loans
(2)
on residential real estate properties, which have a higher level of credit risk than first lien mortgage loans. We believe home equity loans with a CLTV of 90% or higher or a FICO score below 700 are the loans with the highest levels of credit risk in our portfolios.
The breakdowns by LTV/CLTV and FICO score of our two main loan portfolios, one-to four-family and home equity, are as follows (dollars in thousands)
(3)
:
 
 
 
In addition to the factors described above, we monitor credit trends in loans by acquisition channel and vintage, which are summarized below as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 (dollars in thousands):
 
Allowance for Loan Losses
The allowance for loan losses is management's estimate of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The estimate of the allowance for loan losses is based on a variety of factors, including the composition and quality of the portfolio; delinquency levels and trends; probable expected losses for the next twelve months; current and historical charge-off and loss experience; current industry charge-off and loss experience; the condition of the real estate market and geographic concentrations within the loan portfolio; the interest rate climate; the overall availability of housing credit; and general economic conditions. Determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for loan losses in future periods. We believe our allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2008 is representative of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date.
In determining the allowance for loan losses, we allocate a portion of the allowance to various loan products based on an analysis of individual loans and pools of loans. However, the entire allowance is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date.
The following table presents the allowance for loan losses by major loan category (dollars in thousands):
 
 
 
During the year ended December 31, 2008, the allowance for loan losses increased by $572.4 million from the level at December 31, 2007. This increase was driven primarily by the increase in the allowance allocated to the home equity loan portfolio, which began to deteriorate during the second half of 2007. During the year ended December, 31 2008, we also experienced deterioration in the performance of our one- to four-family loan portfolio. We believe the deterioration in both of these portfolios was caused by several factors, including: home price depreciation in virtually all key markets; growing inventories of unsold homes; rising foreclosure rates; sustained contraction in the availability of credit; and a severe downturn in the economy. While we do believe the provision for loan losses will be at historically high levels in future periods, we do not expect those levels to be in excess of those incurred in 2008.
The following table provides an analysis of the allowance for loan losses and net charge-offs for the past five years (dollars in thousands):
 
 
 
The following table allocates the allowance for loan losses by loan category (dollars in thousands):
 
 
Loan losses are recognized when it is probable that a loss will be incurred. Our policy is to charge-off closed-end consumer loans when the loan is 120 days delinquent or when we determine that collection is not probable. For credit cards, our policy is to charge-off loans when collection is not probable or the loan has been delinquent for 180 days. Our policy for one- to four-family loan charge-offs prior to January 1, 2008 was to recognize a charge-off when we foreclosed on the property. For home equity loans, our policy prior to January 1, 2008 was to charge-off loans when we foreclosed on the property or when the loan had been delinquent for 180 days. As of January 1, 2008, we adjusted our charge-off policy mainly for loans in the process of foreclosure. Our updated policy for both one- to four-family and home equity loans is to assess the value of the property when the loan has been delinquent for 180 days or is in bankruptcy, regardless of whether or not the property is in foreclosure, and charge-off the amount of the loan balance in excess of the estimated current property value. As a result of this change, nonperforming loans included a $73.5 million write down as of December 31, 2008.
 
Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 increased by $811.7 million. The overall increase was primarily due to higher net charge-offs on home equity loans, which was driven mainly by the same factors as described above. The continued pressure in the residential real estate market, specifically home price depreciation combined with tighter mortgage lending guidelines, could lead to a higher level of charge-offs in future periods. The following graph illustrates the net charge-offs by quarter:
Nonperforming Assets
We classify loans as nonperforming when they are 90 days past due. The following table shows the comparative data for nonperforming loans and assets (dollars in thousands):
 
 
During the year ended December 31, 2008 our nonperforming assets, net increased $585.9 million to $1.1 billion. The increase was attributed primarily to an increase in nonperforming one- to four-family loans of $411.8 million and home equity loans of $111.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 when compared to December 31, 2007. We expect nonperforming loan levels to increase over time due to the weak conditions in the residential real estate and credit markets.
The following graph illustrates the nonperforming loans by quarter:
The allowance as a percentage of total nonperforming loans receivable, net decreased from 121% at December 31, 2007 to 115% at December 31, 2008. This decrease was driven primarily by an increase in one- to four-family non-performing loans, which have a significantly lower level of expected loss when compared to home equity loans. The balance of nonperforming loans includes loans delinquent 90 to 179 days as well as loans delinquent 180 days and greater. We believe the distinction between these two periods is important as loans delinquent 180 days and greater have been written down to their expected recovery value, whereas loans delinquent 90 to 179 days have not. We believe the allowance for loan losses expressed as a percentage of loans delinquent 90 to 179 days is an important measure of the adequacy of the allowance as these loans are expected to drive the vast majority of future charge-offs. Additional charge-offs on loans delinquent 180 days are possible if home prices decline beyond our current expectations, but we do not anticipate these charge-offs to be significant, particularly when compared to the expected charge-offs on loans delinquent 90 to 179 days. We consider this ratio especially important for one- to four-family loans as we expect the balances of loans delinquent 180 days and greater to increase in the future due to the extensive amount of time it takes to foreclose on a property in the current real estate market.
The following table shows the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans delinquent 90 to 179 days for each of our major loan categories (dollars in thousands):
 
 
In addition to nonperforming assets, we monitor loans where a borrower's past credit history casts doubt on their ability to repay a loan ("Special Mention" loans). We classify loans as Special Mention when they are between 30 and 89 days past due. The following table shows the comparative data for Special Mention loans (dollars in thousands):
 
 
The trend in Special Mention loan balances is generally indicative of the expected trend for charge-offs in future periods, as these loans have a greater propensity to migrate into nonaccrual status and ultimately charge-off. One- to four-family loans are generally secured in a first lien position by real estate assets, reducing the potential loss when compared to an unsecured loan. Our home equity loans are generally secured by real estate assets; however, the majority of these loans are secured in a second lien position, which substantially increases the potential loss when compared to a first lien position.
During 2008, Special Mention loans increased by $422.8 million to approximately $1.0 billion. While our level of Special Mention loans can fluctuate significantly in any given period, we do not believe the overall increase we observed in 2008 will be repeated in 2009.
The following graph illustrates the Special Mention loans by quarter:
Securities
We focus primarily on security type and credit rating to monitor credit risk in our securities portfolios. We believe our asset-backed securities portfolio, which we sold in the fourth quarter of 2007, represented our highest concentration of credit risk within the securities portfolio. Subsequent to the sale of that portfolio, we believe our
 
highest concentration of remaining credit risk, while considerably lower than the credit risk inherent in asset-backed securities, is our CMO portfolio. The table below details the amortized cost by average credit ratings and type of asset as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 (dollars in thousands):
 
While the vast majority of this portfolio is AAA-rated, we concluded during the year ended December 31, 2008 that approximately $181.2 million of the securities in this portfolio had a probable risk of future loss. As a result of the deterioration in the expected credit performance of the underlying loans in the securities, they were written down to their estimated fair market value by recording a $95.0 million impairment for the year ended December 31, 2008. Further declines in the performance of our CMO portfolio could result in additional impairments in future periods.
Derivatives
Credit risk is an element of the recurring fair value measurements for certain assets and liabilities, including derivative instruments. We monitor the collateral requirements on derivative instruments through credit support agreements, which reduce risk by permitting the netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon occurrence of certain events. We considered the impact of credit risk on the fair value measurement for derivative instruments, particularly those in net liability positions, to be mitigated by the enforcement of credit support agreements, and the collateral requirements therein. Our credit risk analysis for derivative instruments also considered whether the cost to mitigate the credit loss exposure on derivative instruments in net asset positions would have resulted in material adjustments to the valuations. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the consideration of credit risk, the Company's or the counterparty's, did not result in an adjustment to the valuation of its derivative financial instruments.
 
SUMMARY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Note 1Organization, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of our significant accounting policies, many of which require the use of estimates and assumptions. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following are noteworthy because they are based on estimates and assumptions that require complex, subjective judgments by management, which can materially impact reported results. Changes in these estimates or assumptions could materially impact our financial condition and results of operation.
Allowance for Loan Losses
Description
The allowance for loan losses is management's estimate of probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. In determining the adequacy of the allowance, we perform periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and loss forecasting assumptions. At December 31, 2008, our allowance for loan losses was $1.1 billion on $25.3 billion of loans designated as held-for-investment.
Judgments
The estimate of the allowance is based on a variety of factors, including the composition and quality of the portfolio; delinquency levels and trends; probable expected losses for the next twelve months; current and historical charge-off and loss experience; current industry charge-off and loss experience; the condition of the real estate market and geographic concentrations within the loan portfolio; the interest rate climate; the overall availability of housing credit; and general economic conditions. Determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses by loan type: one- to four-family, home equity and consumer and other loan portfolios.
Our one- to four-family and home equity loan portfolios are separated into risk segments based on key risk factors, which include but are not limited to channel of loan origination, documentation type, loan product type and LTV ratio. Based upon the segmentation, probable losses are determined with expected loss rates in each segment. The additional protection provided by mortgage insurance and the credit default swap has been factored into the expected loss on defaulted mortgage loans. The expected recovery from the liquidation of foreclosed real estate and expected recoveries from loan sellers related to contractual guarantees are also factored into the expected loss on defaulted mortgage loans. Our one- to four-family and home equity loan portfolios represented 51% and 40%, respectively, of the total gross loan portfolio as of December 31, 2008.
For the consumer and other loan portfolio, management establishes loss estimates for each consumer portfolio based on credit characteristics and observation of the existing markets. The expected recoveries from the sale of repossessed collateral are factored into the expected loss on defaulted consumer loans based on current liquidation experience. Our consumer and other loan portfolio represented 9% of the total gross loan portfolio as of December 31, 2008.
Subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for loan losses in future periods.
Effects if Actual Results Differ
The crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets has substantially increased the complexity and uncertainty involved in estimating the losses inherent in our loan portfolio. If our underlying assumptions and
 
judgments prove to be inaccurate, the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses. These losses would result in a decrease in our net income as well as a decrease in the level of regulatory capital at E*TRADE Bank.
Fair Value Measurements
Description
Effective January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 157, ("SFAS No. 157"), which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We determine the fair value of our financial instruments and for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis in accordance with SFAS No. 157. We will not adopt certain provisions of this statement until January 1, 2009 as they relate to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. Examples of assets and liabilities for which we have not applied the provisions of SFAS No. 157 include reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets measured at fair value in impairment tests under SFAS No. 142, ("SFAS No. 142"), nonfinancial long-lived assets measured at fair value for an impairment assessment under SFAS No. 144, ("SFAS No. 144") as well as nonfinancial liabilities for exit or disposal activities initially measured at fair value under SFAS No. 146, ("SFAS No. 146").
Fair Value Measurements
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
Judgments
In determining fair value, we use various valuation approaches, including market, income and/or cost approaches. The fair value hierarchy established in SFAS No. 157 requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant. As such, even when market assumptions are not readily available, our own assumptions reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. The standard describes the following three levels used to classify fair value measurements:
 
 
 
The availability of observable inputs can vary from instrument to instrument and in certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an instrument's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company's transfers in and out of Level 3 are as of the beginning of the reporting period on a quarterly basis.
Effects if Actual Results Differ
As of December 31, 2008, 23% and 1% of our total assets and total liabilities, respectively, represented instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis categorized as Level 3 as of December 31, 2008 represented less than 1% of our total assets and total liabilities. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement of an instrument requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the instrument.
 
Classification and Valuation of Certain Investments
Description
We generally classify our investments in mortgage-backed securities, debt securities and marketable equity securities as either available-for-sale or trading. We have not classified any investments as held-to-maturity. The classification of an investment determines its accounting treatment. Both unrealized and realized gains and losses on trading securities held by our banking subsidiaries are recognized in gain (loss) on loans and securities, net. Securities held by our brokerage subsidiaries are for market-making purposes and gains and losses are recorded as principal transactions revenue. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Declines in fair value that we believe to be other-than-temporary are included in gain (loss) on loans and securities, net for our banking and brokerage investments and gain (loss) on sales of investments, net for our corporate investments. We have investments in certain publicly-traded and privately-held companies, which we evaluate for other-than-temporary declines in market value. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we recognized $96.2 million, $168.7 million and $2.8 million, respectively, of losses from other-than-temporary declines in market value related to our investments.
Judgments
The fair value hierarchy established in SFAS No. 157 requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
Mortgage-backed securities backed by U.S. Government sponsored and federal agencies include to be announced ("TBA") securities and mortgage pass-through certificates. The fair value of mortgage-backed securities backed by U.S. Government sponsored and federal agencies is determined using quoted market prices, recent market transactions and spread data for similar instruments. Mortgage-backed securities backed by U.S. Government sponsored and federal agencies are generally categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
CMOs, generally non-agency mortgage-backed securities, are typically valued using market observable data, when available, including recent external market transactions for similar instruments. We also utilized a pricing service to corroborate the market observability of our inputs used in the fair value measurements. The valuations of CMOs reflect our best estimate of what market participants would consider in pricing the financial instruments. We consider the price transparency for these financial instruments to be a key determinant of the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value. Due to the limited activity and low level of transparency around inputs to their valuation, a portion of these securities are classified as Level 3 even though we believe that Level 2 inputs could likely be obtainable in a more active market.
We also make estimates about the timing for recognizing losses in the consolidated statement of income (loss) based on market conditions and other factors. Management uses judgment to estimate the future cash flows associated with each security held at a loss and to assess the probability of collecting those cash flows. Management uses a qualitative and quantitative risk approach to evaluate each security held at a loss, which includes assessing underlying collateral characteristics to determine if there has been an adverse change in the amount or timing of the estimated future cash flows, which would indicate other-than-temporary impairment. The Company recognizes an impairment charge by writing the amortized cost basis of the security down to its fair market value when the Company believes that there has been a probable adverse change in the estimated future cash flows of the security. We assess securities for impairment at each reported balance sheet date.
Effects if Actual Results Differ
In general, level classification transfers in and out of Level 3 during the year ended December 31, 2008 were driven by changes in price transparency in the CMO market throughout the year. Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2008 include $3.9 million of CMOs classified as Level 2 on January 1, 2008. While the Company's fair value estimates of Level 3 instruments as of December 31, 2008 utilized observable inputs where available, the valuation included significant management judgment in determining the relevance and reliability of
 
market information considered and the financial instruments were therefore classified as Level 3. The Company recorded a $118.8 million loss in other comprehensive loss during the year ended December 31, 2008 on CMOs classified as Level 3 as of December 31, 2008. The Company recorded a $1.0 million loss in other comprehensive loss during the year ended December 31, 2008 related to CMOs classified as Level 2 on January 1, 2008 and Level 3 as of December 31, 2008. Of the $95.0 million impairment recorded for the year ended December 31, 2008 related to the CMO portfolio, $93.6 million related to CMOs classified as Level 3 as of January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2008.
Determining if a security is other-than-temporarily impaired is complex and requires judgment by management about circumstances that are inherently uncertain. In particular, these estimates require management to estimate the amount and timing of credit losses on the underlying loans supporting the security. Subsequent evaluations of these securities, in light of factors then prevailing, may result in additional impairment in future periods. If all securities with fair values lower than amortized cost were impaired, we would record a pre-tax loss of $439.9 million.
Accounting for Financial Derivatives
Description
We enter into derivative transactions to reduce the risk of market price or interest rate movements on the value of certain assets, liabilities and future cash flows. Accounting for derivatives differs significantly depending on whether a derivative is designated as a hedge. In order to qualify for hedge accounting treatment, documentation must indicate the intention to designate the derivative as a hedge of a specific asset or liability or a future cash flow. Effectiveness of the hedge must be monitored over the life of the derivative.
The majority of derivative transactions we entered into as of December 31, 2008 were cash flow hedges. These hedges, which include a combination of interest rate swaps, forward-starting swaps and purchased options on caps and floors, are used primarily to reduce the variability of future cash flows associated with existing variable-rate liabilities and assets and forecasted issuances of liabilities.
These cash flow hedge relationships are treated as effective hedges as long as the future issuances of liabilities remain probable and the hedges continue to meet the requirements of SFAS No. 133, as amended. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that hedge cash flows associated with repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and home equity lines of credit are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss as unrealized gains or losses, for both active and terminated hedges. As of December 31, 2008, we had an unrealized pre-tax loss reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $671.3 million related to cash flow hedges.
Judgments
If the derivatives in these cash flow hedge relationships are determined to be effective hedges, the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss are included in operating interest expense or operating interest income as a yield adjustment during the same periods in which the related interest on the hedged item affects earnings. If the derivatives are determined not to be effective hedges, the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss would be reclassified into the gain (loss) on loans and securities, net line item in the consolidated statement of income (loss).
The majority of cash flow hedge relationships are hedges of the potential change in cash flows associated with the forecasted issuance of debt. In order to be considered an effective hedge, the forecasted issuance of debt must be considered probable as of the balance sheet date. The future issuance of this debt, including repurchase agreements, is largely dependent on the market demand and liquidity in the wholesale borrowings market.
As of December 31, 2008, we believe the forecasted issuance of all debt in cash flow hedge relationships is probable. However, unexpected changes in market conditions in future periods could impact our ability to issue
 
this debt. We believe the forecasted issuance of debt in the form of repurchase agreements is most susceptible to an unexpected change in market conditions.
Effects if Actual Results Differ
If our hedging strategies were to become significantly ineffective or our assumptions about the nature and timing of forecasted transactions were to be inaccurate, we could no longer apply hedge accounting and our reported results would be significantly affected.
In particular, if we determined that the forecasted issuance of debt associated with our cash flow hedges was no longer probable, the $671.3 million pre-tax loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss would be reclassified into the gain (loss) on loans and securities, net line item in the consolidated statement of income (loss) in the period in which this determination was made. This loss would have a material adverse effect on the regulatory capital position at E*TRADE Bank and our results of operations.
Estimates of Effective Tax Rates, Deferred Taxes and Valuation Allowances
Description
In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we calculate our income tax expense (benefit) based on our interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. This requires us to estimate our current tax obligations and the realizability of uncertain tax positions and to assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, the net amount of which we show as other assets or other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. We must also assess the likelihood that each of our deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is not , we establish a valuation allowance. When we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a reporting period, we generally record a corresponding tax expense in our consolidated statement of income (loss). Conversely, to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary, that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed, which generally reduces our overall income tax expense. At December 31, 2008 we had net deferred tax assets of $1.0 billion, net of a valuation allowance (on state and foreign country deferred tax assets) of $127.7 million. At December 31, 2007 we had net deferred tax assets of $550.2 million, net of a valuation allowance (on state and foreign country deferred tax assets) of $91.8 million.
more likely than not
Judgments
Management must make significant judgments to determine our provision for income tax expense (benefit), our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax assets. Changes in our estimate of these taxes occur periodically due to changes in the tax rates, changes in our business operations, implementation of tax planning strategies, the expiration of relevant statutes of limitations, resolution with taxing authorities of uncertain tax positions and newly enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance. These changes in judgment as well as differences between our estimates and actual amount of taxes ultimately due, when they occur, affect accrued taxes and can be material to our operating results for any particular reporting period.
The most significant tax related judgment made by management was the determination of whether to provide for a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. During the year ended December 31, 2008 we did not provide for a valuation allowance against our federal deferred tax assets. We are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and record a charge to income if we determine, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
We did not establish a valuation allowance against our federal deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2008 as we believe that it is more likely than not that all of these assets will be realized. Our evaluation focused on
 
identifying significant, objective evidence that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future. We reviewed the estimated future taxable income for our trading and investing and balance sheet management segments separately and determined that our net operating losses in 2007 and 2008 were due solely to the credit losses in our balance sheet management segment. We believe these losses were caused by the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets which significantly impacted our asset-backed securities portfolio and our home equity loan portfolios in 2007 and continued to generate credit losses in 2008. We estimate that these credit losses will continue in future periods; however, we ceased the business activities which we believe are the root cause of these losses. Therefore, while we do expect credit losses to continue in future periods, we do expect these amounts to decline when compared to our credit losses in 2007 and 2008. Our trading and investing segment generated substantial book taxable income for each of the last six years and we estimate that it will continue to generate taxable income in future periods at a level sufficient enough to generate taxable income for the Company as a whole. We consider this to be significant, objective evidence that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future.
Our analysis of the need for a valuation allowance recognizes that we are in a cumulative book taxable loss position as of the three-year period ended December 31, 2008, which is considered significant, objective evidence that we may not be able to realize some portion of our deferred tax assets in the future. However, we believe we are able to rely on our forecasts of future taxable income and overcome the uncertainty created by the cumulative loss position.
Effects if Actual Results Differ
Changes in our tax expense (benefit) due to the actual effective tax rates differing from our estimates, when they occur, affect accrued taxes and can be material to our operating results for any particular reporting period.
In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets, we estimated future taxable income based on management approved forecasts. This process required significant judgment by management about matters that are by nature uncertain. If future events differ significantly from our current forecasts, a valuation allowance may need to be established, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and our regulatory capital position at E*TRADE Bank. In addition, a significant portion of the net deferred tax asset relates to a $2.3 billion federal tax loss carryforward, the utilization of which may be further limited in the event of certain material changes in the ownership of the Company. As of December 31, 2008, we had net deferred tax assets of $1.0 billion.
Valuation of Goodwill and Other Intangibles
Description
We review goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually and whenever events or changes indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with SFAS No. 142. Our recorded goodwill at December 31, 2008 was $1.9 billion, and we will continue to evaluate it for impairment at least annually. Our recorded intangible assets net of amortization at December 31, 2008 were $386.1 million, which have useful lives between five and thirty years.
Judgments
In connection with our annual impairment test of goodwill, we concluded that the goodwill was not impaired. We recognize that as of December 31, 2008, our market capitalization was significantly less than the amount of goodwill recorded on our books. We believe this condition is due to the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets which has significantly impacted the value of our loan portfolio assumed within our market capitalization. The value of this portfolio is contained in the balance sheet management segment. The goodwill for the balance sheet management business was written off in entirety in the fourth quarter of 2007. The vast majority of the goodwill remaining on our balance sheet is connected to our retail brokerage business, which is a reporting unit in the trading and investing segment. Our evaluation indicates that this unit has a fair value far in excess of the goodwill assigned to it.
 
Effects if Actual Results Differ
If our estimates of goodwill fair value change due to changes in our businesses or other factors, we may determine that an impairment charge is necessary. Estimates of fair value are determined based on a complex model using cash flows and company comparisons. If management's estimates of future cash flows are inaccurate, the fair value determined could be inaccurate and impairment not recognized in a timely manner. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. If changes in the estimated underlying revenues occur, impairment or a change in the remaining life may need to be recognized.
Valuation and Expensing of Share-Based Payments
Description
We value and expense employee share-based payments, which is primarily stock options, in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R). We value each granted option using an option pricing model using assumptions that match the characteristics of the granted options. We then assume a forfeiture rate that is used to calculate each period's compensation expense attributed to these options.
Judgments
We estimate the value of employee stock options using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. Assumptions necessary for the calculation of fair value include expected term and expected volatility. These assumptions are management's best estimate of the characteristics of the options. Additionally, forfeiture rates are estimated based on prior option vesting experience.
Effects if Actual Results Differ
If our estimates of employees' forfeiture rates are not correct at the end of the term of the option, we will record either additional expense or a reduction in expense in the period it completely vests. This adjustment may be material to the period in which it is recorded. In addition, option fair value is based on estimates of volatility determined by us. Many methods are available to determine volatility, so the determination is subjective. Applying a different method to determine volatility could impact earnings. A 10% change in volatility would increase or decrease stock option fair value by approximately 7%. A change in fair value would affect all amortization periods.

Interest Rates and Operating Interest Differential
Increases and decreases in operating interest income and operating interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of enterprise interest-earning assets and liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates (rate). The following table shows the effect that these factors had on the interest earned on our enterprise interest-earning assets and the interest incurred on our enterprise interest-bearing liabilities. The effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in volume by the previous year's average yield/cost. Similarly, the effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in average yield/cost by the previous year's volume. Changes applicable to both volume and rate have been allocated proportionately (dollars in thousands):

Borrowings
Deposits represent our most significant source of funding. In addition, we borrow from the FHLB and sell securities under repurchase agreements.
We are a member of, and own capital stock in, the FHLB system. The FHLB provides us with reserve credit capacity and authorizes us to apply for advances based on the security of pledged home mortgages and other assetsprincipally securities that are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the U.S. Governmentprovided we meet certain creditworthiness standards. At December 31, 2008, our outstanding advances from the FHLB totaled $3.9 billion at interest rates ranging from 1.43% to 5.56% and at a weighted-average rate of 4.15%.
We also raise funds by selling securities under agreements to repurchase the same securities. The counterparties to these agreements hold the securities in custody. We treat repurchase agreements as borrowings and secure them with designated fixed- and variable-rate securities. We also participate in the Federal Reserve Bank's term investment option and treasury, tax and loan borrowing programs. We use the proceeds from these transactions to meet our cash flow or asset/liability matching needs.
The following table sets forth information regarding the weighted-average interest rates and the highest and average month-end balances of our borrowings (dollars in thousands):

Operating margin
Percentage of net revenue that goes to income before other income (expense), income tax expense (benefit), minority interest, discontinued operations and cumulative effect of accounting change. It is calculated by dividing our income before other income (expense), income tax expense (benefit), minority interest, discontinued operations and cumulative effect of accounting change by our total net revenue.
Operating margin (%)
An adjustable-rate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the option to make a fully-amortizing, interest-only, or minimum payment each month. The minimum payment on an Option ARM loan is usually based on the interest rate charged during the introductory period. This introductory rate is usually significantly below the fully-indexed rate for loans with short duration introductory periods.

The operating interest income earned on certain assets is completely or partially exempt from federal and/or state income tax. As such, these tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than a taxable investment. To provide more meaningful comparison of yields and margins for all interest-earning assets, the interest income earned on tax exempt assets is increased to make it fully equivalent to interest income on other taxable investments. This adjustment is done for the analytic purposes in the net enterprise interest income/spread calculation and is not made on the consolidated statement of income (loss), as that is not permitted under GAAP.
Taxable equivalent interest adjustment
Adjusted equity capital used in the calculation of capital adequacy ratios at E*TRADE Bank as required by the OTS. Tier 1 capital equals: total shareholder's equity at E*TRADE Bank, plus/(less) unrealized losses (gains) on available-for-sale securities and cash flow hedges, less deferred tax assets, goodwill and certain other intangible assets.

MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
The management of E*TRADE Financial Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. E*TRADE Financial Corporation's internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company's management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company's board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that:
 
 
 
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
E*TRADE Financial Corporation's management assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in "Internal ControlIntegrated Framework." Based on management's assessment, management believes as of December 31, 2008, that E*TRADE Financial Corporation's internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
E*TRADE Financial Corporation's Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued an audit report regarding E*TRADE Financial Corporation's internal control over financial reporting. The report of Deloitte & Touche LLP appears on the next page.
 
REPORTS OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
E*TRADE Financial Corporation
Arlington, Virginia
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of E*TRADE Financial Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on the criteria established in issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2008 of the Company and our report dated February 26, 2009 (May 14, 2009 as to Note 24) expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and included explanatory paragraphs regarding the Company's adoption of new accounting standards and a change in its Segment Information.

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
E*TRADE Financial Corporation
Arlington, Virginia
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of E*TRADE Financial Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of income (loss), comprehensive income (loss), shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of E*TRADE Financial Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 48, , as of January 1, 2007. The Company also adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 157, , and SFAS No. 159, , on January 1, 2008.

NOTE 1ORGANIZATION, BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
E*TRADE Financial Corporation is a financial services company that provides online brokerage and related products and services primarily to individual investors under the brand "E*TRADE Financial." Our products and services include investor-focused banking, primarily sweep deposits and savings products and asset gathering. The Company's most significant subsidiaries are described below:
Organization
 
 
 
 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. Entities in which the Company holds at least a 20% ownership or in which there are other indicators of significant influence are generally accounted for by the equity method. Entities in which the Company holds less than 20% ownership and does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are generally carried at cost. Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The Company evaluates investments including joint ventures, low income housing tax credit partnerships and other limited partnerships to determine if the Company is required to consolidate the entities under the guidance of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 46 revised, ("FIN 46R").
Basis of Presentation
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities-an interpretation of ARB No. 51
Certain prior period items in these consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. As discussed in Note 3Discontinued Operations, the operations of certain businesses have been accounted for as discontinued operations in accordance with the SFAS No. 144. Accordingly, results of operations from prior periods have been reclassified to discontinued operations. Unless noted, discussions herein pertain to the Company's continuing operations. These consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.
The Company reports corporate interest income and corporate interest expense separately from operating interest income and operating interest expense. The Company believes reporting these two items separately provides a clearer picture of the financial performance of the Company's operations than would a presentation that combined these two items. Operating interest income and operating interest expense is generated from the operations of the Company. Corporate debt, which is the primary source of the corporate interest expense, has been issued primarily in connection with the Citadel Investment and past acquisitions, such as Harris and BrownCo.
direct
Similarly, the Company reports gain (loss) on sales of investments, net separately from gain (loss) on loans and securities, net. The Company believes reporting these two items separately provides a clearer picture of the financial performance of its operations than would a presentation that combined these two items. Gain (loss) on loans and securities, net is the result of activities in the Company's operations, namely its balance sheet
 
management segment, including impairment on its available-for-sale mortgage-backed and investment securities portfolio. Gain (loss) on sales of investments, net relates to historical equity investments of the Company at the corporate level and are not related to the ongoing business of the Company's operating subsidiaries.
During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company re-defined the line item "Total net revenue" by removing "Provision for loan losses" and separately stating it as its own line item and reclassified hedge ineffectiveness recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 133, as amended, from "Other operating expense" to the "Gain (loss) on loans and securities, net" line item on the consolidated statement of income (loss).
New Income Statement Reporting Format
The consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes for the periods presented. Actual results could differ from management's estimates. Material estimates in which management believes near-term changes could reasonably occur include allowance for loan losses; fair value measurements; classification and valuation of certain investments; accounting for financial derivatives; estimates of effective tax rates, deferred taxes and valuation allowances; valuation of goodwill and other intangibles; and valuation and expensing of share-based payments.
Use of Estimates
On November 29, 2007, the Company entered into an agreement to receive a $2.5 billion cash infusion from Citadel. In consideration for the cash infusion, Citadel received three primary items: substantially all of the Company's asset-backed securities portfolio (approximately $3.0 billion in amortized cost), 84.7 million shares of common stock

The items in this transaction were negotiated at arms length and transacted simultaneously and in contemplation of one another. As a result, the $2.5 billion in proceeds were allocated to each item based on their relative fair values at the time of the transaction.
The key components of the Company's accounting for this transaction were as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
Below are descriptions and accounting policies for the Company's financial statement categories.
Financial Statement Descriptions and Related Accounting Policies
For the purpose of reporting cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments with original or remaining maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase that are not required to be segregated under federal or other regulations to be cash and equivalents. Cash and equivalents are composed of interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, funds due from banks and federal funds. Cash and equivalents included $2.7 billion and $54.2 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, of overnight cash deposits that the Company is required to maintain with the Federal Reserve Bank.
Cash and Equivalents
Cash and investments required to be segregated under federal or other regulations consist primarily of interest-bearing cash accounts. Certain cash balances, related to collateralized financing transactions by the Company's brokerage subsidiaries, are required to be segregated for the exclusive benefit of the Company's brokerage customers.
Cash and Investments Required to be Segregated Under Federal or Other Regulations
Trading securities are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term and are carried at estimated fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on securities classified as trading held by the Bank are included in the gain (loss) of loans and securities, net line item and are derived using the specific identification method. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading securities held by broker-dealers are recorded in the principal transactions line item and are also derived by the specific identification method.
Trading Securities
The Company classified its debt securities, mortgage-backed securities and marketable equity securities as either trading or available-for-sale. None of the Company's mortgage-backed or investment securities were classified as held-to-maturity at December 31, 2008 or 2007.
Available-for-Sale Mortgage-Backed and Investment Securities
Available-for-sale securities consist of mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, publicly traded equity securities and other debt securities. Securities classified as available-for-sale are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax. As of January 1, 2008, the Company adopted SFAS No. 157 for the fair value measurement of available-for-sale mortgage-backed and investment securities. Realized and unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities, except for publicly traded equity securities, are computed using the specific identification method. Amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the life of the security. Realized gains and losses and declines in fair value judged to be other-than-temporary are included in gain (loss) on loans and securities, net; other amounts relating to corporate investments are included in gain (loss) on sales of investments, net line item in the consolidated statement of income (loss). Interest earned is included in operating interest income for banking and balance sheet management operations or corporate interest income for corporate investments.
Available-for-sale securities that have an unrealized loss are evaluated for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 115. Management uses judgment to estimate the future cash flows associated with each security held at a loss and to assess the probability of collecting those cash flows. Management uses a qualitative and quantitative risk approach to evaluate each security held at a loss, which includes assessing underlying collateral characteristics to determine if there has been an adverse change in the amount or timing of the estimated future cash flows, which would indicate other-than-temporary impairment. The Company recognizes an impairment charge by writing the amortized cost basis of the security down to its fair market value when the Company believes that there has been a probable adverse change in the estimated future cash flows of the security. When it is determined that a security has other-than-temporary impairment, the Company recognizes an impairment charge in the gain (loss) on loans and securities, net line item in the consolidated statement of income (loss). Subsequent to the sale of the asset-backed securities portfolio in 2007, the Company no longer holds a significant
 
number of securities that were rated below "AA" at the time of purchase and are subject to Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") 99-20, ("EITF 99-20").
Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets
Margin receivables represent credit extended to customers and non-customers to finance their purchases of securities by borrowing against securities they currently own. Receivables from non-customers represent credit extended to principal officers and directors of the Company to finance their purchase of securities by borrowing against securities owned by them. Margin receivables to the Company's principal officers totaled less than $0.1 million for both December 31, 2008 and 2007. Securities owned by customers and non-customers are held as collateral for amounts due on the margin receivables, the value of which is not reflected in the consolidated balance sheet. In many cases, the Company is permitted to sell or re-pledge these securities held as collateral and use the securities to enter into securities lending transactions, to collateralize borrowings or for delivery to counterparties to cover customer short positions. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of securities that the Company received as collateral in connection with margin receivables and stock borrowing activities, where the Company is permitted to sell or re-pledge the securities, was approximately $3.8 billion. Of this amount, $1.0 billion had been pledged or sold at December 31, 2008 in connection with securities loans, bank borrowings and deposits with clearing organizations.
Margin Receivables
Loans, net consists of loans that are held-for-sale and real estate and consumer loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity, also known as loans held for investment. Loans that are held for investment are carried at amortized cost adjusted for charge-offs, net, allowance for loan losses, deferred fees or costs on originated loans and unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans. Loan fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred and the net fee or cost is recognized in operating interest income using the interest method over the contractual life of the loans. Premiums and discounts on purchased loans are amortized or accreted into income using the interest method over the remaining period to contractual maturity and adjusted for actual prepayments. The Company classifies loans as nonperforming when full and timely collection of interest or principal becomes uncertain or when they are 90 days past due. Interest previously accrued, but not collected, is reversed against current income when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status and is considered nonperforming. Accretion of deferred fees is discontinued for nonperforming loans. Payments received on nonperforming loans are recognized as interest income when the loan is considered collectible and applied to principal when it is doubtful that full payment will be collected. The Company's policy for one- to four-family loan charge-offs prior to January 1, 2008 was to charge-off to the extent that the carrying value of the loan exceeds the estimated net realizable value of the underlying collateral at the time of foreclosure. For home equity loans, the Company's policy prior to January 1, 2008 was to charge-off at time of foreclosure or when the loan has been delinquent for 180 days. As of January 1, 2008, the Company adjusted its charge-off policy mainly for loans in the process of foreclosure. The updated policy for both one- to four-family and home equity loans is to assess the value of the property when the loans has been delinquent for 180 days or it is in bankruptcy, regardless of whether or not the property is in foreclosure, and charge-off the amount of the loan balance in excess of the estimated current property value. Credit cards are charged-off when collection is not probable or the loan has been delinquent for 180 days. Consumer loans are charged-off when the loan has been delinquent for 120 days or when it is determined that collection is not probable.
Loans, Net
The allowance for loan losses is management's estimate of credit losses inherent in the Company's loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The estimate of the allowance is based on a variety of factors, including the composition and quality of the portfolio; delinquency levels and trends; probable expected losses for the next twelve months; current and historical charge-off and loss experience; current industry charge-off and loss experience; the condition of the real estate market and geographic concentrations within the loan portfolio; the interest rate climate; the overall availability of housing credit; and general economic conditions. Determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for loan losses in future periods. In general, the allowance for loan losses should be at least equal to twelve months of projected
Allowance for Loan Losses
 
losses for all loan types. Management believes this level is representative of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. Loan losses are charged and recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses.
Property and equipment are carried at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, generally three to ten years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or lease terms. Buildings are depreciated over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or forty years. Land is carried at cost. Technology development costs are charged to operations as incurred. Technology development costs include costs incurred in the development and enhancement of software used in connection with services provided by the Company that do not otherwise qualify for capitalization treatment as internally developed software costs in accordance with Statement of Position ("SOP") 98-1,
Property and Equipment, Net
Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use.
In accordance with SOP 98-1, the cost of internally developed software is capitalized and included in property and equipment at the point at which the conceptual formulation, design and testing of possible software project alternatives are complete and management authorizes and commits to funding the project. The Company does not capitalize pilot projects and projects where it believes that future economic benefits are less than probable. Internally developed software costs include the cost of software tools and licenses used in the development of the Company's systems, as well as specifically identified payroll and consulting costs.
Goodwill and other intangibles, net represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired through the Company's business combinations. The Company tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on at least an annual basis or when certain events occur. The Company evaluates the remaining useful lives of other intangible assets with finite lives each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization.
Goodwill and Other Intangibles, Net
Servicing rights are recognized when the Company sells a loan and retains the related servicing rights. In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156 ("SFAS No. 156"). This statement establishes, among other things, the accounting for all separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities. The Company adopted this statement on January 1, 2007 and the impact was not material to the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. As of January 1, 2008, the Company elected to account for servicing rights under the fair value measurement method. The transition adjustment to opening retained earnings as of January 1, 2008 related to the fair value measurement election was $0.3 million.
Servicing Rights
, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets
Included in the other assets line item in the consolidated balance sheet is real estate acquired through foreclosure and repossessed consumer assets. Real estate properties acquired through foreclosures, commonly referred to as REO and repossessed assets, are recorded at the lower of its carrying value or fair value, less estimated selling costs.
Real Estate Owned and Repossessed Assets
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, ("SFAS No. 109")which prescribes the use of the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax asset or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets when it is that a portion or all of a given deferred tax asset will not be realized. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, income tax expense includes (i) deferred tax expense, which generally represents the net change in the deferred tax asset or liability balance during the year plus any change in valuation allowances and (ii) current tax expense, which represents the amount of tax currently payable to or receivable from a taxing authority. Uncertain tax positions are only recognized to the extent they satisfy the criteria under FASB Interpretation No. 48, ("FIN 48"), which states that an uncertain tax position must be more likely than not of being sustained upon examination. The amount of tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than fifty percent likely of being sustained on ultimate settlement of an uncertain tax position.

Securities sold under agreements to repurchase similar securities, also known as repurchase agreements, are collateralized by fixed- and variable-rate mortgage-backed securities or investment grade securities. Repurchase agreements are treated as secured borrowings for financial statement purposes and the obligations to repurchase securities sold are reflected as such in the consolidated balance sheet.
Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase
Customer payables to customers and non-customers represent credit balances in customer accounts arising from deposits of funds and sales of securities and other funds pending completion of securities transactions. The Company pays interest on certain customer payables balances.
Customer Payables
The Company accounted for its mandatory convertible debt by allocating the proceeds using the relative fair value of the stock purchase contracts and the debt securities on the date of issuance. The issue costs were deferred and allocated to the debt securities and the stock purchase contracts based on their relative fair values at issuance date. The portion of issuance costs allocated to the debt was amortized to corporate interest expense over the life of the debt using the interest method. In 2008, the Company retired the entire $450 million principal amount of the mandatory convertible notes with the issuance of 25 million shares of common stock at $18 per share (the mandatory conversion price).
Mandatory Convertible Debt
Assets and liabilities of consolidated subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars, the functional currency of the Company, using the exchange rate in effect at each period end. Revenues and expenses are translated at the weighted average exchange rate during the period. The effects of foreign currency translation adjustments arising from differences in exchange rates from period to period are deferred and included in accumulated other comprehensive loss for subsidiaries whose functional currency is their local currency. Currency transaction gains or losses, derived on monetary assets and liabilities stated in a currency other than the functional currency, are recognized in current operations and have not been significant to the Company's operating results in any period.
Foreign Currency Translation
The Company's comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of net income (loss), foreign currency translation gains (losses), unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities and the effective portion of the unrealized gains (losses) on financial derivatives in cash flow hedge relationships, net of reclassification adjustments and related tax.
Comprehensive Income (Loss)
Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock.
Earnings (Loss) Per Share
The Company enters into derivative transactions to hedge against the risk of market price or interest rate movements on the value of certain assets, liabilities and future cash flows. The Company must also recognize certain contracts and commitments as derivatives, whether freestanding or embedded, when the characteristics of those contracts and commitments meet the definition of a derivative promulgated by SFAS No. 133as amended.
Financial Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
,
Each derivative is recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as a freestanding asset or liability. Financial derivative instruments in hedging relationships that mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of assets or liabilities are considered fair value hedges under SFAS No. 133, as amended. Financial derivative instruments designated in hedging relationships that mitigate the exposure to the variability in expected future cash flows or other forecasted transactions are considered cash flow hedges. The Company formally documents at inception all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items and the risk management objective and strategy for each hedge transaction. For financial statement purposes, the Company's policy is to not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments and fair value amounts related to collateral arrangements under master netting arrangements.
 
Fair value hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the financial derivative instrument and the change in fair value of the asset or liability being hedged on the consolidated balance sheet with the net difference, or hedge ineffectiveness, reported as fair value adjustments of financial derivatives in the gain (loss) on loans and securities, net line item in the consolidated statement of income (loss). Cash payments or receipts and related accruals during the reporting period on derivatives included in fair value hedge relationships are recorded as an adjustment to interest income on the hedged asset or liability. If a financial derivative in a fair value hedging relationship is no longer effective, de-designated from its hedging relationship or terminated, the Company discontinues fair value hedge accounting for the derivative and the hedged item. Changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments no longer designated in an accounting hedge relationship are recorded in the gain (loss) on loans and securities, net, line item in the consolidated statement of income (loss). The accumulated adjustment of the carrying amount of the hedged interest-earning asset or liability is recognized in earnings as an adjustment to interest income over the expected remaining life of the asset using the effective interest method.
Cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the financial derivative instrument as either a freestanding asset or a freestanding liability in the consolidated balance sheet, with the effective portion of the change in fair value of the financial derivative recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax in the consolidated balance sheet. Amounts are then included in net operating interest income as a yield adjustment in the same period the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the financial derivative is reported as fair value adjustments of financial derivatives in the gain (loss) on loans and securities, net line item in the consolidated statement of income (loss). If it becomes probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will not occur, amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the specific hedging instruments are reported in the gain (loss) on loans and securities, net line item in the consolidated statement of income (loss). If a financial derivative ceases to be highly effective as a hedge, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively and the financial derivative instrument continues to be recorded at fair value with changes in fair value being reported in the gain (loss) on loans and securities, net line item in the consolidated statement of income (loss).
Derivative gains and losses that are not held as accounting hedges are recognized in the gain (loss) on loans and securities, net line item in the consolidated statement of income (loss) as these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133, as amended.
Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted SFAS No. 157 which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company determines the fair value of its financial instruments and for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis in accordance with SFAS No. 157. The Company will not adopt certain provisions of this statement until January 1, 2009 as they relate to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. Examples of assets and liabilities for which the Company has not applied the provisions of SFAS No. 157 include reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets measured at fair value in impairment tests under SFAS No. 142, nonfinancial long-lived assets measured at fair value for an impairment assessment under SFAS No. 144, as well as nonfinancial liabilities for exit or disposal activities initially measured at fair value under SFAS No. 146. See Note 6Fair Value Disclosures.

Effective January 1, 2008, the Company elected to carry investments in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac preferred stock at fair value through earnings under SFAS No. 159. The Company elected to carry the investment in preferred stock at fair value through earnings to allow the Company to economically hedge the portfolio without the burden of complying with SFAS No. 133, as amended. The impact of this adoption was an after-tax decrease to opening retained earnings as of January 1, 2008 of approximately $86.9 million ($134.9 million before taxes). As of December 31, 2007, the Company's investment in preferred stock was reported in the balance sheet line item available-for-sale mortgage-backed and investment securities.

NOTE 2BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
The Company did not complete any business combinations in 2008 or 2007. On August 1, 2006, the Company completed its acquisition of RAA, a Dallas, Texas-based investment advisor managing over $1 billion in assets. The aggregate purchase price of approximately $24.9 million included $19.8 million, or 0.8 million shares, in common stock issued and $5.1 million in cash. At acquisition, the purchase price included approximately $0.1 million in net assets acquired, $9.5 million in customer list and other intangibles and $1.6 million held in escrow, with the remaining $13.7 million recorded as goodwill. The purchase price has been allocated to the net assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The results of operations of each are included in the Company's consolidated statement of income from the date of the acquisition.
The Company subsequently sold RAA in 2008. The sale of RAA did not qualify as a discontinued operation. For additional information, see Note 4Facility Restructuring and Other Exit Activities.
 
NOTE 3DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
In 2008, the Company sold its Canadian brokerage business and exited its direct retail lending business. In 2006, the Company completed the sale of E*TRADE Professional Trading, LLC. Results of operations from these businesses have been reclassified to discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.
Sale of Canadian Brokerage Business
The Company made the decision to sell its Canadian brokerage business and completed the sale to Scotiabank in 2008. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $429.0 million and associated income tax expense of $160.2 million. The Company does not have significant continuing involvement in the Canadian brokerage business, and its operations and cash flows have been eliminated from the ongoing operations of the Company. As a result, the Canadian brokerage business qualifies as a discontinued operation, in accordance with SFAS No. 144. The Company's results of operations, net of income tax, include the Canadian brokerage business as a discontinued operation on the Company's consolidated statement of income (loss) for all periods presented. Prior to the Canadian brokerage business being recorded as a discontinued operation, it was included in the results of operations of both the trading and investing and balance sheet management segments.
The following table summarizes the results of discontinued operations for the Canadian brokerage business (dollars in thousands):
 
Exit of the Direct Retail Lending Business
In 2008, the Company exited its direct retail lending business, which was the Company's last remaining loan origination channel (the Company exited the wholesale mortgage lending business in 2007). As such, the entire direct retail lending business, including the wholesale mortgage lending business, met the requirements under SFAS No. 144 to be recorded and reported as discontinued operations. The operations and cash flows of the direct retail lending business have been eliminated from the ongoing operations of the Company and the Company did not have any significant continuing involvement in the direct retail lending business after its closure. Therefore, the Company's results of operations, net of income tax, include direct retail lending business as a discontinued operation on the Company's consolidated statement of income (loss) for all periods presented. Prior to the direct retail lending business being recorded as a discontinued operation, it was included in the results of operations of the trading and investing segment.

Exit of Non-Core Operations
Institutional Brokerage Operations
In 2007, the Company announced a plan to simplify and streamline the business by exiting and/or restructuring certain non-core operations and took steps to restructure the institutional brokerage business to focus on areas that complement order flow generated by customers. In 2008, the Company announced the decision to exit certain institutional trading operations in the U.S. that do not align with the core business. As a result of these exits, the Company recognized $5.6 million and $9.1 million for facilities consolidation and asset write-off costs, $3.1 million and $7.0 million in severance costs and $1.5 million and $1.0 million of other costs related to these exits for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. All of these charges have been recorded in the balance sheet management segment.
The Company expects to incur charges in future periods as it periodically evaluates the estimates made in connection with this activity; however, the Company does not expect these charges to be significant.
Sale of RAA
In 2008, the Company sold substantially all of the assets of RAA to PHH Investments, Ltd for approximately $25 million. The sale of RAA resulted in a pre-tax gain of $2.8 million, which has been recorded in the trading and investing segment.
Other Exit Activities
In 2007, the Company decided to consolidate and relocate certain of its facilities, which continued into 2008. The Company incurred $21.4 million and $7.5 million of charges for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, primarily related to the exit of certain operating leases. These charges have been recorded in both the balance sheet management and trading and investing segments. Additionally, in 2007 the Company incurred $3.1 million in connection with reorganizing the management structure of the balance sheet management segment, including changing the nature and focus of its operations.
In 2006, the Company decided to relocate certain functions out of the state of California as well as outsource certain clearing operations and costs related to the relocation of certain accounting functions. The Company incurred charges of $0.9 million and $29.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, related to costs for exiting those facilities. The total charge for this exit activity was $30.1 million, all of which has been recorded in the trading and investing segment.
The Company expects to incur charges in future periods as it periodically evaluates the estimates made in connection with this activity; however, the Company does not expect those costs to be significant.

The following table shows the components of operating interest income and operating interest expense from continuing operations (dollars in thousands):
 
NOTE 6FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES
Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted SFAS No. 157 which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company determines the fair value of its financial instruments and for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis in accordance with SFAS No. 157. The Company will not adopt certain provisions of this statement until January 1, 2009 as they relate to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. Examples of assets and liabilities for which the Company has not applied the provisions of SFAS No. 157 include reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets measured at fair value in impairment tests under SFAS No. 142, nonfinancial long-lived assets measured at fair value for an impairment assessment under SFAS No. 144, as well as nonfinancial liabilities for exit or disposal activities initially measured at fair value under SFAS No. 146.
In determining fair value, the Company uses various valuation approaches, including market, income and/or cost approaches. The fair value hierarchy established in SFAS No. 157 requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant. As such, even when market assumptions are not readily available, the Company's own assumptions reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. The standard describes the following three levels used to classify fair value measurements:
 
 
 
The availability of observable inputs can vary from instrument to instrument and in certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an instrument's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement of an instrument requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the instrument.
Recurring Fair Value Measurement Valuation Techniques
The fair value for certain financial instruments is derived using pricing models and other valuation techniques that involve significant management judgment. The price transparency of financial instruments is a key determinant of the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value of the Company's financial instruments. Financial instruments for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available will generally have a higher degree of price transparency than financial instruments that are thinly traded or not quoted. In accordance with SFAS No. 157, the criteria used to determine whether the market for a financial instrument is active or inactive is based on the particular asset or liability. For equity securities, the Company's definition of actively traded was based on average daily volume and other market trading statistics. The Company considered the market for other types of financial instruments, including certain CMOs, to be inactive as of December 31, 2008. As a result, the valuation of these financial instruments included significant management judgment in determining the relevance and reliability of market information available. The Company considered the inactivity of the market to be evidenced by several factors, including decreased price transparency caused by decreased volume of trades relative to historical levels.
Mortgage-backed Securities Backed by U.S. Government Sponsored and Federal Agencies
Mortgage-backed securities backed by U.S. Government sponsored and federal agencies include TBA securities and mortgage pass-through certificates. The fair value of mortgage-backed securities backed by U.S. Government sponsored and federal agencies is determined using quoted market prices, recent market transactions and spread data for similar instruments. Mortgage-backed securities backed by U.S. Government sponsored and federal agencies are generally categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Collateralized Mortgage Obligations
CMOs, generally non-agency mortgage-backed securities, are typically valued using market observable data, when available, including recent external market transactions for similar instruments. The Company also utilized a pricing service to corroborate the market observability of the Company's inputs used in the fair value measurements. The valuations of CMOs reflect the Company's best estimate of what market participants would consider in pricing the financial instruments. The Company considers the price transparency for these financial instruments to be a key determinant of the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value. Due to the limited activity and low level of transparency around inputs to their valuation, a portion of these securities are classified as Level 3 even though the Company believes that Level 2 inputs could likely be obtainable in a more active market.
Investment Securities
As of December 31, 2008, investment securities include municipal bonds and corporate bonds. For municipal bonds, the Company utilized recent market transactions for identical or similar bonds to corroborate
 
pricing service fair value measurements. Municipal bonds are generally categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of corporate bonds is estimated using market price quotes corroborated by recently executed transactions observable in the market. Corporate bonds are generally categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The majority of the Company's derivative financial instruments, interest rate swap and option contracts, are valued with pricing models commonly used by the financial services industry using market observable pricing inputs. The Company does not consider these models to involve significant judgment on the part of management and corroborated the fair value measurements with counterparty valuations. The majority of the Company's derivative financial instruments are categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the consideration of credit risk, the Company's or the counterparty's, did not result in an adjustment to the valuation of its derivative financial instruments.
U.S. Treasuries
The fair value of U.S. Treasuries is based on quoted market prices in active markets. U.S. Treasuries are classified as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
Securities Owned and Securities Sold, Not Yet Purchased
Securities transactions entered into by certain broker-dealer subsidiaries are included in trading securities and securities sold, not yet purchased in the Company's SFAS No. 157 disclosures. The fair value of securities owned and securities sold, not yet purchased is determined using listed or quoted market prices and are generally categorized in Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Servicing Rights
On January 1, 2008, the Company elected to account for servicing rights under the fair value measurement method in accordance with SFAS No. 156. The fair value of the servicing rights is determined using models that include observable inputs, if available. To the extent observable inputs are not available, the Company estimates fair value based on the present value of expected future cash flows using its best estimate of the key assumptions, including anticipated loan prepayments and discount rates. Servicing rights are categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy when unobservable inputs are significant to the fair value measurements.
 
Recurring Fair Value Measurements
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below (dollars in thousands):
 
 
Both observable and unobservable inputs may be used to determine the fair value of positions that the Company has classified within the Level 3 category. As a result, the realized and unrealized gains and losses for assets and liabilities within the Level 3 category presented in the tables below may include changes in fair value that were attributable to both observable and unobservable inputs. The following table presents additional information about Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the year ended December 31, 2008 (dollars in thousands):

Level 3 assets and liabilities include instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. As of December 31, 2008, 23% and 1% of the Company's total assets and total liabilities, respectively, represented instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis categorized as Level 3 as of December 31, 2008 represented less than 1% of the Company's total assets and total liabilities.
In general, level classification transfers in and out of Level 3 during the year ended December 31, 2008 were driven by changes in price transparency in the CMO market throughout the year. The Company's transfers in and out of Level 3 are as of the beginning of the reporting period on a quarterly basis. Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2008 include $3.9 million of CMOs classified as Level 2 on January 1, 2008. While the Company's fair value estimates of Level 3 instruments as of December 31, 2008 utilized observable inputs where available, the valuation included significant management judgment in determining the relevance and reliability of market information considered and the financial instruments were therefore classified as Level 3. The Company recorded a $118.8 million loss in other comprehensive loss during the year ended December 31, 2008 on CMOs classified as Level 3 as of December 31, 2008. The Company recorded a $1.0 million loss in other comprehensive loss during the year ended December 31, 2008 related to CMOs classified as Level 2 on January 1, 2008 and Level 3 as of December 31, 2008. Of the $95.0 million impairment recorded for the year ended December 31, 2008 related to the CMO portfolio, $93.6 million related to CMOs classified as Level 3 as of January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2008.
Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements
The Company also measures certain other financial assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with GAAP. As of December 31, 2008, loans, net included impaired loans with a current value of approximately $360 million that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The majority of the fair value measurements of these loans were based on estimates of the current property value. The Company classified these fair value measurements as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as the valuations included Level 3 inputs that were significant to the estimate of fair value. The adjustments to fair value of these loans resulted in a loss of $132.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments
SFAS No. 107, , requires the disclosure of the estimated fair value of financial instruments. The following disclosure of the estimated fair value of financial instruments, not otherwise disclosed above pursuant to SFAS No. 157, is made by the Company in accordance with SFAS No. 157. Different market assumptions and estimation methodologies could significantly affect estimated fair value amounts.
Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The fair value of financial instruments, not otherwise disclosed above pursuant to SFAS No. 157, whose estimated fair value approximates carrying value is summarized as follows:
 
 
 
The fair value of financial instruments whose estimated fair values were different from their carrying values is summarized below (dollars in thousands):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the normal course of business, the Company makes various commitments to extend credit and incur contingent liabilities that are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheet. Significant changes in the economy or interest rates influence the impact that these commitments and contingencies have on the Company in the future. Information related to such commitments and contingent liabilities is detailed in Note 23Commitments, Contingencies and Other Regulatory Matters.
 
NOTE 7AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MORTGAGE-BACKED AND INVESTMENT SECURITIES
The amortized cost basis and estimated fair values of available-for-sale mortgage-backed and investment securities are shown in the following tables (dollars in thousands):
 
 
Contractual Maturities
The contractual maturities of available-for-sale debt securities, including mortgage-backed and debt securities, at December 31, 2008 are shown below (dollars in thousands):
 
The Company pledged $8.4 billion and $10.1 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, of available-for-sale securities as collateral for federal reserves, repurchase agreements and short-term borrowings.
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment of Investments
The following tables show the fair values and unrealized losses on investments, aggregated by investment category, and the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position (dollars in thousands):
 
 
The Company does not believe that any individual unrealized loss in the available-for-sale portfolio as of December 31, 2008 represents an other-than-temporary impairment. The majority of the unrealized losses on mortgage-backed securities are attributable to changes in interest rates and a re-pricing of risk in the market. Substantially all mortgage-backed securities backed by U.S. Government sponsored and federal agencies are "AAA" rated. Municipal bonds and corporate bonds are evaluated by reviewing the credit-worthiness of the issuer and general market conditions. The Company has the intent and ability to hold the securities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2008 until the market value recovers or the securities mature.
Within the securities portfolio, the asset-backed securities portfolio, which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2007, represented the highest concentration of credit risk. The Company recorded other-than-temporary impairment charges for asset-backed securities of $168.7 million and $1.5 million for years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Subsequent to the sale of that portfolio, the highest concentration of remaining credit risk, while considerably lower than the credit risk inherent in asset-backed securities, is the CMO portfolio. While the majority of this portfolio is AAA-rated, the Company concluded during 2008 that approximately $181.2 million of these securities had a probable risk of future loss as a result of the deterioration in the expected credit performance of the underlying loans in the securities. These securities were written down to their estimated fair market value by recording $95.0 million impairment during the year ended December 31, 2008.
Our intent to hold securities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2008 until the market value recovers or the securities mature was based on the facts and circumstances that existed as of that date. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the "Act") was signed into law on October 3, 2008. This Act grants the Treasury authority to purchase debt securities from financial institutions under the TARP Capital Purchase Program. The administration in place at the Treasury on December 31, 2008 had not utilized this particular authority granted to them in this Act. Therefore, the Company's ability and intent to hold securities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2008 until the market value recovers or the securities mature was based on this fact.
Subsequent to December 31, 2008, a new administration was put in place at the Treasury. On February 10, 2009, this new administration provided a high level outline of its plans to help resolve the credit crisis. As part of this plan, they announced their intentions to create the "Public-Private Investment Fund". They stated that the purpose of this fund will be to purchase both loans and securities from financial institutions allowing them to cleanse their balance sheets of what are often referred to as "legacy" assets. The Company does not yet know enough about the details of this program to determine if it would be of interest to the Company. Therefore the Company cannot make an assessment of whether the Treasury's plans under the Act will impact the Company's intent with respect to these securities and its loans in future periods.
The Company elected the fair value option for its preferred stock under SFAS No. 159 as of January 1, 2008. Subsequent to the adoption, preferred stock was classified as trading securities. As of December 31, 2008, the Company no longer held preferred stock securities as all positions were sold during the year ended December 31, 2008.
The detailed components of the gain (loss) on loans and securities, net and gain (loss) on sales of investments, net line items on the consolidated statement of income (loss) are shown below.
 
Gain (Loss) on Loans and Securities, Net
Gain (loss) on loans and securities, net from continuing operations are as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
Gain (loss) on Sales of Investments, Net
Gain (loss) on sales of investments, net are as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
NOTE 8LOANS, NET
Loans, net are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
 
In addition to these loans, the Company had no commitments to originate, buy or sell loans at December 31, 2008 (see Note 23Commitments, Contingencies and Other Regulatory Matters).
The following table shows the percentage of adjustable and fixed-rate loans in the Company's portfolio (dollars in thousands):
 
 
The weighted-average remaining maturity of mortgage loans secured by one- to four-family residences was 326 and 337 months at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Additionally, all mortgage loans outstanding at December 31, 2008 and 2007 in the held-for-investment portfolio were serviced by other companies.
Activity in the allowance for loan losses is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
During 2008, the allowance for loan losses increased by $572.4 million. This increase was driven primarily by an increase of $374.7 million in the allowance allocated to the home equity loan portfolio, which began to deteriorate during the second half of 2007. During the year ended December, 31 2008, the Company also experienced deterioration in the performance of its one- to four-family loan portfolio.
Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by $811.7 million compared to the same period in 2007. The overall increase was primarily due to higher net charge-offs on home equity loans.
 
We classify loans as nonperforming when they are 90 days past due. The following table provides the breakout of nonperforming loans by type (dollars in thousands):
 
If the Company's nonperforming loans at December 31, 2008 had been performing in accordance with their terms, the Company would have recorded additional interest income of approximately $45.9 million, $19.9 million and $1.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. During 2008, the Company recognized $33.1 million in interest on loans that were in nonperforming status at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, there were no commitments to lend additional funds to any of these borrowers.
In 2007, the Company entered into a CDS on $4.0 billion of its first-lien residential real estate loan portfolio through a synthetic securitization structure. As of December 31, 2008, the balance of the loans covered by the CDS was $2.9 billion. A CDS provides, for a fee, an assumption by a third party of a portion of the credit risk related to the underlying loans. The CDS provides protection for losses in excess of $4.0 million, but not to exceed approximately $30.3 million. In addition, the Company's regulatory risk-weighted assets were reduced as a result of this transaction because the Company transferred a portion of its credit risk to an unaffiliated third party. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company recognized $1.6 million in losses on the portion of the loans covered under the CDS. The Company has not yet realized any recoveries from the CDS; however, the estimated recoveries from the CDS for the next twelve months were $13.9 million at December 31, 2008, which is reflected in the allowance for loan losses.
 
NOTE 9ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
The Company enters into derivative transactions to protect against the risk of market price or interest rate movements on the value of certain assets, liabilities and future cash flows. The Company is also required to recognize certain contracts and commitments as derivatives when the characteristics of those contracts and commitments meet the definition of a derivative as promulgated by SFAS No. 133, as amended.
Fair Value Hedges
The Company uses a combination of interest rate swaps, forward-starting swaps and purchased options on swaps to offset its exposure to changes in value of certain fixed-rate assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recognized currently in earnings. To the extent that the hedge is ineffective, the changes in the fair values will not offset and the difference, or hedge ineffectiveness, is reflected in other expense excluding interest in the gain (loss) on loans and securities, net line item in the consolidated statement of income (loss).
The following table summarizes information related to financial derivatives in fair value hedge relationships (dollars in thousands):
 
 
 
 
De-designated Fair Value Hedges
During the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, certain fair value hedges were de-designated; therefore, hedge accounting was discontinued during those periods. The net gain or loss on the underlying transactions being hedged is amortized to operating interest expense or operating interest income over the original forecasted period at the time of de-designation. Changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments after de-designation of fair value hedge accounting are recorded in the gain (loss) on loans and securities, net line item in the consolidated statement of income (loss).
Cash Flow Hedges
The Company uses a combination of interest rate swaps, forward-starting swaps and purchased options on caps and floors to hedge the variability of future cash flows associated with existing variable-rate liabilities and assets and forecasted issuances of liabilities. These cash flow hedge relationships are treated as effective hedges as long as the future issuances of liabilities remain probable and the hedges continue to meet the requirements of SFAS No. 133, as amended. The future issuance of these liabilities, including securities sold under agreements to repurchase, are largely dependent on the market demand and liquidity in the wholesale borrowings market. Additionally, the Company enters into forward purchase and sale agreements, which are considered cash flow hedges, when the terms of the commitments exactly match the terms of the securities purchased or sold.
As of December 31, 2008, the Company believes the forecasted issuance of all debt in cash flow hedge relationships is probable. However, unexpected changes in market conditions in future periods could impact the ability to issue this debt. The Company believes the forecasted issuance of debt in the form of repurchase agreements is most susceptible to an unexpected change in market conditions.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that hedge cash flows associated with repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and home equity lines of credit are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss as unrealized gains or losses, for both active and terminated hedges. If the derivatives are determined to be effective hedges, the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss are included in operating interest expense or operating interest income as a yield adjustment during the same periods in which the related interest on the funding affects earnings. If the derivatives are determined not to be effective hedges, the amount recorded in other comprehensive income would be reclassified into the gain (loss) on loans and securities, net line item in the consolidated statement of income (loss). During the upcoming twelve months, the Company expects to include a pre-tax amount of approximately $96 million of net unrealized loss that are currently reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss in operating interest expense as a yield adjustment in the same periods in which the related items affect earnings.
 
The following table summarizes information related to the Company's financial derivatives in cash flow hedge relationships, hedging variable-rate assets and liabilities and the forecasted issuances of liabilities (dollars in thousands):
 
 
Under SFAS No. 133, as amended, the Company is required to record the fair value of gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheet. In addition, during the normal course of business, the Company terminates certain interest rate swaps and options.
The following tables show: 1) amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges; 2) the notional amounts and fair values of derivatives terminated for the periods presented; and 3) the amortization of terminated interest rate swaps included in operating interest expense and operating interest income (dollars in thousands):
 
 
The gains (losses) accumulated in other comprehensive loss on the derivative instruments terminated shown in the preceding table will be included in operating interest expense and operating interest income over the periods the variable rate liabilities and hedged forecasted issuance of liabilities will affect earnings, ranging from 188 days to approximately 14 years.
The following table shows the balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss attributable to open cash flow hedges and discontinued cash flow hedges (dollars in thousands):
 
The following table shows the balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss attributable to cash flow hedges by type of hedged item (dollars in thousands):
 
Hedge Ineffectiveness
In accordance with SFAS No. 133, as amended, the Company recognizes hedge ineffectiveness on both fair value and cash flow hedge relationships. The amount of ineffectiveness recorded in earnings for cash flow hedges is equal to the excess of the cumulative change in the fair value of the actual derivative over the cumulative change in the fair value of a hypothetical derivative which is created to match the exact terms of the underlying instruments being hedged. These amounts are reflected in the gain (loss) on loans and securities, net line item in the consolidated statement of income (loss). Cash flow and fair value ineffectiveness are re-measured on a quarterly basis. The following table summarizes income (expense) recognized by the Company as fair value and cash flow hedge ineffectiveness (dollars in thousands):
 
Economic Hedges
During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company used equity put options and credit default swaps as economic hedges against potential changes in the value of the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac preferred stock.
 
Derivatives used as economic hedges but not designated in a hedging relationship for accounting purposes are included in derivative assets or derivative liabilities. The mark and interest income or expense on the net hedged position is recognized in gain (loss) on loans and securities, net.
Liability to Lehman Brothers
Prior to Lehman Brothers' declaration of bankruptcy in September 2008, the Bank was a counterparty to interest rate derivative contracts with a subsidiary of Lehman Brothers. Lehman Brothers' declaration of bankruptcy triggered an event of default and early termination under the Bank's International Swap Dealers Association Master Agreement. As of the date of the event of default, the Bank's net amount due to the Lehman Brothers subsidiary was approximately $101 million, the majority of which was collateralized by securities held by or on behalf of the Lehman Brothers subsidiary. The Bank is currently pursuing a settlement of the obligation, including a return of the collateral and payment of cash for the net amount owed to Lehman Brothers.
Credit Risk
Credit risk is an element of the recurring fair value measurements for certain assets and liabilities, including derivative instruments. Credit risk is managed by limiting activity to approved counterparties and setting aggregate exposure limits for each approved counterparty. The Company also monitors collateral requirements on derivative instruments through credit support agreements, which reduce risk by permitting the netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon occurrence of certain events. The Company considered the impact of credit risk on the fair value measurement for derivative instruments, particularly those in net liability positions to counterparties, to be mitigated by the enforcement of credit support agreements, and the collateral requirements therein. The Company pledged approximately $441.4 million of its mortgage-backed securities as collateral related to its derivative contracts.
The Company's credit risk analysis for derivative instruments also considered whether the cost to mitigate the credit loss exposure on derivative instruments in net asset positions would have resulted in material adjustments to the valuations. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the consideration of counterparty credit risk did not result in an adjustment to the valuation of its derivative financial instruments.
While the Company does not expect that any counterparty will fail to perform, the maximum exposure associated with each counterparty to interest rate swaps and purchased interest rate options at December 31, 2008 was $23.8 million, net of derivative liabilities. The exposure was concentrated in two counterparties (Credit Suisse First Boston and Royal Bank of Scotland).
NOTE 10PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NET
Property and equipment, net consists of the following (dollars in thousands):
 
 
 
Depreciation and amortization expense from continuing operations related to property and equipment was $82.5 million, $83.2 million and $71.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Software includes capitalized internally developed software costs. These costs were $65.5 million, $64.1 million and $37.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Completed projects are carried at cost and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, generally four years. Amortization expense from continuing operations for the capitalized amounts was $33.4 million, $27.2 million and $24.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. Also included in software at December 31, 2008 is $54.0 million of internally developed software in the process of development for which amortization has not begun.
NOTE 11GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES, NET
The following table discloses the changes in the carrying value of goodwill that occurred in the trading and investing and balance sheet management segments for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):
 
 
For the year ended December 31, 2008, the changes in the carrying value of goodwill are the result of the Company paying additional purchase consideration in connection with prior acquisitions, offset by write-offs of goodwill related to certain exit activities and discontinued operations (see Note 2Discontinued Operations and Note 3Facility Restructuring and Other Exit Activities for further discussion).
For the year ended December 31, 2007, the changes in the carrying value of goodwill are the result of the Company recognizing an impairment of goodwill related the Company's balance sheet management business. The impairment of goodwill for this business occurred during the fourth quarter of 2007 and was due primarily to the decline in fair value related to the crisis in the residential real-estate and credit markets. The method used for determining the fair value of the balance sheet management business was a combination of prices for comparable businesses and the expected present value of future cash flows of the business. In addition, there was a write-off of goodwill related to certain exit activities. These decreases were slightly offset by purchase accounting adjustments related to earn outs and escrow releases on prior acquisitions that were made by the Company.
 
Other intangible assets with finite lives, which are primarily amortized on an accelerated basis, consist of the following (dollars in thousands):
 
 
Assuming no future impairments of these assets or additional acquisitions, annual amortization expense will be as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
Amortization of other intangibles from continuing operations was $35.7 million, $40.5 million and $46.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
NOTE 12OTHER ASSETS

NOTE 14SECURITIES SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE AND OTHER BORROWINGS
The maturities of borrowings at December 31, 2008 and total borrowings at December 31, 2008 and 2007 are shown below (dollars in thousands):
 
Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase
The Company sells repurchase agreements which are collateralized by fixed- and variable-rate mortgage-backed securities or investment grade securities. Repurchase agreements are treated as secured borrowings for financial statement purposes and obligations to repurchase securities sold are reflected as borrowings in the consolidated balance sheet. The brokers retain possession of the securities collateralizing the repurchase agreements until maturity. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $312.2 million and $268.5 million of collateral in excess of the repurchase agreement liability with Cantor Fitzgerald and Citigroup, respectively. The weighted average maturity of the repurchase agreements with these counterparties was approximately one year and six years for Cantor Fitzgerald and Citigroup, respectively. There were no other counterparties in which the amount of collateral in excess of the repurchase agreement liability exceeded 10% of shareholders' equity.
Below is a summary of repurchase agreements and collateral associated with the repurchase agreements at December 31, 2008 (dollars in thousands):
 
Other Borrowings
The Company had $0.3 billion floating-rate and $3.6 billion fixed-rate FHLB advances at December 31, 2008. The floating-rate advances adjust quarterly based on the LIBOR. As a condition of its membership in the FHLB Atlanta, the Company is required to maintain a FHLB stock investment currently equal to the lesser of: a percentage of 0.2% of total Bank assets; or a dollar cap amount of $25 million. Additionally,
FHLB Advances
 
the Bank must maintain an Activity Based Stock investment which is currently equal to 4.5% of the Bank's outstanding advances. The Company had an investment in FHLB stock of $200.9 million and $338.6 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company must also maintain qualified collateral as a percent of its advances, which varies based on the collateral type, and is further adjusted by the outcome of the most recent annual collateral audit and by FHLB's internal ranking of the Bank's creditworthiness. These advances are secured by a pool of mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company pledged loans with a lendable value of $13.2 billion and $16.8 billion, respectively, of the one- to four-family and home equity loans as collateral in support of both its advances and unused borrowing lines.
ETBH raised capital through the formation of trusts, which sell trust preferred stock in the capital markets. The capital securities must be redeemed in whole at the due date, which is generally 30 years after issuance. Each trust issued Floating Rate Cumulative Preferred Securities, at par with a liquidation amount of $1,000 per capital security. The trusts used the proceeds from the sale of issuances to purchase Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures issued by ETBH, which guarantees the trust obligations and contributed proceeds from the sale of its subordinated debentures to E*TRADE Bank in the form of a capital contribution.
Other
During 2007, ETBH formed three trusts, ETBH Capital Trust XXVIII, ETBH Capital Trust XXIX and ETBH Capital Trust XXX. These trusts issued a total of 60,000 shares of Floating Rate Cumulative Preferred Securities for a total of $60.0 million. Net proceeds from these issuances were invested in Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures that mature in 2037 and have variable rates of 1.90%, 1.95%, or 2.00% above the three-month LIBOR, payable quarterly. ETBH did not form any trusts for the year ended December 31, 2008.
In April 2007, ETBH called ETBH Capital Trust IV which had sold $10.0 million of trust preferred stock in the capital markets in 2002 and generated a loss of $0.3 million. In June 2007, ETBH called Telebank Capital Trust I which had sold $9.0 million of trust preferred stock in the capital markets in 1997, and generated a loss of $0.9 million.
The face values of outstanding trusts at December 31, 2008 are shown below (dollars in thousands):
 
Other borrowings also includes $18.8 million of overnight and other short-term borrowings in connection with the Federal Reserve Bank's term investment option and treasury, tax and loan programs. The Company pledged $14.1 million of securities to secure these borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank.
 
NOTE 15CORPORATE DEBT
The Company's corporate debt by type is shown below (dollars in thousands):
 
 
 
Senior Notes
All of the Company's senior notes are unsecured and will rank equal in right of payment with all of the Company's existing and future
unsubordinated indebtedness and will rank senior in right of payment to all its existing and future subordinated indebtedness.
In 2008, the Company began exchanging debt for common stock to extinguish a portion of its outstanding senior notes. The details of these exchanges are discussed below.
8% Senior Notes Due June 2011

Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities consist of the following (dollars in thousands):
 
NOTE 17INCOME TAXES
Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted FIN 48. As a result of the implementation, the Company recognized a $14.9 million increase to its liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which was accounted for as a
 
reduction to the beginning balance of retained earnings. The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of January 1, 2007 was $150.4 million. Of this total amount at January 1, 2007, $51.6 million (net of the federal benefit on state issues) represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2007 and 2008 is as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the unrecognized tax benefit was $64.7 million and $74.9 million, respectively. At December 31, 2008, $37.8 million (net of federal benefits on state issues) represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective income tax in future periods.
The following table summarizes the tax years that are either currently under examination or remain open under the statute of limitations and subject to examination by the major tax jurisdictions in which the Company operates:
 
 
It is likely that certain examinations may be settled or the statute of limitations could expire with regards to other tax filings, in the next twelve months. In addition, proposed legislation could favorably impact certain of the Company's unrecognized tax benefits. Such events would generally reduce the Company's unrecognized tax benefits, either because the tax positions are sustained or because the Company agrees to the disallowance, by as much as $5.0 million, all of which could affect the Company's total tax provision or the effective tax rate.
The Company's practice is to recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to income tax matters in income tax expense. After the adoption of FIN 48, the Company has total gross reserves for interest and penalties of $5.9 million and $8.6 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2008 includes a reduction in the accrual for interest of $2.7 million, principally related to the expiration of statute of limitations for the tax year ended December 31, 2004.
 
The components of income tax expense (benefit) from continuing operations are as follows (dollars in thousands)
 
The components of income (loss) before income tax expense (benefit) and discontinued operations are as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
 
Deferred income taxes are recorded when revenues and expenses are recognized in different periods for financial statement and tax return purposes. Prior year balances for the deferred tax asset and liabilities have been re-presented to ensure consistency between periods. The adjustments relate to the presentation of the federal benefit of the state deferred assets and liabilities. The temporary differences and tax carryforwards that created deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company generated a federal net operating loss of approximately $727.4 million and did not provide for a valuation allowance against the federal deferred tax assets. The Company is required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and record a charge to income if it determines, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. If the Company did conclude that a valuation allowance was required, the resulting loss would have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition and regulatory capital position at E*TRADE Bank. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $1.0 billion.
The Company did not establish a valuation allowance against its federal deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2008 as it believes that it is more likely than not that all of these assets will be realized. The Company's evaluation focused on identifying significant, objective evidence that it will be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future. The Company reviewed the estimated future taxable income for its trading and investing and balance sheet management segments separately and determined that the net operating losses in 2007 and 2008 were due solely to the credit losses in its balance sheet management segment. The Company believes these losses were caused by the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets which significantly impacted its asset-backed securities and home equity loan portfolios in 2007 and continued to generate credit losses in 2008. The Company estimates that these credit losses will continue in future periods; however, the Company ceased the business activities which it believes are the root cause of these losses. Therefore, while the Company does expect credit losses to continue in
 
future periods, it does expect these amounts to decline when compared to the credit losses in 2007 and 2008. The trading and investing segment generated substantial book taxable income for each of the last six years and the Company estimates that it will continue to generate taxable income in future periods at a level sufficient enough to generate taxable income for the Company as a whole. The Company considers this to be significant, objective evidence that it will be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future.
The Company's analysis of the need for a valuation allowance recognizes that it is in a cumulative book taxable loss position as of the three-year period ended December 31, 2008, which is considered significant, objective evidence that the Company may not be able to realize some portion of the deferred tax assets in the future. However, the Company believes it is able to rely on the forecasts of future taxable income and overcome the uncertainty created by the cumulative loss position.
The crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets has created significant volatility in the Company's results of operations. This volatility is isolated almost entirely to the balance sheet management segment. The forecasts for this segment include assumptions regarding the estimate of future expected credit losses, which the Company believes to be the most variable component of the forecasts of future taxable income. The Company believes this variability could create a book loss in the overall results for an individual reporting period while not significantly impacting the overall estimate of taxable income over the period in which the Company expects to realize the deferred tax assets. Conversely, the Company believes the trading and investing segment will continue to produce a stable stream of income which it believes can reliably estimate in both individual reporting periods as well as over the period in which the Company estimates it will realize the deferred tax assets.
In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, the Company estimated future taxable income based on management approved forecasts. This process required significant judgment by management about matters that are by nature uncertain. If future events differ significantly from the current forecasts, a valuation allowance may need to be established, which would have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition and regulatory capital position at E*TRADE Bank. In addition, a significant portion of the net deferred tax asset relates to a $2.3 billion federal tax loss carryforward, the utilization of which may be further limited in the event of certain material changes in the ownership of the Company. The Company will continue to monitor and update its assumptions and forecasts of future taxable income and assess the need for a valuation allowance.
For certain of the Company's state and foreign country deferred tax assets, the Company maintains a valuation allowance of $127.7 million and $91.8 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, as it is more likely than not that they will not be fully realized. The Company's valuation allowance increased by $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The principal components of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been established include the following state and foreign country net operating loss carryforwards and excess tax bases in certain illiquid investments:
 
 
 
 
The Company has not provided $9.0 million of deferred income taxes on $25.0 of undistributed earnings and profits in its foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2008 since the Company intends to permanently reinvest such earnings.
The effective tax rates differed from the federal statutory rates as follows:

Preferred Stock
The Company has 1.0 million shares authorized in preferred stock. None were issued and outstanding at December 31, 2008 and 2007.
Issuance of Common Stock
In 2008, the Company exchanged a total of $120.8 million in principal of outstanding senior notes for 27.1 million shares of common stock.

% Notes. (See Note 15Corporate Debt for additional details on the transaction.)
In 2008 and 2007, the Company issued $339.0 million or 84.7 million shares of common stock in conjunction with the Citadel Investment. The 84.7 million shares of common stock were issued in three increments: 14.8 million upon initial closing in November 2007; 23.2 million shares upon Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act approval in December 2007 and 46.7 million shares upon all required regulatory approvals in May 2008.
Share Repurchases
On April 18, 2007, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a $250.0 million common stock repurchase program (the "April 2007 Plan"). The April 2007 Plan is open-ended and allows for the repurchase of common stock on the open market, in private transactions or a combination of both. The $200.0 million repurchase program approved by the Board in December 2004 (the "December 2004 Plan") was completed in 2007.
 
The Company did not repurchase any shares of common stock in 2008. In 2007, the Company repurchased a total of 7.2 million shares of common stock for an aggregate $148.6 million under the April 2007 Plan and the December 2004 Plan. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had approximately $158.5 million available to purchase additional shares under the April 2007 Plan.
NOTE 19EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE
The following table is a reconciliation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share (dollars and shares in thousands, except per share amounts):
 
The Company excluded from the calculations of diluted earnings (loss) per share 37.4 million and 21.0 million shares of stock options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock units for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Of the excluded shares, 1.4 million and 9.6 million shares were anti-dilutive because of the Company's net loss for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2007, there were 46.7 million shares that had not been issued in connection with the Citadel Investment of which 3.9 million shares were anti-dilutive because of the Company's net loss for the period. The Company excluded from the calculations of diluted earnings per share 5.3 million shares of stock options that would have been anti-dilutive for the year ended December 31, 2006.
 
Excluded from the calculations of diluted earnings per share are 2.2 million shares of common stock for the year ended December 31, 2006, issuable under convertible subordinated notes as the effect of applying the treasury stock method on an if-converted basis would be anti-dilutive. There were not any shares issuable under convertible subordinated notes excluded from the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, as all convertible subordinated notes outstanding had been redeemed in 2006.
NOTE 20EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS AND OTHER BENEFITS
Employee Stock Option Plans
In 2005, the Company adopted and the shareholders approved the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan ("2005 Plan") to replace the 1996 Stock Incentive Plan ("1996 Plan") which provides for the grant of nonqualified or incentive stock options to officers, directors, key employees and consultants for the purchase of newly issued shares of the Company's common stock at a price determined by the Board at the date the option is granted. Options are generally exercisable ratably over a two to four-year period from the date the option is granted and most options expire within seven years from the date of grant. Certain options provide for accelerated vesting upon a change in control. Exercise prices are generally equal to the fair market value of the shares on the grant date. A total of 85.4 million shares had been authorized under the 1996 Plan. Under the 2005 Plan, the remaining unissued authorized shares of the 1996 Plan, up to 42.0 million shares, were authorized for issuance. Additionally, any shares that had been awarded but remained unissued under the 1996 Plan that were subsequently canceled, would be authorized for issuance under the 2005 Plan, up to 39.0 million shares. As of December 31, 2008, 13.8 million shares were available for grant under the 2005 Plan.
The Company recognized $26.6 million, $25.0 million and $21.7 million in compensation expense from continuing operations for stock options for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company recognized a tax benefit of $9.8 million, $8.1 million and $7.8 million related to the stock options for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model based on the assumptions noted in the table below. Expected volatility is based on a combination of historical volatility of the Company's stock and implied volatility of publicly traded options on the Company's stock. The expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The expected term is estimated using employees' actual historical behavior and projected future behavior based on expected exercise patterns. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bond where the remaining term equals the expected term. Dividend yield is zero as the Company has not, nor does it currently plan to, issue dividends to its shareholders.
 
The weighted-average fair values of options granted were $2.02, $7.48 and $8.60 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Intrinsic value of options exercised were $0.1 million, $50.6 million and $89.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
 
A summary of options activity under the 2005 Plan is presented below:
 
As of December 31, 2008, there was $28.8 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.5 years.
Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Units
The Company issues restricted stock awards and restricted stock units to its employees. Each restricted stock unit can be converted into one share of the Company's common stock upon vesting. These awards are issued at the fair market value on the date of grant and vest ratably over the period, generally two to four years. The fair value is calculated as the market price upon issuance.
In connection with the Company's contract to hire the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), the Board made grants of restricted stock and stock options. The grants vest through October 2009, 62.5% of which time vests through January 1, 2009 and the balance of which time-vest through October 2009. In making these awards, the Board exercised its discretion to amend the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan and issue grants in excess of the stated maximum to any individual in any single year but did not increase the aggregate number of shares that may be issued under the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan; however, the Board will not issue any further equity, cash bonus or non-equity incentive plan payments to the CEO through at least the end of 2009. None of the restricted stock awards and no more than 37.5% of the stock option awards are expected to be deductible for federal income tax purposes.
The Company recorded $15.5 million, $9.4 million and $10.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, in compensation expense from continuing operations related to restricted stock awards and restricted stock units. The Company recognized a tax benefit of $3.9 million, $3.2 million and $3.7 million related to restricted stock awards and restricted stock units for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
A summary of non-vested restricted stock award activity is presented below:
 
 
A summary of non-vested restricted stock unit activity is presented below:
 
As of December 31, 2008, there was $16.7 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested awards. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.0 year. The total fair value of restricted shares and restricted stock units vested was $5.6 million, $11.0 million and $7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The shareholders of the Company previously approved the 2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("2002 Purchase Plan"), and reserved 5,000,000 shares of common stock for sale to employees at a price no less than 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock at the beginning of the one-year offering period or the end of each of the six-month purchase periods. Under SFAS No. 123(R), the 2002 Purchase Plan was considered compensatory. Effective August 1, 2005, the Company changed the terms of its purchase plan to reduce the discount to 5% and discontinued the look-back provision. As a result, the purchase plan was not compensatory beginning August 1, 2005. In 2008, the Company temporarily suspended the 2002 Purchase Plan due to the low number of shares remaining for issuance. At December 31, 2008, 212,650 shares were available under the 2002 Purchase Plan.
401(k) Plan
The Company has a 401(k) salary deferral program for eligible employees who have met certain service requirements. The Company matches certain employee contributions; additional contributions to this plan are at the discretion of the Company. Total contribution expense from continuing operations under this plan was $4.6 million, $5.4 million and $5.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
NOTE 21REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS
Registered Broker-Dealers
The Company's U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the Uniform Net Capital Rule (the "Rule") under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 administered by the SEC and FINRA, which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital. The minimum net capital requirements can be met under either the Aggregate Indebtedness method or the Alternative method. Under the Aggregate Indebtedness method, a broker-dealer is required to maintain minimum net capital of the greater of 6 
 2
/
3
% of its aggregate indebtedness, as defined, or a minimum dollar amount. Under the Alternative method, a broker-dealer is required to maintain net capital equal to the greater of $250,000 or 2% of aggregate debit balances arising from customer transactions. The method used depends on the individual U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary. The Company's international broker-dealer subsidiaries, located in Europe and Asia, are subject to capital requirements determined by their respective regulators.
As of December 31, 2008, all of the Company's broker-dealer subsidiaries met minimum net capital requirements. Total required net capital was $0.1 billion at December 31, 2008. In addition, the Company's broker-dealer subsidiaries had excess net capital of $0.7 billion at December 31, 2008.
 
The table below summarizes the minimum excess capital requirements for the Company's broker-dealer subsidiaries (dollars in thousands):
 
 
Banking
E*TRADE Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on E*TRADE Bank's financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, E*TRADE Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of E*TRADE Bank's assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. E*TRADE Bank's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.
Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require E*TRADE Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier I Capital to Risk-weighted assets and Tier I Capital to adjusted total assets. As shown in the table below, at December 31, 2008, the OTS categorized E*TRADE Bank as "well capitalized" under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. However, events beyond management's control, such as a continued deterioration in residential real estate and credit markets, could adversely affect future earnings and E*TRADE Bank's ability to meet its future capital requirements.
E*TRADE Bank's required actual capital amounts and ratios are presented in the table below (dollars in thousands):
 
 
NOTE 22LEASE ARRANGEMENTS
The Company has non-cancelable operating leases for facilities through 2024. Future minimum lease payments and sublease proceeds under these leases, including leases involved in facility restructurings, are as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
Certain leases contain provisions for renewal options and rent escalations based on increases in certain costs incurred by the lessor. Rent expense from continuing operations, net of sublease income, was $25.6 million, $25.0 million and $23.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Rent expense excludes costs related to leases involved in facility restructurings, which are recorded in the facility restructuring and other exit activities line item in the consolidated statement of income (loss).
NOTE 23COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER REGULATORY MATTERS
Legal Matters
Litigation Matters
On October 27, 2000, a complaint was filed in the Superior Court for the State of California, County of Santa Clara, entitled, "Ajaxo, Inc., a Delaware corporation, Plaintiff, versus E*TRADE GROUP, INC., a Delaware corporation; and Everypath, Inc., a California corporation; and Does 1 through 50, inclusively, Defendants." Through this complaint, Ajaxo sought damages and certain non-monetary relief for the Company's alleged breach of a non-disclosure agreement with Ajaxo pertaining to certain wireless technology offered to the Company by Ajaxo as well as damages and other relief against both the Company and defendant Everypath, Inc., for their alleged misappropriation of Ajaxo's trade secrets. Following a jury trial, a judgment was entered in 2003 in favor of Ajaxo against the Company for $1.3 million dollars for breach of the Ajaxo non-disclosure agreement. Although the jury also found in favor of Ajaxo on its misappropriation of trade secrets claim against the Company and defendant Everypath, the trial court subsequently denied Ajaxo's requests for additional damages and relief on these claims. Thereafter, all parties appealed, and on December 21, 2005, the California Court of Appeal affirmed the above-described award against the Company for breach of the nondisclosure agreement but remanded the case to the trial court for the limited purpose of determining what, if any, additional damages Ajaxo may be entitled to as a result of the jury's previous finding in favor of Ajaxo on its misappropriation of trade secrets claim against the Company and defendant Everypath. Following the foregoing ruling by the Court of Appeal, defendant Everypath ceased operations and made an assignment for the benefit of its creditors in January, 2006. As a result, defendant Everypath is no longer defending the case. Although the Company paid Ajaxo the full amount due on the judgment against it above, the case, consistent with the rulings issued by the Court of Appeal, was remanded back to the trial court, and on May 30, 2008, a jury returned a verdict in favor of E*TRADE denying all claims raised and demands for damages against the Company by Ajaxo. Following the trial court's filing on September 5, 2008, of entry of judgment in favor of E*TRADE, Ajaxo filed post trial motions asking the trial court to grant a new trial and to vacate its September 5, 2008, entry of judgment in favor of the Company. By order dated November 4, 2008, the court denied these motions, and on December 2, 2008, Ajaxo filed its notice of appeal.
 
On October 2, 2007, a class action complaint alleging violations of the federal securities laws was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company and then its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer entitled, "Larry Freudenberg, Individually and on Behalf of All Others Similarly Situated, Plaintiff, versus E*TRADE Financial Corporation, Mitchell H. Caplan and Robert J. Simmons, Defendants." By order dated July 17, 2008, the trial court consolidated the Freudenberg action with four other purported class actions, all of which were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and which were based on the same facts and circumstances as the Freudenberg action. By the same July 17, 2008 order, the trial court appointed the "Kristen-Straxton Group" and Ira Newman co-lead plaintiffs and Brower Piven and Levi & Korsinski, respectively, as lead and co-lead plaintiffs' counsel. Thereafter, on January 16, 2009, Plaintiffs served their "Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint for Violations of the Federal Securities Laws." In their amended complaint, Plaintiffs again name the Company's former chief executive and financial officers as defendants as well as Dennis Webb, the Company's former Capital Markets Division President. In their amended complaint, Plaintiffs allege causes of action for violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 against all defendants, and (2) violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the individual defendants. In specific, Plaintiffs contend, among other things, that the value of E*TRADE's stock between April 19, 2006 and November 9, 2007 (the "class period") was artificially inflated because defendants, among other things, issued materially false and misleading statements and failed to disclose that the Company was experiencing a rise in delinquency rates in its mortgage and home equity portfolios; failed to timely record an impairment on its mortgage and home equity portfolios; materially overvalued its securities portfolio, which includes assets backed by mortgages; and based on the foregoing, lacked a reasonable basis for the positive statements it made about the Company's earnings and prospects. Plaintiffs seek to recover damages in an amount to be proven at trial, including interest and attorneys' fees and costs. By prior order of the court, Defendants are to file their motion to dismiss by April 2, 2009; and all parties are to complete briefing on Defendants' motion to dismiss by August 17, 2009. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against these claims.
On August 15, 2008, an action entitled, "Ronald M. Tate, Trustee of the Ronald M. Tate Trust Dtd 4/13/88, and George Avakian, an Individual, Plaintiffs, versus E*TRADE Financial Corporation, Mitchell H. Caplan, an Individual, and Robert J. Simmons, an Individual, Defendants" was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Tate action is based on the same facts and circumstances, and contains the same claims, as the Freudenberg consolidated actions discussed above. By agreement of the parties and approval of the court, the Tate action has been consolidated with the Freudenberg consolidated actions for the purpose of pre-trial discovery.
Based upon the same facts and circumstances alleged in the Freudenberg class action complaint above, a verified shareholder derivative complaint was filed in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on October 4, 2007, against the Company's then Chief Executive Officer, President/Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and individual members of its board of directors entitled, "Catherine Rubery, Derivatively on behalf of E*TRADE Financial Corporation, Plaintiff, versus Mitchell H. Caplan, R. Jarrett Lilien, Robert J. Simmons, George A. Hayter, Daryl Brewster, Ronald D. Fisher, Michael K. Parks, C. Catherine Raffaeli, Lewis E. Randall, Donna L. Weaver, and Stephen H. Willard, Defendants, -and- E*TRADE Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation, Nominal Defendant." Plaintiff alleges, among other things, causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets, unjust enrichment, and violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. The above shareholder derivative complaint has been consolidated with another shareholder derivative complaint brought in the same court and against the same named defendants entitled, "Marilyn Clark, Derivatively On Behalf of E*TRADE Financial Corporation, Plaintiff, versus Mitchell H. Caplan, et al., Defendants" (collectively, with the Rubery case, the "federal derivative actions"). Three similar derivative actions, based on the same facts and circumstances as the federal derivative actions but alleging exclusively state causes of action, have been filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County. These three cases have been ordered consolidated in that court under the caption "In re: E*Trade Financial Corporation Derivative Litigation, Lead Index No. 07-603736" (the "state derivative actions"). By agreement of the parties and approval of the respective courts, proceedings in both these federal and state derivative actions will continue to trail those in the federal securities actions discussed above.
 
On April 2, 2008, a class action complaint alleging violations of the federal securities laws was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company entitled, "John W. Oughtred, Individually, and on Behalf of all Others Similarly Situated, Plaintiff, v. E*TRADE Financial Corporation and E*TRADE Securities, LLC, Defendants." Plaintiff contends, among other things, that the Company committed various sales practice violations in the sale of certain auction rate securities to investors between April 2, 2003, and February 13, 2008 (the "class period") by allegedly misrepresenting that these securities were highly liquid and safe investments for short term investing. On April 17, 2008, the trial court entered an order relieving the Company of its obligation to move, answer or otherwise respond to the complaint until such time as the court may deem appropriate. Thereafter, plaintiff Oughtred joined plaintiffs in twelve other actions involving auction rate securities (in which the Company is named as defendant) in filing a motion seeking to centralize all 13 actions in the Southern District of New York or in the alternative, the Northern District of California. By order filed October 9, 2008, a United States Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation denied plaintiffs' motion to transfer, and on December 18, 2008, Plaintiff filed his first amended class action complaint. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against the claims raised in this complaint.

On October 11, 2006, a state class action entitled, "Nikki Greenberg, and all those similarly situated, plaintiffs, versus E*TRADE FINANCIAL Corporation, defendant" was filed in the Superior Court for the State of California, County of Los Angeles on behalf of all customers or consumers who allegedly made or received telephone calls from E*TRADE that were recorded without their knowledge or consent following a telephone call from plaintiff Greenberg to the Company's Beverly Hills financial center on August 8, 2006, that was recorded during a brief period when the Company's automated notice system was out of order. On February 7, 2008, class certification was granted and the class defined to consist of (1) all persons in California who received telephone calls from E*TRADE and whose calls were recorded without their consent within three years of October 11, 2006, and (2) all persons who made calls from California to the Beverly Hills financial center of the Company on August 8, 2006. In the interim, the Company has filed motions seeking to de-certify or further limit the defined class, and plaintiffs have filed competing motions seeking to expand it. The hearing of these motions, formerly set for September 19, 2008, is now scheduled to take place on March 6, 2009. The Company has denied the allegations of the complaint.
Representatives of various states attorneys general have made informal inquiries regarding the auction rate securities held by the Company's customers. The Company is cooperating with these inquiries, which are continuing.
In addition to the matters described above, the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the normal course of business which could have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In each pending matter, the Company contests liability or the amount of claimed damages. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages, or where investigation or discovery have yet to be completed, the Company cannot predict with certainty the loss or range of loss related to such matters, how such matters will be resolved, when they will ultimately be resolved, or what any eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief might be. Subject to the foregoing, the Company believes that the outcome of any such pending matter will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of the Company, although the outcome could be material to the Company's or a business segment's operating results in the future, depending, among other things, upon the Company's or business segment's income for such period.
An unfavorable outcome in any matter that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, even if the ultimate outcomes are resolved in the Company's favor, the defense of such litigation could entail considerable cost or the diversion of the efforts of management, either of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
 
Regulatory Matters
The securities and banking industries are subject to extensive regulation under federal, state and applicable international laws. From time to time, the Company has been threatened with or named as a defendant in, lawsuits, arbitrations and administrative claims involving securities, banking and other matters. The Company is also subject to periodic regulatory audits and inspections. Compliance and trading problems that are reported to regulators, such as the SEC, FINRA, OTS or FDIC by dissatisfied customers or others are investigated by such regulators, and may, if pursued, result in formal claims being filed against the Company by customers or disciplinary action being taken against the Company or its employees by regulators. Any such claims or disciplinary actions that are decided against the Company could have a material impact on the financial results of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
The SEC, in conjunction with various regional securities exchanges, is conducting an inquiry into the trading activities of certain specialist firms, including the Company's subsidiary ETCM, on various regional exchanges in order to determine whether such firms executed proprietary orders in a given security prior to a customer order in the same security (a practice commonly known as "trading ahead") during the period 19992005. ETCM was a specialist on the Chicago Stock Exchange during the period under review. The SEC has indicated that it will seek disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and penalties from any firm found to have engaged in trading ahead activity to the detriment of its customers during that time period. It is possible that such sanctions, if imposed against ETCM, could have a material impact on the financial results of the Company during the period in which such sanctions are imposed. The Company and ETCM are cooperating with the investigation.
On October 17, 2007, the SEC initiated an informal inquiry into matters related to the Company's loan and securities portfolios. That inquiry is continuing. The Company is cooperating fully with the SEC in this matter.
Insurance
The Company maintains insurance coverage that management believes is reasonable and prudent. The principal insurance coverage it maintains covers commercial general liability; property damage; hardware/software damage; cyber liability; directors and officers; employment practices liability; certain criminal acts against the Company; and errors and omissions. The Company believes that such insurance coverage is adequate for the purpose of its business. The Company's ability to maintain this level of insurance coverage in the future, however, is subject to the availability of affordable insurance in the marketplace.
Reserves
For all legal matters, reserves are established in accordance with SFAS No. 5, . Once established, reserves are adjusted based on available information when an event occurs requiring an adjustment.
Accounting for Contingencies
Commitments
In the normal course of business, the Company makes various commitments to extend credit and incur contingent liabilities that are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheet. Significant changes in the economy or interest rates influence the impact that these commitments and contingencies have on the Company in the future.
Loans
In 2008, the Company exited its direct retail lending business, which was the last remaining loan origination channel of the Company. As a result, the Company had no commitments to originate or sell mortgage loans at December 31, 2008. Additionally, the Company had no commitments to purchase loans at December 31, 2008.
 
Securities, Unused Lines of Credit and Certificates of Deposit
At December 31, 2008, the Company had commitments to purchase $0.8 billion and sell $1.8 billion in securities. In addition, the Company had approximately $2.2 billion of certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in less than one year and $3.0 billion of unfunded commitments to extend credit.
Guarantees
The Company provides guarantees to investors purchasing mortgage loans, which are considered standard representations and warranties within the mortgage industry. The primary guarantee is that the mortgage and the mortgage note have been duly executed and each is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms. The mortgage has been duly acknowledged and recorded and is valid. The mortgage and the mortgage note are not subject to any right of rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense, including, without limitation, the defense of usury, and no such right of rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense has been asserted with respect thereto. If these claims prove to be untrue, the investor can require the Company to repurchase the loan and return all loan purchase and servicing release premiums.
Management has determined that quantifying the potential liability exposure is not meaningful due to the nature of the standard representations and warranties, which rarely result in loan repurchases.
ETBH raised capital through the formation of trusts, which sold trust preferred stock in the capital markets. The capital securities are mandatorily redeemable in whole at the due date, which is generally 30 years after issuance. Each trust issues Floating Rate Cumulative Preferred Securities at par, with a liquidation amount of $1,000 per capital security. The proceeds from the sale of issuances were invested in ETBH's Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures.
During the 30-year period prior to the redemption of the Floating Rate Cumulative Preferred Securities, ETBH guarantees the accrued and unpaid distributions on these securities, as well as the redemption price of the securities and certain costs that may be incurred in liquidating, terminating or dissolving the trusts (all of which would otherwise be payable by the trusts). At December 31, 2008, management estimated that the maximum potential liability under this arrangement is equal to approximately $437.9 million or the total face value of these securities plus dividends, which may be unpaid at the termination of the trust arrangement.
NOTE 24SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION
Beginning in the first quarter of 2009, the Company revised its segment financial reporting to reflect the manner in which its chief operating decision maker had begun assessing the Company's performance and making resource allocation decisions. As a result, the Company now reports its operating results in two segments: 1) "Trading and Investing", which includes the businesses that were formerly in the "Retail" segment and now includes the Company's market making business, and 2) "Balance Sheet Management", which includes the businesses from the former "Institutional" segment, other than the market-making business. The Company's segment financial information from prior periods has been reclassified in accordance with the new segment financial reporting.
Trading and investing includes:
 
 
 
 
Balance sheet management includes:
 
 
The Company evaluates the performance of its segments based on segment contribution (net revenue less provision for loan losses and operating expense). All corporate overhead, administrative and technology charges are allocated to segments either in proportion to their respective direct costs or based upon specific operating criteria. Activities associated with discontinued operations have been excluded from the segment results.
 
Financial information for the Company's reportable segments is presented in the following tables (dollars in thousands):
 
 
 
 
 
 
Segment Assets
Total assets for each segment are shown in the following table (dollars in thousands):
 
 
Geographic Information
The Company operates in both U.S. and international markets. The Company's international operations are conducted through offices in Europe and Asia. In 2008, the Company re-defined total net revenue by removing provision for loan losses and separately stating it as its own line item, and reclassified hedge ineffectiveness recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 133, as amended from other operating expense to the loss on loans and securities, net line item. Results of operations from the Canadian brokerage business and direct retail lending business have been reclassified to discontinued operations. Therefore, net revenue from these businesses has been excluded from total net revenue. The following information provides a representation of each region's contribution to the consolidated amounts (dollars in thousands):
No single customer accounted for greater than 10% of gross revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.
 
NOTE 25CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION (PARENT COMPANY ONLY)
The following presents the Parent's condensed statement of income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss), balance sheet and statement of cash flows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Parent Company Guarantees
Guarantees are contingent commitments issued by the Company for the purpose of guaranteeing the financial obligations of a subsidiary to a financial institution. The collective obligation of the corporation does not change by the existence of corporate guarantees. Rather, the guarantees shift ultimate payment responsibility of an existing financial obligation from a subsidiary to the parent company.
In support of the Company's brokerage business, the Company has provided guarantees on the settlement of its subsidiaries' financial obligations with several financial institutions related to its securities lending activities. Terms and conditions of the guarantees, although typically undefined in the guarantees themselves, are governed by the conditions of the underlying obligation that the guarantee covers. Thus, the Company's obligation to pay under these guarantees coincides exactly with the terms and conditions of those underlying obligations. At December 31, 2008, no claims had been filed with the Company for payment under any guarantees. These guarantees are not collateralized.
In addition to guarantees issued on behalf of subsidiaries participating in securities lending programs, the Company also issues guarantees for the settlement of foreign exchange transactions. If a subsidiary fails to deliver currency on the settlement date of a foreign exchange arrangement, the beneficiary financial institution may seek payment from the Company. Terms are undefined, and are governed by the terms of the underlying financial obligation. At December 31, 2008, no claims had been made on the Company under these guarantees and thus, no obligations had been recorded. These guarantees are not collateralized.
NOTE 26QUARTERLY DATA (UNAUDITED)
The information presented below reflects all adjustments, which, in the opinion of management, are of a normal and recurring nature necessary to present fairly the results of operations for the quarterly periods presented (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts):
 
The continued deterioration in the residential real estate and credit markets, as well as the nearly unprecedented turmoil in the global financial markets, had a significant impact on the Company's financial performance during 2008. The decrease in income (loss) from continuing operations for the third and fourth quarter of 2008 was due primarily to the $517.8 million and $512.9 million in provision for loan losses, respectively. Additionally, the Company incurred losses of $153.8 million, net of hedges, on its preferred stock in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac during the third quarter of 2008. The decrease in net income for the fourth quarter of 2007 was due principally to the $2.2 billion loss on the sale of the Company's asset-backed securities portfolio and $402.3 million in provision for loan losses.
