Statement
, dated June 22, 2009 (the Offering Memorandum), and the related letter of transmittal (the Letter of Transmittal).  Pursuant to the Exchange Offer, the Company is offering to exchange more than $1 billion of newly-issued zero coupon Convertible Debentures due 2019 (the Debentures) for all of its 8% Senior Notes due 2011 (the 2011 Notes) and a portion of its 12.5% Springing Lien Notes due 2017 (the 2017 Notes, and together with the 2011 Notes, the Notes).
 
 
Notwithstanding disclosure to the contrary in the Offering Memorandum regarding the ranking of the Debentures, the indenture that will govern the Debentures, the form of which is filed as Exhibit TC3 to the Companys Form T-3 filed on June 22, 2009, will provide that any lien incurred pursuant to Section 4.20 of the indenture governing the 2017 Notes will cause the Debentures to be equally and ratably secured.  This disclosure corrects and supersedes disclosure in the Offering Memorandum to the effect that the Debentures will be subordinated in right of payment to the 2017 Notes to the extent such 2017 Notes are secured in the future.
 
Further information regarding the Exchange Offer may be found in the Companys Current Reports on Form 8-K filed on June 17, 2009, June 19, 2009 and June 22, 2009, the press release announcing the launch of the Exchange Offer attached to the 8-K filed on June 22, 2009 as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein and the Companys Form T-3 Application for Qualification of Indentures under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 filed on June 22, 2009, including the form of indenture that will govern the Debentures, the Offering Memorandum and the Letter of Transmittal, all of which are filed as exhibits thereto.
