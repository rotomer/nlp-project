New York, NY, July 1, 2009
E*TRADE FINANCIAL Corporation (NASDAQ: ETFC)
 
announced today the progress of its previously announced debt exchange offer (the 
Exchange Offer
) to exchange more than $1 billion of newly-issued zero coupon Convertible Debentures due 2019 (the 
Debentures
) for all of its 8% Senior Notes due 2011 (the 
2011 Notes
) and a portion of its 12.5% Springing Lien Notes due 2017 (the 
2017 Notes
, and together with the 2011 Notes, the 
Notes
).  Assuming the Exchange Offer is completed, the Debentures issued in exchange for any Notes tendered during the period ending at midnight, New York City time, on July 1, 2009 (the Early Tender Period), will be Class A Debentures and have a conversion price of $1.0340 per share.  
In connection with the Exchange Offer,
the Company is also
solicit
ing
consents
(the 
Consents
)
to amendments and waivers of certain provisions of the indentures governing the Notes during the
Early Tender Period
, unless extended.
As of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, July 1, 2009, approximately $
428
,
206
,
000
of 2011 Notes and approximately $
1
,
102
,
779
,
248
of 2017 Notes had been validly tendered, including $230,245,000 of 2011 Notes and $700,000,000 of 2017 Notes tendered by affiliates of Citadel Investment Group L.L.C. (
Citadel
).  Because the aggregate principal amount of 2017 Notes tendered by holders other than Citadel exceeds $310,000,000, acceptance of the 2017 Notes tendered by such holders for exchange will be pro-rated as described in the Offering Memorandum related to the Exchange Offer dated June 22, 2009 (the Offering Memorandum).
Approval of the amendments and waivers to the indentures governing the 2011 Notes and the 2017 Notes requires, with respect to each series, Consents from holders of an absolute majority of the outstanding Notes, as well as Consents from holders of a majority of the Notes not held by Citadel (the Majority of the Minority Consent).  Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Offer, holders tendering Notes for exchange are deemed to have delivered Consents with respect to such Notes and holders other than Citadel can deliver a Consent without tendering the related Notes in exchange for a consent fee of $5.00 per every $1,000 principal amount of Notes to which such Consent relates (the Consent Fee).  Citadel has agreed to deliver sufficient Consents, prior to
 
 
 
 
 
midnight, New York City time, on July 1, 2009, such that Consents with respect to an absolute majority of each series of Notes will be obtained and has waived the Consent Fee with respect to such Notes.  In addition, based on the results disclosed above, the Majority of the Minority Consent has been obtained with respect to both the 2011 Notes and the 2017 Notes.
The foregoing results represent the Companys preliminary calculations of Notes tendered and Consents delivered, and are subject to change.
The Early Tender Period remains open until midnight, New York City time, on July 1, 2009, for additional tenders of Notes for exchange and deemed consent.  The deadline for delivering Consents without tendering the related Notes to receive the Consent Fee and for withdrawing Notes and Consents previously tendered expired at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on July 1, 2009.
The complete terms and conditions of the Exchange Offer are set forth in the Offering Memorandum
,
and the
related letter of t
ransmittal
and consent
sent to holders of the Notes.
Completion of
the Exchange Offer
is conditioned upon
, among other things, shareholder approval at
a Special M
eeting
of Shareholders expected to occur in mid-August 2009
.
 
In addition to approval by shareholders, the extent of Citadel
s participation in the Exchange Offer is subject to approval from E*TRADE
s primary federal banking regulator, the Office of Thrift Supervision
(the OTS)
.

New York, NY, July 2, 2009
 
E*TRADE FINANCI
AL Corporation (NASDAQ: ETFC)
 
today
announced results of the Early Tender Period of its previously announced debt exchange offer (the 
Exchange Offer
) to exchange more than $1 billion of newly-issued zero coupon Convertible Debentures due 2019 (the 
Deben
tures
) for all of its 8% Senior Notes due 2011 (the 
2011 Notes
) and a portion of its 12.5% Springing Lien Notes due 2017 (the 
2017 Notes
, and together with the 2011 Notes, the 
Notes
).  Assuming the Exchange Offer is completed, the Debentures issued
 
in exchange for any Notes tendered during the period
that ended
 
at midnight,
New York City
time, on July 1, 2009 (the 
Early Tender Period
), will be Class A Debentures and have a conversion price of $1.0340 per share.  In connection with the Exchange Offe
r, the Company also announced that during the Early Tender Period it obtained consents (the 
Consents
) required to amend and waive certain provisions of the indentures governing the Notes.
As of the Early Tender Period expiration, approximately
$429,616,
000
of 2011 Notes and approximately
$1,407,178,248
of 2017 Notes had been validly tendered, including
$230,245,000
of 2011 Notes and
$1 b
illion
of 2017 Notes tendered by affiliates of Citadel Investment Group L.L.C. (
Citadel
).  
The 2011 Notes tendered re
present Citadel
s total holdings and approximately 9
7 percent of non-Citadel holdings
, and the 2017 Notes tendered represent the maximum of Citadel
s commitment to participate in the Exchange Offer and approximately 9
9 percent of non-Citadel holdings
.
 
Bec
ause the aggregate principal amount of 2017 Notes tendered by holders other than Citadel exceeds $310,000,000, acceptance of the 2017 Notes tendered by such holders for exchange will be pro-rated as described in the Offering Memorandum related to the Exch
a
nge Offer dated June 22, 2009 (the 
Offering Memorandum
).
In addition, the Company announced that it had o
b
tained the
Consents
necessary to amend and waive certain provisions of the indentures governing the Notes and that, in
connection therewith, the Co
mpany will pay aggregate consent fees
of
approximately
$24,690
in the quarter
ending
 
September 30,
2009
,
to holders that delivered Consents without tendering the related Notes for exchange.  
Holders that tendered their Note
s for exchange
during the Early T
ender Period were deemed to have delivered Consents with
 
 
 
 
 
 
respect to such Notes and to have waived payment of any consent fe
e, provided the Exchange Offer is completed.  
However, if the Exchange Offer is not completed for any reason, the Company will pay
ad
ditional
consent fees
, in the aggregate,
 
of
approximately
$
9
,
183
,971
to holders that tendered their Notes for exchange during the Early Tender Period.
The foregoing results represent the Company
s preliminary calculations of Notes tendered and Consents de
livered, and are subject to change.
As more fully described in the Offering
Memorandum
, the Company presently expects that on Ju
l
y 8, 2009:
The Exchange Offer remains open until midnight, New York City time, on the date of the Special Meeting of Shar
eholders the Company will call t
o approve
the
Exchang
e Offer
(the 
Expiration Date
), which the Company currently expects to occur in mid-August
2009
.  Assuming the Exchange Offer is completed, the Debentures issued in exchange for any Notes tendered after
the Early Tender Period and before midnight,
New York City
time, on the Expiration Date will be Class B Debentures, which will have a conversion price of $1.5510 per share and be identical to the Class A Debentures in all other respects.
  However, because
the maximum number of 2017 Notes subject to the Exchange Offer were tendered during the Early Tender Period, the Exchange Offer effectively remains open only with respect to the 2011 Notes not tendered during the Early Tender Period.
The complete terms a
nd conditions of the Exchange Offer are set forth in the Offering Memorandum and the related letter of transmittal and consent sent to holders of the Notes.  Completion of the Exchange Offer is conditioned upon, among other things, shareholder approval at
 
a Special Meeting of Shareholder
s.  
In addition to approval by shareholders, the extent of Citadel
s participation in the Exchange Offer is subject to approval from E*TRADE
s primary federal banking regulator, the Office of Thrift Supervision (the 
OTS
).
