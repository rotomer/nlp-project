In connection with its previously announced debt exchange offer, E*TRADE Financial Corporation (the "Company") entered into an Indenture dated as of August 25, 2009 (the "Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee, pursuant to which the Company issued new zero coupon convertible debentures as further described below. A copy of the Indenture is filed herewith as Exhibit 4.1.
 
On August 25, 2009, the Company announced the closing of its debt exchange offer for certain of its outstanding interest-bearing notes (the "Exchange Offer"). In connection with the Exchange Offer, the Company issued an aggregate of $1,739,616,000 aggregate principal amount of zero coupon Class A Convertible Debentures due 2019 (the "Class A Debentures") and $2,255,000 aggregate principal amount of zero coupon Class B Convertible Debentures due 2019 (the "Class B Debentures" and, together with the Class A Debentures, the "Convertible Debentures") in exchange for $429,616,000 of the Company's 8% Senior Notes due 2011 and $1,310,000,000 of the Company's 12.5% Springing Lien Notes due 2017. The issuance of Convertible Debentures was exempt from registration under Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. This exemption was available to the Company because the Exchange Offer was conducted with the Company's existing security holders exclusively where no commission or other remuneration was paid or given directly or indirectly for soliciting the exchange of securities pursuant to the Exchange Offer.
The Class A Debentures and Class B Debentures will be convertible into shares of the Company's common stock at initial conversion prices of $1.0340 and $1.5510 per share, respectively, but are otherwise identical in all respects. Based upon their respective initial conversion prices, the Class A Debentures will be convertible into 1,682,413,926 shares of the Company's common stock and the Class B Debentures will be convertible into 1,453,900 shares of the Company's common stock.
The Company's press release dated August 25, 2009 related to the closing is filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

Transfer Provisions

(2) Indebtedness owed (A) to the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor evidenced by an unsubordinated promissory note or (B) to any Restricted Subsidiary or Regulated Subsidiary; provided that (x) any event which results in any such Restricted Subsidiary or Regulated Subsidiary ceasing to be a Restricted Subsidiary or Regulated Subsidiary or any subsequent transfer of such Indebtedness (other than to the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary or Regulated Subsidiary) shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness not permitted by this clause (2) and (y) if the Company (or any Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Guarantor at the time such Indebtedness is Incurred) is the obligor on such Indebtedness, such Indebtedness must be expressly contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Securities, in the case of the Company, or the Security Guarantee, in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor;
 
(3) Indebtedness issued in exchange for, or the net proceeds of which are used to refinance or refund, then outstanding Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness outstanding under clause (1), (2) or (4)) and any refinancings thereof in an amount not to exceed the amount so refinanced or refunded (plus premiums, accrued interest, fees and expenses); provided that (a) Indebtedness the proceeds of which are used to refinance or refund the Securities or Indebtedness that is pari passu with, or subordinated in right of payment to, the Securities or a Security Guarantee shall only be permitted under this clause (3) if (x) in case the Securities are refinanced in part or the Indebtedness to be refinanced is pari passu with the Securities or a Security Guarantee, such new Indebtedness, by its terms or by the terms of any agreement or instrument pursuant to which such new Indebtedness is outstanding, is expressly made pari passu with, or subordinate in right of payment to, the remaining Securities or the Security Guarantee, or (y) in case the Indebtedness to be refinanced is subordinated in right of payment to the Securities or a Security Guarantee, such new Indebtedness, by its terms or by the terms of any agreement or instrument pursuant to which such new Indebtedness is issued or remains outstanding, is expressly made subordinate in right of payment to the Securities or the Security Guarantee at least to the extent that the Indebtedness to be refinanced is subordinated to the Securities or the Security Guarantee, (b) such new Indebtedness, determined as of the date of Incurrence of such new Indebtedness, does not mature prior to the Stated Maturity of the Indebtedness to be refinanced or refunded, and the Average Life of such new Indebtedness is at least equal to the remaining Average Life of the Indebtedness to be refinanced or refunded and (c) such new Indebtedness is Incurred by the Company or a Subsidiary Guarantor or by the Restricted Subsidiary that is the obligor on the Indebtedness to be refinanced or refunded;

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 4.03, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that may be Incurred pursuant to this Section 4.03 will not be deemed to be exceeded, with respect to any outstanding Indebtedness due solely to the result of fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies or due to fluctuations in the value of commodities or securities which underlie such Indebtedness. For the purposes of determining compliance with any restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness (x), the U.S dollar equivalent principal amount of any Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit debt and (y) the principal amount of any Indebtedness which is calculated by reference to any underlying security or commodity shall be calculated based on the relevant closing price of such commodity or security on the date such Indebtedness was incurred.
(c) For purposes of determining any particular amount of Indebtedness under this Section 4.03, (x) Indebtedness outstanding under any Credit Facility on the Closing Date shall be treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1) of the second paragraph of clause (a) of this Section 4.03, (y) Guarantees, Liens or obligations with respect to letters of credit supporting Indebtedness
 
otherwise included in the determination of such particular amount shall not be included and (z) any Liens granted pursuant to the equal and ratable provisions referred to in Section 4.09 shall not be treated as Indebtedness.

(d) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary Guarantor will Incur any Indebtedness if such Indebtedness is subordinate in right of payment to any other Indebtedness unless such Indebtedness is also subordinate in right of payment to the Securities or the applicable Security Guarantee to the same extent.
(e) The Company will not permit any Regulated Subsidiary (x) to Incur any Indebtedness the proceeds of which are not invested in the business of such Bank Regulated Subsidiary (or any Subsidiary of such Bank Regulated Subsidiary) or such Broker Dealer Regulated Subsidiary (or any Subsidiary of such Broker Dealer Regulated Subsidiary which is also a Regulated Subsidiary) and (y) to Incur any Indebtedness for the purpose, directly or indirectly, of dividending or distributing the proceeds of such Indebtedness to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; except that the Incurrence of Indebtedness by a Regulated Subsidiary that does not comply with (x) or (y) above shall be permitted provided that such Incurrence complies with paragraph (a) of this Section 4.03 as if such paragraph applied to such Regulated Subsidiary.

The Trustee may also place an appropriate notation on any Security thereafter authenticated. However, the effectiveness of the amendment, supplement or waiver is not affected by any failure to annotate or exchange Securities in this fashion.
Section 9.04. The Trustee shall be provided with, and will be fully protected in conclusively relying upon, an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of any amendment, supplement or waiver authorized pursuant to this Article is authorized or permitted by this Indenture. If the Trustee has received such an Opinion of Counsel, it shall sign the amendment, supplement or waiver so long as the same does not adversely affect the rights of the Trustee. The Trustee may, but is not obligated to, execute any amendment, supplement or waiver that affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture.

The Guarantors hereby agree that their obligations hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Securities or this Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder of the Securities with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the Company, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor.

Section 10.02. . Each Subsidiary Guarantor, and by its acceptance of Securities, each Holder, hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such parties that the Guarantee of such Guarantor not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to any Guarantee.

Limitation on Conversion
 
 
For purposes of the above subsection (i), the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned or held by a Holder and its Affiliates shall include the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities (and any other securities that are exercisable for, exchangeable for or convertible into Common Stock and held by such Holder and its Affiliates) with respect to which a conversion notice has been given, but shall exclude the number of shares of Common Stock which would be issuable upon (I) conversion of the remaining, unconverted portion of the Securities beneficially owned by such Holder or any of its Affiliates, and (II) exercise, exchange or conversion of the unexercised, unexchanged or
 
unconverted portion of any other securities of the Company beneficially owned by such Holder or any of its Affiliates that are subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this Section 12.01, beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act of 1934.
For purposes of the above subsections (i) and (ii), in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as reflected in the most recent of (x) the Company's most recent Form 10-K, Form 10-Q or Form 8-K, as the case may be, (y) a public announcement by the Company or (z) notice by the Company or the transfer agent for the Common Stock setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding.

Section 12.02.
Exercise of Conversion Privilege.
(a) Subject to subsection (b) below, the Company shall satisfy the Conversion Obligation with respect to each $1,000 principal amount of Securities tendered for conversion in shares of fully paid Common Stock by delivering (i) for any conversion prior to August 26, 2019, on the third Business Day following the relevant Conversion Date or (ii) for any conversion on or after August 26, 2019, on the Maturity Date, in each case, a number of shares of Common Stock equal to 1) the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be converted divided by 2) the Conversion Price in effect on the relevant Conversion Date; provided further that the Company will deliver cash in lieu of fractional shares of Common Stock as provided in Section 12.03.
(b) Before any Holder of a Securities shall be entitled to convert the same as set forth above, such Holder shall 1) in the case of a Global Securities, comply with the procedures of the Depositary in effect at that time and, if required, pay all taxes or duties, if any, and 2) in the case of a Security issued in certificated form, (a) complete and manually sign and deliver an irrevocable written notice to the Conversion Agent in the form set forth in Exhibit A (or a facsimile thereof) (a "Notice of Conversion") at the office of the Conversion Agent and shall state in writing therein the principal amount of Securities to be converted and the name or names (with addresses) in which such Holder wishes the certificate or certificates for any shares of Common Stock, if any, to be delivered upon settlement of the Conversion Obligation to be registered, (b) surrender such Securities, duly endorsed to the Company or in blank (and accompanied by appropriate endorsement and transfer documents), at the office of the Conversion Agent, (c) if required, pay all transfer or similar taxes or duties and (d) if required, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer document. A Security shall be deemed to have been converted immediately prior to the close of business on the date (the "Conversion Date") that the Holder has complied with the requirements set forth in this subsection (b).
No Notice of Conversion with respect to any Securities may be tendered by a Holder thereof if such Holder has also tendered a Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice and not validly withdrawn such Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 11.01.
If more than one Security shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same Holder, the Conversion Obligation with respect to such Securities, if any, that shall be payable upon conversion shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities (or specified portions thereof to the extent permitted thereby) so surrendered.
(c) Delivery of the amounts owing in satisfaction of the Conversion Obligation shall be made by the Company in no event later than the date specified in subsections (a) or (b), as applicable, of this Section 12.02. The Company shall make such delivery by paying the cash amount owed, if any, to the Holder of the Security surrendered for conversion, or such Holder's
 
nominee or nominees, and/or by issuing, or causing to be issued, and delivering to such Holder, or such Holder's nominee or nominees, certificates or a book-entry transfer through the Depositary for the number of full shares of Common Stock, if any, to which such Holder shall be entitled as part of such Conversion Obligation (together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares).
(d) In case any Security shall be surrendered for partial conversion, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall, as provided in a Company Order, authenticate and deliver to or upon the written order of the Holder of the Security so surrendered, without charge to such Holder, a new Security or Securities in authorized denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unconverted portion of the surrendered Securities.
(e) If a Holder submits a Security for conversion, the Company shall pay all stamp and other duties, if any, which may be imposed by the United States or any political subdivision thereof or taxing authority thereof or therein with respect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock, if any, upon the conversion. However, the Holder shall pay any such tax which is due because the Holder requests any shares of Common Stock to be issued in a name other than the Holder's name. The Company may refuse to deliver the certificates representing the shares of Common Stock being issued in a name other than the Holder's name until the Company receives a sum sufficient to pay any tax which will be due because the shares are to be issued in a name other than the Holder's name. Nothing herein shall preclude any tax withholding required by law or regulations.
(f) Except as provided in Section 12.04, no adjustment shall be made for dividends on any shares issued upon the conversion of any Security as provided in this Article.
(g) Upon the conversion of an interest in a Global Security, the Trustee, or the custodian at the direction of the Trustee, shall make a notation on such Global Security as to the reduction in the principal amount represented thereby. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of any conversion of Securities effected through any Conversion Agent other than the Trustee.
Section 12.03. .
Fractions of Shares
No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of any Security or Securities. If more than one Security shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same Holder, the number of full shares which shall be issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities (or specified portions thereof) so surrendered. Instead of any fractional share of Common Stock that would otherwise be issuable upon conversion of any Security or Securities (or specified portions thereof), the Company shall calculate and pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fraction (calculated to the nearest
 1
/
100
th of a share) based on the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Conversion Date or if the Conversion Date is not on a Trading Day, the next following Trading Day.
Section 12.04.
Adjustment of Conversion Price.
The Conversion Price shall be adjusted from time to time by the Company as follows; provided that the Company shall not make any adjustments to the Conversion Price if Holders (as a result of holding the Securities, and at the same time as common stockholders participate) in any of the transactions described below as if such Holders held a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the, the principal amount of Securities held by such Holders divided by the then-applicable Conversion Price, without having to convert their Securities:
(a) In case the Company shall issue shares of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution on shares of the Common Stock, or the Company shall effect a share split or share combination, the Conversion Price shall be multiplied by the following fraction:
OS
0
/OS'
 
where,
OS
0
= the number of shares of Common Stock that will be outstanding immediately prior to the close of business on the record date for such dividend or distribution as of the effective date of such share split or combination, as the case may be; and
OS' = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the record date for such dividend or distribution and immediately after giving effect to such dividend or distribution or immediately after the effective date of such share split or combination, as the case may be.
Any adjustment made pursuant to this subsection (a) shall become effective on the date that is immediately after (x) the record date for such dividend or other distribution, or (y) the date on which such split or combination becomes effective, as applicable. If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 12.04(a) is declared but not paid or made, the Conversion Price shall be readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay such dividend or distribution, or split or combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock, as the case may be, to the Conversion Price that would then be in effect if such dividend, distribution had not been declared.
(b) In case the Company shall distribute to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock any rights or warrants (other than, as described below, rights distributed pursuant to a shareholder rights plan) entitling them for a period of not more than 45 days after the date of such distribution to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the average of Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock on the ten Trading Days immediately preceding the time of announcement of such distribution, the Conversion Price shall be multiplied by the following fraction:
(OS
0
+ Y) / (OS
0
+ X)
where,
OS
0
= the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the close of business on the record date for such distribution;
X = the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to such rights or warrants; and
Y = the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the aggregate price payable to exercise such rights or warrants divided by the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of public announcement for the issuance of such rights or warrants.
 
For purposes of this subsection (b), in determining whether any rights or warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at less than such average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock, and in determining the aggregate exercise or conversion price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Company for such rights or warrants and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors. If any right or warrant described in this paragraph (b) is not exercised or converted prior to the expiration of the exercisability or convertibility thereof, the new Conversion Price shall be readjusted to the Conversion Price that would have been in effect if our right or warrant had not been issued.
(c) In case the Company shall distribute shares of any class of Capital Stock of the Company, evidences of its indebtedness or other assets or property of the Company to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock (but excluding dividends or distributions referred to in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section 12.04, dividends or distributions paid exclusively in cash referred to in subsection (d) of this Section 12.04, and distributions described below in this subsection (c) with respect to Spin-Offs) (any of such shares of Capital Stock, indebtedness, or other asset or property hereinafter in this subsection (c) called the "Distributed Property"), then, in each such case the Conversion Price shall be multiplied by the following fraction:
(SP
0
 FMV) / SP
0
where,
SP
0
= the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Date for such distribution; and
FMV = the fair market value of the shares of Capital Stock, evidences of indebtedness, assets or property distributed with respect to each outstanding share of Common Stock on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution, as determined by the Board of Directors.
With respect to an adjustment pursuant to this subsection (c) where there has been a payment of a dividend or other distribution to the holders of the Common Stock in shares of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar equity interest, of or relating to a Subsidiary or other Company business unit (a "Spin-Off"), the Conversion Price in effect immediately before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the 10th Trading Day immediately following, and including, the effective date of the Spin-Off shall be multiplied by the following fraction:
MP
0
/ (FMV
0
+ MP
0
)
where,
FMV
0
= the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Capital Stock or similar equity interest distributed to holders of Common Stock applicable to one share of Common Stock over the first 10 consecutive Trading Day period immediately following the effective date of the Spin-Off; and
 
MP
0
= the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock over the first 10 consecutive Trading Day period immediately following the effective date of the Spin-Off.
Such adjustment shall occur on the 10th Trading Day from the effective date of the Spin-Off; provided that in respect of any conversion within the 10 Trading Days immediately following, and including, the effective date of any Spin-Off, references in this subsection (c) with respect to the Spin-Off to 10 Trading Days shall be deemed replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed between the effective date of such Spin-Off and the Conversion Date in determining the applicable Conversion Price.
If any such dividend or distribution described in this subsection (c) is declared but not paid or made, the Conversion Price shall be readjusted to be the Conversion Price that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
(d) In case the Company shall pay any cash dividends or distributions to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock, the Conversion Price shall be multiplied by the following fraction:
(SP
0
 C) / SP
0
where,
SP

= the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Date for such distribution;
C = the amount in cash per share the Company distributes to holders of Common Stock in such distribution.
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the record date for such dividend or distribution. If any such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Price shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Price that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
(e) In case the Company or any of its Subsidiaries make a payment in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for Common Stock, to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock exceeds the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as it may be amended), the Conversion Price shall be multiplied by the following fraction:
(OS
0
x SP') / (AC + (SP' x OS'))
where,
AC = the aggregate value of all cash and any other consideration as determined by the Board of Directors paid or payable for shares purchased in such tender or exchange offer;
OS
0
= the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the date such tender or exchange offer expires;
 
OS' = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after the date such tender or exchange offer expires (after giving effect to such tender offer or exchange offer); and
SP' = the Last Reported Sale Price of Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the date such tender or exchange offer expires.
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after close of business on the Trading Day next succeeding the date such tender or exchange offer expires.
(f) No adjustment to the Conversion Price shall be made if the application of any of the formulas set forth in this Section 12.04 (other than in connection with a share combination) would result in an increase in the Conversion Price.
For purposes of this Section 12.04 the term "Record Date" shall mean, with respect to any dividend, distribution or other transaction or event in which the holders of Common Stock have the right to receive any cash, securities or other property or in which the Common Stock (or other applicable security) is exchanged for or converted into any combination of cash, securities or other property, the date fixed for determination of shareholders entitled to receive such cash, securities or other property (whether such date is fixed by the Board of Directors or by statute, contract or otherwise).
In addition to any increases to the Conversion Price required by subsections (a), (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this Section 12.04, and to the extent permitted by applicable law and the rules of the Nasdaq Global Select Stock Market or any other securities exchange on which the Common Stock is then listed, the Company from time to time may decrease the Conversion Price by any amount for a period of at least 20 calendar days if the Board of Directors determines that such increase would be in the Company's best interest. Whenever the Conversion Price is decreased pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Company shall mail to the Holder of each Security at his last address appearing on the register and the Trustee a notice of the increase at least 15 calendar days prior to the date the decreased Conversion Price takes effect, and such notice shall state the decreased Conversion Price and the period during which it will be in effect. In addition, the Company may also (but is not required to) decrease the Conversion Price to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock in connection with any dividend or distribution of shares (or rights to acquire shares) or similar event.
(g) Without limiting the foregoing, no adjustment to the Conversion Price will be made:
 
 
 
 
(h) All calculations and other determinations under this Article shall be made by the Company and shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one-ten thousandth (
 1
/
10,000
) of a share, as the case may be.
(i) For purposes of this Section 12.04, the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock.
(j) With respect to a conversion of Securities pursuant to this Article, at and after the close of business on the Conversion Date (each such day the "Relevant Date"), the Person in whose name any certificate representing any shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion is registered shall be treated as a stockholder of record of the Company on such Relevant Date. On and after the Conversion Date with respect to a conversion of Securities pursuant hereto, all rights of the Holders of such Securities shall terminate, other than the right to receive the consideration deliverable upon conversion of such Securities as provided herein. A Holder of a Security is not entitled, as such, to any rights of a holder of Common Stock until, if such Holder converts such Security and is entitled pursuant hereto to receive shares of Common Stock in respect of such conversion, the close of business on the Relevant Date or respective Relevant Dates, as the case may be, with respect to such conversion.
(k) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment to the Conversion Price will be required unless the adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% of the Conversion Price. However, the Company will carry forward any adjustments that are less than 1% of the Conversion Price that the Company elects not to make and take them into account upon the earlier of (i) any conversion of Securities, regardless of whether the aggregate adjustment is less than 1% upon any Conversion Date and (ii) such time as all adjustments that have not been made prior thereto would have the effect of adjusting the Conversion Price by at least 1%.
Section 12.05.
Notice of Adjustments of Conversion Price.
Whenever the Conversion Price is adjusted as herein provided:
(a) the Company shall compute the adjusted Conversion Price in accordance with Section 12.04 and shall prepare a certificate signed by the Chief Financial Officer of the Company setting forth the adjusted Conversion Price and showing in reasonable detail the facts upon which such adjustment is based, and such certificate shall promptly be filed with the Trustee and with each Conversion Agent (if other than the Trustee); and
(b) upon each such adjustment, a notice stating that the Conversion Price has been adjusted and setting forth the adjusted Conversion Price shall be required, such notice shall be provided by the Company to all Holders in accordance with Section 11.03.
Neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be under any duty or responsibility with respect to any such certificate or the information and calculations contained therein, except to exhibit the same to any Holder of Securities desiring inspection thereof at its office during normal business hours.
 
Section 12.06.
Company to Reserve Common Stock.
The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock, for the purpose of effecting the conversion of Securities, the full number of shares of Common Stock then issuable upon the conversion of all Outstanding Securities.
Section 12.07.
Taxes on Conversions.
Except as provided in the next sentence, the Company shall pay all documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax due that may be payable in respect of the issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock on conversion of Securities pursuant hereto. The Company shall not, however, be required to pay any tax or duty that may be payable in respect of (i) income of the Holder, or (ii) any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that of the Holder of the Security or Securities to be converted, and no such issue or delivery shall be made unless and until the Person requesting such issue has paid to the Company the amount of any such tax or duty, or has established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax or duty has been paid.
Section 12.08.
Certain Covenants.
Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment reducing the Conversion Price below the then par value, if any, of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities, the Company shall take all corporate action which it reasonably determines may be necessary in order that the Company may validly and legally issue shares of such Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Price.
The Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of Securities shall be fully paid and non-assessable by the Company and free from all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue thereof.
The Company further covenants that if at any time the Common Stock shall be listed for trading on any other national securities exchange the Company shall, if permitted and required by the rules of such exchange, list and keep listed, so long as the Common Stock shall be so listed on such exchange, all Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities.
Section 12.09.
Cancellation of Converted Securities.
All Securities surrendered for the purpose of payment, repurchase, conversion or registration of transfer, shall, if surrendered to the Company or any Paying Agent or any Security Registrar, be surrendered to the Trustee and promptly canceled by it, or, if surrendered to the Trustee, shall be promptly canceled by it, and no Securities shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly permitted by any of the provisions of this Indenture. The Trustee shall dispose of canceled Securities in accordance with its customary procedures and shall upon request promptly provide copies of all cancelled certificates to the Company. If the Company shall acquire any of the Securities, such acquisition shall not operate as satisfaction of the debt represented by such Securities unless and until the same are delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.
 
Section 12.10. .
Provision in Case of Effect of Reclassification, Consolidation, Merger or Sale
In the event of (i) any reclassification or change of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a split, subdivision or combination), (ii) any consolidation, binding share exchange, recapitalization, reclassification, merger, acquisition, combination or other similar event of the Company with another Person or (iii) any sale, transfer or conveyance of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company to any other Person, in each case as a result of which holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive cash, securities or other property or assets with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock (any such event described in clauses (i) through (iii) a "Merger Event"), then:
(a) the Company or the successor or purchasing Person, as the case may be, shall execute with the Trustee a supplemental indenture (which shall comply with the Trust Indenture Act as in force at the date of execution of such supplemental indenture if such supplemental indenture is then required to so comply) permitted under Section 9.01 providing for the conversion and settlement of the Securities as set forth in this Indenture. Such supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Article and the Trustee may conclusively rely on the determination by the Company of the equivalency of such adjustments. If, in the case of any Merger Event, the Reference Property includes shares of stock or other securities and assets of a company other than the successor or purchasing company, as the case may be, in such change of control, consolidation, binding share exchange, recapitalization, reclassification, merger, acquisition, combination, sale, transfer or conveyance, then such supplemental indenture shall also be executed by such other company and shall contain such additional provisions to protect the interests of the Holders of the Securities as the Board of Directors shall reasonably consider necessary by reason of the foregoing.
In the event a supplemental indenture is executed pursuant to this Section 12.10, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee an Officers' Certificate briefly stating the reasons therefore, the kind or amount of cash, securities or property or assets that will constitute the Reference Property after any such Merger Event, any adjustment to be made with respect thereto and that all conditions precedent have been complied with, and shall promptly mail notice thereof to all Holders.
If any securities to be provided for the purpose of conversion of Securities hereunder require registration with or approval of any governmental authority under any federal or state law before such securities may be validly issued upon conversion, each supplemental indenture executed pursuant to this Section shall provide that the Company or the successor or the purchasing Person, as the case may be, or if the Reference Property includes shares of stock or other securities and assets of a company other than the successor or purchasing company, as the case may be, then such company, shall use all commercially reasonable efforts, to the extent then permitted by the rules and interpretations of the SEC (or any successor thereto), to secure such registration or approval in connection with the conversion of Securities.
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 12.02(a) to (b), and subject to the provisions of Section 12.01 at the effective time of such Merger Event, a Holder will be entitled thereafter to elect to convert each $1,000 principal amount of Securities into the same type of consideration that a holder of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the quotient of $1,000 and the applicable Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such transaction (the "Reference Property"). For purposes of the foregoing, the type and amount of consideration that a Holder would have been entitled to receive if the Holder had held Common Stock in the case of any such transaction that causes the Company's Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive more than a single type of consideration (determined based in part upon any form of
 
stockholder election) will be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the Holders of the Company's Common Stock that affirmatively make such an election.
(c) The Company shall cause notice of the execution of a supplemental indenture required by this Section 12.10 to be mailed to each Holder, at his address appearing on the register, or by such other means reasonably acceptable to such Holder, within 20 calendar days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such supplemental indenture.
(d) The above provisions of this Section shall similarly apply to successive Merger Events.
Section 12.11.
Responsibility of Trustee for Conversion Provisions.
The Trustee and any Conversion Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder of Securities to determine whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the Conversion Price, or with respect to the nature or extent of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed, herein or in any supplemental indenture provided to be employed, in making the same, or whether a supplemental indenture need be entered into. Neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any Common Stock, or of any other securities or property or cash, which may at any time be issued or delivered upon the conversion of any Securities; and it or they do not make any representation with respect thereto. Neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be responsible for any failure of the Company to make or calculate any cash payment or to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock or share certificates or other securities or property or cash upon the surrender of any Security for the purpose of conversion; and the Trustee and any Conversion Agent shall not be responsible for any failure of the Company to comply with any of the covenants of the Company contained in this Article.
Section 12.12.
Right to Set-off Withholding Taxes.
The Company may, at its option, set-off withholding taxes due with respect to Securities against delivery of Common Stock on the Securities. In the case of any such set-off against Common Stock delivered upon conversion of the Securities, such Common Stock shall be valued based on the arithmetic average of the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock in the 5 Trading Days immediately preceding the conversion.
Section 12.13. To the extent that the Company has a rights plan in effect, each share of Common Stock issued upon conversion of a Security pursuant to this Article 12 shall be entitled to receive, in addition to any of the Company's Common Stock and in lieu of any adjustment to the conversion price, the appropriate number of rights, if any, and the certificates representing the Common Stock issued upon such conversion shall bear such legends, if any, in each case as may be provided by the terms of any shareholder rights plan adopted by the Company, as the same may be amended from time to time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if prior to the conversion, the rights have separated from the Company's Common Stock, the applicable conversion price will be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Company distributed to all holders of the Company's Common Stock, shares of the Company's capital stock, evidences of indebtedness or assets as described in Section 12.04 above, subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such rights.

E*TRADE Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company", which term includes any successor under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, promises to pay to             , or its registered assigns, the principal sum [of [            ] DOLLARS ($[            ])] [IF THIS DEBENTURE IS A GLOBAL SECURITY, THEN INSERTset forth on the Principal Schedule attached hereto] on August 31, 2019.
Payment of the principal of this Security will be made at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose, which shall initially be the principal corporate trust office of The Bank of New York Mellon in New York, New York, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts.

2. . (a) This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of the Company designated as its Class [] Senior Convertible Debentures due 2019 (herein called the "Securities") issued under an Indenture dated as of August 25, 2009 (as amended from time to time, the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee.

Within 30 days of the occurrence of a Fundamental Change, the Company or, at the written request of the Company, the Trustee shall mail to all Holders of record of the Securities a notice of the occurrence of a Fundamental Change and of the repurchase right arising as a result thereof after the occurrence of any Fundamental Change.

5. The Securities are in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 principal amount and any multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. A Holder may register the transfer or exchange of Securities in accordance with the Indenture. The Trustee may require a Holder to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. Pursuant to the Indenture, there are certain periods during which the Trustee will not be required to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Security or certain portions of a Security.
Registered Form; Denominations; Transfer; Exchange.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of this Security is payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

6. . Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Security is entitled, at his option, at any time prior to the close of business on the second Scheduled Trading Day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, to convert this Security (or any portion of the principal amount hereof which is $1,000 or a multiple thereof), at the principal amount hereof, or of such portion, into a number of fully paid and non-assessable shares (calculated as to each conversion to the nearest
Conversion

/
100
of a share) of Common Stock of the Company equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the principal amount to be converted by (ii) the Conversion Price specified in the Indenture, by surrender of this Security together with a Notice of Conversion, a form of which is set forth in Section 2.05, as provided in the Indenture and this debenture, duly endorsed or assigned to the Company or in blank, to the Company at its office or agency, which shall be initially the principal corporate trust office of The Bank of New York Mellon in New York, New York, and, unless the shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion are to be issued in the same name as this debenture, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company or its agent duly executed by, the Holder or by his duly authorized attorney, or if less than the entire principal amount hereof is to be converted, the portion hereof to be converted. Subject to the aforesaid requirement for payment, no payment or adjustment is to be made on conversion for dividends on the Common Stock issued on conversion. No fractions of shares or scrip representing fractions of shares will be issued on conversion, but instead of any fractional interest the Company shall pay a cash adjustment as provided in the Indenture. The Conversion Price is subject to adjustment as provided in the Indenture. In addition, the Indenture provides that in case of certain consolidations or mergers to which the Company is a party or the transfer of substantially all of the assets of the Company, the Indenture shall be amended, without the consent of any Holders of Securities, so that this Security, if then outstanding, will be convertible thereafter, during the period this Security shall be convertible as specified above, into the same type of consideration that a holder of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Common Stock obtained by dividing the aggregate principal amount of this Security by the Conversion Price immediately prior to such transaction would have owned or been entitled to receive. In the event of conversion of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities for the unconverted portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
 
7. If an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Securities may declare all the Securities to be due and payable. If a bankruptcy or insolvency default with respect to the Company occurs and is continuing, the Securities automatically become due and payable. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Securities except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may require indemnity satisfactory to it before it enforces the Indenture or the Securities. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities then outstanding may direct the Trustee in its exercise of remedies.
Defaults and Remedies.
8. . Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture and the Notes may be amended, or default may be waived, with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes. Without notice to or the consent of any Holder, the Company and the Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture or the Notes to, among other things, cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency or make any change that in the good faith opinion of the Board of Directors does not materially and adversely affect the rights of any Holder.
