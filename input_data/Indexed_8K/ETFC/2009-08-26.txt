Explanatory Note
 
On August 25, 2009, the Company announced the closing of its debt exchange offer for certain of its outstanding interest-bearing notes (the "Exchange Offer"). In connection with the Exchange Offer, the Company issued an aggregate of $1,739,616,000 aggregate principal amount of zero coupon Class A Convertible Debentures due 2019 (the "Class A Debentures") and $2,255,000 aggregate principal amount of zero coupon Class B Convertible Debentures due 2019 (the "Class B Debentures" and, together with the Class A Debentures, the "Convertible Debentures") in exchange for $431,871,000 of the Company's 8% Senior Notes due 2011 and $1,310,000,000 of the Company's 12.5% Springing Lien Notes due 2017. The issuance of Convertible Debentures was exempt from registration under Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. This exemption was available to the Company because the Exchange Offer was conducted with the Company's existing security holders exclusively where no commission or other remuneration was paid or given directly or indirectly for soliciting the exchange of securities pursuant to the Exchange Offer.
The Class A Debentures and Class B Debentures will be convertible into shares of the Company's common stock at initial conversion prices of $1.0340 and $1.5510 per share, respectively, but are otherwise identical in all respects. Based upon their respective initial conversion prices, the Class A Debentures will be convertible into 1,682,413,926 shares of the Company's common stock and the Class B Debentures will be convertible into 1,453,900 shares of the Company's common stock.
The Company's previously filed press release dated August 25, 2009 related to the closing is incorporated herein by reference to Exhibit 99.1 of the Original 8-K.
