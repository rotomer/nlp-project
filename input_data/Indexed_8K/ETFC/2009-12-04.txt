On December 1, 2009,
E*TRADE
Financial
 Corporation
 (the Company) entered into employment agreements with its executive officers (other than the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer, who already has an employment agreement).  
The Companys compensation committee approved these employment agreements as part of its ongoing review of executive compensation in order to have consistent employment and severance terms among its executive officers and to ensure that those terms are consistent with current market practice.
 In addition to formalizing the employment terms, each agreement provides severance benefits (including change in control severance benefits) that are similar to the officers existing sevece and employment agreements described in the Companys most recently filed proxy statement, except that the officers severance benefits (outside of a change in control) will also include 12 months accelerated vesting.  Each employment agreement provides that if the officer is involuntary terminated without cause or resigns for good reason (including actions by the Company to materially decrease the officers salary or duties) and signs a release, the officer will receive a prorated bonus for the year of termination (based on actual performance for the year of termination), one times the sum of salary plus target bonus, 12 months of health benefits, and 12 months of accelerated vesting of equity awards.  If the termination occurs in connection with a change in control, the severance benefits will be two times the sum of

salary plus target bonus, 24 months of health benefits and full accelerated vesting of equity awards.  The employment agreements do not provide for tax reimbursement payments.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, hereunto duly authorized.
