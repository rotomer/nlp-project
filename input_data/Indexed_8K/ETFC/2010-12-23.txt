As announced on December 17, 2010, E*TRADE Financial Corporation (the Company) has appointed Matthew Audette as its Chief Financial Officer effective January 1, 2011.  On December 22, 2010, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Audette, effective upon his commencement as Chief Financial Officer.  Mr. Audettes compensation will include a $500,000 annual salary and an annual target cash bonus opportunity of $600,000, as well as annual equity award opportunities.  In connection with his promotion, he will receive stock options and restricted stock units with a total grant date value (based on the Companys practices for recognizing compensation expense) of approximately $750,000, which will vest annually over four years.  Mr. Audette will be provided with relocation benefits to be determined by the Company.  The employment agreement has the standard severance terms for the Companys executive officers, providing that if he is involuntary terminated without cause or resigns for good reason (including actions by the Company to materially decrease his salary or duties) and signs a release, he will receive a prorated bonus for the year of termination (based on actual performance for the year of termination), one times the sum of salary plus target bonus, 12 months of health benefits, and 12 months of accelerated vesting of equity awards.  If the termination occurs in connection with a change in control, the severance benefits will be two times the sum of salary plus target bonus, 24 months of health benefits and full accelerated vesting of equity awards.
