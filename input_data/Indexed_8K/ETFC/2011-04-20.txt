E*TRADE Financial Corporation (NASDAQ: ETFC) today announced results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2011, reporting net income of $45 million, or $0.16 per share, compared with a net loss of $24 million, or $0.11 loss per share, in the prior quarter and a net loss of $48 million, or $0.25 loss per share, in the first quarter of 2010. The company reported total net revenue of $537 million for the first quarter, compared with $518 million in the prior quarter and $537 million in the year-ago period.
E*TRADE is off to a terrific start in 2011, said Steven Freiberg, Chief Executive Officer of E*TRADE Financial Corporation. Our first quarter results benefited from strength in our brokerage franchise, growth in both interest and non-interest revenue, positive loan performance trends and ongoing expense management. We reported impressive sequential and year-over-year growth in DARTs, brokerage accounts and margin receivables, and net new brokerage assets of $3.9 billion were the highest weve ever recorded. With increased capacity to invest in the franchise, continued improvement in loan performance trends and a focus on expenses, E*TRADE is well positioned for growth.
E*TRADE reported DARTs of 177,000 during the quarter, an increase of 18 percent from the prior quarter and an increase of 14 percent versus the same quarter a year ago.
At quarter end, the company reported 4.3 million customer accounts, which included 2.7 million brokerage accounts. Net new brokerage accounts were 51,000 during the quarter compared with 28,000 in the prior quarter and 2,000 in the first quarter of 2010.
The company ended the quarter with $189 billion in total customer assets, compared with $176 billion in the prior quarter.
During the quarter, net new brokerage assets were positive $3.9 billion, the highest level on record by the company. Brokerage related cash increased by $1.4 billion to $25.9 billion during the period, while customers were net buyers of approximately $2.3 billion of securities. Average margin receivables increased 10 percent sequentially from $4.9 billion to $5.4 billion.
Net operating interest income for the first quarter was $310 million, reflecting a net interest spread of 2.84 percent on average interest-earning assets of $42.7 billion. The $5 million sequential increase in net operating interest income resulted from a $1.3 billion increase in average interest-earning assets, reflecting the increase in brokerage customer cash.
Commissions, fees and service charges, principal transactions, and other revenue in the first quarter were $201 million, compared with $181 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. This reflected the sequential increase in trading activity. Average commission per trade was $11.32, a slight decline sequentially from $11.37 in the fourth quarter.
Total net revenue in the quarter also included $26 million of net gains on loans and securities, including net impairment of $6 million.
Total operating expense declined two percent, or $7 million, to $298 million from the prior quarter, and included a seasonal increase in advertising spend and $4 million in restructuring expenses. Mr. Freiberg commented: We are committed to managing expenses in line with 2010 levels, while, at the same time, investing in the franchise. Our advertising spend is driving meaningful results and our sales force, which we plan to grow by 35 percent this year, is focused on building and extending relationships with retail investors and with corporate clients of our equity compensation solutions business. We believe these initiatives will drive profitable growth and shareholder value.
The companys loan portfolio contracted by $0.9 billion from the prior quarter, including $0.7 billion related to prepayments or scheduled principal reductions. First quarter provision for loan losses decreased $78 million from the prior quarter to $116 million.
Net charge-offs in the quarter were $194 million, a decrease of $2 million from the prior quarter. The allowance for loan losses remained at $1.0 billion, or six percent of gross loans receivable, at quarter end.
For the companys entire loan portfolio, special mention delinquencies declined by 14 percent, and at-risk delinquencies declined by 11 percent in the quarter. As compared to the year-ago period, special mention delinquencies declined 34 percent and at-risk delinquencies declined 33 percent.
As of March 31, 2011, the company reported E*TRADE Bank Tier 1 capital ratios of 7.54 percent to total adjusted assets and 14.29 percent to risk-weighted assets. E*TRADE Bank had excess risk-based total capital (, above the level regulators define as well-capitalized) of $1.3 billion at quarter end.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Reporting Changes
All prior periods have been adjusted to reflect the Companys 1-for-10 reverse stock split that became effective in the second quarter of 2010. See endnote (1) for line items that have been impacted by this change.
Explanation of Non-GAAP Measures and Certain Metrics
Management believes that tangible book value per share, corporate cash, EBITDA, interest coverage and Bank earnings before taxes and before credit losses are appropriate measures for evaluating the operating and liquidity performance of the Company. Management believes that adjusting GAAP measures by excluding or including certain items is helpful to investors and analysts who may wish to use some or all of this information to analyze our current performance, prospects and valuation. Management uses non-GAAP information internally to evaluate our operating performance and in formulating our budget for future periods.
Tangible Book Value per Share
Tangible book value per share represents shareholders equity less goodwill (net of related deferred tax liability) and other intangible assets divided by common stock outstanding. The Company believes that tangible book value per share is a measure of the Companys capital strength. See endnote (6) for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the comparable GAAP measure.
Corporate Cash
Corporate cash represents cash held at the parent company as well as cash held in certain subsidiaries that can distribute cash to the parent company without any regulatory approval. The Company believes that corporate cash is a useful measure of the parent companys liquidity as it is the primary source of capital above and beyond the capital deployed in our regulated subsidiaries. See our financial statements and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition that will be included in the periodic report the Company expects to file with the SEC with respect to the financial periods discussed herein for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the comparable GAAP measure.
EBITDA
EBITDA represents net income (loss) before taxes, depreciation and amortization and corporate interest expense. Management believes that EBITDA provides a useful additional measure of our performance by excluding certain non-cash charges and expenses that are not directly related to the performance of our business.
Interest Coverage
Interest coverage represents EBITDA divided by corporate interest expense. Management believes that by excluding the charges and expenses that are excluded from EBITDA, interest coverage provides a useful additional measure of our ability to continue to meet our interest obligations and our liquidity. See endnote (8) for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the comparable GAAP measure.
Bank Earnings Before Taxes and Before Credit Losses
Bank earnings before taxes and before credit losses represents the pre-tax earnings of E*TRADE Banks holding company, ETB Holdings, Inc. (Bank) before provision for loan losses, gains on loans and securities, net, net impairment and losses on early extinguishment of FHLB advances. This metric shows the amount of earnings that the Bank, after accruing for the interest expense on its trust preferred securities, generates each quarter prior to credit related losses, primarily provision and losses on securities. Management believes this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors and analysts as it is an indicator of the level of credit related losses the Bank can absorb without causing a decline in E*TRADE Banks excess risk-based capital. See endnote (9) for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the comparable GAAP measure.
It is important to note these metrics and other non-GAAP measures may involve judgment by management and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, net income (loss), consolidated statements of cash flows, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. For additional information on the adjustments to these non-GAAP measures, please see our financial statements and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition that will be included in the periodic report the Company expects to file with the SEC with respect to the financial periods discussed herein.
ENDNOTES
(1) All prior periods have been adjusted to reflect the Companys 1-for-10 reverse stock split that became effective in the second quarter of 2010. Financial information impacted by this capital change includes EPS, weighted average shares, outstanding shares, common stock and APIC.
(2) Because the Company reported a net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2010 and March 31, 2010, the calculation of diluted net loss per share does not include common stock equivalents as they are anti-dilutive and would result in a reduction of net loss per share.
(3) Reflects elimination of transactions between Trading and Investing and Balance Sheet Management segments, which includes deposit and intercompany transfer pricing arrangements.
(4) Amounts and percentages may not calculate due to rounding.
(5) Operating margin is the percentage of net revenue that results in income (loss) before other income (expense) and income taxes. The percentage is calculated by dividing income (loss) before other income (expense) and income taxes by total net revenue.
(6) The following tables provide a reconciliation of GAAP book value and book value per share to non-GAAP tangible book value and tangible book value per share (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts):
(7) Enterprise net interest spread is the taxable equivalent rate earned on average enterprise interest-earning assets less the rate paid on average enterprise interest-bearing liabilities, excluding corporate interest-earning assets and liabilities and customer cash held by third parties.
(8) Interest coverage represents the ratio of the Companys EBITDA to its corporate interest expense. The interest coverage ratio based on the Companys net income was 1.0, (0.6) and (1.2) for the three months ended March 31, 2011, December 31, 2010 and March 31, 2010, respectively.
(9) Bank earnings before taxes and before credit losses represents the pre-tax earnings of E*TRADE Banks holding company, ETB Holdings, Inc. (Bank) before provision for loan losses, gains on loans and securities, net, net impairment and losses on early extinguishment of FHLB advances. This metric shows the amount of earnings that the Bank, after accruing for the interest expense on its trust preferred securities, generates each quarter prior to credit related losses, primarily provision and loss on securities. Management believes this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors and analysts as it is an indicator of the level of credit related losses the Bank can absorb without causing a decline in E*TRADE Banks excess risk-based capital. Below is a reconciliation of Bank earnings before taxes and before credit losses from loss before income taxes (dollars in thousands):
(a)
Excess risk-based capital is the excess capital that E*TRADE Bank has compared to the regulatory minimum well-capitalized threshold.
(a)
Non-bank loss represents all of the Companys subsidiaries, including Corporate, but excluding the Bank.
(b)
(10) These metrics have been updated for prior periods to exclude international local activity.
(11) Net new customer assets are total inflows to all new and existing customer accounts less total outflows from all closed and existing customer accounts. The net new banking assets and net new brokerage assets metrics treat asset flows between E*TRADE entities in the same manner as unrelated third party accounts.
(12) Capital ratios are at the E*TRADE Bank level. The ratios and excess capital amounts are Q111 estimates based on the regulatory minimum well-capitalized threshold. Below is a reconciliation of beginning E*TRADE Bank excess risk-based capital to ending E*TRADE Bank excess risk-based capital for the quarterly periods presented:
The capital release from loan portfolio run-off includes the decrease in risk-based capital required for our one- to four-family, home equity and consumer loan portfolios.

(b)
Represents the capitalimpact related to changes in other risk-weighted assets.

The following table shows the total amount of charge-offs on loans that are still held by the Company as of the periods presented (dollars in millions):
(14) Includes unpaid principal balances and premiums (discounts).
(15) The TDR loan performance detail is a subset of the Companys total loan performance.
(16) The total expected loss on TDRs includes both the previously recorded charge-offs and the specific valuation allowance.
(17) Excludes loans to customers on margin.
(18) Gross-up for tax-exempt securities.
(19) Includes interest earned on average customer assets of $3.6 billion, $3.3 billion and $3.1 billion for the quarters ended March 31, 2011, December 31, 2010 and March 31, 2010, respectively, held by parties outside E*TRADE Financial, including third party money market funds and sweep deposit accounts at unaffiliated financial institutions.
