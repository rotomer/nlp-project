On May 19, 2011, E*TRADE Financial Corporation (the "Company") expects to consummate the issuance and sale of $435,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 6 3/4 % Senior Notes due 2016 (the "Notes") pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") dated May 16, 2011 between the Company and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as underwriter (the "Underwriter"). The Notes are to be issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of May 19, 2011 (the "Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"). The Company will use the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes to redeem all of its outstanding 7.375% Senior Notes due 2013 (the "2013 Notes"), totaling approximately $414.7 aggregate principal amount, including paying the associated redemption premiums, accrued interest and related fees and expenses.
The offering of the Notes was registered pursuant to the Company's shelf registration statement (the "Registration Statement") on Form S-3, as amended (File No. 333-158636) and a related prospectus supplement, in each case filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A copy of the Underwriting Agreement is filed as Exhibit 1.1 and a copy of the Indenture (including the form of Note filed as Exhibit 4.2) is filed as Exhibit 4.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, both of which are incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement. The descriptions of the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture in this report are summaries and are qualified in their entirety by the terms of the Underwriting Agreement and Indenture, respectively.
The Notes will bear interest at the rate of 6 3/4 % per annum and will mature on June 1, 2016. Interest on the Notes is payable in cash on June 1 and December 1 of each year beginning on December 1, 2011.
The Company may redeem the Notes at its option, in whole, at any time or in part from time to time, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed plus the "applicable premium" (as defined in the Indenture) as of, and accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the applicable redemption date. Upon a change of control, as defined in the Indenture, where the ratings of the Notes decline in connection with any such change in control, the Company will be required to make an offer to purchase the Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes on the date of purchase, plus accrued interest, if any, to but excluding the redemption date.
The Notes are general senior obligations of the Company and are not guaranteed by the subsidiaries through which the Company currently conducts substantially all of its operations. The Notes rank equal in right of payment with all of the Company's existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness, and rank senior in right of payment to all of the Company's existing and future subordinated indebtedness. It is expected that on or about June 15, 2011, the Company and certain of its "restricted subsidiaries" (as defined in the Indenture) will grant a security interest in its and these subsidiaries' assets (consisting primarily of the stock and equity interests in various subsidiaries, accounts receivable and other real and personal property) to secure its 12.5% Springing Lien Notes due 2017 ("Springing Lien Notes") and 0% Convertible Debentures due 2019 ("Convertible Debentures"). No security interest will be granted to the holders of the Notes.
The Indenture contains several restrictive covenants including, but not limited to the following: (i) limitations on incurrence of additional indebtedness and issuances of preferred stock, (ii) limitations on restricted payments, (iii) limitations on distributions from regulated subsidiaries and restricted subsidiaries, (iv) limitations on the issuance or sale of capital stock of regulated subsidiaries and restricted subsidiaries, (v) limitations on transactions with affiliates, (vi) limitations on asset sales and sale-leaseback transactions, (vii) future subsidiary guarantees and (viii) limitations on liens, subject in each case to certain exceptions.
The Indenture contains customary terms that upon certain events of default occurring and continuing, either the trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may declare the principal of the Notes and any accrued and unpaid interest through the date of such declaration immediately due and payable. In the case of certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency relating to Company, the principal amount of the Notes together with any accrued and unpaid interest through the occurrence of such event shall automatically become and be immediately due and payable.

The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but, if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in Sections 6(a) or 6(b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such Sections of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriter on the other, from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriter on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriter on the other, shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Securities to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriter in connection therewith bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriter on the other, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriter and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
, in lieu
(e) The Company and the Underwriter agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 6 were determined by allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 6(b) above.

statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
(f) The remedies provided for in this Section 6 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.

(1) the redemption date;
(2) the redemption price, including the portion thereof representing any accrued interest;
(3) the place or places where Notes are to be surrendered for redemption;
(4) Notes called for redemption must be so surrendered in order to collect the redemption price;
(5) on the redemption date the redemption price will become due and payable on Notes called for redemption, and interest on Notes called for redemption will cease to accrue on and after the redemption date;

(7) if any Note contains a CUSIP or CINS number, no representation is being made as to the correctness of the CUSIP or CINS number either as printed on the Notes or as contained in the notice of redemption and that the Holder should rely only on the other identification numbers printed on the Notes.
(c) Once notice of redemption is sent to the Holders, Notes called for redemption become due and payable at the redemption price on the redemption date, and upon surrender of the Notes called for redemption, the Company shall redeem such Notes at the redemption price. Commencing on the redemption date, Notes redeemed will cease to accrue interest. Upon surrender of any Note redeemed in part, the Holder will receive a new Note equal in principal amount to the unredeemed portion of the surrendered Note.
Section 4.01 . The Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes of any series on the dates and in the manner provided in the Notes of that series and this Indenture.

Maintenance of Office or Agency
The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Notes of one or more series may be presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, for such purposes.

The Trustee may, but is not obligated to, execute any amendment, supplement or waiver that affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Indenture.
Section 9.05 . Every supplemental indenture executed pursuant to this Article shall conform to the requirements of the TIA.

Payments for Consents
Section 10.01 . Subject to this Article X, each of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereby, jointly and severally, unconditionally guarantees to each Holder of a Note and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, irrespective of the validity and enforceability of this Indenture, the Notes or the obligations of the Company hereunder or thereunder, that: (a) the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes will be promptly paid in full when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, redemption or otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes, if any, if lawful, and all other obligations of the Company to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder will be promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof; and (b) in the case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Notes or any of such other obligations, that the same will be promptly paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise. Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed or any performance so guaranteed for whatever reason, the Subsidiary Guarantors shall be jointly and severally obligated to pay the same immediately. Each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that this is a guarantee of payment and not a guarantee of collection.
Guarantees
The Subsidiary Guarantors hereby agree that their obligations hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Notes or this Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder of the Notes with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the Company, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor. Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever and covenant that this Guarantee shall not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in the Notes and this Indenture or pursuant to Section 10.04.
If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors or any custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to either the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors, any amount paid by either to the Trustee or such Holder, this Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and effect.
 
Each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that it shall not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to the Holders in respect of any obligations guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all obligations guaranteed hereby. Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that, as between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article VI for the purposes of this Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby, and (y) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such obligations as provided in Article VI, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Subsidiary Guarantors for the purpose of this Guarantee. The Subsidiary Guarantors shall have the right to seek contribution from any non paying Subsidiary Guarantor so long as the exercise of such right does not impair the rights of the Holders under the Guarantee.
Section 10.02 . Each Subsidiary Guarantor, and by its acceptance of Notes, each Holder, hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such parties that the Guarantee of such Subsidiary Guarantor not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to any Guarantee. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Trustee, the Holders and the Subsidiary Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under its Guarantee and this Article X shall be limited to the maximum amount as will, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Subsidiary Guarantor that are relevant under such laws, and after giving effect to any collections from, rights to receive contribution from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Subsidiary Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Subsidiary Guarantor under this Article X, result in the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under its Guarantee to not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.
Limitation on Subsidiary Guarantor Liability
Section 10.03 . In the event that the Company is required to cause a Regulated Subsidiary or Restricted Subsidiary to guarantee the Notes pursuant to Section 4.07, the Company shall cause such Subsidiaries to execute supplemental indentures to this Indenture and Guarantees in accordance with Section 4.07 and this Article X, to the extent applicable.

Such successor Person thereupon may cause to be signed any or all of the Guarantees to be endorsed upon all of the Notes issuable hereunder which theretofore shall not have been signed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee.

This is one of the Notes issued under an Indenture dated as of May 19, 2011 (as amended from time to time, the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee. Capitalized terms used herein are used as defined in the Indenture unless otherwise indicated. The terms of the Notes include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act. The Notes are subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture and the Trust Indenture Act for a statement of all such terms. To the extent permitted by applicable law, in the event of any inconsistency between the terms of this Note and the terms of the Indenture, the terms of the Indenture will control.
The Notes are general unsecured obligations of the Company.
 
This Note is subject to optional redemption, and may be the subject of an Offer to Purchase, as further described in the Indenture. There is no sinking fund or mandatory redemption applicable to this Note.
 
If the Company deposits with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations sufficient to pay the then outstanding principal of, premium, if any, and accrued interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, the Company may in certain circumstances be discharged from the Indenture and the Notes or may be discharged from certain of its obligations under certain provisions of the Indenture.

If a bankruptcy or insolvency default with respect to the Company occurs and is continuing, the Notes automatically become due and payable. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may require indemnity satisfactory to it before it enforces the Indenture or the Notes.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special counsel for E*TRADE Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the Company's offering of $435,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 6.75 % Notes due 2016 (the "Notes") in an underwritten public offering pursuant to an underwriting agreement dated May 16, 2011 (the "Underwriting Agreement") between the Company and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (the "Underwriter"). The Notes are to be issued pursuant to an Indenture dated as of May 19, 2011 (the "Indenture") by and between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee.
We, as your counsel, have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records, certificates of public officials and other instruments as we have deemed necessary for the purposes of rendering this opinion.
On the basis of the foregoing, we advise you that, in our opinion, the Notes have been duly authorized in accordance with the Indenture, and, when executed and authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriter in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, concepts of reasonableness and equitable principles of general applicability; provided that we express no opinion as to (x) the enforceability of any waiver of rights under any usury or stay law or (y) any provision that purports to avoid the effect of fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or similar provision of applicable law by limiting the amount of any future subsidiary guarantor's obligation with respect to a guarantee of the Notes.
We are members of the Bars of the States of New York and California and the foregoing opinion is limited to the laws of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (including the statutory provisions, all applicable provisions of the Delaware Constitution and reported judicial decisions interpreting the foregoing).
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to a report on Form 8-K to be filed by the Company on the date hereof. In giving this consent, we do not admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act.
This opinion is rendered solely to you in connection with the above matter. This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose or relied upon by or furnished to any other person without our prior written consent.
Very truly yours,
