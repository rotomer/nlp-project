NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 20, 2011--E*TRADE Financial Corporation (NASDAQ: ETFC) today announced results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2011, reporting net income of $47 million, or $0.16 per share, compared with net income of $45 million, or $0.16 per share, in the prior quarter and net income of $35 million, or $0.12 per share, in the second quarter of 2010. The company reported total net revenue of $518 million for the second quarter, compared with $537 million in the prior quarter and $534 million in the year-ago period.
We are pleased with our second quarter performance, which reflected continued solid progress across the firm, said Steven Freiberg, Chief Executive Officer of E*TRADE Financial Corporation. While our brokerage results were affected by an industry-wide decline in trading activity, we have continued to experience positive momentum in a number of metrics, including the generation of new accounts and assets, the growth of margin receivables, and improvements in customer retention. Our Corporate Services group continues to build momentum, signing more than 30 new client contracts during the quarter and strengthening an important channel for future retail brokerage account growth. Within the loan portfolio, we experienced a continuation of improving delinquency trends, and continue to focus on risk mitigation activities to stem future losses. Collectively, our successes this quarter allow us to maintain focus on initiatives that we believe will further enhance the customer experience and create value for shareholders.
Mr. Freiberg continued: During the quarter we also accessed the capital markets to refinance our nearest maturity debt at an attractive rate, issuing $435 million of 6.75 percent notes due 2016, refinancing $415 million of 7.375 percent notes due 2013. This transaction makes our next maturity 2015, and affords us the flexibility to focus on other outstanding indebtedness.
E*TRADE reported DARTs of 148,000 during the quarter, a decrease of 17 percent from the prior quarter and a decrease of 13 percent versus the same quarter a year ago.
At quarter end, the company reported 4.3 million customer accounts, which included 2.8 million brokerage accounts. Net new brokerage accounts were 25,000 during the quarter compared with 51,000 in the prior quarter and 18,000 in the second quarter of 2010.
The company ended the quarter with $186 billion in total customer assets, compared with $189 billion in the prior quarter.
During the quarter, net new brokerage assets were positive $1.5 billion. Brokerage related cash increased by $0.4 billion to $26.3 billion during the period, while customers were net buyers of approximately $0.2 billion of securities. Average margin receivables increased six percent sequentially to $5.7 billion, an increase of 27 percent from the year-ago period.
Net operating interest income for the second quarter was $315 million, up from $310 million in the prior quarter and $302 million in the second quarter of 2010. Second quarter results reflected a net interest spread of 2.89 percent on average interest-earning assets of $42.9 billion. The five basis point sequential increase in spread resulted mainly from a reduction in non-performing loans, coupled with exceptional performance in the companys stock lending business in the quarter.
Commissions, fees and service charges, principal transactions, and other revenue in the second quarter were $174 million, compared with $201 million in the prior quarter. This reflected the sequential decline in trading activity, experienced across the industry. Average commission per trade was $11.14, compared with $11.32 in the prior quarter and $11.05 in the second quarter of 2010.
Total net revenue in the quarter also included $28 million of net gains on loans and securities, including net impairment of $3 million.
Total operating expense declined two percent, or $7 million, sequentially to $291 million.
The companys loan portfolio contracted by $0.7 billion from the prior quarter, including $0.6 billion related to prepayments and scheduled principal reductions. The second quarter provision for loan losses decreased $13 million from the prior quarter to $103 million.
Net charge-offs in the quarter were $178 million, a decrease of $15 million from the prior quarter. The allowance for loan losses at quarter end was $0.9 billion, or six percent of gross loans receivable.
For the companys entire loan portfolio, special mention delinquencies declined by nine percent sequentially, while total at-risk delinquencies declined by 13 percent. As compared to the year-ago period, special mention delinquencies declined 30 percent and total at-risk delinquencies declined 33 percent.
As of June 30, 2011, the company reported a consolidated Tier 1 common ratio of 8.4 percent, up from 6.5 percent at the end of the prior period and 5.3 percent at the end of the second quarter 2010. E*TRADE Bank ended the quarter with a Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.9 percent and a risk-based capital ratio of 16.2 percent.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Explanation of Non-GAAP Measures and Certain Metrics
Management believes that tangible book value per share, corporate cash, EBITDA, interest coverage, Bank earnings before taxes and before credit losses and E*TRADE Financial ratios are appropriate measures for evaluating the operating and liquidity performance of the Company. Management believes that adjusting GAAP measures by excluding or including certain items is helpful to investors and analysts who may wish to use some or all of this information to analyze our current performance, prospects and valuation. Management uses non-GAAP information internally to evaluate our operating performance and in formulating our budget for future periods.
Tangible Book Value per Share
Tangible book value per share represents shareholders equity less goodwill (net of related deferred tax liability) and other intangible assets divided by common stock outstanding. The Company believes that tangible book value per share is a measure of the Companys capital strength. See endnote (6) for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the comparable GAAP measure.
Corporate Cash
Corporate cash represents cash held at the parent company as well as cash held in certain subsidiaries that can distribute cash to the parent company without any regulatory approval. The Company believes that corporate cash is a useful measure of the parent companys liquidity as it is the primary source of capital above and beyond the capital deployed in our regulated subsidiaries. See our financial statements and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition that will be included in the periodic report the Company expects to file with the SEC with respect to the financial periods discussed herein for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the comparable GAAP measure.
EBITDA
EBITDA represents net income (loss) before taxes, depreciation and amortization and corporate interest expense. Management believes that EBITDA provides a useful additional measure of our performance by excluding certain non-cash charges and expenses that are not directly related to the performance of our business.
Interest Coverage
Interest coverage represents EBITDA divided by corporate interest expense. Management believes that by excluding the charges and expenses that are excluded from EBITDA, interest coverage provides a useful additional measure of our ability to continue to meet our interest obligations and our liquidity. See endnote (8) for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the comparable GAAP measure.
Bank Earnings Before Taxes and Before Credit Losses
Bank earnings before taxes and before credit losses represents the pre-tax earnings of E*TRADE Banks holding company, ETB Holdings, Inc. (Bank) before provision for loan losses, gains on loans and securities, net, net impairment and losses on early extinguishment of FHLB advances. This metric shows the amount of earnings that the Bank, after accruing for the interest expense on its trust preferred securities, generates each quarter prior to credit related losses, primarily provision and losses on securities. Management believes this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors and analysts as it is an indicator of the level of credit related losses the Bank can absorb without causing a decline in E*TRADE Banks excess risk-based capital. See endnote (9) for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the comparable GAAP measure.
E*TRADE Financial Ratios
E*TRADE Financial ratios, including Tier 1 leverage, Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital ratios, are based on the Federal Reserve regulatory minimum well-capitalized threshold. E*TRADE Financials Tier 1 common ratio is defined as the Tier 1 capital less elements of Tier 1 capital that are not in the form of common equity, such as trust preferred securities, divided by total risk-weighted assets. Management believes these ratios are an important measure of the Companys capital strength. See endnotes (1) and (15) for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measure.
It is important to note these metrics and other non-GAAP measures may involve judgment by management and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, net income (loss), consolidated statements of cash flows, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. For additional information on the adjustments to these non-GAAP measures, please see our financial statements and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition that will be included in the periodic report the Company expects to file with the SEC with respect to the financial periods discussed herein.
ENDNOTES
(1) The Tier 1 common ratio at E*TRADE Financial is a Q211 estimate and is a non-GAAP measure. Management believes this ratio is an important measure of the Company's capital strength. The Tier 1 common ratio is calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):
(2) Because the Company reported a net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2010, the calculation of diluted net loss per share does not include common stock equivalents as they are anti-dilutive and would result in a reduction of net loss per share.
(3) Reflects elimination of transactions between Trading and Investing and Balance Sheet Management segments, which includes deposit and intercompany transfer pricing arrangements.
(4) Amounts and percentages may not calculate due to rounding.
(5) Operating margin is the percentage of net revenue that results in income (loss) before other income (expense) and income taxes. The percentage is calculated by dividing income (loss) before other income (expense) and income taxes by total net revenue.
(6) The following tables provide a reconciliation of GAAP book value and book value per share to non-GAAP tangible book value and tangible book value per share (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts):
(7) Enterprise net interest spread is the taxable equivalent rate earned on average enterprise interest-earning assets less the rate paid on average enterprise interest-bearing liabilities, excluding corporate interest-earning assets and liabilities and customer cash held by third parties.
(8) Interest coverage represents the ratio of the Companys EBITDA to its corporate interest expense. The interest coverage ratio based on the Companys net income was 1.1, 1.0, and 0.9 for the three months ended June 30, 2011, March 31, 2011 and June 30, 2010, respectively.
(9) Bank earnings before taxes and before credit losses represents the pre-tax earnings of E*TRADE Banks holding company, ETB Holdings, Inc. (Bank) before provision for loan losses, gains on loans and securities, net, net impairment and losses on early extinguishment of FHLB advances. This metric shows the amount of earnings that the Bank, after accruing for the interest expense on its trust preferred securities, generates each quarter prior to credit related losses, primarily provision and loss on securities. Management believes this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors and analysts as it is an indicator of the level of credit related losses the Bank can absorb without causing a decline in E*TRADE Banks excess risk-based capital. Below is a reconciliation of Bank earnings before taxes and before credit losses from income before income taxes (dollars in thousands):
(a)
Excess risk-based capital is the excess capital that E*TRADE Bank has compared to the regulatory minimum well-capitalized threshold.
(a)
Non-bank loss represents all of the Companys subsidiaries, including Corporate, but excluding the Bank.
(b)
(10) Net new customer assets are total inflows to all new and existing customer accounts less total outflows from all closed and existing customer accounts. The net new banking assets and net new brokerage assets metrics treat asset flows between E*TRADE entities in the same manner as unrelated third party accounts.
(11) Delinquent loans include charge-offs for loans that are in bankruptcy or are 180 days past due which have been written down to their fair value. The following table shows the total amount of charge-offs on loans that are still held by the Company as of the periods presented (dollars in millions):
(12) Includes unpaid principal balances and premiums (discounts).
(13) The TDR loan performance detail is a subset of the Companys total loan performance.
(14) Capital ratios are at the E*TRADE Bank level. The ratios and excess capital amounts are Q211 estimates based on the regulatory minimum well-capitalized threshold. Below is a reconciliation of beginning E*TRADE Bank excess risk-based capital to ending E*TRADE Bank excess risk-based capital for the quarterly periods presented:
The capital release from loan portfolio run-off includes the decrease in risk-based capital required for our one- to four-family, home equity and consumer loan portfolios.
(a)
Represents cash flows to and from the parent company.
(b)
Represents the capitalimpact related to changes in other risk-weighted assets.
(c)
(15) The Tier 1 leverage, Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital ratios at E*TRADE Financial are Q211 estimates based on the Federal Reserve regulatory minimum well-capitalized threshold. E*TRADE Financial is not currently subject to capital requirements; however, the implementation of holding company capital requirements are expected to become effective within the next four years as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act. Management believes this ratio is an important measure of the Company's capital strength and has begun to track this ratio internally, using the current capital guidelines that apply to bank holding companies. The Tier 1 leverage, Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital ratios are calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):
Under the regulatory guidelines for risk-based capital, on-balance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk categories according to the obligor or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of any collateral. The aggregate dollar amount in each risk category is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with that category. The resulting weighted values from each of the risk categories are aggregated for determining total risk-weighted assets.
(a)
(16) The total expected loss on TDRs includes both the previously recorded charge-offs and the specific valuation allowance.
(17) Excludes loans to customers on margin.
(18) Gross-up for tax-exempt securities.
(19) Includes interest earned on average customer assets of $3.7 billion, $3.6 billion and $3.1 billion for the quarters ended June 30, 2011, March 31, 2011 and June 30, 2010, respectively, held by parties outside E*TRADE Financial, including third party money market funds and sweep deposit accounts at unaffiliated financial institutions.
