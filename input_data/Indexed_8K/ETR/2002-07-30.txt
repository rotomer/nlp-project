Exhibit 99.1 [Logo of Entergy] For further information: Nancy Morovich, VP, Investor Relations Phone 504/576-5506, Fax 504/576-2897 INVESTOR NEWS nmorovi@entergy.com July 30, 2002 ENTERGY REPORTS RECORD SECOND QUARTER OPERATIONAL EARNINGS NEW ORLEANS - Entergy Corporation reported solid second quarter 2002 operational earnings of $1.17 per share compared with $1.06 in the same period of 2001, reflecting increased earnings from both utility operations and Entergy's non-utility nuclear business. Second quarter 2002 results set a new record for the company and were 10 percent higher than the same period one year ago. On an as reported basis, Entergy reported income of $1.06 per share, an amount equal to earnings for the same period in 2001. Second quarter 2002 reported results reflected a special charge in connection with costs associated with the restructuring of Entergy's wholesale power development business. "Operating results reflect the positive impact of some strengthening of the economy in the utility's service territory and continued strong performance in Entergy Nuclear" said J. Wayne Leonard, Entergy's chief executive officer. "We're delivering on the commitments we have made to our stakeholders, and we have not allowed the disruptive activities in the sector to distract us. Four years ago we said we were going to deliver superior financial results by focusing on our core competencies, providing outstanding customer service, and maintaining sound financial integrity. We've met, and in most instances exceeded, these goals and we're committed to pursuing excellence with the highest level of ethics and integrity in our business practices and safety in our operations." Table 1 provides a comparative summary of earnings per share for second quarter and year-to-date 2002. - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Table 1: Entergy Corporation Consolidated Results Second Quarter and Year-to-Date 2002 vs. 2001 (Per share in U.S. $) - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Second Quarter Year-to-Date 2002 2001 $ Change 2002 2001 $ Change As Reported U.S. Utility 0.85 0.74 0.11 1.31 1.25 0.06 Parent & Other (0.02) 0.03 (0.05) (0.05) (0.01) (0.04) Competitive Businesses 0.23 0.29 (0.06) (0.54) 0.51 (1.05) ---------------------------------------- Consolidated Earnings 1.06 1.06 - 0.72 1.75 (1.03) Less Special Items U.S. Utility - - - - (0.01) 0.01 Parent & Other - - - - (0.05) 0.05 Competitive Businesses (0.11) - (0.11) (1.26) - (1.26) ---------------------------------------- Total (0.11) - (0.11) (1.26) (0.06) (1.20) Operational U.S. Utility 0.85 0.74 0.11 1.31 1.26 0.05 Parent & Other (0.02) 0.03 (0.05) (0.05) 0.04 (0.09) Competitive Businesses 0.34 0.29 0.05 0.72 0.51 0.21 ---------------------------------------- Consolidated Earnings 1.17 1.06 0.11 1.98 1.81 0.17 Weather Impact - - - 0.03 0.05 (0.02) U.S. Utility In second quarter 2002, as reported and operational utility earnings were $0.85 per share, compared to $0.74 in second quarter 2001. The increase in earnings quarter to quarter resulted primarily from higher revenues due to increased sales volume reflecting both modest customer growth and higher usage levels. Operation and maintenance expenses were significantly higher during second quarter 2002 due primarily to previously deferred ice storm costs being expensed as a result of the settlement reached with the Arkansas Public Service Commission. As noted in footnote (a) to Table 8, the net income impact of these expenses was essentially offset by revenues recorded in accordance with the regulatory settlement. After excluding the ice storm settlement costs, operation and maintenance expenses were modestly higher in 2002 compared to 2001 due primarily to spending in fossil and nuclear generation. For the year 2002, operation and maintenance expenses are projected to be slightly higher compared to 2001 levels. However, improved sales and revenues driven primarily by a more positive economic environment is expected to more than overcome this increase. Higher usage in second quarter 2002 increased residential sales by 7 percent, compared to second quarter 2001. Commercial and governmental sales were up 3 percent, reflecting increased usage across all commercial customer classes, while industrial sales experienced a 4 percent reduction quarter over quarter. The reduction in industrial sales was due exclusively to the impact of contractual modifications which reclassified certain industrial customers from retail to wholesale. After removing the impact of the reclassification, industrial sales reflected an increase of 1.5 percent resulting primarily from increased usage in the petroleum refining sector. The increase in usage across retail customer classes, which totaled 3.6 percent after the above reclassification, as well as the growth in the number of customers during the quarter, demonstrate some economic recovery beginning to take hold in the Entergy service territory. A summary of sales volumes by customer class is included in Appendix A to this release. Table 2 provides a summary of the utility's key operational measures with quarter-to-quarter and year-to-date comparisons. The utility continues to pursue the approval of rate plans and mechanisms that provide increased certainty as to the allowable earnings levels and provide incentives to reward operating excellence. Appendix B provides a summary of the utility's pending regulatory events and regulatory recovery mechanisms by operating subsidiary. Parent & Other Parent & Other recorded an as reported loss per share of $(0.02) in second quarter 2002, compared with earnings of $0.03 in second quarter 2001. The loss in second quarter 2002 was due primarily to lower interest income earned in 2002 resulting from lower yields on invested cash and higher corporate expenses in the current quarter. Competitive Businesses As reported earnings were $0.23 per share for the competitive businesses in second quarter 2002 compared to $0.29 in the same period of 2001. Second quarter 2002 results include a special charge totaling $(0.11) which reflects asset impairments and restructuring costs in connection with the wholesale power development business. The $(0.11) net charge also includes an offsetting gain of $0.10 primarily associated with the sale of certain assets in connection with the restructuring process. Excluding this special charge, operational earnings increased 17 percent, from $0.29 per share in second quarter 2001 to $0.34 in second quarter 2002. This increase in operational earnings reflects continued strong performance in non- utility nuclear operations which served to more than offset lower results from Energy Commodity Services. Table 3 provides a 2002 vs. 2001 comparison of contributions by business for the second quarter and year-to-date, on both an as reported and operational bases. - ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Table 3: Competitive Businesses Contributions to Earnings Per Share Second Quarter and Year-to-Date 2002 vs. 2001 - ----------------------------------------------------------------------- (Per share in U.S. $) Second Quarter Year-to-Date 2002 2001 $ 2002 2001 $ Change Change As Reported Entergy Nuclear 0.24 0.15 0.09 0.42 0.29 0.13 Energy Commodity Services (0.01) 0.14 (0.15) (0.96) 0.22 (1.18) ------------------------------------------ Total 0.23 0.29 (0.06) (0.54) 0.51 (1.05) Less Special Items Entergy Nuclear - - - - - - Energy Commodity Services (0.11) - (0.11) (1.26) - (1.26) ------------------------------------------ Total (0.11) - (0.11) (1.26) - (1.26) Operational Entergy Nuclear 0.24 0.15 0.09 0.42 0.29 0.13 Energy Commodity Services 0.10 0.14 (0.04) 0.30 0.22 0.08 ------------------------------------------ Total 0.34 0.29 0.05 0.72 0.51 0.21 - ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Table 4 provides a summary of Entergy's non-utility generation in MWh sold forward for the years 2002 and 2003.

Entergy Nuclear Entergy Nuclear (EN) earned $0.24 per share compared to $0.15 in second quarter 2001. The increase was due primarily to the contribution in 2002 of Indian Point 2, which was acquired in September 2001, as well as higher overall output levels due to the absence of refueling outages in 2002. Two refueling outages were conducted during second quarter 2001; none were conducted in second quarter 2002. EN's average capacity factor was 98.5 percent for second quarter 2002 as compared to 77.8 percent for the same period in 2001 reflecting the timing of plant refuelings. EN continues to achieve excellent operational performance. EN expanded its production capacity by 39 percent and its output by 77 percent quarter over quarter. Average production costs increased quarter to quarter due primarily to the inclusion of amortized refueling outage costs in 2002 for the Pilgrim and Indian Point 3 units. Currently, EN has sold 100 percent of the output of its generating assets through the end of 2002 at prices that range from $29 to $51 per megawatt hour. Table 5 provides a summary of Entergy Nuclear's key operational measures with quarter-to-quarter and year-to-date comparisons. Energy Commodity Services Energy Commodity Services (ECS) includes the combined reporting of Entergy-Koch L.P. and Entergy's wholesale power development business, Entergy Wholesale Operations (EWO). ECS recorded a loss of $(0.01) per share in second quarter 2002 compared to earnings of $0.14 in the same period last year. This loss reflects the impact of restructuring costs in the power development business recorded during the quarter. Operational earnings were also lower in second quarter 2002 compared to the same period in 2001, $0.10 per share compared to $0.14, due primarily to lower income from the trading business. As was the case in first quarter 2002, the income sharing mechanisms that are part of the Entergy-Koch partnership agreement allocated substantially all of the partnership's income to Entergy in the second quarter of this year. Entergy-Koch Trading, a subsidiary of Entergy-Koch L.P., contributed lower operational earnings primarily due to low market volatility, particularly in the power market, and lower profitability on gas trading, compared to second quarter 2001. As of the end of second quarter 2002, Entergy-Koch expected 31 percent of its trading book to be converted to cash by year end 2002 and 73 percent by the end of 2003. Eighty-four percent of the fair market value of Entergy-Koch's mark-to-market portfolio is based on actively-quoted prices. In addition, Entergy-Koch diligently manages counterparty risks with more than 90 percent of its trading book tied to counterparties with investment grade credit ratings and no more than 5 percent of Entergy- Koch's trading book is represented by a single counterparty. The Gulf South pipeline realized higher earnings in second quarter 2002 through slightly higher volumes of gas transported and higher gas storage revenues as movements in gas prices increased storage activities. Volumes for second quarter 2002 were up 2 percent compared to second quarter 2001. EWO recorded an $(0.11) per share special item in second quarter 2002 reflecting asset impairments and restructuring costs at that business unit. The net charge of $(0.11), detailed in Tables 8 and 9, includes an offsetting gain of $0.10 recorded on the sale of certain assets in connection with the restructuring process. Table 6 provides a summary of Energy Commodity Services' key operational measures with quarter-to-quarter and year-to-date comparisons. - ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Table 6: Energy Commodity Services Operational Performance Measures Second Quarter and Year-to-Date 2002 vs. 2001 (see appendix C for definitions of measures) - ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Second Quarter Year-to-Date 2002 2001 % 2002 2001 % Change Change Entergy-Koch Trading Electricity volatility 44% 78% -44% 45% 76% -41% Gas volatility 53% 52% 2% 67% 71% -6% Electricity marketed (GWh) 26,877 26,386 2% 66,705 57,395 16% Gas marketed (Bcf/d) 4.8 6.8 -29% 5.1 7.0 -27% Gain/loss days 1.7 4.3 -60% 1.9 2.9 -34% Gulf South Pipeline Throughput 2.31 2.26 2% 2.50 2.36 6% Miles of pipeline 8,800 8,800 - Storage capacity (Bcf) 68 68 - Production cost $0.096 $0.095 1% $0.084 $0.093 -10% Entergy Wholesale Operations Net MW in operation* 1,209 3,368 -64% Net MW under construction 597 523 14% * Effective this quarter, Damhead Creek, an 800 MW gas-fired unit in the U.K., is not included in sold forward metrics consistent with Entergy's first quarter 2002 restructuring announcement.

Variance Analysis Tables 8 and 9, on the following page, provide second quarter and year- to-date 2002 vs. 2001 reported earnings variance analyses for "U.S. Utility, Parent & Other," "Competitive Businesses," and "Consolidated." (a) Net revenue increased in second quarter and year-to-date 2002 due primarily to the impact of recording in current revenue the previously deferred revenues at Entergy Arkansas per the Transition Cost Account mechanism. The ice storm settlement agreed to with the Arkansas Public Service Commission authorized that the previously deferred amounts be recorded as revenue. In addition, net revenue increased due to the impact of higher sales volumes across retail customer segments resulting from some strengthening in the economy. Also, fluctuations in fuel prices positively impacted unbilled revenue which is included in Other for the second quarter and year-to-date periods. Utility Net Revenue Variance Analysis, 2002 vs. 2001 ($ EPS) Second Quarter Year-to-Date Weather - Weather (0.02) Regulatory settlements 0.49 Regulatory settlements 0.49 Sales growth/pricing 0.07 Sales growth/pricing 0.05 Other 0.08 Other 0.08 Total 0.64 Total 0.60 (b) Net revenue increased primarily as a result of the inclusion of operations of Indian Point 2 which was acquired in September 2001. (c) Interest expense & other charges decreased due to the retirement and refinancing of long-term debt and the absence of interest expense in 2002 on System Energy Resources, Inc.'s reserve for rate refund which was finalized in late 2001. (d) Income statement line items are tax effected at the statutory rate. Any difference between the statutory and effective tax rate is reflected in the "Income taxes-other" line. (e) Taxes other than income taxes decreased due primarily to the elimination of Entergy Louisiana's franchise tax reserve associated with capital leases in accordance with a recent state court finding. (f) Depreciation expense increased primarily as a result of revisions to certain asset lives and retirement patterns in second quarter 2001 which lowered depreciation expense, as well as higher depreciation expense in 2002 as a result of increasing investment in property, plant, and equipment. (g) Asset impairments and restructuring charges reflect the impact of recording the costs of restructuring the Entergy Wholesale Operations business. (h) Other income (deductions) decreased due primarily to lower Entergy- Koch earnings. (i) Other operation & maintenance expense increased due primarily to Entergy Arkansas' ice storm settlement, $(0.44), prior year's reversal of Entergy Arkansas' storm damage expenses $(0.07), and higher nuclear and fossil operation and maintenance expenses. For the year-to-date period, expenses increased due to lower nuclear insurance program distributions and overall expenses were partially offset by no merger related expenses in 2002. (j) Other operation & maintenance expense increased due primarily to the inclusion of operations of Indian Point 2. (k) Nuclear refueling outage expense increased due to initiating amortization of this cost in June 2001 for Pilgrim and Indian Point 3. (l) Other income (deductions) increased due primarily to the suspension of any goodwill amortization in accordance with new accounting rules. (m) Other income (deductions) decreased due primarily to the absence in 2002 of liquidated damages from Damhead Creek plant and lower equity in earnings from affiliates, primarily Entergy-Koch. (n) Interest and dividend income decreased due to lower interest income earned given declining deferred fuel balances at Utility as well as lower investment balances at Parent & Other. Table 10 lists special items by business with quarter-to-quarter and year-to-date comparisons. Special items are those events that are not routine, related to prior periods, or related to discontinued operations. Other Performance Highlights Entergy generated $449 million in operating cash in second quarter 2002, an increase of 8 percent compared to second quarter 2001. At the end of second quarter 2002, Entergy had approximately $731 million of cash and cash equivalents. Operational net margin was 9.1 percent, its highest level in more than six years and return on equity remained above 10 percent for the seventh consecutive quarter. The capital structure ratio remains within Entergy's target range with a net debt ratio of 49 percent. Entergy's credit ratios remain among the strongest in the industry. The current level of cash along with significant borrowing capacity continues to provide considerable financial flexibility to Entergy. The off-balance sheet debt, exclusive of operating leases, totals less than $350 million and constitutes only 2 percent of total capitalization. As of the end of second quarter 2002, the liquidity shortfall, as defined in appendix C was $(414) million. A significant amount of currently maturing long-term debt, approximately $1.1 billion, created the current liquidity shortfall at end of second quarter. Approximately $950 million of the maturing long-term debt is associated with utility debt that matures primarily in the first half of 2003. Financings at the utility were structured over the past several years to mature in the 2003-2004 timeframe as a result of the expectation that transition to competition would be at an advanced stage and would require significant corporate restructuring. Given the extended delays in utility deregulation, Entergy will actively pursue refinancing these amounts over the next 12 to 18 months and is confident that liquidity will return to more historical levels as refinancings are completed. Table 11 provides a summary of financial measures with quarter-to- quarter and year-to-date comparisons. Planned Capital Expenditures - 2002-2004 Entergy will continue to invest both in its core utility and wholesale energy businesses and in growth opportunities aimed at expanding and leveraging the advantages offered by its integrated business strategy. Over the next three years, Entergy's utility investments will focus on reliability improvements and customer growth. Capital investments in Entergy's non-utility nuclear business over this same period are for maintenance improvements, power uprates, nuclear fuel procurement, and the purchase of the Vermont Yankee nuclear plant which will close on July 31, 2002, in accordance with the purchase agreement. Energy Commodity Services plans to invest in power projects currently under construction, approximating 600 MW. Growth opportunities could include investments in pipeline, gas storage, nuclear, as well as additional regulated and/or unregulated generation assets.

Financial Outlook and Earnings Review "Through second quarter 2002 we continued to achieve strong results despite nearly daily negative revelations in our sector," said C. John Wilder, Entergy's chief financial officer. "Our success is based on a well-developed, integrated strategy supported by a solid, disciplined financial plan. Our return metrics, credit metrics, and cash position all continue to be very sound and our growth prospects look promising. The first half of 2002 has been very positive and we are pleased to confirm our 2002 operational earnings per share guidance at the $3.40 to $3.60 range." Earnings Guidance Entergy's 2002 earnings guidance is detailed in Table 13. Key assumptions reflected in the earnings ranges are as follows: - - Approximately 70 percent of 2002 earnings are expected from the utility. Earnings guidance is based on existing rate plans and fuel recovery mechanisms. The incremental increase expected in 2002 is the result of modest operational improvements, the full impact of the cessation of goodwill amortization, and the assumption of a normal level of allocated tax benefits from Parent. - - More than 20 percent of earnings are expected from Entergy Nuclear, where prices are set by power purchase agreements that cover 100 percent of the megawatt hours generated. The increase in nuclear earnings is expected to be provided by: a full-year's contribution at Indian Point 2; the addition of Vermont Yankee, a 510 MW nuclear acquisition that will close on July 31, 2002; and increased pricing of power sold under the power purchase agreement at Pilgrim. Capacity factor assumption for the overall fleet is 90 to 93 percent, and Fall 2002 refueling outages are assumed at FitzPatrick, Indian Point 2 and Vermont Yankee. - - Energy Commodity Services' guidance is based on a full year's contribution from Entergy-Koch at a 50 percent sharing of income, consistent with Entergy's ownership share. In addition, guidance reflects adjustments for no operating losses at Saltend and no liquidated damages from Damhead Creek. Finally, guidance reflects the continued impact of depressed spark spreads on EWO's generation portfolio. - - Parent & Other's guidance is adjusted for a normal level of allocated tax benefits, as well as reduced levels of interest income due to lower investment balances. Table 13 provides Entergy's projection of 2002 operational earnings per share with 2001 operational earnings as its data starting point. - ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Table 13: 2002 Earnings Per Share Guidance - ----------------------------------------------------------------------- (Per share in U.S. $) Entergy's 2002 operational earnings guidance with June 2002 year-to- date actual results as its starting point is detailed in Table 14 below. This table reflects the projected earnings contributions for each of Entergy's businesses for the remainder of 2002. Entergy's 2003 earnings guidance is detailed in Table 15. Key assumptions reflected in the earnings ranges are as follows: - - Approximately 70 percent of 2003 earnings are expected from the utility. Earnings guidance is based on existing rate plans and fuel recovery mechanisms. The incremental increase expected in 2003 is the result of modest rate base increases earning returns in the 11-12% range with a full-year impact of rate actions in Arkansas and Mississippi as well as some increase in overall sales growth. - - More than 20 percent of earnings are expected from Entergy Nuclear, where prices set by power purchase agreements will average $38/MWh. Increases will result from the full year impact of Vermont Yankee, and reduced overall operating costs. Capacity factor assumption for the fleet ranges from 93 to 95 percent. Spring 2003 refueling outages are assumed at the Pilgrim and Indian Point 3 units. - - Energy Commodity Services' guidance is based on contributions from Entergy-Koch at a 50 percent sharing of income, consistent with Entergy's ownership share. Modest growth in trading, and pipeline, along with savings from the restructured wholesale generation business, will add to earnings at ECS. - - Parent & Other's guidance is based on corporate expenses estimated at approximately $30 million partially offset by interest income on invested cash. Table 15 provides Entergy's projection of 2003 operational earnings per share with 2002 operational earnings guidance mid-point as its data starting point. Entergy anticipates growing earnings at an average annual rate of 8 to 10 percent beyond 2003 and has acknowledged that such growth is achievable only if new investments can be made over the next several years. Entergy continues to remain confident that investment opportunities will be available and as such believes the targeted level of earnings growth is achievable beyond 2003.

Exhibit 99.2 [Logo of Entergy] Entergy 639 Loyola Avenue New Orleans, LA 70113 News Release Date: July 30, 2002 For Immediately Release: Contact: Yolanda Pollard (News Media) (504) 576-4238 ypollar@entergy.com Nancy Morovich (Investor Relations) (504) 576-5506 nmorovi@entergy.com Entergy Reports Record Second Quarter - Operational Earnings Increase 10 Percent New Orleans, La. - Entergy Corporation (NYSE:ETR) today announced second quarter 2002 consolidated operational earnings per share that were 10 percent higher than in the same period of last year and set a new company record for second quarter operational earnings per share. The 2002 increase was driven by improved results in Entergy's utility business and its non-utility nuclear business. On an operational basis, Entergy's earnings were $267.1 million, or $1.17 per share, in second quarter 2002, compared with $238.9 million, or $1.06 per share, in the year-earlier period. On an as reported basis, Entergy recorded income of $241.7 million, or $1.06 per share, a per share amount equal to earnings for the same period in 2001. Second quarter 2002 reported results reflected a special charge associated with the restructuring of Entergy's wholesale power development business, which was announced earlier this year. "Operating results reflect the positive impact of some strengthening in the economy in the utility's service territory and continued strong performance in Entergy Nuclear" said J. Wayne Leonard, Entergy's chief executive officer. "We're delivering on the commitments we have made to our stakeholders, and we have not allowed the disruptive activities in the sector to distract us. Four years ago we said we were going to deliver superior financial results by focusing on our core competencies, providing outstanding customer service, and maintaining sound financial integrity. We've met, and in most instances exceeded, these goals and we're committed to pursuing excellence with the highest level of ethics and integrity in our business practices and safety in our operations." A few key highlights of the second quarter include: - A refueling outage at Arkansas Nuclear One Unit 2 was completed in 21 days 18 hours, a world record for this unit design. - In May, the Edison Electric Institute presented Entergy with the industry's most prestigious honor, the Edison Award, for business leadership and operational excellence in its Northeast nuclear fleet. In June, the National Fuel Funds Network presented the 2002 Sister Pat Kelley Achievement Award to CEO Wayne Leonard in recognition of his achievement on behalf of low-income families. The Kelley Award is the National Fuel Funds Network's highest accolade. Utility Operations In the second quarter of 2002, as reported and operational utility earnings were $194.9 million, or 85 cents per share, compared with $168.5 million, or 74 cents per share, for the same period in 2001. There were no special items recorded at the utility in either quarter. The increase in earnings quarter to quarter resulted primarily from higher revenues due to increased electric sales volume, which reflected both modest customer growth and higher usage levels as a result of improved economic conditions. Operation and maintenance expenses were significantly higher during second quarter 2002 due primarily to previously deferred ice storm costs being expensed as a result of a settlement reached with the Arkansas Public Service Commission. After excluding the ice storm settlement costs, operation and maintenance expenses were modestly higher in 2002 compared to 2001 due primarily to spending in fossil and nuclear generation. Higher electric usage in second quarter 2002 increased residential sales by 7 percent, compared to second quarter 2001. Commercial and governmental sales were up 3%, reflecting increased usage across all commercial customer classes, while industrial sales experienced a 4 percent reduction quarter over quarter. The reduction in industrial sales was due exclusively to the impact of contractual modifications which reclassified certain industrial customers from retail to wholesale. After removing the impact of the reclassification, industrial sales reflected an increase of 1.5%, and total retail sales reflected an increase of 3.6%. Competitive Non-Regulated Businesses Operational earnings per share from Entergy's competitive businesses increased by 17 percent, from 29 cents per share, or $63.3 million, in second quarter 2001, to 34 cents per share, or $77.2 million, in second quarter 2002, reflecting the continued strong performance in non-utility nuclear operations. As reported earnings for the competitive businesses were $51.8 million, or 23 cents per share, in second quarter 2002, compared to $63.3 million, or 29 cents per share, in the same period of 2001. Second quarter 2002 results include a special charge totaling a negative 11 cents per share for restructuring costs in connection with the wholesale power development business. Entergy Nuclear earned $53.5 million, or 24 cents per share, in second quarter 2002, compared to $33.1 million, or 15 cents per share, in second quarter 2001. The increase was due primarily to the contribution in 2002 of Indian Point 2, which was acquired in September 2001, as well as higher overall output levels due to the absence of refueling outages in 2002. Energy Commodity Services, which includes the combined reporting of Entergy-Koch L.P. and Entergy's wholesale power development business, recorded a loss of $1.7 million, or 1 cent per share, in second quarter 2002 compared to earnings of $30.2 million, or 14 cents per share, in the same period last year. Operational earnings were also lower in second quarter 2002 compared to the same period in 2001: $23.7 million, or 10 cents per share, compared to $30.2 million, or 14 cents per share, due primarily to lower income from the trading business. Entergy-Koch Trading contributed lower operational earnings primarily due to lower electricity volatility and lower profitability on gas trading, compared to second quarter 2001. The Gulf South pipeline realized higher earnings in second quarter 2002 through slightly higher volumes of gas transported and higher gas storage revenues as movements in gas prices increased storage activities. Entergy Wholesale Operations recorded a special item of negative 11 cents per share in second quarter 2002 reflecting restructuring costs for this business. Parent & Other Parent & Other reported a loss per share of 2 cents in second quarter 2002, compared with earnings of 3 cents per share in second quarter 2001. The loss in second quarter 2002 was due primarily to lower interest income earned in 2002 resulting from lower yields on invested cash and higher corporate expenses in the current quarter. Outlook "Through second quarter 2002 we continued to achieve strong results despite nearly daily negative revelations in our sector," said C. John Wilder, Entergy's chief financial officer. "Our success is based on a well-developed, integrated strategy supported by a solid, disciplined financial plan. Our return and credit metrics and cash position all continue to be very sound and our growth prospects look promising. The first half of 2002 has been very positive and we are pleased to confirm our 2002 operational earnings per share guidance at the $3.40 to $3.60 range."
