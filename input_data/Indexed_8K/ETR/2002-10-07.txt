[Logo of Entergy] Entergy Corporation 639 Loyola Avenue New Orleans, LA 70113 Exhibit 99.1 News Release Date: October 7, 2002 For Release: Immediate Contact: Morgan Stewart (Media) Nancy Morovich (Investor Relations) (504) 576-4238 (504) 576-5506 mstewa3@entergy.com nmorovi@entergy.com Entergy Releases Third Quarter Earnings Guidance, Increases 2002 Full-Year Guidance New Orleans, La. - In accordance with Regulation FD, Entergy Corporation (NYSE: ETR) today indicated that it expects to report third quarter 2002 financial results of at least $1.45 in operational earnings per share, including the impact of weather which was milder than normal during the period. This level of earnings exceeds the current First Call consensus estimate of $1.35 per share. In addition, Entergy increased its operational earnings guidance for full year 2002 from the previous range of $3.40 to $3.60 to the revised range of $3.60 to $3.70 per share and reaffirmed its full year 2003 guidance at $3.75 to $3.95 per share. Entergy noted that it expects Utility results to be improved over third quarter 2001 due in part to higher sales volumes reflecting continued improvement in the regional economy. Entergy Nuclear is also expected to record increased results compared to third quarter 2001 due to a full quarter's contribution from the Indian Point 2 nuclear plant in Buchanan, N.Y., acquired in September 2001, as well as two months of contribution from the Vermont Yankee nuclear plant located near Brattleboro, VT., acquired in July 2002. Third quarter 2002 results at Energy Commodity Services are expected to be comparable to the same quarter a year ago when combined power and gas trading produced very strong results. Third quarter 2002 earnings are expected to benefit from increased profitability in trading across all products including power, gas, and weather. Energy Commodity Services includes the operations of Entergy-Koch, the company's provider of wholesale energy marketing and trading services, and Entergy's non- regulated wholesale assets. Results at Parent & Other are expected to be improved compared to third quarter 2001 due to decreased operating and interest expenses. On an as reported basis, earnings for third quarter 2002 are expected to be positively impacted by a special item of approximately $0.10 per share. This special item is primarily associated with a gain recorded on the sale of two development projects in Spain. Entergy raised its 2002 full year guidance to a range of $3.60 to $3.70 per share to reflect year to date disproportionate sharing of income from the Entergy-Koch venture and the year to date impact of weather. Entergy recorded substantially all of the partnership income from the Entergy-Koch venture in the first and second quarters of 2002, and is expected to again receive a disproportionate share of income in the third quarter. Entergy recorded $0.03 per share in operational earnings through second quarter 2002 due to favorable weather, but expects milder than normal temperatures during the third quarter to more than offset this amount. Entergy's previously stated guidance for 2002 assumed normal weather and a 50 percent share of income from Entergy-Koch. Entergy's reaffirmed 2003 earnings guidance continues to be based upon assumptions of normal weather and a 50 percent share of Entergy-Koch partnership income.
