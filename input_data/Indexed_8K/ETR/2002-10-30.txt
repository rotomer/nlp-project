The 21 percent increase in operational earnings in third quarter follows a ten percent increase achieved in second quarter 2002. On an as reported basis, Entergy reported income of $1.59 per share for third quarter 2002, or 14 percent higher than one year ago. Third quarter 2002 reported results reflected a special item related primarily to a gain on the sale of two development projects in Spain. Operating cash flow for third quarter 2002 compared to the same period last year increased $239 million to $867 million due primarily to higher net income and lower fuel payments at utility operations and higher net income at the non-utility nuclear business. "Operating results reflect fundamentally strong performance across our businesses," said J. Wayne Leonard, Entergy's chief executive officer. "Over the past four years we made tough decisions that were necessary to position our company to withstand some of the most severe market conditions our industry has ever endured. While we are now realizing some of the benefits of those decisions, there is much work left to be done. We are committed to remaining sharply focused on operating excellence, risk management and the execution of our investment strategies which we believe will position us to continue delivering superior value to all of our stakeholders."

U.S. Utility In third quarter 2002, as reported and operational utility earnings were $1.07 per share, compared to $0.99 in third quarter 2001. The increase in earnings quarter to quarter resulted primarily from higher revenues due to increased sales volume reflecting both customer growth and higher usage levels. In addition, operation and maintenance expenses were lower during third quarter 2002 due primarily to lower plant outage costs in fossil generation as the result of fewer forced outages, as well as lower spending in distribution operations which reflects the utility's ongoing efforts to aggressively manage costs. Utility operating cash flow for third quarter 2002 compared to the same period last year increased $124 million to $727 million due primarily to higher net income and lower fuel payments in the 2002 period compared to third quarter 2001. Higher electricity usage in third quarter 2002 increased residential sales by 3 percent, compared to third quarter 2001. Commercial and governmental sales were up 2 percent, reflecting increased usage across all commercial customer classes, while industrial sales experienced an increase of 4 percent quarter over quarter. Significantly higher usage in the chemical sector, which accounts for more than 40 percent of industrial sales, was the primary contributor to the increase in industrial usage. The increase in sales across retail customer classes, which totaled 3 percent, as well as the growth in the number of customers during the quarter, demonstrates a continuation of the economic recovery that began in second quarter 2002 across the Entergy service territory. A summary of sales volumes by customer class is included in Appendix A to this release. Table 2 provides a summary of the utility's key operational measures with quarter-to-quarter and year-to-date comparisons. - ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Table 2: Utility Operational Performance Measures Third Quarter and Year-to-Date 2002 vs. 2001 (see appendix C for definitions of measures) - ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Third Quarter Year-to-Date 2002 2001 % 2002 2001 % Change Change Utility Generation in GWh 26,635 28,081 -5% 70,364 73,365 -4% GWh billed Residential 10,827 10,502 3% 25,303 24,771 2% Commercial and Gov't 8,240 8,073 2% 21,221 20,800 2% Industrial 10,839 10,457 4% 30,770 31,478 -2% Operation & maintenance exp. $14.01 $14.17 -1% $18.02 $14.42 25% Reliability SAIFI 2.10 2.12 -1% SAIDI 161.2 164.1 -2% Reliability complaints 58 38 53% 96 97 -1% Safety 9 11 -18% 27 24 13% Number of customers Residential 2,236,611 2,217,728 1% Commercial & Gov't 316,665 310,467 2% Industrial 41,486 41,587 - - ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- The utility continues to pursue the approval of rate plans and mechanisms that provide increased certainty as to the allowable earnings levels as well as incentives to reward operating excellence. Appendix B provides a summary of the utility's pending regulatory events and regulatory recovery mechanisms by operating subsidiary. II. Parent & Other Parent & Other recorded an as reported loss per share of $(0.02) in third quarter 2002, compared with a loss of $(0.06) in third quarter 2001. The improved results were due primarily to higher interest income, lower interest expenses and reduced corporate expenses in the current quarter compared to the same period last year. III. Competitive Businesses As reported earnings were $0.54 per share for the competitive businesses in third quarter 2002 compared to $0.46 in the same period of 2001. Third quarter 2002 results include a special item totaling $0.09 which is comprised primarily of a gain recorded on the sale of two development projects, Castelnou and Morautu de Tajuna, in Spain. Excluding this special item, operational earnings increased 45 percent, from $0.31 per share in third quarter 2001 to $0.45 in third quarter 2002 primarily due to additional nuclear capacity acquired by Entergy Nuclear. Operating cash flow at the competitive businesses for third quarter 2002 compared to the same period last year increased by $109 million to $131 million due primarily to higher net income from non-utility nuclear operations in third quarter 2002 compared to third quarter 2001. Table 3 provides a 2002 vs. 2001 comparison of contributions by competitive business for third quarter and year-to-date, on both as reported and operational bases. - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Table 3: Competitive Businesses Contributions to Earnings Per Share Third Quarter and Year-to-Date 2002 vs. 2001 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (Per share in U.S. $) Third Quarter Year-to-Date 2002 2001 $ 2002 2001 $ Change Change As Reported Entergy Nuclear 0.32 0.16 0.16 0.74 0.44 0.30 -------------------------------------- Energy Commodity Services Non-nuclear wholesale assets 0.07 0.14 (0.07) (1.17) 0.09 (1.26) Entergy-Koch Trading 0.12 0.12 - 0.28 0.32 (0.04) Gulf South Pipeline 0.03 0.04 (0.01) 0.14 0.11 0.03 -------------------------------------- Total Energy Commodity 0.22 0.30 (0.08) (0.75) 0.52 (1.27) Services -------------------------------------- Total 0.54 0.46 0.08 (0.01) 0.96 (0.97) Less Special Items Entergy Nuclear - - - - - - -------------------------------------- Energy Commodity Services Non-nuclear wholesale assets 0.09 0.15 (0.06) (1.17) 0.15 (1.32) Entergy-Koch Trading - - - - - - Gulf South Pipeline - - - - - - -------------------------------------- Total Energy Commodity 0.09 0.15 (0.06) (1.17) 0.15 (1.32) Services -------------------------------------- Total 0.09 0.15 (0.06) (1.17) 0.15 (1.32) Operational Entergy Nuclear 0.32 0.16 0.16 0.74 0.44 0.30 -------------------------------------- Energy Commodity Services Non-nuclear wholesale assets (0.02)(0.01) (0.01) - (0.06) 0.06 Entergy-Koch Trading 0.12 0.12 - 0.28 0.32 (0.04) Gulf South Pipeline 0.03 0.04 (0.01) 0.14 0.11 0.03 -------------------------------------- Total Energy Commodity 0.13 0.15 (0.02) 0.42 0.37 0.05 Services -------------------------------------- Total 0.45 0.31 0.14 1.16 0.81 0.35 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Table 4 provides a summary of Entergy's non-utility generation in MWh sold forward for the years 2002, 2003, and 2004. (a) Effective second quarter 2002, Damhead Creek, an 800 MW gas-fired unit in the U.K., was no longer included in sold forward table consistent with Entergy's first quarter 2002 restructuring announcement. Entergy Nuclear Entergy Nuclear (EN) earned $0.32 per share compared to $0.16 in third quarter 2001. The increase was due primarily to the full quarter's contribution in 2002 of Indian Point 2, which was acquired in September 2001, as well as the contribution for a portion of third quarter 2002 of Vermont Yankee, which was acquired at the end of July 2002. EN's average capacity factor was 96.8 percent for third quarter 2002 as compared to 97.5 percent for the same period in 2001. The earnings contributions in third quarter 2002 from Indian Point 2, and to a lesser extent Vermont Yankee, were the primary reasons for the increase of $73 million in operating cash flow at EN this quarter compared to the same period last year. EN continues to achieve excellent operational performance. EN expanded its production capacity by 15 percent and its output by 38 percent quarter over quarter. Average production costs increased quarter to quarter due primarily to the inclusion of amortized refueling outage costs in 2002 for the Pilgrim and Indian Point 3 units. Currently, EN has sold 100 percent of the output of its generating assets, excluding any uprated capacity, through the end of 2003 at prices that range from $29 to $49 per megawatt hour. Table 5 provides a summary of Entergy Nuclear's key operational measures with quarter-to-quarter and year-to-date comparisons. - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Table 5: Entergy Nuclear Operational Performance Measures Third Quarter and Year-to-Date 2002 vs. 2001 (see appendix C for definitions of measures) - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Third Quarter Year-to-Date 2002 2001 % 2002 2001 % Change Change Entergy Nuclear Net MW in operation 3,955 3,445 15% Average realized price 42.59 34.62 23% per MWh Production cost per MWh 18.49 17.06 8% 18.27 17.24 6% Generation in GWh 8,152 5,887 38% 23,110 15,354 51% Capacity factor 96.8% 97.5% -1% 98.5% 91.5% 7.7% Refueling outage duration No refueling outages completed during the quarter - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Energy Commodity Services Energy Commodity Services (ECS) includes earnings contributions from Entergy-Koch L.P. and Entergy's non-nuclear wholesale assets. ECS recorded earnings of $0.22 per share in third quarter 2002 compared to earnings of $0.30 in the same period last year. The lower earnings reported in 2002 compared to last year is due primarily to the impact of special items in each period as detailed in Table 10. Operational earnings in third quarter 2002 were $0.13 compared to $0.15 in the same period of 2001, with both quarters' earnings coming primarily from solid performance in the energy trading business. As was the case in the first two quarters of 2002, the income sharing mechanisms that are part of the Entergy-Koch partnership agreement allocated substantially all of the partnership's income to Entergy in the third quarter of this year. Entergy-Koch L.P. contributed slightly lower operational earnings in third quarter 2002 compared to the same period in 2001 primarily as a result of lower volumes of gas transported and higher production costs at Gulf South Pipeline. Earnings from Entergy-Koch's trading operations, EKT, were flat compared to prior year. Volumes of gas and electricity traded in third quarter 2002 were both up over 20 percent compared to third quarter 2001. Current quarter energy trading results showed marked improvement when compared to second quarter 2002 results. This improvement resulted from improved liquidity in the market during the period, following months when many competitors were exiting the trading business, causing market prices to disconnect from market fundamentals. In addition, EKT was successful in obtaining new physical optimization customers representing approximately 11 billion cubic feet of gas storage, and its customer-based derivative activity continued to improve, showing a year to date increase of 80 percent based on notional trade value. Consistent with EKT's rigorous risk management practices and trading discipline, average daily Earnings at Risk during the third quarter was $11 million and the duration of the trading book remained relatively short, with 82 percent of the mark to market value converting to cash by the end of 2003. Further, 80 percent of the total market value of EKT's mark to market portfolio is based on actively quoted prices and approximately 81 percent of EKT's counterparty credit exposure is associated with companies that currently have investment grade credit ratings. Lastly, mark to market earnings comprised just 8 percent of Entergy's consolidated operational earnings for third quarter 2002. A special item of $0.09 per share was recorded at Entergy's non- nuclear wholesale assets business. This special item consists primarily of the gain on the sale of two development projects in Spain.

Also, higher sales volumes reflecting continued economic recovery positively impacted net revenues in third quarter 2002. For the year-to-date period, net revenues were favorably impacted by the recording in current revenue the previously deferred revenues at Entergy Arkansas per the Transition Cost Account mechanism. The ice storm settlement with the Arkansas Public Service Commission authorized previously deferred amounts to be recorded as revenue. In addition, net revenue for the year-to-date period increased due to the impact of higher sales volumes noted above. Also, fluctuations in fuel prices that positively impacted unbilled revenue for the year-to-date period led to higher net revenue. This impact is included in Other on the Net Revenue Analysis.

(e) Interest expense & other charges decreased due to the prior year's recording of the effects of the FERC order addressing System Energy Resources, Inc.'s 1995 rate application, as well as decreases due to the retirement and refinancing of long-term debt and the absence of interest expense in 2002 on System Energy's reserve for rate refund which was finalized in late 2001. (f) Other income (deductions) increased due primarily to the suspension of any goodwill amortization in accordance with new accounting rules. (g) Other operation & maintenance expense decreased primarily due to lower fossil generation expenses offset by higher nuclear expenses resulting primarily from recording radwaste disposal liabilities. (h) Other operation & maintenance expense increased due primarily to the inclusion of operations of Indian Point 2 and Vermont Yankee partially offset by lower expenses in Entergy's non-nuclear wholesale assets business. (i) Interest and dividend income decreased due to recording in the prior year the effects of the FERC order addressing System Energy's 1995 rate application. The year-to-date period also included the impact of lower interest income earned as a result of declining deferred fuel balances on which interest is accrued. (j) Income statement line items are tax effected at the statutory rate. Any difference between the statutory and effective tax rate is reflected in the "Income taxes-other" line. (k) Decommissioning expense increased due primarily to recording the effects of the FERC order addressing System Energy's 1995 rate application in third quarter 2001. (l) Depreciation expense increased primarily as a result of recording the effects of the FERC order addressing System Energy's 1995 rate application in third quarter 2001. (m) Taxes other than income taxes decreased due primarily to the elimination of Entergy Louisiana's franchise tax reserve associated with capital leases in accordance with a recent state court finding. (n) Nuclear refueling outage expense increased due to initiating amortization of this cost in June 2001 for Pilgrim and Indian Point 3. (o) Other income (deductions) decreased due primarily to the absence in 2002 of liquidated damages from Damhead Creek plant and lower equity earnings from affiliates, primarily Entergy-Koch. (p) Other operation & maintenance expense increased due primarily to Entergy Arkansas' ice storm settlement, prior year's reversal of Entergy Arkansas' storm damage expenses, and higher nuclear operation expenses combined with lower nuclear insurance program distributions. Overall expenses were partially offset by no merger related expenses in 2002. (q) Asset impairments and restructuring charges reflect the impact of recording the costs of restructuring the non-nuclear wholesale assets business.

Other Financial Performance Highlights Entergy generated $867 million in operating cash in third quarter 2002, a significant increase of 38 percent compared to third quarter 2001. At the end of third quarter 2002, Entergy had approximately $949 million of cash and cash equivalents. Operational net margin was 9.9 percent, its highest level in more than six years and the fifth consecutive quarter of improvement. Return on equity increased to 10.8 percent for the eighth consecutive quarter of improvement. The capital structure ratio remains within Entergy's target range of 45 to 50 percent with a net debt ratio of under 48 percent. The current level of cash along with significant borrowing capacity continues to provide considerable financial flexibility to Entergy. The off-balance sheet debt, exclusive of operating leases, equals just $325 million and constitutes about 2 percent of total capitalization.

Entergy's current refinancing plan calls for a significant portion of the $1.2 billion of utility debt which matures through 2003 to be refinanced in advance, with $809 million planned to be refinanced on an accelerated basis prior to year-end 2002. Utility debt makes up approximately 75 percent of Entergy's current debt structure. Entergy's $1.45 billion corporate revolver, $735 million of which was undrawn at September 30, 2002, has a stated termination date of May 14, 2003, but can be extended to a one year note at Entergy's discretion through a "term out" provision. Entergy's liquidity averages approximately $2 billion through 2004 assuming the corporate revolver is renewed or termed out. In addition, Entergy has numerous liquidity levers that could potentially generate more than $1 billion of additional liquidity should it be required. These levers include the issuance of Entergy Corporation term debt, reduced capital and operation and maintenance spending and increasing net debt at the Utility.

Given the continuing delay in competition across nearly all of Entergy's jurisdictions, the company currently expects to refinance maturing utility debt for periods up to 30 years, consistent with the long term nature of utility assets.

VI. Earnings Guidance "Continued emphasis on operating excellence supported by a solid financial plan produced another quarter of very positive results," said C. John Wilder, Entergy's chief financial officer. "The first nine months of 2002 produced many challenges for Entergy and the results we've achieved in an extremely tough market provide evidence that our business fundamentals are sound and our strategic initiatives are on track. The benefits of disproportionate sharing of profit from the Entergy-Koch venture, $0.14 in earnings per share through third quarter, slightly offset by the year-to-date impact of unfavorable weather, supports increasing our operational earnings per share guidance to the $3.60 to $3.70 range for full year 2002." Entergy's 2002 earnings guidance is detailed in Table 16. Key assumptions reflected in the earnings ranges are as follows: - - Approximately 70 percent of 2002 earnings are expected from the utility. Earnings guidance is based on existing rate plans and fuel recovery mechanisms. The incremental increase expected in 2002 is the result of modest sales growth and operational improvements, the full impact of the cessation of goodwill amortization, and the assumption of a normal level of allocated tax benefits from Parent. - - More than 20 percent of earnings are expected from Entergy Nuclear, where prices are set by power purchase agreements that cover 100 percent of the megawatt hours generated. The increase in nuclear earnings is expected to be provided by: a full-year's contribution at Indian Point 2; the addition of Vermont Yankee, which was acquired on July 31, 2002; and increased pricing of power sold under the power purchase agreement at Pilgrim. The capacity factor assumption for the overall fleet is 90 to 93 percent, and Fall 2002 refueling outages are reflected at FitzPatrick, Indian Point 2 and Vermont Yankee. - - Energy Commodity Services' guidance is based on a full year's contribution from Entergy-Koch with Entergy receiving substantially all of the partnership income for the first three quarters of 2002, (based on actual amounts received from a disproportionate sharing arrangement), and a 50% share of income in fourth quarter, consistent with Entergy's economic ownership. In addition, guidance reflects adjustments for no earnings impact from Damhead Creek consistent with Entergy's decision in first quarter 2002 to write-off its equity investment in the plant. Finally, guidance reflects the continued impact of depressed spark spreads on Entergy's remaining non-nuclear wholesale assets. - - Parent & Other's guidance is adjusted for a normal level of allocated tax benefits, as well as reduced levels of interest income due to lower investment balances. Table 16 provides Entergy's projection of 2002 operational earnings per share with 2001 operational earnings as its data starting point. Entergy's 2002 operational earnings guidance with September 2002 year- to-date actual results as its starting point is detailed in Table 17 below. This table reflects the projected earnings contributions for each of Entergy's businesses for the remainder of 2002. Entergy's 2003 earnings guidance is detailed in Table 18. Key assumptions reflected in the earnings ranges are as follows: - - Approximately 70 percent of 2003 earnings are expected from the utility. Earnings guidance is based on existing rate plans for all utility operating subsidiaries with the exception of Entergy Mississippi and Entergy New Orleans, where increased earnings are assumed based on pending rate filings, as discussed in Appendix B. Current fuel recovery mechanisms are assumed for all companies. Incremental earnings expected in 2003 are also the result of modest rate base increases earning returns in the 11-12% range with a full- year impact of 2002 rate actions in Arkansas and Mississippi as well as some increase in overall sales growth. - - More than 20 percent of earnings are expected from Entergy Nuclear, where prices set by power purchase agreements will average $37/MWh. Increases will result from the full year impact of Vermont Yankee, and reduced overall operating costs. Capacity factor assumption for the fleet ranges from 93 to 95 percent. Spring 2003 refueling outages are assumed at the Pilgrim and Indian Point 3 units. - - Energy Commodity Services' guidance is based on contributions from Entergy-Koch at a 50 percent sharing of income, consistent with Entergy's ownership share. Modest growth in trading, and pipeline, along with savings from the restructured non-nuclear wholesale assets business, will add to earnings at ECS. - - Parent & Other's guidance is based on corporate expenses estimated at approximately $30 million partially offset by interest income on invested cash. Table 18 provides Entergy's projection of 2003 operational earnings per share with 2002 operational earnings guidance mid-point as its data starting point. Entergy anticipates growing earnings at an average annual rate of 8 to 10 percent beyond 2003 and has acknowledged that such growth is achievable only if new investments can be made over the next several years. Entergy continues to remain confident that investment opportunities will be available and as such believes the targeted level of earnings growth is achievable beyond 2003.

[Logo of Entergy] Entergy 639 Loyola Avenue New Orleans, LA 70113 Exhibit 99.2 Date: October 30, 2002 News Release For Release: Immediately Contact: Yolanda Pollard (News Media) (504) 576-4238 ypollar@entergy.com Nancy Morovich (Investor Relations) (504) 576-5506 nmorovi@entergy.com Entergy Reports Record Third Quarter - Operational Earnings Per Share Increase 21 Percent New Orleans, La. - Entergy Corporation (NYSE:ETR) today announced third quarter 2002 consolidated operational earnings per share that were 21 percent higher than in the same period of last year and set a new company record for third quarter operational earnings per share. The 21 percent increase follows a 10 percent increase achieved in second quarter 2002. Third quarter operational earnings reflect improved results in both Entergy's utility business and its non-utility nuclear business. On an operational basis, Entergy's earnings were $340 million, or $1.50 per share, in third quarter 2002, compared with $278.7 million, or $1.24 per share, in the year-earlier period. On an as reported basis, Entergy recorded income of $360.9 million, or $1.59 per share, compared with $312.5 million, or $1.39 per share for the same period in 2001. Third quarter 2002 as reported results include a special item of 9 cents per share related primarily to a gain on the sale of two development projects in Spain. "Operating results reflect fundamentally strong performance across our businesses," said J. Wayne Leonard, Entergy's chief executive officer. "Over the past four years we made tough decisions that were necessary to position our company to withstand some of the most severe market conditions our industry has ever endured. While we are now realizing some of the benefits of those decisions, there is much work left to be done. We are committed to remaining sharply focused on operating excellence, risk management and the execution of our investment strategies which we believe will position us to continue delivering superior value to all of our stakeholders." Utility Operations In the third quarter of 2002, as reported and operational utility earnings were $243.7 million, or $1.07 per share, compared with $223.6 million, or 99 cents per share, for the same period in 2001. There were no special items recorded at the utility in either quarter. The increase in earnings quarter to quarter resulted primarily from higher revenues due to increased electric sales volume, which reflected both customer growth and higher electricity usage levels. In addition, operation and maintenance expenses were lower during third quarter 2002 due primarily to lower plant outage costs in fossil generation as a result of fewer forced outages, as well as lower spending in distribution operations which reflects the utility's ongoing efforts to manage costs. Higher electricity usage in third quarter 2002 increased residential sales by 3 percent, compared to third quarter 2001. Commercial and governmental sales were up 2 percent, reflecting increased usage across all commercial customer classes, while industrial sales experienced an increase of nearly 4 percent quarter over quarter. Significantly higher usage in the chemical sector, which accounts for more than 40 percent of industrial sales, was the primary contributor to the increase in industrial usage. The increase in sales across retail customer classes, which totaled 3 percent, as well as the growth in the number of customers during the quarter, demonstrates a continuation of the economic recovery that began in second quarter 2002 across the Entergy service territory. Competitive Non-Regulated Businesses Operational earnings per share from Entergy's competitive businesses increased by 45 percent, from 31 cents per share, or $68.1 million, in third quarter 2001, to 45 cents per share, or $100.5 million, in third quarter 2002, primarily due to additional nuclear capacity acquired by Entergy's non-utility nuclear business. As reported earnings for the competitive businesses were $121.4 million, or 54 cents per share, in third quarter 2002, compared to $101.9 million, or 46 cents per share, in the same period of 2001. Third quarter 2002 results include a special item of 9 cents per share, or $20.9 million, for a gain on the sale of two development projects, Castelnou and Morautu de Tajuna, in Spain, while third quarter 2001 included a special item of 15 cents per share, or $33.8 million, comprised primarily of the gain recorded on the sale of the Saltend project in the United Kingdom. Entergy Nuclear earned $73.1 million, or 32 cents per share, in third quarter 2002, compared to $34.6 million, or 16 cents per share, in third quarter 2001. The increase was due primarily to the full quarter's contribution in 2002 of Indian Point 2, which was acquired in September 2001, as well as the contribution for a portion of third quarter 2002 of Vermont Yankee, which was acquired at the end of July 2002. Energy Commodity Services, which includes earnings contributions from Entergy-Koch L.P. and Entergy's non- nuclear wholesale assets, reported earnings of $48.3 million, or 22 cents per share, in third quarter 2002 compared to earnings of $67.2 million, or 30 cents per share, in the same period last year. The lower earnings reported in 2002 is due primarily to the impact of special items reported in each period discussed above. Operational earnings in third quarter 2002 were $27.4 million, or 13 cents per share, compared to $33.4 million, or 15 cents per share, in the same period of 2001, with both quarters' earnings coming primarily from solid performance in the energy trading business. As was the case in the first two quarters of 2002, the income sharing mechanisms that are part of the Entergy-Koch partnership agreement allocated substantially all of the partnership's income to Entergy in the third quarter of this year. Entergy-Koch L.P. contributed slightly lower operational earnings in third quarter 2002 compared to the same period in 2001 primarily as a result of lower volumes of gas transported and higher production costs at Gulf South Pipeline. Earnings from Entergy-Koch's trading operations, EKT, were flat compared to prior year. Volumes of gas and electricity traded in third quarter 2002 were both up over 20 percent compared to third quarter 2001. Current quarter energy trading results showed marked improvement when compared to second quarter 2002 results. This improvement resulted from improved liquidity in the market during the period, following months when many competitors were exiting the trading business, causing market prices to disconnect from market fundamentals. Parent & Other Parent & Other reported an as reported loss per share of 2 cents in third quarter 2002, compared with a loss of 6 cents per share in third quarter 2001. The improved results were due primarily to higher interest income, lower interest expenses, and reduced corporate expenses in the current quarter compared to the same period last year. Outlook "Continued emphasis on operating excellence supported by a solid financial plan produced another quarter of very positive results," said C. John Wilder, Entergy's chief financial officer. "The first nine months of 2002 produced many challenges for Entergy and the results we've achieved in an extremely tough market provide evidence that our business fundamentals are sound and our strategic initiatives are on track. The benefit of the disproportionate sharing of profit from the Entergy-Koch venture, slightly offset by the year-to- date impact of milder than normal weather, supports increasing our operational earnings per share guidance to the $3.60 to $3.70 range for full year 2002. Looking ahead to 2003, we are highly confident that our $3.75 to $3.95 range is well within our reach, given the consistently solid performance and underlying strength of each of our businesses."
