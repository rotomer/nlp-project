Results also include the impact of weather which was near normal for the period. Entergy noted that it expects both Utility and Entergy Nuclear results to be near flat compared to fourth quarter 2001. Fourth quarter 2002 results at Energy Commodity Services are expected to be higher when compared to the same quarter a year ago as the result of solid performance at Entergy-Koch L.P. as well as the positive impact of disproportionate income sharing as noted above. Energy Commodity Services includes the operations of Entergy-Koch, the company's provider of wholesale energy marketing and trading services, and Entergy's non-nuclear wholesale assets. Results at Parent & Other are expected to be improved compared to fourth quarter 2001 due to reduced consolidated tax benefits in 2001 allocated from Parent to other Entergy companies as well as higher interest income. Entergy also reaffirmed operational earnings guidance for 2003 to be in the range of $3.75 to $3.95 per share.
