[Logo of Entergy] Exhibit 99.1 For further information: Nancy Morovich, VP, Investor Relations Phone 504/576-5506, Fax 504/576-2897 INVESTOR NEWS nmorovi@entergy.com February 4, 2003 ENTERGY REPORTS SOLID EARNINGS FOR FOURTH QUARTER 2002 NEW ORLEANS - Entergy Corporation announced consolidated fourth quarter 2002 as reported earnings per share of $0.33 compared with $0.09 in 2001. Entergy's operational earnings per share for fourth quarter were $0.34 versus $0.18 in fourth quarter 2001. The 89 percent increase in the quarter's operational earnings was driven by the continued strength of Entergy's competitive businesses. Fourth quarter 2002 reported results included special items related to impairments recorded in connection with certain assets and contracts in the non-nuclear wholesale asset business, the impact of which was largely offset by tax benefits recorded in connection with the sale of Damhead Creek, an 800 MW gas-fired plant in the United Kingdom. For the year 2002, consolidated as reported earnings per share were $2.64 with operational earnings per share of $3.81. This compares with $3.23 in both as reported and operational earnings per share in 2001. Cash flow from operations for fourth quarter 2002 continued to be strong at $511 million which led to the second consecutive year where Entergy generated over $2 billion in operating cash flow. "2002 was a year of disappointing performance in our industry, and as these results became more common and more unexpected, the crisis in investor confidence affected everyone," said J. Wayne Leonard, Entergy's chief executive officer. "Despite all of this Entergy maintained its strong cash position, improved its credit quality and liquidity, and exceeded its targeted operational earnings growth. We now look ahead in 2003 with renewed commitment to build on our excellence in utility performance, grow our nuclear business, reinforce our energy trading capability, and continue our near five- year record of exceeding expectations." Table 1 provides a comparative summary of earnings per share for fourth quarter and year-to-date 2002. - --------------------------------------------------------------------- Table 1: Entergy Corporation Consolidated Results Fourth Quarter and Year-to-Date 2002 vs. 2001 - --------------------------------------------------------------------- (Per share in U.S. $) Fourth Quarter Year-to-Date 2002 2001 $ 2002 2001 $ Change Change As Reported U.S. Utility 0.19 0.20 (0.01) 2.57 2.45 0.12 Parent & Other (0.11) (0.20) 0.09 (0.17) (0.26) 0.09 Competitive Businesses 0.25 0.09 0.16 0.24 1.04 (0.80) ---------------------------------------- Consolidated Earnings 0.33 0.09 0.24 2.64 3.23 (0.59) Less Special Items U.S. Utility - - - - (0.01) 0.01 Parent & Other - (0.03) 0.03 - (0.08) 0.08 Competitive Businesses (0.01) (0.06) 0.05 (1.17) 0.09 (1.26) ---------------------------------------- Total (0.01) (0.09) 0.08 (1.17) - (1.17) Operational U.S. Utility 0.19 0.20 (0.01) 2.57 2.46 0.11 Parent & Other (0.11) (0.17) 0.06 (0.17) (0.18) 0.01 Competitive Businesses 0.26 0.15 0.11 1.41 0.95 0.46 ---------------------------------------- Consolidated Earnings 0.34 0.18 0.16 3.81 3.23 0.58 Weather Impact - (0.02) 0.02 (0.01) (0.01) - - --------------------------------------------------------------------- I. U.S. Utility In fourth quarter 2002, as reported and operational utility earnings were $0.19 per share, compared to $0.20 in fourth quarter 2001. The decrease in fourth quarter earnings in 2002 compared to 2001 was due primarily to higher intercompany tax accruals and higher operation and maintenance expenses, both of which were largely offset by higher sales volume across all customer classes. The increased operation and maintenance expenses included higher fossil plant outage expense, higher customer service support expense, and higher employee benefits expense. Utility operating cash flow for fourth quarter 2002 was $892 million, an increase of $471 million compared to the same period last year due primarily to the receipt in 2002 of cash for utilization of utility tax losses on the 2001 consolidated tax return. Higher electricity usage in fourth quarter 2002 increased residential sales by 15 percent, compared to fourth quarter 2001. This significant increase is due to the confluence of positive factors - a return to normal weather and an improved economy - and this rate of growth is not expected to continue going forward. Commercial and governmental sales were up 5 percent, reflecting increased usage across all commercial customer classes, while industrial sales experienced an increase of 2 percent quarter over quarter. Higher usage in the petroleum refining sector was the primary contributor to the increase in industrial usage. The percentage fluctuations in sales across retail customer classes, which totaled 6 percent, is not unusual in the fourth quarter since overall usage for this time of year is generally low and even modest changes in customer demand can represent a significant percentage increase on a relatively small base. Retail sales for the year 2002 were up 2 percent which is in line with historical trends and growth projections for the future. A summary of sales volumes by customer class is included in Appendix A to this release. For the year 2002, the utility earned $2.57 per share on both an as reported and operational basis, compared with $2.45 per share as reported, and $2.46 per share operational for 2001. The higher earnings in 2002 were due primarily to higher sales volumes across most customer classes, reflecting some strengthening in the economy, as well as reduced expenses as the result of the cessation of goodwill amortization required in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 142. These positive effects were partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses reflecting higher fossil plant outage costs and higher nuclear and customer service support costs. Table 2 provides a summary of the utility's key operational measures with quarter-to-quarter and year-to-date comparisons. - ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Table 2: Utility Operational Performance Measures Fourth Quarter and Year-to-Date 2002 vs. 2001 (see appendix D for definitions of measures) - ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Fourth Quarter Year-to-Date 2002 2001 % 2002 2001 % Change Change Utility Generation in GWh 19,687 21,245 (7%) 90,051 94,610 (5%) GWh billed Residential 7,279 6,309 15% 32,581 31,080 5% Commercial and Gov't 6,811 6,499 5% 28,032 27,299 3% Industrial 10,248 10,098 2% 41,018 41,577 (1%) Operation & maintenance expense/MWh $23.84 $19.44 23% $19.29 $15.55 24% Reliability SAIFI 1.99 2.13 (7%) SAIDI 164 162 1% Reliability complaints 19 22 (14%) 115 119 (3%) Number of customers Residential 2,236,507 2,218,410 1% Commercial & Gov't 317,167 311,215 2% Industrial 41,133 41,125 0% - ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- The utility continues to pursue the approval of rate plans and mechanisms that provide increased certainty as to the allowable earnings levels as well as incentives to reward operating excellence. These efforts resulted in Entergy Mississippi, Inc. obtaining a rate increase during fourth quarter 2002 which became effective in 2003. Appendix C provides a summary of the utility's pending regulatory events and regulatory recovery mechanisms by operating subsidiary. II. Parent & Other Parent & Other recorded a loss of $(0.11) per share in fourth quarter 2002 on both an as reported and operational basis. This compares to a loss of $(0.20) per share as reported, and $(0.17) per share operational, in fourth quarter 2001. The improvement in 2002 was due primarily to a decrease in Parent consolidated tax benefits allocated to other Entergy companies under the Entergy Tax Allocation Agreement, from the 2001 consolidated tax return compared to the 2000 tax return. The decrease in consolidated tax benefits is due to a decreased taxable loss at the Parent in 2001 compared to 2000. In addition, higher interest income contributed to the improved results at Parent in the 2002 period. Finally, fourth quarter 2001 as reported results included the impact of a $(0.03) special item recorded in connection with the write-down of a non-core business investment. For the full year on an as reported basis, Parent & Other had a loss of $(0.17) per share in 2002 compared to $(0.26) per share in 2001. The improved as reported results reflects the absence in 2002 of special items recorded at Parent & Other during 2001 related to expenses of a terminated merger and the write-down of a non-core business investment. For the full year, Parent & Other had an operational loss of $(0.17) in 2002 compared with an operational loss of $(0.18) in 2001. III. Competitive Businesses Earnings were $0.25 per share for the competitive businesses in fourth quarter 2002 compared to $0.09 in the same period of 2001. Fourth quarter 2002 results include a net special item of $(0.01) while 2001 earnings included special items totaling $(0.06). The special amount in 2002 is comprised of impairments recorded in Entergy's non-nuclear wholesale asset business in connection with the RS Cogen project and write-down of a gas generation and services contract entered into by Entergy Power Management Corporation prior to the formation of Entergy- Koch L.P. The impact of these impairments was largely offset by tax benefits recorded as a result of the sale in fourth quarter 2002 of the Damhead Creek project in the UK. Excluding special items, operational earnings increased 73 percent, from $0.15 per share in fourth quarter 2001 to $0.26 in fourth quarter 2002. For the year 2002, the decrease in earnings at the competitive businesses, $0.24 per share compared to $1.04, was driven primarily by costs associated with restructuring Entergy's non-nuclear wholesale asset business. Operational results improved from $0.95 per share in 2001 to $1.41 in 2002 due primarily to additional nuclear capacity and higher power contract pricing at Entergy Nuclear and solid results at Entergy-Koch L.P. in both the trading and gas pipeline businesses. Operating cash flow at the competitive businesses for fourth quarter 2002 compared to the same period last year decreased by $59 million to $44 million due primarily to higher costs in Entergy Nuclear as a result of three scheduled plant refueling outages completed in fourth quarter 2002. No refueling outages were conducted in fourth quarter 2001. Table 3 provides a 2002 vs. 2001 comparison of contributions by competitive business for fourth quarter and year-to-date, on both as reported and operational bases. - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Table 3: Competitive Businesses Contributions to Earnings Per Share Fourth Quarter and Year-to-Date 2002 vs. 2001 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (Per share in U.S. $) Fourth Quarter Year-to-Date 2002 2001 $ 2002 2001 $ Change Change As Reported Entergy Nuclear 0.15 0.13 0.02 0.88 0.57 0.31 -------------------------------------- Energy Commodity Services Non-nuclear wholesale assets (0.05)(0.08) 0.03 (1.22) - (1.22) Entergy-Koch Trading 0.07 0.01 0.06 0.36 0.34 0.02 Gulf South Pipeline 0.08 0.03 0.05 0.22 0.13 0.09 -------------------------------------- Total Energy Commodity Services 0.10 (0.04) 0.14 (0.64) 0.47 (1.11) -------------------------------------- Total 0.25 0.09 0.16 0.24 1.04 (0.80) Less Special Items Entergy Nuclear - - - - - - -------------------------------------- Energy Commodity Services Non-nuclear wholesale (0.01)(0.06) 0.05 (1.17) 0.09 (1.26) assets Entergy-Koch Trading - - - - - - Gulf South Pipeline - - - - - - -------------------------------------- Total Energy Commodity Services (0.01)(0.06) 0.05 (1.17) 0.09 (1.26) -------------------------------------- Total (0.01)(0.06) 0.05 (1.17) 0.09 (1.26) Operational Entergy Nuclear 0.15 0.13 0.02 0.88 0.57 0.31 -------------------------------------- Energy Commodity Services Non-nuclear wholesale assets (0.04)(0.02) (0.02)(0.05) (0.09) 0.04 Entergy-Koch Trading 0.07 0.01 0.06 0.36 0.34 0.02 Gulf South Pipeline 0.08 0.03 0.05 0.22 0.13 0.09 -------------------------------------- Total Energy Commodity Services 0.11 0.02 0.09 0.53 0.38 0.15 -------------------------------------- Total 0.26 0.15 0.11 1.41 0.95 0.46 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Table 4 provides a summary of Entergy's non-utility generation in MWh sold forward for the years 2003, 2004, and 2005. - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Table 4: Competitive Businesses Percent of Generation Sold Forward Years 2003 through 2005 (see appendix D for definitions of measures) - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 2003 2004 2005 Entergy Nuclear Planned TWh of generation 33 33 34 Percent of total planned competitive generation 91% 91% 90% Percent of EN's total planned generation sold forward 100 92% 25% Average realized and assumed contract price per MWh $37 $38 $36 Energy Commodity Services Planned TWh of generation 3 3 4 Percent of total planned competitive generation 9% 9% 10% Percent of ECS' total planned generation sold forward 38% 18% 22% Average realized contract spark spread per MWh $12 $11 $11 Average assumed market spark spread per MWh $6 $0 $0 Percent of Competitive Businesses' planned 95% 85% 25% generation sold forward - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Entergy Nuclear Entergy Nuclear (EN) earned $0.15 per share compared to $0.13 in fourth quarter 2001 on both as reported and operational basis. The increase was due primarily to the contributions in 2002 from Vermont Yankee, which was acquired in July 2002, as well as to higher pricing in 2002 under certain power purchase contracts. EN's average capacity factor was 78 percent for fourth quarter 2002 as compared to 95 percent for the same period in 2001 due to the impact of three scheduled plant refueling outages. These outages also decreased cash flow from operations this quarter compared to the same period last year. In addition, the amortization of costs associated with these refueling outages, completed at FitzPatrick, Indian Point 2 and Vermont Yankee, increased production costs quarter to quarter. Table 5 provides a summary of Entergy Nuclear's key operational measures with quarter-to-quarter and year-to-date comparisons. - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Table 5: Entergy Nuclear Operational Performance Measures Fourth Quarter and Year-to-Date 2002 vs. 2001 (see appendix D for definitions of measures) - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Fourth Quarter Year-to-Date 2002 2001 % 2002 2001 % Change Change Entergy Nuclear Net MW in operation 3,955 3,445 15% Average realized price per MWh 40.87 35.27 16% Production cost per MWh 22.18 19.55 13% 20.20 18.60 9% Generation in GWh 6,843 7,260 -6% 29,953 22,614 32% Capacity factor 78% 95% -18% 93% 93% 0% Refueling outage duration Current Last % Period Outage Change FitzPatrick 24 38 37% Indian Point 2 33 (a) Vermont Yankee 21 22 5% - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (a) Indian Point 2 was last refueled during an extended shutdown in 2000 prior to Entergy's acquisition of the plant. Energy Commodity Services Energy Commodity Services (ECS) includes earnings contributions from Entergy-Koch L.P. and Entergy's non-nuclear wholesale assets. ECS recorded earnings of $0.10 per share in fourth quarter 2002 compared to a loss of $(0.04) in the same period last year. The improvement in results reported by ECS in 2002 compared to last year is due primarily to strong earnings in trading, improved results in the gas pipeline business, and the absence in 2002 of losses realized in fourth quarter 2001 in connection with asset sales in the non-nuclear wholesale asset business. Operational earnings in fourth quarter 2002 were $0.11 compared to $0.02 in the same period of 2001. As was the case in the first three quarters of 2002, the income sharing mechanisms that are part of the Entergy-Koch partnership agreement allocated substantially all of the partnership's income to Entergy in the fourth quarter of this year. Entergy-Koch L.P. contributed higher operational earnings in fourth quarter 2002 compared to the same period in 2001 primarily as a result of earnings at Entergy-Koch Trading (EKT). In addition, Gulf South Pipeline realized higher earnings even as volumes of gas transported decreased due to more favorable transportation contract pricing. EKT continues to rigorously manage risks while exercising strict trading discipline. Average Daily Earnings at Risk during the fourth quarter increased to $13.1 million, but remains within the risk limits authorized for this business. The duration of the trading book remained relatively short, with essentially all of the mark to market value converting to cash by the end of 2004. Further, 77 percent of the total market value of EKT's mark to market portfolio is based on actively quoted prices and approximately 86 percent of EKT's counterparty credit exposure is associated with companies that currently have investment grade credit ratings. Lastly, mark to market earnings comprised just 21 percent of Entergy's consolidated operational earnings for fourth quarter 2002. A special item of $(0.01) per share was recorded at Entergy's non- nuclear wholesale asset business. This special item consists of impairments recorded in connection with the RS Cogen project and a gas generation and services contract entered into by Entergy Power Management Corporation prior to the formation of Entergy-Koch L.P. The impact of these impairments was largely offset by tax benefits recorded as a result of the sale in fourth quarter 2002 of the Damhead Creek project in the UK. Table 6 provides a summary of Energy Commodity Services' key operational measures with quarter-to-quarter and year-to-date comparisons. - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Table 6: Energy Commodity Services Operational Performance Measures Fourth Quarter and Year-to-Date 2002 vs. 2001 (see appendix D for definitions of measures) - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Fourth Quarter Year-to-Date 2002 2001 % 2002 2001 % Change Change Entergy-Koch Trading Electricity volatility 41% 37% 11% 48% 78% -38% Gas volatility 50% 80% -38% 61% 72% -15% Electricity marketed (GWh)(b)136,833 60,892 125% 408,038 180,893 126% Gas marketed (Bcf/d) (b) 5.0 3.5 43% 5.8 3.0 93% Gain/loss days 1.3 2.2 -41% 1.8 2.8 -35% Daily average Earnings at Risk 13.1 5.3 147% 10.8 6.4 69% Gulf South Pipeline Throughput 2.22 2.51 -12% 2.40 2.45 -2% Production cost $0.113 $0.098 15% $0.094 $0.093 1% Non-nuclear Wholesale Assets Net MW in operation (b) 1,421 2,410 -41% Generation in GWh 250 196 28% Average realized price per MWh 14 19 -26% Net MW under construction 385 373 3% - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (b) Previously reported volumes, which included only U.S. trading, have been adjusted to reflect both U.S. and Europe volumes traded. IV. Variance Analysis Tables 8 and 9 below provide fourth quarter and year-to-date 2002 vs. 2001 earnings variance analyses for "U.S. Utility, Parent & Other," "Competitive Businesses," and "Consolidated." - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Table 9: Entergy Corporation Earnings Per Share Variance Analysis Year-to-Date 2002 vs. 2001 - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ (Per share in U.S. $, sorted in consolidated column, most to least favorable) U.S. Utility, Parent & Competitive Other Businesses Consolidated 2001 earnings 2.19 1.04 3.23 Net revenue 0.93 (i) 0.47 (j) 1.40 Interest expense and other charges 0.32 (k) 0.01 0.33 Income taxes - other 0.09 (c) 0.11 (c) 0.20 Other income (deductions) 0.09 (d) 0.02 (e) 0.11 Taxes other than income taxes 0.05 (l) - 0.05 Gain (loss) on sale of assets-net 0.01 (0.01) - Share repurchase/dilution effect (0.03) - (0.03) Nuclear refueling outage expense 0.02 (0.07) (m) (0.05) Decommissioning expense (0.07) (n) - (0.07) Cumulative effect of accounting change - (0.10) (h) (0.10) Interest and dividend income (0.16) (o) 0.05 (0.11) Depreciation/amortization expense (0.29) (p) (0.03) (0.32) Other operation & maintenance expense (0.75) (f) (0.08) (g) (0.83) Asset/contract impairments and restructuring - (1.17) (q) (1.17) charges ----- ----- ----- 2002 earnings 2.40 0.24 2.64 ----- ----- ----- - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ (c) Income statement line items are tax effected at the statutory rate. Any difference between the statutory and effective tax rate is reflected in the "Income taxes-other" line. (d) Other income (deductions) increased due primarily to the suspension of goodwill amortization. (e) Other income (deductions) increased due primarily to higher Entergy-Koch earnings. (f) Other operation & maintenance expense for the quarter increased due primarily to higher fossil outage expenses, higher customer service support expenses, and higher employee benefits expenses. The year-to-date increase was due primarily to Entergy Arkansas' ice storm settlement, prior year's reversal of Entergy Arkansas' storm damage expenses, and higher nuclear operation expenses combined with lower nuclear insurance program distributions in the current period. Overall expenses were partially offset by no merger related expenses in 2002. (g) Other operation & maintenance expense for the quarter decreased due primarily to the absence of loss reserves recorded in 2001 on the then pending sale of Latin American assets and other development projects. This decrease was partially offset by the costs associated with the inclusion of operations from Vermont Yankee, acquired in July 2002. On a year-to-date basis, other operation & maintenance expense increased due to the inclusion of a full year's operations of Indian Point 2 as well as Vermont Yankee's operations since acquisition, July 2002. These increases in expense were partially offset by the absence of provisions recorded in 2001 on the then pending sale of Latin American assets and other development projects. (h) Cumulative effect of accounting change is due to the absence in 2002 of the positive impact of a 2001 accounting pronouncement that resulted in recording mark to market revenue in 2001 on a Damhead Creek gas contract with Shell. (i) Net revenue increased in fourth quarter 2002 due primarily to the impact of higher sales volumes across all retail customer segments resulting from improvement in the local economy as well as the positive effect of more favorable weather quarter over quarter. For the year-to-date period, net revenues were favorably impacted by the recording in 2002 of revenue previously deferred at Entergy Arkansas per the Transition Cost Account mechanism. The ice storm settlement with the Arkansas Public Service Commission reached in May 2002 authorized previously deferred amounts to be recorded as revenue. In addition, net revenue for the year-to-date period increased due to the impact of higher sales volumes noted above. Also, fluctuations in fuel prices that positively impacted unbilled revenue for the year-to-date period led to higher net revenue. This impact is included in Other on the Net Revenue Analysis. Utility Net Revenue Variance Analysis, 2002 vs. 2001 ($ EPS) Fourth Quarter Year-to-Date Weather 0.02 Weather - Sales growth/pricing 0.06 Sales growth/pricing 0.17 SERI refund - SERI refund 0.19 Regulatory settlements - Regulatory settlements 0.51 Other (0.04) Other 0.06 Total 0.04 Total 0.93 (j) Net revenue for the quarter decreased primarily as a result of lower revenues from Damhead Creek and the absence of the gain on the sale of the Saltend plant which occurred in fourth quarter 2001, the impact of which was partially offset by the inclusion of operations of Vermont Yankee. For the year-to-date period, net revenue increased due to the inclusion of operations of Indian Point 2 for the full year 2002, and Vermont Yankee since acquisition in July 2002. Partially offsetting these increases was the lack of Saltend net revenues and the absence of gains on sales of assets, primarily Saltend which was sold in August 2001. (k) Interest expense & other charges decreased due to the prior year's recording of the effects of the FERC order addressing System Energy Resources, Inc.'s 1995 rate application, as well as decreases due to the retirement and refinancing of long-term debt and the absence of interest expense in 2002 on System Energy's reserve for rate refund which was finalized in late 2001. (l) Taxes other than income taxes decreased due primarily to the elimination of Entergy Louisiana's franchise tax reserve associated with capital leases in accordance with a recent state court finding. (m) The increase in nuclear outage refueling expense is due to higher amortization expense for Pilgrim and Indian Point 3 as well as a portion of amortization expense being recorded in 2002 for refueling outages completed in fourth quarter 2002 at Indian Point 2, Vermont Yankee and FitzPatrick. (n) Decommissioning expense increased due primarily to recording the effects of the FERC order addressing System Energy's 1995 rate application in third quarter 2001. (o) Interest and dividend income decreased due to lower interest income earned as a result of declining deferred fuel balances on which interest is accrued and due to recording in 2001 the effects of the FERC order addressing System Energy's 1995 rate application. (p) Depreciation expense increased primarily as a result of recording the effects of the FERC order addressing System Energy's 1995 rate application in third quarter 2001 as well as from higher depreciation on general plant and intangible plant assets. (q) Asset impairments and restructuring charges reflect the impact of recording costs associated with impairment reserves recorded in connection with certain non-nuclear wholesale assets. The impact of restructuring charges recorded in fourth quarter was largely offset by the positive impact of the sale of Damhead Creek. Table 10 lists special items by business with quarter-to-quarter and year-to-date comparisons.

Other Financial Performance Highlights Entergy generated $511 million in operating cash in fourth quarter 2002, a decrease of $476 million compared to fourth quarter 2001. The decrease is primarily the result of reduced tax refunds, lower deferred fuel collections and higher nuclear refueling outage costs. For the year 2002, Entergy generated in excess of $2 billion of operating cash making 2002 the second consecutive year that the company has generated more than $2 billion in operating cash flow. At the end of fourth quarter 2002, Entergy had approximately $1.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents and unused revolver capacity of $1,018 million at the Parent and Utility subsidiaries. The current level of cash along with substantial borrowing capacity provides valuable financial flexibility to Entergy. As reported net margin was 7.22 percent, decreasing slightly from fourth quarter 2001 while operational net margin improved nearly 3 percentage points over last year to 10.43 percent. Return on equity, on an as reported basis, decreased to 7.84 percent while operational return on equity climbed to 11.33 percent resulting in nine consecutive quarters of improvement. Entergy continues to pursue financial and operational objectives to achieve double-digit performance in operational net margins and operational returns on equity. Entergy's capital structure remains within the target range of 45 to 50 percent debt. The off-balance sheet debt, exclusive of operating leases, equals $409 million and constitutes about 2 percent of total capitalization. Table 11 provides a summary of financial measures with quarter-to- quarter and year-to-date comparisons. Cash and Liquidity At the end of 2002, Entergy's combined cash balance and unused capacity on bank revolvers was $2.35 billion. Entergy's $1.45 billion corporate revolver, $915 million of which was unused at December 31, 2002, has a stated termination date of May 14, 2003, but can be extended to a one year note at Entergy's discretion through a "term out" provision. Entergy expects to have significant cash available through 2005 for three potential uses: investments in new businesses or assets, repayment of debt, and dividend increases. In addition, Entergy has numerous liquidity levers that could potentially generate more than $1 billion of additional liquidity, should it be required. These levers include issuing additional Entergy Corporation term debt, reducing capital and operation and maintenance spending, and increasing net debt at the Utility. Table 12 provides a summary of projected sources and uses of cash for the years 2003 through 2005 in accordance with Entergy's 2003 financial plan. Sources shown on the table include $2.4 billion of new debt that Entergy believes it could issue in association with new investments while maintaining a net debt ratio of 50% or less. This amount could vary depending upon the type of new investment and the credit market environment. - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Table 12: Entergy Corporation Projected Sources and Uses of Cash 2003-2005 ($ in billions) - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 2003-2005 Beginning cash at 1/1/03 1.3 Entergy Corp. credit revolver - unused portion 0.9 Planned refinancings 3.1 New debt capacity 2.4 Total financings 6.4 Operating cash flow 5.2 ----- Total sources 12.9 Debt maturities 4.4 Capital expenditures 3.4 Dividends 1.0 Targeted liquidity 0.8 ----- Total uses 9.6 Net Liquidity Available for New Investment, Debt 3.3 Repayment, Dividend Increase - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Capital Expenditures Entergy's capital plan from 2003 through 2005 calls for $3.4 billion of investment; $2.9 billion of this amount is associated with capital projects that maintain Entergy's existing assets. The remaining $0.5 billion is associated with previously-identified investments such as the steam generator replacement at Arkansas Nuclear One, Unit 1, nuclear plant power uprates at Entergy Nuclear, and the completion of a gas-fired power plant currently under construction in Entergy's non- nuclear wholesale asset business, and a previously-deferred equity investment for Entergy's interest in Entergy-Koch.

Earnings Guidance "Continued emphasis on operating excellence supported by a solid financial plan produced another quarter of very positive results," said C. John Wilder, Entergy's chief financial officer. "In 2002 we were challenged by extremely difficult market conditions. The success achieved by Entergy as reflected in 2002 results supports our belief that our business fundamentals are sound and our strategic initiatives are on track. We enter 2003 with an economy that has yet to fully recover and with numerous challenges ahead in the energy market. However, we are committed to diligently manage our businesses consistent with our long-term aspirations in order to deliver sustained value to our shareholders." Entergy's 2003 earnings guidance is detailed in Table 15. Earnings guidance for 2003 includes the impact of Entergy's decision to expense stock options effective first quarter 2003 which is not expected to be material. Additional detail on other key assumptions reflected in the earnings ranges are as follows: - - Approximately 70 percent of 2003 earnings are expected from the Utility. Earnings guidance is based on existing rate plans, including the increased rates put into effect at Entergy Mississippi in connection with the Order issued by the MPSC in December 2002. In addition, increased earnings are assumed for Entergy New Orleans based on its pending rate filing, as discussed in Appendix C. Current fuel recovery mechanisms are assumed for all companies as is the full-year impact of 2002 rate actions in Arkansas, Gulf States, and Mississippi. Incremental earnings expected in 2003 are also the result of an increase in overall sales growth. Partially offsetting these revenue enhancements are increases in O&M expense and depreciation. - - More than 20 percent of earnings are expected from Entergy Nuclear, where prices set by power purchase agreements will average $37/MWh. Increases will result from the full year impact of Vermont Yankee, outage differences, power uprates, and reduced overall operating costs. Currently, EN has sold 100 percent of the output of its generating assets, excluding a portion of uprated capacity, through the end of 2003 at prices that range from $29 to $42 per megawatt hour. Capacity factor assumption for the fleet ranges from 93 to 95 percent. Spring 2003 refueling outages are assumed at the Pilgrim and Indian Point 3 units. - - Energy Commodity Services' guidance is based on contributions from Entergy-Koch at a 50 percent sharing of income, consistent with Entergy's ownership share. Modest growth in trading and pipeline will add to earnings at ECS. - - Parent & Other's guidance is based on modest improvement in corporate expenses along with increased interest expense. Table 15 provides Entergy's projection of 2003 operational earnings per share with 2002 as reported and operational earnings as its data starting points. At this time, no material special items are expected to be recorded in 2003, hence as reported earnings per share guidance is equal to operational earnings per share guidance. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Table 15: 2003 Earnings Per Share Guidance (Per share in U.S. $) - -------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2002 Earnings Operational/Special Item 2003 Per Changes in 2003 Guidance Range Share Range of Impact Utility As Reported 2.57 Less 0.00 Operational items: special items ---- Operational 2.57 Increased revenues due to 0.24 0.27 rate actions and sales growth Increased O&M, (0.11) (0.09) depreciation, other ------------- Total Operational 0.13 0.18 2.70 2.75 ------------------------------------------------------- Special items: None - - ------------- Total As Reported 2.70 2.75 ------------------------------------------------------- Entergy Nuclear As Reported 0.88 Less 0.00 Operational items: special items ---- Operational 0.88 Increased revenue due to 0.05 0.07 increased Mwhs produced Decreased revenue due to (0.02) (0.02) lower PPA pricing Increased outage (0.08) (0.08) amortization expense Decreased O&M expense, 0.07 0.10 other ------------- Total Operational 0.02 0.07 0.90 0.95 ------------------------------------------------------- Special items: None - - ------------- Total As Reported 0.90 0.95 ------------------------------------------------------- Energy Commodity Services As Reported (0.64) Less (1.17) Operational items: special items ---- Operational 0.53 Decreased contribution (0.21) (0.21) from Entergy-Koch (t) Increased income from 0.02 0.06 commodity trading Increased income from 0.01 0.02 pipeline operations ------------- Total Operational (0.18) (0.13) 0.35 0.40 ------------------------------------------------------- Special items: None - - ------------- Total As Reported 0.35 0.40 ------------------------------------------------------- Parent & Other As Reported (0.17) Less 0.00 Operational items: special items ----- Operational (0.17) Increased netinterest (0.05) (0.03) expense Decreased corporate 0.02 0.05 expense ------------- Total Operational (0.03) 0.02 (0.20) (0.15) ------------------------------------------------------- Special items: None - - ------------- Total As Reported (0.20) (0.15) ------------------------------------------------------- Total As Reported 2.64 Less (1.17) special items ----- Operational 3.81 Total Operational for 2003 3.75 3.95 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Total As Reported for 2003 3.75 3.95 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- (t) Reflects 2002 earnings associated with disproportionate income sharing. Entergy's goal is to grow earnings at an average annual rate of 8 to 10 percent in 2003 and beyond. Entergy expects to achieve its targeted earnings by growing its existing businesses at approximately 6 percent with the remaining 2 to 4 percent from new capital investments. Entergy has acknowledged that such growth is achievable only if new investments can be made over the next several years. Entergy continues to remain confident that investment opportunities will be available and as such believes the targeted level of earnings growth is achievable beyond 2003. At the same time Entergy has consistently maintained a strict policy that new investments must exceed (on an ex ante basis) the incremental average project cost of capital while maintaining corporate credit metrics.

[Logo of Entergy] Entergy 639 Loyola Avenue New Orleans, LA 70113 Exhibit 99.2 Date: February 4, 2003 News Release For Release: Immediately Contact: Yolanda Pollard (News Media) (504) 576-4238 ypollar@entergy.com Nancy Morovich (Investor Relations) (504) 576-5506 nmorovi@entergy.com Entergy Reports Solid Earnings for Fourth Quarter 2002 New Orleans, La. - Entergy Corporation (NYSE:ETR) today announced fourth quarter 2002 as reported earnings of $75.8 million, or 33 cents per share, compared with $20.7 million, or 9 cents per share in fourth quarter 2001. On an operational basis, fourth quarter earnings were $77.4 million, or 34 cents per share, in 2002, compared with $39.8 million, or 18 cents per share, in 2001. The 89 percent increase in the quarter's operational earnings was driven by the continued strength of Entergy's competitive businesses. For the year 2002, Entergy announced as reported earnings of $599.4 million, or $2.64 per share, and operational earnings of $866.4 million, or $3.81 per share. These figures compare with $3.23 per share in as reported and operational earnings in 2001. The year over year decline in as reported earnings reflects special charges taken in 2002 associated with closing the North American operations of Entergy's wholesale power development business. Fourth quarter highlights for the company include the following: - Entergy Corporation received the prestigious 2002 Platts/BusinessWeek Global Power Company of the Year award for its nuclear growth strategy that has created one of the nation's most efficient and safest fleet of nuclear plants. It was the second major honor Entergy received in 2002. In June the company was named the recipient of the Edison Award, the highest honor presented within the electricity industry. - Hurricane Lili moved ashore on Oct. 3, 2002, leaving 243,000 Entergy customers in Louisiana and Mississippi without power. Six days later, all customers who were able to receive power were restored, once again proving Entergy is an industry leader in emergency restoration. - Entergy Nuclear completed refueling outages at Vermont Yankee and Indian Point 2 in record time, with no lost time accidents. "2002 was a year of disappointing performance in our industry, and as these results became more common and more unexpected, the crisis affected everyone," said J. Wayne Leonard, Entergy's chief executive officer. "Despite all of this, Entergy maintained its strong cash position, improved its credit quality and liquidity, and exceeded its targeted operational earnings growth. We now look ahead in 2003 with renewed commitment to build on our excellence in utility performance, grow our nuclear business, reinforce our energy trading capability, and continue our near five-year record of exceeding expectations." Utility Operations In fourth quarter 2002, as reported and operational utility earnings were $42.4 million, or 19 cents per share, compared to $44.5 million, or 20 cents per share, in fourth quarter 2001. The decrease in earnings quarter to quarter was due primarily to higher intercompany tax accruals and higher operation and maintenance expenses, both of which were largely offset by higher sales volumes across all customer classes. The increase in operation and maintenance expenses reflects higher plant outage costs in fossil, higher customer service support costs, and higher employee benefits expense. The decrease in earnings quarter over quarter for the utility was also impacted by an increase in the loss realized at Entergy New Orleans, Inc. A request for rate relief has been filed by Entergy New Orleans where inadequate rates continue to negatively impact that company's financial performance and the overall performance of the utility. Higher electricity usage in fourth quarter 2002 increased residential sales by 15 percent, compared to fourth quarter 2001. This significant and highly unusual increase is due to the confluence of positive factors - a return to normal weather and an improved economy, and this rate of growth is not expected to continue going forward. Commercial and governmental sales were up 5 percent, reflecting increased usage across all commercial customer classes, while industrial sales experienced an increase of 2 percent quarter over quarter. For the year 2002, the utility earned $2.57 per share on an as reported and operational basis, compared with $2.45 per share as reported, and $2.46 per share operational for 2001. The higher earnings in 2002 were due primarily to higher sales volumes, reflecting some strengthening in the economy, and cessation of goodwill amortization, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses due to higher fossil plant outage costs and higher nuclear and customer service support costs. Competitive Non-Regulated Businesses As reported earnings were $57.1 million, or 25 cents per share, for the competitive businesses in fourth quarter 2002 compared to $19.1 million, or 9 cents per share, in the same period of 2001. Fourth quarter 2002 results include a net negative special item of 1 cent per share while 2001 earnings included special items totaling negative 6 cents per share. The special amount in 2002 is comprised of impairments recorded in Entergy's non-nuclear wholesale asset business in connection with the RS Cogen project and write-down of a gas generation and services contract entered into by Entergy Power Management Corporation prior to the formation of Entergy-Koch L.P. The impact of these impairments was largely offset by tax benefits recorded as a result of the sale in fourth quarter 2002 of the Damhead Creek project in the UK. Excluding special items, operational earnings increased 73 percent, from 15 cents per share in fourth quarter 2001 to 26 cents per share in fourth quarter 2002. For the year 2002, as reported earnings from the competitive businesses declined to $54.7 million, or 24 cents per share, in 2002, from $233.8 million, or $1.04 per share, in 2001. The decline is primarily due to the special charge in second quarter 2002, as noted earlier, associated with the closing of Entergy's wholesale power development business. On an operational basis, the competitive businesses contributed operational earnings of $321.7 million, or $1.41 per share, compared with $212.4 million, or 95 cents per share, in 2001. Entergy Nuclear earned $33.8 million, or 15 cents per share, in fourth quarter 2002, compared to $28.9 million, or 13 cents per share, in fourth quarter 2001 on both an as reported and operational basis. The increase was due primarily to the contribution in 2002 of Vermont Yankee, which was acquired in July 2002, as well as to higher pricing in 2002 under certain power purchase contracts. For the year 2002, Entergy Nuclear contributed operational and as reported earnings of $201 million, or 88 cents per share, compared with $127.9 million, or 57 cents per share, in 2001. Energy Commodity Services, which includes earnings contributions from Entergy-Koch L.P. and Entergy's non-nuclear wholesale assets, reported earnings of $23.3 million, or 10 cents per share, in fourth quarter 2002, compared to a loss of $9.8 million, or 4 cents per share, in the same period last year. The improvement is due primarily to strong earnings in trading, improved results in the gas pipeline business, and the absence in 2002 of losses realized in fourth quarter 2001 in connection with asset sales in the non-nuclear wholesale asset business. Operational earnings in fourth quarter 2002 were $24.9 million, or 11 cents per share, compared with $2.5 million, or 2 cents per share, in the same period of 2001. The improvement in operational earnings was due primarily to solid results in both the trading and gas pipeline and storage businesses. As was the case in the first three quarters of 2002, the income sharing mechanisms that are part of the Entergy-Koch partnership agreement allocated substantially all of the partnership's income to Entergy in the fourth quarter of this year. Entergy-Koch L.P. contributed higher operational earnings in fourth quarter 2002 compared to the same period in 2001 primarily as a result of earnings at Entergy-Koch Trading. In addition, Gulf South Pipeline realized higher earnings even as volumes of gas transported decreased due to more favorable transportation contract pricing. For the year 2002, Energy Commodity Services had a loss of $145.8 million, or 64 cents per share, on an as reported basis, primarily due to the second quarter charge noted above, compared with earnings of $105.9 million, or 47 cents per share, in 2001. Operational earnings for the year 2002 were $121.2 million, or 53 cents per share, compared to $84.5 million, or 38 cents per share, in 2001. Parent & Other Parent & Other recorded a loss of $23.7 million, or 11 cents per share, in fourth quarter 2002 on both an as reported and operational basis. This compares to an as reported loss of $42.9 million, or 20 cents per share, and an operational loss of $36.1 million, or 17 cents per share, in fourth quarter 2001. The improved results were due primarily to a decrease in Parent consolidated tax benefits allocated to other Entergy companies and to higher interest income. In addition, fourth quarter 2001 as reported results included the impact of a negative special item of 3 cents per share, recorded in connection with the write-down of a non-core business investment. For the year 2002, Parent & Other had a loss of $38.6 million, or 17 cents per share, on an as reported basis, compared with a loss of $57.9 million, or 26 cents per share, in 2001. The improved results reflect the absence in 2002 of special items recorded at Parent & Other during 2001 related to expenses in connection with a terminated merger and the write-down of a non-core business investment. For the year, Parent & Other had an operational loss of $38.6 million, or 17 cents per share, in 2002 compared with a loss of $39.3 million, or 18 cents per share, in 2001. Outlook "Continued emphasis on operating excellence supported by a solid financial plan produced another quarter of very positive results," said C. John Wilder, Entergy's chief financial officer. "In 2002 Entergy was challenged by extremely difficult market conditions. The success achieved by Entergy as reflected in 2002 results supports our belief that our business fundamentals are sound and our strategic initiatives are on track. We enter 2003 with an economy that has yet to fully recover and with numerous challenges ahead in the energy market. However, we are committed to diligently manage our businesses consistent with our long-term aspirations in order to deliver sustained value to our shareholders." Entergy confirmed 2003 as reported and operational earnings guidance in the range of $3.75 to $3.95 per share. Earnings guidance for 2003 includes the impact of Entergy's decision to expense stock options effective first quarter 2003, which is not expected to be material.
