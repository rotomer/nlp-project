Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure.
The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the exhibit listed below, is being furnished, not filed, under Item 9 pursuant to Regulation FD. The information in this report and in such exhibits shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
On April 28, 2003, Entergy Corporation published its 2002 Investor Guide and Statistical Report. The complete text of this Report is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.
Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the exhibit listed below, is being furnished, not filed, under Item 9 to satisfy the requirements of Item 12, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition" in accordance with SEC Release Nos. 33-8216 and 34-47583. The information in this report and in such exhibits shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
On April 28, 2003, Entergy Corporation published its 2002 Investor Guide and Statistical Report. The complete text of this Report is attached hereto as Exhibit 99. Entergy's 2002 Investor Guide contains non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, Entergy has provided quantitative reconciliations within the Investor Guide of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
Each non-GAAP measure in the Investor Guide differs from GAAP only in that the figure or ratio states or includes operational earnings per share. Operational earnings per share is presented for each of Entergy's major business segments as well as on a consolidated basis. Operational earnings per share is not calculated in accordance with GAAP because it excludes the impact of "special items". Special items reflect the impact on earnings of events that are not routine, are related to prior periods, or are related to discontinued businesses. In addition, other financial measures including return on invested capital, (ROIC) and return on equity, (ROE), are included on both an operational and as reported basis. In each case, the metrics defined as "operational" exclude the impact of special items as defined above. Management believes financial metrics calculated using operational earnings provides useful information to investors in evaluating the ongoing results of En tergy's businesses and assists investors in comparing the company's operating performance to the operating performance of others in the energy sector. Entergy management frequently references these non-GAAP financial measures in its decision-making, using them to facilitate historical and ongoing performance comparisons as well as comparisons to the performance of peer companies.
The non-GAAP information presented in the Investor Guide should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, as reported earnings per share prepared in accordance with GAAP.

To Our Investors
 
 
 
In 2002, Entergy Corporation sustained its record of strong performance. The company also enhanced its financial strength and flexibility to succeed in the continued down cycle in power markets.
 
We achieved our goals to grow operational earnings 8 to 10 percent, to sustain strong cash flow, to improve net margin, to strengthen our balance sheet, and to improve liquidity. In short, we ended the year in a strong financial position, in a market that punished many participants for not exercising financial discipline. Entergy produced total shareholder return of 20.2 percent in 2002, compared to a 15 percent for the S&P Electric Utilities Index.
loss
 
In 2002, Entergy's as reported earnings were $2.64 per share, down from $3.23 per share in 2001, as a result of special charges related to our wholesale power development business. Excluding those charges, 2002 operational earnings were $3.81 per share, an increase of 18 percent. Operational earnings improved at each of our businessesthe utility, Entergy Nuclear, and Energy Commodity Services.
 
In addition in 2002:
 
 
 
Entergy continues to concentrate on long-term financial goals aimed at enhancing the financial strength and vitality of each of our businesses. These long-term goals are aimed at top-tier operational performance, financial flexibility, and strong investment returns:
 
 
 
 
We are hopeful that all of these efforts will result in top-quartile total shareholder return through a competitive dividend and stock price appreciation.
 
At the same time, we remain committed to the highest standards of integrity, transparency and disclosure. This Investor Guide reflects our continual efforts to improve the quality of the information we provide to the financial community. We hope that the financial and operational data presented here will be useful to you, and we are grateful for your interest in Entergy.
