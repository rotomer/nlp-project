Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including exhibits 99.2 and 99.3 attached hereto, is being furnished, not filed, under Item 12, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition."
On July 28, 2003, Entergy Corporation ("Entergy") issued the Earnings Releases, which are attached as exhibits hereto and incorporated herein by reference. Entergy's senior management team will host an earnings conference call at 10:00 a.m. CST, Monday, July 28, 2003

Entergy's Earnings Releases contain non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, Entergy has provided quantitative reconciliations within the Earnings Releases of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
Each non-GAAP measure in the Earnings Releases differs from GAAP only in that the figure or ratio states or includes operational earnings per share. Operational earnings per share is presented for each of Entergy's major business segments as well as on a consolidated basis. Operational earnings per share is not calculated in accordance with GAAP because it excludes the impact of "special items". Special items reflect the impact on earnings of events that are not routine, are related to prior periods, or are related to discontinued businesses. In addition, other financial measures including return on invested capital, (ROIC) and return on equity, (ROE), are included on both an operational and as reported basis. In each case, the metrics defined as "operational" exclude the impact of special items as defined above. Management believes financial metrics calculated using operational earnings provides useful information to investors in evaluating the ongoing results of Entergy's businesses and assists investors in comparing the company's operating performance to the operating performance of others in the energy sector. Entergy management frequently references these non-GAAP financial measures in its decision-making, using them to facilitate historical and ongoing performance comparisons as well as comparisons to the performance of peer companies.
The non-GAAP information presented in the Earnings Releases should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, as reported earnings per share prepared in accordance with GAAP.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
News Release
 
 
New Orleans, La. - The Board of Directors of Entergy Corporation (NYSE:ETR) has declared a quarterly dividend of 45 cents per common share. This dividend reflects a 29 percent increase over the previous dividend of 35 cents per common share. The payment date is Sept. 1, 2003 to stockholders of record Aug. 12, 2003. In addition, the Board established an objective to annually grow the dividend consistent with the achievement of its financial aspirations.
The higher dividend, which equates to $1.80 per share on an annual basis, reflects Entergy's strong earnings growth and cash generation over the past four years, and is based on the expected continuation of strong performance driven by intrinsic growth, intensified productivity improvements, and the asset acquisition opportunities that the company has positioned itself to capture. The higher dividend also responds to the recent reduction in federal dividend tax rates and provides a tax-efficient means of distributing returns to owners.
Given the current shares outstanding, the dividend increase equates to an incremental $90 million use of cash on an annual basis. Entergy anticipates the next review for a dividend increase will occur in October 2004 for the dividend payable Dec. 1, 2004.
"The dividend level is designed to balance current period payout against the need for financial flexibility and liquidity, thus providing for continued growth in both earnings and the dividend," said Chairman of the Board Robert v.d. Luft. "Management conducted rigorous stress testing to provide the Board comfort that the increased dividend is sustainable in a wide range of scenarios."
The dividend is part of a broader set of financial aspirations that reflect Entergy's financial strength and business prospects, guided by a well-developed market point of view. The overarching financial goal is to achieve and maintain returns to shareholders, comprised of a combination of earnings growth and yield, that rank in the top quartile among peers. Entergy will grow its dividend annually consistent with progress toward achievement of the following financial aspirations:
to achieve a return of 9 percent on average invested capital in the near term, and 10 percent in the long term;
to maintain near-term earnings growth of 8-10 percent, comprised of 6 percent intrinsic growth and 2-4 percent growth from asset acquisitions, and long-term growth of 5-6 percent, equal to top-quartile industry growth over the last 20 years; and
to earn a single A credit rating over the long term by maintaining or improving its 45-50 percent net debt to net capital ratio and 4 times or better interest coverage.
A critical element in realizing these financial aspirations is achieving improvements in productivity. Entergy's financial plans include incremental cost savings totaling $70 million, comprised of $45 million in the utility and $25 million in Entergy's competitive nuclear business. When combined with $75 million of savings already identified for Entergy Nuclear, these productivity improvements total $145 million to be achieved from 2003 through 2007.
Success in achieving these productivity improvements will expand net operating profit after taxes by an amount that essentially funds the cash cost of the dividend increase.
Entergy Corporation is an integrated energy company engaged primarily in electric power production, retail distribution operations, energy marketing and trading, and gas transportation. Entergy owns and operates power plants with about 30,000 megawatts of electric generating capacity, and it is the second-largest nuclear generator in the United States. Entergy delivers electricity to 2.6 million utility customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. Through Entergy-Koch, LP, it is also a leading provider of wholesale energy marketing and trading services, as well as an operator of natural gas pipeline and storage facilities.

NEW ORLEANS - Entergy Corporation reported second quarter 2003 earnings of $0.89 per share compared with $1.06 in the same period of 2002, reflecting a loss provision of $(0.28) per share related to the River Bend Nuclear Power Plant. Entergy's earnings on an operational basis were $1.17 per share which equaled operational earnings for second quarter 2002.
Entergy generated $475 million in operating cash flow in second quarter 2003 compared to $449 million in the same period of 2002. The increase was due primarily to higher levels of deferred fuel cost recovery in the current quarter compared to one year ago and the receipt in second quarter 2003 of a dividend from Entergy-Koch, LP. Both of these items were partially offset by higher cash expenditures at Entergy Nuclear in connection with planned refueling outages.
"Operating results reflect the structural stability we've worked to build into our business over the past five years," said . "Strong execution and results at Entergy-Koch, which is the business specifically structured to manage risks, overcame the temporary impacts of mild weather and nuclear outages we experienced this quarter. We are confident in our ability to achieve continued strong financial results, and in turn, to produce top quartile returns for our shareholders."
J. Wayne Leonard, Entergy's chief executive officer
Table 1 provides a comparative summary of earnings per share for second quarter and year-to-date 2003.
 
I.
U.S. Utility
In second quarter 2003, Utility as-reported earnings were $0.53 per share, compared to $0.85 in second quarter 2002. Second quarter 2003 as-reported earnings include a loss provision of $(0.28) per share related to an unfavorable decision in Texas on previously disallowed River Bend construction costs. On an operational basis, as-reported earnings were $0.81 in second quarter 2003 compared to $0.85 last year. The decrease resulted primarily from lower net revenues due to milder weather and decreased sales in the industrial sector. Operation and maintenance expenses were significantly lower during second quarter 2003 due primarily to the absence in 2003 of ice storm expenses recorded in second quarter 2002 as a result of a settlement reached with the Arkansas Public Service Commission. The 2002 net income impact of this regulatory settlement was essentially zero, because revenues were recorded at the same time. After excluding the effect of the ice stor m settlement, operation and maintenance expenses were essentially flat in second quarter 2003 compared to the same period in 2002.
Usage in the residential sector was essentially flat in second quarter 2003 compared to second quarter 2002. Commercial and governmental sales were up slightly, while industrial sales experienced a 7 percent decline quarter over quarter. The decline in industrial sales reflects the loss of three industrial customers to cogeneration since second quarter 2002. A summary of sales volumes by customer class is included in Appendix A to this release.
Table 2 provides a summary of the Utility's key operational measures with quarter-to-quarter and year-to-date comparisons.
The Utility continues to pursue rate mechanisms that reward operating excellence. Such efforts resulted in Entergy New Orleans, Inc. obtaining a base rate increase of $30.2 million in second quarter 2003. Appendix C provides a summary of the Utility's pending key regulatory events and regulatory recovery mechanisms by operating subsidiary.
II.
Parent & Other
Parent & Other recorded an as-reported loss per share of $(0.04) in second quarter 2003, compared with a loss of $(0.02) in second quarter 2002. Operational results in each period equaled as-reported results. The loss in second quarter 2003 was due primarily to higher interest expense reflecting the impact of Parent term debt, totaling $500 million, issued since December 2002 at an average coupon rate of 7.2 percent.
III.
Competitive Businesses
As-reported earnings were $0.40 per share for the competitive businesses in second quarter 2003, compared to $0.23 in the same period of 2002. As-reported earnings in 2002 reflected a charge totaling $(0.11) per share for asset impairments and restructuring expenses in the non-nuclear wholesale assets business. On an operational basis, second quarter 2003 earnings per share were $0.40 compared to $0.34 in 2002. The 18 percent increase in second quarter 2003 reflects strong performance at Energy Commodity Services which more than offset the negative impact of refueling outages at Entergy Nuclear.
Table 3 provides a 2003 vs. 2002 comparison of contributions by competitive business for second quarter and year-to-date, on both as-reported and operational bases.
 
Table 4 provides a summary of Entergy's non-utility generation in MWh sold forward for the years 2003, 2004, and 2005. During the first two quarters of 2003, Entergy entered into eight new contracts for Entergy Nuclear plant output. Transaction terms range from 2004 to 2008. These transactions cover more than 2 million and 4 million megawatt hours in 2004 and 2005, respectively.
(a) Two percent of EN's total planned generation sold forward in 2005 is associated with the Vermont Yankee contract for which pricing may be adjusted.
Entergy Nuclear
Entergy Nuclear (EN) earned $0.19 per share, compared to $0.24 in second quarter 2002. The decrease was due primarily to lower generation available for sale as the result of two planned refueling outages and several short unplanned outages. In second quarter 2002, there were no refueling outages. The contribution in 2003 of Vermont Yankee, acquired in July 2002, served to offset somewhat the negative impact of outages during the quarter. EN's average capacity factor was 84.1 percent for second quarter 2003, compared to 98.5 percent for the same period in 2002. Adjusting for the impact of planned refueling outages, EN's capacity factor for second quarter 2003 would have been approximately 95 percent.
Average production costs increased modestly quarter to quarter due to higher amortized refueling outage expenses resulting from additional planned refueling outages. Excluding the impact of these higher amortization expenses, average production costs for second quarter 2003 was less than $19 per megawatt hour. For the years 2003 and 2004, EN has sold 100 percent and 98 percent, respectively, of the output of its generating assets at average prices per megawatt hour of $37 in 2003 and $38 in 2004. In addition, 39 percent of 2005 output is currently under contract at an average price of $37 per megawatt hour.
 
Table 5 provides a summary of Entergy Nuclear's key operational measures with quarter-to-quarter and year-to-date comparisons.
(b) Indian Point 3 began its scheduled refueling outage on March 28, 2003.
Energy Commodity Services
Energy Commodity Services (ECS) includes earnings contributions from Entergy-Koch, LP and Entergy's non-nuclear wholesale assets business. ECS recorded as-reported earnings of $0.21 per share in second quarter 2003, compared to a loss of $(0.01) in the same period last year. The significant improvement in results reported by ECS in 2003 was due primarily to strong earnings in trading and the absence in 2003 of charges recorded in second quarter 2002 for asset impairments and restructuring expenses in the non-nuclear wholesale assets business.
Operational earnings in second quarter 2003 were $0.21, compared to $0.10 in the same period of 2002, reflecting substantially higher earnings at Entergy-Koch Trading (EKT), a subsidiary of Entergy-Koch, LP. Compared to second quarter 2002, EKT's trading results reflected substantially higher earnings in point-of-view trading. In addition, the contribution from financial optimization more than doubled while earnings from physical optimization activities increased by more than 60 percent, both as compared to second quarter 2002. Earnings at Entergy-Koch's gas transportation subsidiary, Gulf South Pipeline, were $0.03 per share which equaled the performance of second quarter 2002. Improved transportation margins and storage fees served to offset lower throughput and higher production cost during the quarter to produce the flat pipeline earnings. The income sharing mechanisms that are part of the Entergy-Koch partnership agreement allocated substantially all of the partnership's income to Entergy in second quarter 2003.
Average Daily Earnings at Risk (DEAR) during second quarter 2003 increased to $12.9 million when compared to second quarter 2002, reflecting the strength of EKT's point-of-view and the additional capital employed consistent with that point-of-view. However, DEAR decreased compared to first quarter 2003, reflecting significantly lower market volatility in the current period. In addition to DEAR, EKT employs other risk measures that test whether or not overall risk is within acceptable limits. All of these measures were managed in accordance with established trading policies and procedures during the quarter.
The duration of EKT's trading book continues to be relatively short, with essentially all of the mark-to-market value converting to cash by the end of 2003. Further, essentially all of the total market value of EKT's mark-to-market portfolio is based on actively quoted prices, and approximately 95 percent of EKT's counterparty credit exposure is associated with companies that currently have investment-grade credit ratings. Lastly, mark-to-market earnings comprised 16 percent of Entergy's consolidated operational earnings for second quarter 2003.
 
Table 6 provides a summary of Energy Commodity Services' key operational measures with quarter-to-quarter and year-to-date comparisons.
(c) Previously reported volumes, which included only U.S. trading, have been adjusted to reflect both U.S. and Europe volumes traded.
 
Table 7 provides additional details on Entergy-Koch's trading activities during second quarter 2003.
IV.
Variance Analysis
Tables 8 and 9 provide second quarter and year-to-date 2003 vs. 2002 earnings variance analyses for "U.S. Utility, Parent & Other," "Competitive Businesses," and "Consolidated."
Footnotes to Tables 8 and 9 follow:
Other operation & maintenance expense decreased due primarily to the absence of Entergy Arkansas' ice storm settlement, $(0.44), recorded in second quarter 2002.
Asset/contract impairments and restructuring charges at the Competitive Businesses primarily reflect prior year's impact of recording expenses associated with exiting the greenfield power development business, as well as charges associated with impairment reserves related to certain non-nuclear wholesale assets.
Interest expense and other charges decreased due to the absence of debt associated with the Damhead Creek power plant in the UK.
Income statement line items are tax effected at the statutory rate. Any difference between the statutory and effective tax rate is reflected in the "income taxes-other" line.
Nuclear refueling outage expense increased due to higher nuclear refueling outage amortization expense at Indian Point 2, Vermont Yankee and FitzPatrick where outages were completed in fourth quarter 2002, and Pilgrim and Indian Point 3, where outages were completed during second quarter 2003.
Decommissioning expense increased due to higher accretion expense on decommissioning liabilities resulting from implementation of SFAS 143, which is primarily offset by regulatory credits captured in net revenue to reflect anticipated recovery of these expenses.
Other income (deductions) decreased due to a loss provision recorded as a result of an unfavorable court decision in Texas on previously-disallowed River Bend construction costs.
Other income (deductions) increased due primarily to higher Entergy-Koch earnings.
Net revenue decreased in second quarter and year-to-date 2003 due primarily to the absence in 2003 of the impact of recording the ice storm settlement reached with the Arkansas Public Service Commission in 2002. This settlement resulted in previously deferred revenues at Entergy Arkansas per the Transition Cost Account mechanism being recorded in net revenue in second quarter 2002. Regulatory credits, which show increases in second quarter and year-to-date periods, are offset by higher decommissioning expenses resulting from implementation of SFAS 143.
 
 
 
 
Cumulative effect of accounting change reflects implementation of SFAS 143, a new accounting standard which required the revaluation of certain assets and liabilities associated with nuclear decommissioning.
 
Table 10 lists special items by business with quarter-to-quarter and year-to-date comparisons. Special items are those events that are not routine, are related to prior periods, or are related to discontinued businesses. Special items are included in as-reported earnings per share results but are excluded from operational earnings per share. The timing of recording such items is made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
V.
Cash and Liquidity
Entergy generated $475 million in operating cash in second quarter 2003, an increase of $26 million compared to second quarter 2002. The increase in cash flow at Utility, Parent & Other is the result of higher deferred fuel cost recovery, approximately $75 million, in second quarter 2003 compared to one year ago, and the receipt of a $75 million dividend from Entergy-Koch, LP. Partially offsetting Utility, Parent & Other improved operating cash flow was a decrease of $91 million in operating cash flow at Entergy Nuclear. The lower cash flow at EN is due primarily to expenditures associated with planned and unplanned outages during second quarter 2003, as well as reduced revenues during this period resulting from lower generation.
Table 11 provides operating cash flow information with quarter-to-quarter and year-to-date comparisons for Utility, Parent & Other, Entergy Nuclear, and Energy Commodity Services.
Energy Commodity Services' operating cash flow includes contributions from Entergy's investment in Entergy-Koch, LP that are recognized in Entergy Corporation's financial statements (such as dividends received and taxes paid).
At the end of second quarter 2003, Entergy's combined cash balance and unused capacity on bank revolvers totaled more than $2 billion, comprised of $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents and unused revolver capacity of $1.2 billion at the Parent and Utility subsidiaries.  Entergy's $1.45 billion corporate revolver was renewed at its previous level during second quarter 2003. The revolver has a stated termination date of May 13, 2004, but can be extended to a one-year note at Entergy's discretion through a "term-out" provision. The renewed revolver combined with $500 million in Parent term debt issued since December 2002 provides Entergy with substantial liquidity and financial flexibility.
As detailed in Table 12, Entergy expects to have significant cash available through 2005 for three potential uses: investments in new businesses or assets, repayment of debt, and dividend increases. Sources shown on the table include $1.9 billion of new debt that Entergy believes it could issue in association with new investments while maintaining a net debt ratio of 50% or less. This amount could vary depending upon the type of new investment and the credit market environment. The table also reflects the impact of Entergy's Board of Directors' decision on July 27, 2003, to approve a 29 percent increase in the Entergy common dividend to $1.80 per share on an annual basis. This dividend increase will raise cash requirements for dividend payments by $90 million per year.
Table 12 provides a summary of projected sources and uses of cash for the period from July 1, 2003 through the end of 2005.
 
VI.
Other Financial Performance Highlights
As-reported net margin was 11.87 percent, an increase of nearly 6 percentage points over second quarter 2002, while operational net margin improved nearly 2 percentage points over last year to 10.8 percent. Return on equity, on an as-reported basis, increased by more than 6 percentage points to 12.85 percent while operational return on equity was nearly 12 percent.
Entergy's capital structure remains within the target range of 45 to 50 percent net debt to net capital. Entergy's off-balance sheet debt, exclusive of operating leases, equals $385 million and constitutes only 2 percent of total capitalization.
Table 13 provides a summary of financial measures with quarter-to-quarter and year-to-date comparisons.
(o) As-reported metrics are computed in accordance with GAAP as they include all components of net income, including special items. Operational metrics are non-GAAP measures as they are calculated using operational net income, which excludes the impact of special items. Reconciliations of operational earnings per share to as-reported earnings per share can be found in Appendix B.
VII.
Capital Expenditures
Entergy's capital plan from 2003 through 2005 calls for $3.7 billion of investment; $2.9 billion of this amount is associated with capital projects that maintain Entergy's existing assets. The remaining $0.8 billion is associated with previously identified investments such as the steam generator replacement at Arkansas Nuclear One Unit 1, nuclear plant power uprates at Entergy Nuclear, the completion of a gas-fired power plant currently under construction in Entergy's non-nuclear wholesale assets business, and a previously deferred equity investment for Entergy's interest in Entergy-Koch.
Table 14 provides a summary of planned capital expenditures for the period 2003 through 2005.
 
VIII.
Debt Refinancing
Entergy has $360 million of debt that matures in the remainder of 2003, $269 million or 75 percent of which is associated with the Utility. Entergy expects to fund approximately $150 million of remaining Utility 2003 maturities and all Entergy Nuclear 2003 maturities with cash. The balance of Utility 2003 maturities is expected to be refinanced for periods up to 30 years, consistent with the long-term nature of utility assets. Refinancing activity may be modified periodically in response to changing market conditions and capital needs.
Table 15 provides details on Entergy's 2003 debt maturities and refinancing activity.

Earnings Guidance
"Through the first half of 2003 we've achieved results that move us closer to meeting our financial objectives this year," said . "We are rising to meet the demands of difficult credit markets, constantly changing economic conditions, and operational challenges as we continue to produce solid financial results. Year-to-date strong performance at Entergy-Koch Trading supports our decision to raise 2003 earnings guidance to a range $4.05 to $4.25 on an operational basis. On an as-reported basis, revised 2003 earnings guidance is $4.37 to $4.57 per share, reflecting strong trading offset by the River Bend loss provision recorded this quarter. In addition, we are issuing as-reported and operational earnings guidance for 2004 in the range of $4.10 to $4.30 per share."
C. John Wilder, Entergy's chief financial officer
Entergy's full-year 2003 earnings guidance is detailed in Table 16. Earnings guidance for 2003 includes the impact, which is not expected to be material, of Entergy's decision to expense stock options effective first quarter 2003. Additional detail on other key assumptions reflected in the earnings ranges are as follows:
Approximately 65 percent of 2003 earnings are expected from the Utility. Earnings guidance is based on existing rate plans, including the Entergy Mississippi rate increase that became effective on January 1, 2003 and the rate increase put into effect June 3, 2003 at Entergy New Orleans. Current fuel recovery mechanisms are assumed for all companies with the exception of Entergy Mississippi, which recently agreed to delayed recovery of certain deferred fuel costs until 2004. Incremental earnings expected in 2003 are also the result of residential and commercial sales growth partially offset by lower industrial sales due to cogeneration losses. O&M expense, excluding the impact of the 2002 ice storm settlement, as well as depreciation, will be modestly higher.
More than 20 percent of 2003 earnings are expected from Entergy Nuclear, where prices set by power purchase agreements average $37/MWh. A year-over-year increase will result from the full-year impact of Vermont Yankee, outage differences, power uprates, and reduced overall operating costs. Currently, EN has sold 100 percent of the output of its generating assets, excluding a portion of uprated capacity, through the end of 2003 at prices that range from $29 to $42 per megawatt hour. The capacity factor assumption for the fleet ranges from 93 to 95 percent, and includes all outages completed to date.
Energy Commodity Services' guidance is based on contributions from Entergy-Koch at a 50 percent sharing of income for the remainder of 2003, consistent with Entergy's ownership share. Entergy received a disproportionate share of income from Entergy-Koch through the first six months of 2003, the impact of which is included in guidance. Modest year-over-year growth is anticipated in trading and at the pipeline.
Parent & Other's guidance is based on modest improvement in corporate expenses along with increased interest expense as a result of $500 million in Parent term debt issued since December 2002 at an average rate of 7.2 percent.
 
Table 16 provides Entergy's projection of 2003 operational earnings per share, with 2002 as-reported and operational earnings as its data starting points. As-reported earnings per share guidance is different from operational earnings per share guidance due to special items recorded to date. At this time, Entergy anticipates recording severance costs which will be treated as special items in the third and fourth quarters of 2003. These costs, which are not presented in the table below because they cannot be estimated at the present time, will result from voluntary severance programs which will be initiated to contribute to productivity improvements in the Utility and Entergy Nuclear.
Reflects year-over-year difference in disproportionate sharing: $0.21 in 2002 vs. $0.27 for year-to-date 2003.
As-reported guidance range is only based on actual year-to-date special items.
 
Entergy's 2003 earnings guidance is detailed in Table 17 below, with June 2003 year-to-date actual results as its starting point. This table reflects the projected changes in the earnings profile for each of Entergy's businesses for the remainder of 2003 based upon how the second half of 2003 is expected to differ from the second half of 2002. At this time, Entergy anticipates recording severance costs which will be treated as special items in the third and fourth quarters of 2003. These costs, which are not presented in the table below because they cannot be estimated at the present time, will result from voluntary severance programs which will be initiated to contribute to productivity improvements in the Utility and Entergy Nuclear.
Excludes impact of disproportionate sharing recorded in second half of 2002; $0.13 per share.
 
 
 
Entergy's full-year 2004 earnings guidance is detailed in Table 18. In contrast to 2003 guidance, the 2004 guidance table combines results from the Utility with Parent & Other to better reflect the way Entergy views and manages these businesses. Key assumptions reflected in the earnings ranges are as follows:
Approximately 65 percent of 2004 earnings are expected from the Utility, Parent & Other. Earnings guidance is based on existing rate plans, including the full-year impact of the rate increase put into effect June 3, 2003 at Entergy New Orleans. Incremental revenues expected in 2004 are also the result of sales growth in the 1.5 to 2.0 percent range. Earnings will also benefit from decreased interest expense and lower O&M expense driven by productivity improvements at the Utility. Partially offsetting are expected increases in depreciation and other expenses.
More than 25 percent of 2004 earnings are expected from Entergy Nuclear. Increased revenues will be generated by an approximate $1 increase in power purchase agreement prices, which will average about $38 in 2004. A year-over-year increase in revenues will also be driven by 60 MW of power uprates which will be added during 2003. Earnings will also increase as a result of productivity improvements that will lower O&M expense. EN has sold 98 percent of the 2004 expected output of its generating assets at prices that range from $29 to $43 per megawatt hour. The capacity factor assumption for the fleet ranges from 92 to 95 percent, and includes planned refueling outages at the Fitzpatrick, Indian Point 2, and Vermont Yankee plants.
Energy Commodity Services' guidance is based on contributions from Entergy-Koch at a 50 percent sharing of income, consistent with Entergy's ownership share. The guidance range also reflects conservative expectations for commodity trading results and modest year-over-year pipeline growth.
 
Entergy's 2004 earnings guidance is detailed in Table 18 below, with the guidance range for 2003 as-reported and operational earnings as its data starting points.
One of Entergy's financial aspirations is to deliver near-term earnings growth of 8-10 percent, comprised of 6% intrinsic growth and 2-4% growth from asset acquisitions. Entergy has acknowledged that this goal is achievable only if new investments are made. Entergy has consistently maintained a disciplined policy that requires new investments to exceed (on an ex ante basis) the incremental average project cost of capital while maintaining corporate credit metrics.
Over the long term, Entergy aspires to deliver earnings growth of 5-6%, equal to top-quartile industry growth over the last 20 years. Entergy's other financial aspirations include achieving a return of 9% on average invested capital in the near term, and 10% in the long term; achieving a single A credit rating over the long term by maintaining or improving its 45-50% net debt to net capital ratio and 4 times or better interest coverage; and growing the dividend annually, consistent with progress made toward the achievement of all financial aspirations.
Appendix A provides details of kwh sales and customer statistics for the Utility.
 
Appendix B provides a side-by-side comparison of historical performance measures.
(t) As-reported metrics are computed in accordance with GAAP as they include all components of net income, including special items. Operational metrics are non-GAAP measures as they are calculated using operational net income, which excludes the impact of special items. A reconciliation of operational earnings per share to as-reported earnings per share is provided here.
Appendix C provides a summary of the Utility's key regulatory cases and events that are pending as well as regulatory recovery mechanisms by operating subsidiary.
(u) Entergy Louisiana's formula rate plan expired with the 2001 test year. Under the expired formula, if Entergy Louisiana earned outside of the bandwidth range, rates would be adjusted on a prospective basis. If earnings were above the bandwidth range, rates would be reduced by 60% of the overage, and if below, increased by 60% of the shortfall.
(v) If Entergy Mississippi earns outside of the bandwidth range, rates will be adjusted on a prospective basis. If earnings are above the bandwidth range, rates are reduced by 50% of the overage, and if below, increased by 50% of the shortfall. The range presented above is not adjusted for performance measures, under which the ROE midpoint can increase or decrease by as much as 1%.
Appendix D provides definitions of certain operational and financial performance measures referenced in this release.

Entergy
Exhibit 99.3
 
News Release
 
New Orleans, La. - Entergy Corporation (NYSE:ETR) today announced second quarter 2003 operational earnings of $270.1 million, or $1.17 per share, which equaled the company record for second quarter operational earnings per share set in 2002. On an as-reported basis, Entergy earned $205.6 million, or 89 cents per share, compared with $241.7 million, or $1.06 per share, in the same period of 2002.
Second quarter 2003 as-reported earnings reflect a loss provision of $65.6 million, or 28 cents per share, related to the River Bend nuclear power plant. In second quarter 2002, as-reported results included a special charge of $25.4 million, or 11 cents per share, associated with the restructuring of Entergy's non-nuclear wholesale assets business.
"Operating results reflect the structural stability we've worked to build into our businesses over the past five years," said . "Strong execution and results at the Entergy-Koch venture, which is the business specifically structured to manage risks, overcame the temporary impacts of mild weather and nuclear outages we experienced this quarter. We are confident in our ability to achieve continued strong financial results, and in turn, to produce top quartile returns for our shareholders."
J. Wayne Leonard, Entergy's chief executive officer
Recent highlights include the following:
Entergy's Board of Directors approved an increase in the dividend from its current annual level of $1.40 per share to $1.80 per share, commencing with the quarterly dividend payment due September 1. In addition, the Board established an objective to annually grow the dividend consistent with the achievement of the company's financial aspirations.
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission removed the "yellow finding" that was issued for the Indian Point 2 nuclear plant. The NRC has now removed both "red" and "yellow" findings since Entergy purchased Indian Point 2 in 2001, officially reflecting improvements in safety at the plant.
The Federal Energy Management Agency and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission both concluded that emergency plans at the Indian Point Nuclear Energy Center provide reasonable assurance that the health and safety of citizens in surrounding communities are adequately protected.
The Nebraska Public Power District selected Entergy from among several national nuclear operating companies to provide management services to the Cooper Nuclear Station.
Utility as-reported earnings in second quarter 2003 were $121.7 million, or 53 cents per share, compared to $194.9 million, or 85 cents per share, in second quarter 2002. Second quarter 2003 as-reported earnings include a loss provision of $65.6 million, or 28 cents per share, related to an unfavorable decision in Texas on previously disallowed River Bend construction costs.
In second quarter 2003, utility operational earnings were $187.3 million, or 81 cents per share, compared with $194.9 million, or 85 cents per share, in the same period last year. The decrease resulted primarily from lower revenues due to milder weather and decreased sales in the industrial sector.
Usage in the residential sector was essentially flat in second quarter 2003 compared to second quarter 2002. Commercial and governmental sales were up slightly, while industrial sales experienced a 7 percent reduction quarter over quarter. Residential and commercial sales were negatively impacted by weather, while the quarter-on-quarter decline in industrial sales is attributed to the loss of three customers to cogeneration.
Operation and maintenance expenses were significantly lower during second quarter 2003 due primarily to the absence in 2003 of ice storm expenses recorded in second quarter 2002 as a result of a settlement reached with the Arkansas Public Service Commission.
The competitive businesses, which are comprised of Entergy Nuclear and Energy Commodity Services, recorded as-reported earnings of $93.4 million, or 40 cents per share, compared to $51.5 million, or 23 cents per share, in second quarter 2002. Second quarter 2002 results included a special charge totaling a negative 11 cents per share for asset impairments and restructuring expenses in the non-nuclear wholesale assets business.
Excluding this special charge, operational earnings for the competitive businesses increased 18 percent from $76.9 million, or 34 cents per share, in second quarter 2002 to $92.3 million, or 40 cents per share, in second quarter 2003. The increase reflects strong performance at Energy Commodity Services which more than offset the negative impact of refueling outages at Entergy Nuclear.
earned $44.9 million, or 19 cents per share, on an as-reported basis, compared to $53.5 million, or 24 cents per share, in second quarter 2002. Operational results in each period equaled as-reported results. The decrease in earnings was due primarily to lower generation available for sale as a result of two planned refueling outages and several short unplanned outages. In second quarter 2002, there were no refueling outages. The contribution in 2003 of Vermont Yankee, acquired in July 2002, helped to offset the negative impact of outages during the quarter.
Entergy Nuclear
, which includes earnings contributions from Entergy-Koch, LP and Entergy's non-nuclear wholesale assets, recorded as-reported earnings of $48.6 million, or 21 cents per share, in second quarter 2003, compared to a loss of $2 million, or 1 cent per share, in the same period last year. The significant improvement in results reported in 2003 was due primarily to strong earnings in trading and the absence in 2003 of charges recorded in second quarter 2002 for asset impairments and restructuring expenses in the non-nuclear wholesale assets business.
Energy Commodity Services
Operational earnings in second quarter 2003 were $47.5 million, or 21 cents per share, compared to $23.4 million, or 10 cents per share, in the same period of 2002 reflecting substantially higher earnings at Entergy-Koch Trading, a subsidiary of Entergy-Koch, LP. Second quarter 2003 earnings from Entergy-Koch's gas transportation subsidiary, Gulf South Pipeline, were essentially flat compared to the same period in 2002. The income sharing mechanisms that are part of the Entergy-Koch partnership agreement allocated substantially all of the partnership's income to Entergy in the second quarter of 2003.
Parent & Other recorded an as-reported loss of $9.5 million, or 4 cents per share, in second quarter 2003, compared with a loss of $4.7 million, or 2 cents per share, in second quarter 2002. Operational results in each period equaled as-reported results. The loss in second quarter 2003 was due primarily to higher interest expense reflecting the impact of Parent term debt, totaling $500 million, issued since December 2002 at an average coupon rate of 7.2 percent.
"Through the first half of 2003, we've achieved results that move us closer to meeting our financial objectives this year," said "We are rising to meet the demands of difficult credit markets, constantly changing economic conditions and operational challenges as we continue to produce solid financial results. Year-to-date strong performance at Entergy-Koch Trading supports our decision to raise 2003 earnings guidance to a range $4.05 to $4.25 on an operational basis. On an as-reported basis, revised 2003 earnings guidance is $4.37 to $4.57 per share, reflecting strong trading offset by the River Bend loss provision recorded this quarter. In addition, we are issuing as-reported and operational earnings guidance for 2004 in the range of $4.10 to $4.30 per share."
