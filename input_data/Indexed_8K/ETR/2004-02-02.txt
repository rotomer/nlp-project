Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including exhibits listed below, is being furnished, not filed, under Item 12, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition."
On February 2, 2004, Entergy Corporation ("Entergy") issued the Earnings Releases, which are attached as exhibits hereto and incorporated herein by reference. Entergy's senior management team will host an earnings conference call at 10:00 a.m. CST, Monday, February 2, 2004

Entergy's Earnings Releases contain non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, Entergy has provided quantitative reconciliations within the Earnings Releases of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
Each non-GAAP measure in the Earnings Releases differs from GAAP only in that the figure or ratio states or includes operational earnings per share. Operational earnings per share is presented for each of Entergy's major business segments as well as on a consolidated basis. Operational earnings per share is not calculated in accordance with GAAP because it excludes the impact of "special items". Special items reflect the impact on earnings of events that are not routine, are related to prior periods, or are related to discontinued businesses. In addition, other financial measures including return on invested capital, (ROIC) and return on equity, (ROE), are included on both an operational and as reported basis. In each case, the metrics defined as "operational" exclude the impact of special items as defined above. Entergy uses these measures internally in budgeting and performance monitoring activities to gauge business performance and the ongoing strength of each business segment. Entergy further believes these metrics provides useful information to investors in evaluating Entergy's ongoing business results and assists investors in comparing the company's operating performance to the operating performance of others in the energy sector.
The non-GAAP information presented in the Earnings Releases should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, as reported earnings per share prepared in accordance with GAAP.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

INVESTOR NEWS
Exhibit 99.1
February 2, 2004
NEW ORLEANS - Entergy Corporation reported a fourth quarter 2003 loss of $(0.17) per share on an as-reported basis compared with income of $0.33 per share in the same period of 2002. Fourth quarter 2003 included a special item reflecting severance charges recorded in connection with a voluntary severance program announced by Entergy in October 2003. Entergy's earnings on an operational basis were $0.38 per share in fourth quarter 2003 compared to $0.34 per share in fourth quarter 2002.
"All of our targeted productivity improvements are well underway and solid progress is being achieved. We have established ambitious financial and operational objectives for each of our businesses and are confident in our ability to enhance shareholder value and achieve top quartile returns. Our voluntary severance program was well received and based on the number of employees participating, we exceeded the goals we had originally established," said . "The longer term value of effective and efficient processes will clearly exceed the initial cost incurred in connection with this program while continuing to improve operational performance."
J. Wayne Leonard, Entergy's chief executive officer

I.
Consolidated Results
Table 1 provides a comparative summary of consolidated earnings per share for fourth quarter and year-to-date 2003.
II.
U.S. Utility Results
In fourth quarter 2003, Utility had an as-reported loss of $(0.14) per share, compared to earnings of $0.19 per share in fourth quarter 2002. The as-reported loss in 2003 includes special items of $(0.30) per share associated with severance charges recorded in connection with a voluntary severance program announced by Entergy in October 2003. On an operational basis, Utility earnings were $0.16 per share in fourth quarter 2003 compared to $0.19 in fourth quarter 2002. The decrease resulted primarily from the effects of milder-than-normal weather in 2003 compared to normal weather experienced in fourth quarter 2002, as well as increased income tax expense, the effects of which were partially offset by rate changes implemented during 2003.
Gigawatt-hours billed to residential customers in fourth quarter 2003 were essentially flat after adjusting for milder-than-normal weather compared to fourth quarter 2002. Commercial and governmental sales were up nearly 3 percent, while industrial sales experienced a decline of more than 4 percent quarter over quarter. The decline in industrial sales reflects the loss of two customers to cogeneration in fourth quarter 2002. Excluding the loss of these customers, which represented approximately 700 GWh of sales in fourth quarter 2002, overall retail sales increased slightly in fourth quarter 2003 compared to the same period last year. A summary of sales volumes by customer class is included in Table 2 below.
For the year 2003, the utility earned $2.03 per share on an as-reported basis, compared with $2.57 per share for 2002. Operational earnings in 2003 were $2.71 per share compared to $2.57 per share for 2002. The higher earnings in 2003 were due primarily to improved pricing resulting from rate changes put into effect in 2003 and lower interest costs, both of which were partially offset by milder-than-normal weather in the current year.
Table 2 provides a summary of the Utility's key operational measures with quarter-to-quarter and year-to-date comparisons.
(a) Excluding charges associated with Entergy's voluntary severance plan, O&M expense per MWh would have been $26.23 for the quarter and $20.31 for full year 2003.
Appendix B provides a summary of the Utility's pending regulatory cases and events by operating subsidiary.
III.
Parent & Other
Parent & Other recorded improved results compared to last year with an as-reported and operational loss per share of $(0.03) in fourth quarter 2003, compared with a loss of $(0.11) per share in fourth quarter 2002. The improvement was due primarily to lower income tax expense.
For the year 2003, Parent & Other had a loss of $(0.10) per share on an as-reported basis, and $(0.09) per share on an operational basis. In 2002, Parent & Other had a loss of $(0.17) per share on both as-reported and operational bases. The improved results in 2003 primarily reflect lower tax expense.
IV.
Competitive Businesses
The competitive businesses had $0.00 earnings per share on an as-reported basis in fourth quarter 2003, compared to $0.25 per share in the same period of 2002. As-reported results in 2003 included special items totaling $(0.25) per share primarily associated with severance charges in connection with the voluntary severance program announced by Entergy in October 2003. On an operational basis, fourth quarter 2003 earnings per share were nearly flat at $0.25 per share compared to $0.26 per share in 2002. While Entergy Nuclear recorded strong earnings in fourth quarter 2003, lower results at Energy Commodities Services offset the improvement.
Comparing full year 2003 to 2002, the increase in as-reported earnings at the competitive businesses from $0.24 per share in 2002 to $2.08 per share in 2003 was driven by a significantly higher earnings contribution from Entergy-Koch Trading in 2003, as well as the absence of a special charge recorded in second quarter 2002 associated with the closing of Entergy's wholesale power development business. On an operational basis, the competitive businesses contributed earnings of $1.63 per share in 2003 compared to $1.41 per share in 2002.
 
Table 3 provides a summary of Entergy's competitive businesses' energy and capacity sold forward for the next five years. For the years 2004, 2005 and 2006, Entergy Nuclear has sold 100 percent, 54 percent, and 45 percent of planned generation at average prices per megawatt-hour of $38, $37 and $36, respectively. In addition, for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006, Energy Commodity Services has sold 62 percent, 66 percent and 50 percent of its planned energy and capacity at average prices per megawatt-hour of $26, $25 and $27, respectively.
Entergy Nuclear Results
Entergy Nuclear (EN) recorded of loss of $(0.01) per share on an as-reported basis in fourth quarter 2003 due primarily to the impact of recording severance charges in connection with Entergy's voluntary severance program. Excluding these and other charges, Entergy Nuclear's operational earnings were $0.24 per share for fourth quarter 2003. In fourth quarter 2002 Entergy Nuclear recorded $0.15 in both as-reported and operational earnings per share. The 60 percent increase in operational earnings in fourth quarter 2003 versus the same period in 2002 was due primarily to a 27 percent increase in MWh produced as there were no refueling outages in fourth quarter 2003 while there were three such outages in fourth quarter 2002. EN's average capacity factor was 98 percent for fourth quarter 2003, compared to 78 percent for the same period in 2002.
Average production costs decreased by 23 percent on a quarter to quarter basis due to a combination of higher generation and the timing of various expenses. For the full year 2003, production costs were in line with 2002 costs and were consistent with Entergy Nuclear's previous projections for the year.
Table 4 provides a summary of Entergy Nuclear's key operational measures with quarter-to-quarter and year-to-date comparisons.
(c) Production cost does not include severance charges associated with the voluntary severance program.
Energy Commodity Services Results
Energy Commodity Services (ECS) includes earnings contributions from Entergy-Koch, LP and Entergy's non-nuclear wholesale assets business. ECS recorded as-reported and operational earnings of $0.01 per share in fourth quarter 2003, compared to $0.10 per share in as-reported earnings and $0.11 per share in operational earnings in the same period last year. The decrease in 2003 was due in part to a larger loss at the non-nuclear wholesale assets business resulting from one additional plant being completed in late 2002, and a second in 2003. The new plants increased overall operating expenses of this business where depressed spark spreads and excess reserve margins continue to diminish revenue opportunities. In addition, decreased results at Gulf South Pipeline driven by lower revenues and higher expenses also contributed to lower results at ECS.
Operational earnings contributed by Entergy-Koch Trading (EKT) in fourth quarter 2003 were $0.07 which equaled operational earnings in the same period of 2002. Volatility was slightly up compared to fourth quarter 2002 and trading earnings reflected solid POV trading results, the expansion of EKT's optimization business and an improved contribution from EKT's European business.
The income sharing mechanisms that are part of the Entergy-Koch partnership agreement allocated substantially all of the partnership's income to Entergy in fourth quarter 2003. Beginning in 2004, Entergy's share of the partnership's income is expected to be 50 percent, consistent with its ownership interest.
 
Table 5 provides a summary of EKT's key operational measures with quarter-to-quarter and year-to-date comparisons.
 
EKT's Daily Average Earnings at Risk (DEAR) during fourth quarter 2003 decreased 25 percent to $9.8 million, when compared to fourth quarter 2002. In addition to DEAR, EKT employs other risk measures that test whether or not overall risk is within acceptable limits. All of these measures were managed in accordance with established trading policies and procedures during the quarter.
Essentially all of the market value of EKT's mark-to-market portfolio is based on actively quoted prices, and approximately 91 percent of EKT's counterparty credit exposure is associated with companies that currently have investment-grade credit ratings. Lastly, mark-to-market earnings comprised 18 percent of Entergy's consolidated operational earnings for fourth quarter 2003. For the year, mark-to-market earnings comprised 19 percent of Entergy's consolidated operational earnings.
 
Table 6 provides additional details on EKT's business that are common indicators of the magnitude of capital employed, book duration of contracts traded, and sources used to value such contracts, among other things.
As-reported and operational earnings at Entergy-Koch's gas transportation subsidiary, Gulf South Pipeline, were $0.01 per share in fourth quarter 2003 compared to $0.08 per share in fourth quarter 2002. Lower throughput and higher production costs impacted Gulf South's results. The decreased throughput was due to higher gas prices causing generally lower gas demand as industrial and power plant customers switch to fuel oil or competitive carriers. Higher costs were primarily the result of incremental legal and consultant expenses incurred primarily in connection with Gulf South's defense of a lawsuit which it believes has no merit.
Table 7 provides a summary of Gulf South Pipeline's key operational measures with quarter-to-quarter and year-to-date comparisons.
V.
Variance Analysis
Tables 8 and 9 provide fourth quarter and year-to-date 2003 vs. 2002 earnings variance analyses for "U.S. Utility, Parent & Other," "Competitive Businesses," and "Consolidated."
Footnotes to Tables 8 and 9 follow:
Net revenue increased in fourth quarter due primarily to higher revenues resulting from rate changes implemented during 2003, higher volumes in unbilled revenues, and increased fuel prices. Also, increased revenue from the competitive retail business led to higher net revenues quarter over quarter. Entergy's retail business is currently operating within ERCOT and as a start-up is generating revenues but has not yet achieved profitability. Year-to-date net revenue increased due primarily to higher revenues from rate changes, unbilled volume increases and competitive retail sales. Regulatory credits also increased, but were mostly offset by higher decommissioning expenses resulting from the implementation of SFAS 143. All of the year-to-date items were partially offset by the absence in 2003 of the impact of recording the ice storm settlement reached with the Arkansas Public Service Commission in 2002. This settlement resulted in previously deferred revenue s at Entergy Arkansas per the Transition Cost Account mechanism being recorded in net revenue in second quarter 2002.
 
Net revenue increased due primarily to higher revenues at Entergy Nuclear resulting from increased generation compared to fourth quarter 2002. There were three planned refueling outages in fourth quarter 2002 as compared to none in fourth quarter 2003.
Decommissioning expense increased due to higher accretion expense on decommissioning liabilities resulting from implementation of SFAS 143, which is primarily offset by regulatory credits captured in net revenue to reflect anticipated recovery of these expenses.
Other income (deductions) decreased due primarily to lower Gulf South Pipeline earnings, while higher earnings at Entergy-Koch Trading resulted in improved year-to-date results.
Interest and dividend income decreased due primarily to lower decommissioning trust investment earnings driven by basis adjustments to various trust assets.
Income statement line items are tax effected at the statutory rate. Any difference between the statutory and effective tax rate is reflected in the "Income taxes-other" line.
Other operation & maintenance expense increased in fourth quarter due primarily to charges recorded in connection with the voluntary severance program. For the year 2003, other operation & maintenance expense decreased due to the absence of expenses recorded in 2002 as part of Entergy Arkansas' ice storm settlement, $(0.44), the effect of which was partially offset by the voluntary severance program charges.
Other operation & maintenance expense increased in fourth quarter due primarily to charges recorded at Entergy Nuclear in connection with the voluntary severance program.
Asset/contract impairments and restructuring charges at the Competitive Businesses primarily reflect prior year's impact of recording costs associated with impairment reserves related to certain non-nuclear wholesale assets.
Cumulative effect of accounting change reflects the financial impact of the implementation of SFAS 143, the effect of which was originally recorded in first quarter 2003, an adjustment to which was recorded in fourth quarter 2003.
Interest expense and other charges decreased due to the absence of debt associated with the Damhead Creek power plant in the UK.
Other income (deductions) decreased due to a loss provision recorded in second quarter 2003, $(0.29), as a result of an unfavorable court decision in Texas on previously-disallowed River Bend construction costs.
Depreciation/amortization expense increased due to the impact of the implementation of SFAS 143 as well as additional depreciation recorded on new plant investments.
Nuclear refueling outage expense increased due to higher nuclear refueling outage amortization expense at Indian Point 2, Vermont Yankee and FitzPatrick where outages were completed in fourth quarter 2002, and Pilgrim and Indian Point 3, where outages were completed during second quarter 2003.
 
Tables 10 lists special items by business with quarter-to-quarter and year-to-date earnings per share comparisons. Table 11 reflects the same items in dollars so as to show the related impact on net income. Special items are those events that are not routine, are related to prior periods, or are related to discontinued businesses. Special items are included in as-reported earnings per share results consistent with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), but are excluded from operational earnings per share. As a result, operational earnings per share is considered a non GAAP measure. Entergy uses this measure internally in budgeting and performance monitoring activities to gauge business performance and the ongoing strength of each business segment. Entergy further believes this metric provides useful information to investors in evaluating Entergy's ongoing business results and assists investors in comparing the company's operating performance to the operating performance of others in the energy sector.
 
 
VI.
Cash and Liquidity
Entergy generated $830 million in operating cash in fourth quarter 2003, an increase of $318 million compared to fourth quarter 2002. Higher revenues and the absence of refueling outage costs at Entergy Nuclear, and a $25 million dividend received from Entergy-Koch, LP, all contributed to the increase. In addition, decreased levels of working capital increased cash flow in fourth quarter 2003 compared to the same period last year. Full year operating cash flow totaled $2 billion, slightly above Entergy's previous full-year projection.
Table 12 provides operating cash flow information with quarter-to-quarter and year-to-date comparisons for Utility, Parent & Other, Entergy Nuclear, and Energy Commodity Services. Amounts shown include the impact of cash payments made between companies as a result of the Entergy Tax Allocation agreement.
Energy Commodity Services' operating cash flow includes contributions from Entergy's investment in Entergy-Koch, LP that are recognized in Entergy Corporation's financial statements (such as dividends received and taxes paid).
At the end of fourth quarter 2003, Entergy's combined cash balance and unused capacity on bank revolvers totaled more than $2.2 billion, comprised of $692 million of cash and cash equivalents and unused revolver capacity of $1.55 billion at the Parent and Utility subsidiaries. 
 
As detailed in Table 13, Entergy expects to have significant cash available through 2006 for three potential uses: investments in new businesses or assets, repayment of debt or equity, and dividend increases. Sources shown on the table include $1.8 billion of new debt that Entergy believes it could issue in association with new investments while maintaining a net debt ratio of 50% or less. This amount could vary depending upon the type of new investment and the credit market environment.
Table 13 provides a summary of projected sources and uses of cash for the period from January 1, 2004 through the end of 2006.
 
VII.
Financial Measures
As-reported net margin was 10.08 percent, an increase of nearly 3 percentage points over 2002, while operational net margin improved slightly over last year to 10.67 percent. Return on equity, on an as-reported basis, increased by more than 3 percentage points to 11.25 percent while operational return on equity exceeded 11.9 percent.
Entergy's capital structure remains within the target range of 45 to 50 percent net debt to net capital. Entergy's off-balance sheet debt, exclusive of operating leases, equals $414 million and constitutes less than 3 percent of total capitalization.
Table 14 provides a summary of financial measures with quarter-to-quarter and year-to-date comparisons. Financial measures in the table include those prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, (GAAP), as well as non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP measures are included in order to remove the effect of non-recurring special items from commonly used financial metrics. Entergy uses these non-GAAP measures internally in budgeting and performance monitoring activities to gauge business performance and the ongoing strength of each business segment. Entergy further believes these measures provide useful information to investors in evaluating Entergy's ongoing business results and assists investors in comparing the company's operating performance to the operating performance of others in the energy sector.
 
Non-GAAP measures are identified with an * in the above table.
VIII.
Capital Expenditures
Entergy's capital plan from 2004 through 2006 includes $4.2 billion for investment; $2.7 billion of this amount is associated with capital projects that maintain Entergy's existing assets. Approximately $0.7 billion of the remaining amount is associated with previously identified investments such as the steam generator replacement at Arkansas Nuclear One Unit 1, nuclear plant power uprates at Entergy Nuclear and Utility, the purchase of the Perryville plant, and a previously deferred equity investment for Entergy's interest in Entergy-Koch. The remaining $0.8 billion includes planned capital expenditures associated with future investments in generation supply assets, various transmission upgrades, environmental compliance expenditures, and other miscellaneous projects.
Table 15 provides a summary of planned capital expenditures for the period 2004 through 2006.
(t) Includes costs associated with the competitive retail business.
 
 
 
IX.
Debt Refinancing
During 2003, Entergy completed debt refinancings of 2004 maturities totaling $742 million for Utility and $595 million for Parent. As a result, the average Utility coupon declined to 6 percent from almost 6.5 percent, and average maturity of the Utility's debt portfolio was extended to 13 years. In addition, Parent senior notes in the amount of $535 million were privately placed in 2003.
Table 16 provides details on Entergy's scheduled maturities as of December 31, 2003.

Earnings Guidance
"Fourth quarter 2003 completed another excellent year of financial performance for Entergy," said . "Our business fundamentals are solidly in place and we have a clear line of sight on the challenging but achievable financials goals we've established for 2004 and beyond. The foundation we've built and the financial discipline we've established give us confidence in our ability to achieve as-reported and operational earnings guidance for 2004 in the range of $4.10 to $4.30 per share."
C. John Wilder, Entergy's chief financial officer
Entergy's 2004 earnings guidance is detailed in Table 17 below, with 2003 actual results as its starting point. Earnings guidance for 2004 reflects the impact of the cessation of Entergy's disproportionate sharing of income from the Entergy-Koch, LP venture. Effective January 1, 2004, Entergy's share of income from the partnership is expected to be 50 percent, consistent with its ownership interest. In contrast to 2003 guidance, the 2004 guidance table combines results from the Utility with Parent & Other to better reflect the way Entergy views and manages these businesses. Key assumptions reflected in the earnings ranges are as follows:
Approximately 65 percent of 2004 earnings are expected from the Utility, Parent & Other. Earnings guidance is based on existing rate plans, including the full-year impact of the rate increase put into effect June 3, 2003 at Entergy New Orleans. Incremental revenues expected in 2004 are also the result of sales growth in the 1.5 to 2.0 percent range. Earnings will also benefit from decreased interest expense and lower O&M expense driven by previously completed refinancings and productivity improvements at the Utility. Increases in depreciation and other expenses are expected to partially offset these earnings improvements at Utility.
More than 25 percent of 2004 earnings are expected from Entergy Nuclear. Increased revenues will be generated by an approximate $1 increase in the pricing of power purchase agreements, which is expected to average about $38 in 2004. A year-over-year increase in revenues will also be driven by 46 MW of power uprates completed during 2003 and the absence of the impact of the 2003 blackout of approximately $10 million. Lower O&M expense driven by productivity improvements will also increase EN earnings. The capacity factor assumption for the fleet ranges from 92 to 95 percent, and includes planned refueling outages at Vermont Yankee in spring 2004, and at FitzPatrick and Indian Point 2 in fall 2004. Finally, increased revenues will come from the services contract, signed in September 2003, for the Cooper Nuclear Station.
Energy Commodity Services' guidance is based on a 50 percent contribution from Entergy-Koch, consistent with Entergy's ownership share. The guidance range also reflects conservative expectations for trading, lower pricing for the non-nuclear wholesale assets business, and modest year-over-year pipeline growth which reflects higher transportation rates and lower operation and maintenance expenses.
 
Reflects elimination of disproportionate sharing, equivalent to $0.38/share in 2003.
 
 
XI.
Long-term Aspirations
One of Entergy's financial aspirations is to deliver near-term earnings growth of 8-10 percent, comprised of 6 percent intrinsic growth and 2-4 percent growth from asset acquisitions. Entergy acknowledges that this goal is only reasonably achievable if additional investments are made. Entergy has consistently maintained a disciplined policy that requires new investments to exceed (on an ex ante basis) the incremental average project cost of capital while maintaining corporate credit metrics. Capital is expected to be available to fund additional investments consistent with Entergy's credit objectives.
Over the long term, Entergy aspires to deliver earnings growth of 5-6 percent, equal to top-quartile industry growth over the last 20 years. Entergy's other financial aspirations include achieving a return of 9 percent on average invested capital in the near term, and 10 percent in the long term; achieving a single A credit rating over the long term by maintaining or improving its 45-50 percent net debt to net capital ratio and 4 times or better interest coverage; and growing the dividend annually, consistent with progress made toward the achievement of all financial aspirations.

Exhibit 99.2
New Orleans, La. - Entergy Corporation (NYSE:ETR) today announced a fourth quarter 2003 as-reported loss of $39.5 million, or 17 cents per share, compared with as-reported earnings of $75.8 million, or 33 cents per share, for fourth quarter 2002. The lower results were due primarily to the impact of severance charges recorded during fourth quarter 2003 in connection with the company's voluntary severance program. Entergy's fourth quarter 2003 earnings on an operational basis were $89.2 million, or 38 cents per share, compared with $77.4 million, or 34 cents per share, in fourth quarter 2002.
For the year 2003, Entergy's as-reported earnings were $926.9 million, or $4.01 per share, and operational earnings were $981.5 million, or $4.25 per share. These results compare with as-reported earnings in 2002 of $599.4 million, or $2.64 per share, and operational earnings of $866.4 million, or $3.81 per share.
"All of our targeted productivity improvements are well underway and solid progress is being achieved. We have established ambitious financial and operational objectives for each of our businesses and are confident in our ability to achieve efficiencies for our customers as well as enhance shareholder value and achieve top quartile returns. Our voluntary severance program was well received, and based on the number of employees participating, we exceeded the goals we had originally established," said . "The long-term value of effective and efficient processes will clearly exceed the initial cost incurred in connection with this program while continuing to improve operational performance."
J. Wayne Leonard, Entergy's chief executive officer
Improvement in Utility revenues from rate changes is offset by milder than normal weather
Higher than expected participation in voluntary severance program increases related charges recorded as special item
Entergy Nuclear operational results improve with no refueling outages in fourth quarter
Entergy-Koch, LP achieves another strong quarter in trading, while gas pipeline results decline due to lower revenues and increased expenses
Other highlights during the quarter included Entergy being named 2003 Global Energy Company of the Year by the Platts/BusinessWeek Global Energy Awards panel, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approving market protocols in connection with proposed retail open access in Texas.
For fourth quarter 2003, the utility recorded an as-reported loss of $33.4 million, or 14 cents per share, compared to earnings of $42.4 million, or 19 cents per share, in fourth quarter 2002. The decrease resulted primarily from the impact of severance charges totaling $70.1 million, or 30 cents per share, recorded in 2003. On an operational basis, Utility earnings in fourth quarter 2003 were $36.7 million, or 16 cents per share, compared to $42.4 million, or 19 cents per share, for the period one year ago. The decrease was due primarily to the effects of milder-than-normal weather in fourth quarter 2003 compared to normal weather experienced in fourth quarter 2002, as well as increased income tax expense, the effects of which were partially offset by rate changes implemented during 2003.
Megawatt-hour sales in the residential sector in fourth quarter 2003, compared to fourth quarter 2002, were essentially flat after adjusting for milder-than-normal weather. Commercial and governmental sales were up nearly 3 percent, while industrial sales experienced a decline of more than 4 percent quarter over quarter. The decline in industrial sales reflects the loss of two industrial customers to cogeneration since fourth quarter 2002. Excluding the loss of these customers, overall retail sales increased slightly quarter to quarter.
For the year 2003, the Utility earned $469.1 million, or $2.03 per share, on an as-reported basis compared to $583.2 million, or $2.57 per share, in 2002. On an operational basis, utility earnings in 2003 were $626.0 million, or $2.71 per share, compared to 2002 results of $583.2 million, or $2.57 per share. The improvement in full-year operational earnings was due primarily to improved pricing as a result of rate changes implemented during the year, as well as lower interest expenses in 2003 compared to 2002 as a result of the company's refinancing program.
 
The competitive businesses, which are comprised of Entergy Nuclear and Energy Commodity Services, recorded as-reported earnings of $1.1 million in fourth quarter 2003, compared to $57.1 million, or 25 cents per share, in fourth quarter 2002. The decrease was due primarily to the impact of recording severance charges of $51.8 million, or 22 cents per share, at Entergy Nuclear. On an operational basis, the competitive businesses in fourth quarter 2003 recorded earnings of $58.8 million, or 25 cents per share, which were essentially equal to results in fourth quarter 2002.
For the year 2003, as-reported earnings from the competitive businesses were $481.3 million, or $2.08 cents per share, compared to $54.7 million, or 24 cents per share, in 2002. The increase is primarily due to a significantly higher earnings contribution from Entergy-Koch Trading in 2003 compared to 2002, as well as to the absence of special charges recorded in 2002 associated with the closing of Entergy's wholesale power development business. On an operational basis, the competitive businesses contributed earnings of $377.9 million, or $1.63 per share, in 2003, compared with $321.7 million, or $1.41 per share in 2002.
recorded a loss of $0.7 million, or 1 cent per share, on an as-reported basis, compared to earnings of $33.8 million, or 15 cents per share, in fourth quarter 2002. The decrease in fourth quarter 2003 was due to severance charges noted earlier. Operational results at Entergy Nuclear in fourth quarter 2003 were $55.8 million, or 24 cents per share, compared to $33.8 million, or 15 cents per share, in 2002. The increase in operational earnings was due primarily to increased megawatt-hours produced as a result of no planned refueling outages during the fourth quarter 2003. In fourth quarter 2002 there were three such outages which reduced generation during that period.
Entergy Nuclear
For the year 2003, Entergy Nuclear contributed as-reported earnings of $300.8 million, or $1.30 per share, compared to $200.5 million, or 88 cents per share in 2002. The increase in 2003 was due primarily to the impact of a special item recorded in first quarter 2003 related to the implementation of a new accounting standard that changed the valuation of nuclear decommissioning assets and liabilities. On an operational basis, Entergy Nuclear's 2003 results were $196.9 million, or 85 cents per share, compared to $200.5 million, or 88 cents per share, in 2002.
, which includes earnings contributions from Entergy-Koch, LP and Entergy's non-nuclear wholesale assets, recorded as-reported and operational earnings of $1.8 million, or 1 cent per share, in fourth quarter 2003. This compares to $23.3 million, or 10 cents per share, in as-reported earnings, and $24.9 million, or 11 cents per share, in operational earnings, in fourth quarter 2002. The decrease in 2003 was due primarily to a larger loss at the non-nuclear wholesale assets business, driven by the operating costs associated with two new plants, as well as decreased results at Gulf South Pipeline where lower revenues were realized and higher expenses were incurred.
Energy Commodity Services
As was the case in the first three quarters of 2003, the income-sharing mechanisms that are part of the Entergy-Koch partnership agreement allocated substantially all of the partnership's income to Entergy in the fourth quarter of this year. Beginning in 2004, Entergy's share of the partnership's income is expected to be 50 percent, consistent with its ownership interest.
For the year 2003, Energy Commodity Services reported earnings of $180.5 million, or 78 cents per share, compared to a loss of $145.8 million, or 64 cents per share, on an as-reported basis. The improved results in 2003 were due primarily to the absence of the 2002 charges in connection with the closing of Entergy's wholesale power development business as noted above. Operational earnings for the year 2003 were $181.0 million, or 78 cents per share, compared to $121.2 million, or 53 cents per share, in 2002.
In fourth quarter 2003, Parent & Other recorded an as-reported loss of $7.2 million, or 3 cents per share, compared to a loss of $23.7 million, or 11 cents per share, in the same period in 2002. Operational results in each period equaled as-reported results. The improvement at Parent & Other in fourth quarter 2003 was due primarily to lower income tax expense.
For the full year, Parent & Other recorded an as-reported loss of $23.4 million, or 10 cents per share, and an operational loss of $22.4 million, or 9 cents per share. This compares to losses in 2002 of $38.6 million, or 17 cents per share, on both as-reported and operational bases. The improved results in 2003 were driven primarily by lower tax expense.
"Fourth quarter 2003 completed another excellent year of financial performance for Entergy," said . "Our business fundamentals are solidly in place and we have a clear view of the challenging but achievable financial goals we've established for 2004 and beyond. The foundation we've built and the financial discipline we've established give us confidence in our ability to achieve as-reported and operational earnings guidance for 2004 in the range of $4.10 to $4.30 per share."
