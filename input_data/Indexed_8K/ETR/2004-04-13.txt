Item 5. Other Events and Regulation FD Disclosure.
The Summary Compensation Table in Part III, Item 11 of Entergy's 2003 Form 10-K and in Entergy Corporation's 2004 Proxy Statement, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 11 and March 29, 2004, respectively, contains a typographical error. The LTIP Payouts to J. Wayne Leonard, Entergy Corporation's Chief Executive Officer, were reported as $2,944,5600 for 2003 and $2,372,1600 for 2002, both of which incorrectly contain an extra -0- at the end. The correct 2003 LTIP Payout is $2,944,560 and the correct 2002 LTIP Payout is $2,372,160.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
