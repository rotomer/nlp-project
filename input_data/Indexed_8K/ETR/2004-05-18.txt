Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure.
The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the exhibit listed below, is being furnished, not filed, under Item 9 pursuant to Regulation FD. The information in this report and in such exhibits shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
On May 18, 2004, Entergy Corporation published its 2003 Investor Guide and Statistical Report. The complete text of this Report is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.
Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the exhibit listed below, is being furnished, not filed, under Item 12, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition." The information in this report and in such exhibits shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
On May 18, 2004, Entergy Corporation published its 2003 Investor Guide and Statistical Report. The complete text of this Report is attached hereto as Exhibit 99. Entergy's 2003 Investor Guide contains non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, Entergy has provided quantitative reconciliations within the Investor Guide of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
Each non-GAAP measure in the Investor Guide differs from GAAP only in that the figure or ratio states or includes operational earnings per share. Operational earnings per share is presented for each of Entergy's major business segments as well as on a consolidated basis. Operational earnings per share is not calculated in accordance with GAAP because it excludes the impact of "special items". Special items reflect the impact on earnings of events that are not routine, are related to prior periods, or are related to discontinued businesses. In addition, other financial measures including return on invested capital, (ROIC) and return on equity, (ROE), are included on both an operational and as reported basis. In each case, the metrics defined as "operational" exclude the impact of special items as defined above. Management believes financial metrics calculated using operational earnings provides useful information to investors in evaluating the ongoing results of En tergy's businesses and assists investors in comparing the company's operating performance to the operating performance of others in the energy sector. Entergy management frequently references these non-GAAP financial measures in its decision-making, using them to facilitate historical and ongoing performance comparisons as well as comparisons to the performance of peer companies.
The non-GAAP information presented in the Investor Guide should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, as reported earnings per share prepared in accordance with GAAP.

DEFINITIONS OF OPERATIONAL MEASURES AND GAAP AND NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
 
Financial measures defined in the below table include measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, (GAAP), as well as non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP measures are included in this statistical guide in order to provide metrics that remove the effect of non-recurring financial impacts from commonly used financial metrics. Entergy uses these non-GAAP measures internally in budgeting and performance monitoring activities to gauge business performance and the ongoing strength of each business segment. Entergy further believes these measures provide useful information to investors in evaluating Entergy's ongoing business results and assists investors in comparing the company's operating performance to the operating performance of others in the energy sector.
