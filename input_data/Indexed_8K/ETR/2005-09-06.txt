Regulation FD Disclosure. On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina hit the coast of Louisiana and Mississippi, causing widespread power outages and catastrophic damage to the Gulf South region including portions of Entergy Corporation's (NYSE: ETR) service territory. Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and the Louisiana portion of Entergy Gulf States each has sustained significant damage to distribution and transmission facilities. In addition, several fossil units located in the New Orleans area were flooded. In total, these four operating companies had approximately 1.1 million customers without power immediately following the storm. Entergy anticipates that this event will influence the financial results of Entergy Corporation and of these operating companies although estimates of the effects are not available at this time. For example: -- Revenues are expected to be lower due to extended outages, customer losses, and inability to bill and collect revenues for electricity previously delivered to customers whose property has been destroyed; -- Capital and other expenditures are expected to be higher due to the restoration, repair and replacement of damaged equipment and assets; and -- Regulatory mechanisms may be modified or created to provide for recovery of restoration costs and lost revenues in a more timely and complete manner than available under currently-in-place cost recovery methods. Entergy Corporation believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet its current obligations and to fund its restoration efforts from a combination of cash on hand and its $2 billion revolver. The operating companies have authority to affect inter-company borrowing through the Entergy System money pool, and Entergy believes it can obtain authorizations from the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory bodies to ensure funding is available at each of its subsidiaries as is necessary. Until near-term estimates of revenue and expenditure effects are available, however, Entergy is unable to affirm previously-issued consolidated as- reported and operational 2005 earnings per share guidance of $4.60 to $4.85 per share for Entergy Corporation. In addition, Entergy is unable to affirm its 8-10% earnings growth aspiration for 2006 and it expects to revise previously disclosed estimates of cash flow and cash available to reflect revenue, cost and recovery outcomes when they can be more accurately estimated. Finally, Entergy is able to affirm that its $1.5 billion share repurchase program remains in place, even though the timing of repurchases under this program may be temporarily delayed. Over the long term, Entergy continues to aspire to deliver earnings per share growth in the range of 5-6% through a combination of intrinsic growth and capital deployment. Entergy will continue to evaluate and consider multiple alternatives for capital deployment, including investment, share repurchases and dividend increases. Entergy Corporation will conduct a teleconference with investors on Tuesday, September 6, 2005 at 10:00 a.m. CDT to discuss this investor news release. The teleconference may be accessed by either dialing 719-457- 2730, confirmation code 4901346 no more than 15 minutes prior to the start time or by visiting www.entergy.com/webcasts. A replay of the teleconference will be available through September 13, 2005 by dialing 719- 457-0820, confirmation code 4901346.
