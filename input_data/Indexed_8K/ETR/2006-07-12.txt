INVESTOR NEWS
Exhibit 99
July 12, 2006
NEW ORLEANS - Entergy Corporation (NYSE: ETR) today announced that it has reached an agreement with Consumers Energy Company to acquire the Palisades nuclear energy plant, a 798 MW plant located near South Haven, Michigan. After the acquisition, Entergy Nuclear's non-utility fleet will total nearly 5,000 MW. The transaction expands Entergy Nuclear's Midwestern presence that began with the 800 MW management services contract in 2003. The Palisades plant will be acquired for approximately $303/KW and is estimated to contribute approximately $0.13 to Entergy's EPS in 2007, assuming the sale closes in the first quarter of 2007. This estimate is expected to increase at the time of close to reflect the net effect of marking to market the Purchase Power Agreement (PPA) associated with this transaction as described below.
Strategic Rationale
Entergy seeks to become the leading nuclear generator by leveraging its core expertise in nuclear plant operations through a continuation of its disciplined approach to capital deployment. In recent years, Entergy has entered the Northeast and Midwest markets and achieved economies of scale through the acquisition of five nuclear units and the execution of a management services contract. The Palisades plant will become the third Combustion Engineering pressurized water reactor in Entergy's nuclear fleet. As part of a larger fleet, Entergy expects to achieve additional operating efficiencies in the areas of purchasing, inventory management, and resource sharing. This project further establishes Entergy's presence in the Midwest and creates a strategic platform for increasing scale through future potential acquisitions and/or management services contracts. Entergy believes that the PPA helps provide price certainty to the customers of Consumers Energy, while offering Entergy an attracti ve marginal risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital.
Transaction Summary
Entergy will acquire the 798 MW plant and other assets such as inventory and the Big Rock Point Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation (the dry fuel storage facility for the Big Rock nuclear plant that is currently being decommissioned) for a net amount of $350 million. The purchase price includes nuclear fuel with an estimated market value of $83 million.
As part of the Palisades purchase, Entergy and Consumers Energy executed a 15-year PPA for 100% of the plant's output (i.e., through the first half of license extension for which approval is anticipated in early 2007). The total price for energy and capacity is fixed according to a schedule allowing for monthly and annual shaping. The PPA is unit contingent with guarantees for minimum capacity factor performance levels during the peak summer months of July and August and associated penalties capped at a pre-specified amount. Entergy is considering a modest uprate of the capacity of Palisades. The PPA does not cover output associated with uprates.
At the time of closing, Entergy will allocate the net $350 million purchase price plus the value of the PPA to the acquired assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair market values on that date in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, "Business Combinations." The net effect of this transaction is expected to result in additional earnings per share, most notably in the initial years of plant ownership. Entergy will include the additional earnings estimate in its 2007 guidance as the transaction close approaches, based on forward market prices at the time.
The transaction is targeted to close in the first quarter of 2007, pending approval by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and other regulatory and state agencies. In the near-term, Entergy intends to finance the cost of the acquisition through borrowings from its $2 billion corporate revolver.
