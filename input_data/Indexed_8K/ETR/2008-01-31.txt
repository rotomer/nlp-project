Item 5.02 (e) Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On January 25, 2008, our Personnel Committee awarded 24,000 restricted stock units to Mr. Leo P. Denault, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.   Each restricted stock unit has an economic value equal to one share of our common stock.  However, unlike a share of common stock, the restricted stock units do not entitle the owner to vote or receive dividends.  Subject to Mr. Denault's continued employment with us, the restricted stock units will vest or mature on the following dates: 
On each vesting date, we will pay, to Mr. Denault, subject to payment of withholding taxes, a cash amount per vested unit equal to the closing price of a share of our common stock on that date. Under certain conditions, including a change of control of our company, death or disability, Mr. Denault's restricted stock units may vest on an earlier date.  The restricted stock units were awarded under our stockholder approved 2007 Equity Ownership and Long Term Incentive Plan.  For additional information, see "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control" in our proxy statement filed March 19, 2007. 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrants have duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
