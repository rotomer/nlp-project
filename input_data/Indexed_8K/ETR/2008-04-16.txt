Exhibit 99.1
News Release
 
Entergy Corporation (NYSE: ETR) today indicated that it expects first quarter 2008 as-reported and operational earnings of approximately $1.55 per share compared to as-reported and operational results of $1.03 per share in first quarter 2007.
New Orleans, La. -
As-reported results are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and are comprised of operational earnings (described below) and special items. Entergy had no special items included in earnings for either first quarter 2008 or first quarter 2007.
The increase in first quarter 2008 operational earnings is due primarily to higher earnings at Entergy Nuclear with slightly higher results at Utility, Parent and Other also contributing to the increase. Results at Entergy's Non-Nuclear Wholesale Assets business are expected to be approximately the same as first quarter 2007. In addition, Entergy's earnings for the current period include the positive effect of accretion associated with the company's share repurchase program.
The quarter on quarter increase in earnings at Entergy Nuclear is attributed to higher revenue from increased production made available by the addition of Palisades acquired in second quarter 2007 and fewer outage days, as well as higher energy pricing. These items were partially offset by higher expenses at Entergy Nuclear, primarily associated with including Palisades in the portfolio.
Entergy affirmed previously issued as-reported and operational earnings guidance for 2008 to be in the range of $6.50 to $6.90 per share.
Entergy's senior management will host its 2008 Analyst Meeting on April 25, 2008 in New Orleans, LA to discuss quarterly results and other business matters with investors. In addition, Entergy will webcast its analyst meeting including a presentation by its Chief Financial Officer Leo Denault, who will review quarterly results in his presentation. The analyst meeting webcast is scheduled to begin at 7:30 a.m. CT, with Mr. Denault's presentation scheduled for approximately 11:00 a.m. CT. The webcast and presentation slides can be accessed via Entergy's Web site at www.entergy.com.
Entergy Corporation is an integrated energy company engaged primarily in electric power production and retail distribution operations. Entergy owns and operates power plants with approximately 30,000 megawatts of electric generating capacity, and it is the second-largest nuclear generator in the United States. Entergy delivers electricity to 2.7 million utility customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. Entergy has annual revenues of more than $11 billion and approximately 14,300 employees.
In this release, Entergy makes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause the actual results to differ materially than the forward-looking information provided. These factors are discussed in more detail in Entergy Corporation's 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K including (a) Forward-Looking Information, (b) Item 1A. Risk Factors, and (c) Item 7. Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis and subsequent SEC filings.

Exhibit 99.2
Exhibit 99.1 to this Report on Form 8-K (the "Pre-Release") contains the non-GAAP financial measure of operational earnings per share. Operational earnings per share is not calculated in accordance with GAAP because it excludes the impact of "special items." Special items reflect the impact on earnings of events that are less routine, are related to prior periods, or are related to discontinued businesses. Management believes the discussion of operational earnings provides useful information to investors in evaluating the ongoing results of Entergy's businesses and assists investors in comparing the company's operating performance to the operating performance of others in the energy sector. Entergy management frequently references operational earnings in its decision-making, using that measure to facilitate historical and ongoing performance comparisons as well as comparisons to the performance of peer companies.
In its Pre-Release, Entergy has not provided quantitative reconciliations of operational earnings per share to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures because for the periods covered in the Pre-Release they are identical due to the absence of special items in those periods.
Non-GAAP information should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures.  Non-GAAP information reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business.  Investors are strongly encouraged to review our consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure.  Non-GAAP information is not standardized; therefore, it may not be possible to compare this information with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names
