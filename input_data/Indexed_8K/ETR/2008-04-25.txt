"We have established aggressive goals for 2008 and while it's early in the year, we are on track for a year of solid accomplishments," said . "Operating results for the quarter reflect strong business performance even as we resource considerable tasks necessary to create a new public company required by the spin-off of our non-utility nuclear business."
J. Wayne Leonard, Entergy's chairman and chief executive officer
Entergy's business highlights include the following:
The CRO (Corporate Responsibility Officer) magazine named Entergy Corporation to its 100 Best Corporate Citizen's list for 2008 for its corporate responsibility efforts in eight categories including climate change, employee relations, environment, financial, governance, human rights, lobbying, and philanthropy.
Entergy was again among America's Most Trustworthy Companies according to Forbes.com's annual listing, making the list for its accounting transparency and governance practices.
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C. completed the acquisition of the Calcasieu facility, two simple cycle gas-fired units that add 322 MW of quick-start capacity for Entergy's WOTAB region.
Entergy's senior management will host its 2008 Analyst Conference on April 25, 2008 in New Orleans to discuss quarterly results and other business matters with investors.

Consolidated Results
Consolidated Earnings
Table 2 provides a comparative summary of consolidated earnings per share for first quarter 2008 versus 2007, including a reconciliation of GAAP as-reported earnings to non-GAAP operational earnings. Utility, Parent & Other had higher earnings due to increased revenues. Entergy's Non-Nuclear Wholesale Assets business reported results which were approximately the same as first quarter 2007. Entergy's results for the current period also reflect the positive effect of accretion associated with the company's share repurchase program.
Entergy Nuclear's earnings increased as a result of higher power prices and additional production from the Palisades plant acquired in second quarter 2007 and fewer outage days. These items were partially offset by higher expense primarily associated with including Palisades in the portfolio.
Detailed earnings variance analysis is included in appendix B to this release.
Consolidated Net Cash Flow Provided by Operating Activities
Entergy's net cash flow provided by operating activities in first quarter 2008 was $448 million compared to $493 million in first quarter 2007. The decrease was due primarily to reduced collections at the Utility of deferred fuel recovery in the current quarter totaling $350 million partially offset by changes in net payables/receivables of $226 million and higher net revenues at Entergy Nuclear of $185 million.
Table 3 provides the components of net cash flow provided by operating activities contributed by each business with quarter-to-quarter comparisons.
II.
Utility, Parent & Other Results
In , Utility, Parent & Other had earnings of $0.48 per share on as-reported and operational bases, compared to $0.44 per share in as-reported earnings and operational earnings in first quarter 2007. Earnings for Utility, Parent & Other in first quarter 2008 reflect higher revenues from sales growth and the absence of a regulatory charge taken in first quarter 2007 partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expense. The higher expense reflects the timing of fossil outages and storm damages expensed at Entergy Arkansas, Inc.
first quarter 2008
Electricity usage, in gigawatt-hour sales by customer segment, is included in Table 4. Current quarter sales reflect the following:
Residential sales in first quarter 2008, on a weather-adjusted basis, showed a 3 percent increase compared to first quarter 2007.
Commercial and governmental sales, on a weather-adjusted basis, were up 2 percent.
Industrial sales in the current quarter were up 1 percent compared to the same period one year ago.
The residential sales sector showed an increase quarter to quarter with the most significant increase at Entergy New Orleans, Inc., where post-storm recovery continues. An increase in the number of customers also contributed to sales growth in the residential sector as well as the commercial and governmental sectors. Sales in the industrial sector for first quarter 2008increased compared to the same quarter of 2007. High utilization in the refining and chemical segments is contributing to increased sales while the housing market is putting negative pressure on the building-related industries. Also, efficiency improvement driven by high energy prices is producing declining sales in some areas.
Table 4 provides a comparative summary of the Utility's operational performance measures.
Appendix C provides information on selected pending local and federal regulatory cases.
III.
Competitive Businesses Results
Entergy's competitive businesses include Entergy Nuclear and Non-Nuclear Wholesale Assets.
Entergy Nuclear
Entergy Nuclear earned $1.12 per share on as-reported and operational bases in first quarter 2008, compared to $0.62 in first quarter 2007 for as-reported and operational earnings. Entergy Nuclear's earnings increased as a result of higher power prices and additional production from the Palisades plant acquired in second quarter 2007 and fewer outage days. These items were partially offset by higher expense primarily associated with including Palisades in the portfolio.
Table 5 provides a comparative summary of Entergy Nuclear's operational performance measures.
Entergy Nuclear's sold forward position is 92%, 83%, and 59% of planned generation at average prices per megawatt-hour of $54, $61 and $58, for 2008, 2009, and 2010, respectively. Table 6 provides capacity and generation sold forward projections for Entergy Nuclear.
Non-Nuclear Wholesale Assets
Entergy's Non-Nuclear Wholesale Assets business incurred a loss of $(0.04) per share on both as-reported and operational bases in first quarter 2008 compared to a loss of $(0.03) per share on as-reported and operational bases in first quarter 2007.
IV.
Earnings Guidance
Entergy is reaffirming 2008 earnings guidance in the range of $6.50 to $6.90 per share on both as-reported and operational bases on a business as usual basis. Guidance for 2008 does not include a special item for expenses anticipated in connection with the plan to pursue separation of Entergy's non-utility nuclear business and to enter into a nuclear services joint venture, both discussed below and in Appendix A. Year-over-year changes are shown as point estimates and are applied to 2007 actual results to compute the 2008 guidance midpoint. Because there is a range of possible outcomes associated with each earnings driver, a range is applied to the calculated guidance midpoints to produce Entergy's guidance ranges for as-reported and operational earnings. 2008 earnings guidance is detailed in Table 7 below.
 
Updated January 2008 to reflect 2007 final results.
Key assumptions supporting 2008 earnings guidance are as follows:
Utility, Parent & Other
Normal weather
Retail sales growth of roughly 2%
Increased revenue associated with rate actions
Decreased non-fuel operation and maintenance expense, primarily due to higher discount rate on benefit plans, absence of minimum bill write-offs, and lower storm reserves
Increased depreciation associated with rate base growth
Decreased interest expense as a result of receiving proceeds from Louisiana storm securitization, net of effects on interest expense of other financings
Decreased other income due primarily to absence of 2007 carrying costs reflected for storm settlements
Decreased income taxes associated with absence of the 2007 fourth quarter income tax adjustments
Entergy Nuclear
41 TWh of total output, reflecting an approximate 94% capacity factor, including 30 day refueling outages at Indian Point 2 in Spring 2008, and FitzPatrick and Vermont Yankee, both in Fall 2008
91% energy sold under existing contracts; 9% sold into the spot market (Additional sales after guidance was issued increased sold forward position to 92%)
$54/MWh average energy contract price; $69/MWh average unsold energy price based on published market prices in October 2007
$22.10/MWh non-fuel operation and maintenance expense/purchased power with increase primarily due to full year of Palisades operation (acquired mid April 2007); $21.30/MWh production cost
Increased depreciation due to continued investment in nuclear fleet and full year of Palisades operation
Increased income tax expense associated with absence of the 2007 fourth quarter income tax adjustments, a change in New York state tax law and the step-up in tax basis from restructuring the Indian Point 2 non-quali fied decommissioning trust fund
Non-Nuclear Wholesale Assets
Increased income tax associated with the absence of the 2007 fourth quarter income tax adjustments, favorable resolution of tax audit issues, and benefits associated with project restructurings
Share Repurchase Program
2008 average fully diluted shares outstanding of approximately 197 million
Special Items
Absence of 2007 nuclear alignment charge
Earnings guidance for 2008 should be considered in association with earnings sensitivities as shown in Table 8. These sensitivities illustrate the estimated change in operational earnings resulting from changes in various revenue and expense drivers. Utility sales are expected to be the most significant variable for 2008 results for Utility, Parent & Other. At Entergy Nuclear, energy prices are expected to be the most significant driver of results in 2008. Estimated annual impacts shown in Table 8 are intended to be indicative rather than precise guidance.
V.
Business Separation
On November 3, 2007, Entergy's Board of Directors approved a plan to pursue a separation of the non-utility nuclear business from Entergy's regulated utility business through a tax-free spin-off of the non-utility nuclear business. Enexus Energy Corporation, formerly referred to as SpinCo, will be a new, independent publicly traded company. In addition, Entergy and Enexus intend to enter into a nuclear services joint venture, with equal ownership.
EquaGen L.L.C. has been selected as the name for the joint venture.
Entergy is targeting around third quarter 2008 for completion of the spin-off transaction. Progress achieved during the last quarter includes:
The steering committee formed last November continues to lead the overall process and make final recommendations on all major business and operational issues; the steering committee's focus shifted from overall framework setting to spin-off implementation during the first quarter
The project management office, with a cross-section of organizational functions, continues to coordinate detailed activities necessary to execute the spin-off so that Enexus and EquaGen are fully prepared to commence independent operations post spin
Regulatory proceedings continued to advance
At the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Entergy Nuclear Operations, Inc. (ENO) continued to supplement its filing to reflect the spin-off transaction and respond to NRC requests for information;
ENO also submitted the necessary filings in the intervention process, including those outlined in a detailed procedural schedule established for the UWUA Local Unions
In Vermont, ENO responded to requests for information and public hearings were conducted pursuant to the scheduling order issued by the Vermont Public Service Board for the spin-off proceeding; the VPSB permitted five parties to intervene in the proceeding
In New York, the state attorney general and the Office of the County Executive of Westchester County, N.Y. submitted comments to the New York Public Service Commission regarding the spin-off proposal; additional information is being prepared by ENO to respond to the comments submitted to the NYPSC
At the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Louisiana Public Service Commission withdrew the only protest filed in the spin-off proceeding
At the Internal Revenue Service, Entergy submitted its request for a private letter ruling finding that the spin-off transaction qualifies for tax-free treatment for federal income tax purposes for both Entergy and its shareholders
Additional information on the spin-off including proposed new business structure, leadership teams, business overviews, financial aspirations, and a transaction timeline including regulatory filing status are included in Appendix A of this release.
VI.
Appendices
Seven appendices are presented in this section as follows:
Appendix A includes information on Entergy's plan to separate the non-utility nuclear business from Entergy's regulated utility business through a tax-free spin-off of the non-utility nuclear business.
Appendix B includes earnings per share variance analysis.
Appendix C provides information on selected pending local and federal regulatory cases.
Appendix D provides financial metrics for both current and historical periods. In addition, historical financial and operating performance metrics are included for the trailing eight quarters.
Appendix E provides a summary of planned capital expenditures for the next three years.
Appendix F provides definitions of the operational performance measures and GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures that are used in this release.
Appendix G provides a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures used in this release.
Appendix A provides information on Entergy's planned spin-off of its non-utility nuclear business.
The announced spin-off of Entergy's non-utility nuclear business will establish two independent, publicly traded companies. Enexus Energy Corporation (formally referred to as SpinCo) has been selected as the name of the new company. In addition, Entergy and Enexus intend to enter into a nuclear services joint venture, with equal ownership. EquaGen L.L.C. has been selected as the name for the joint venture. Below are transaction details and other information on Entergy, Enexus and EquaGen.
New Business Structure
Once the transaction is complete, Entergy Corporation's shareholders will own 100 percent of the common equity in both Entergy and Enexus. Enexus' business is expected to be comprised of the non-utility nuclear assets, including the Pilgrim Nuclear Station in Plymouth, Mass., the James A. FitzPatrick and Indian Point Energy Center plants in Oswego and Buchanan, N.Y., respectively, the Palisades plant in Covert, Mich., and the Vermont Yankee plant in Brattleboro, Vt., and a power marketing operation. Entergy's business will be comprised of the current six regulated utility operating subsidiaries, System Energy Resources, Inc., the related services subsidiaries System Fuels, Inc., Entergy Operations, Inc. and Entergy Services, Inc., and the remaining Entergy subsidiaries. The newly created joint venture, EquaGen, is expected to operate the nuclear assets owned by Enexus. EquaGen is also expected to offer nuclear services to third parties, including decommissioning, plant relicens ing and plant operations for Cooper Nuclear Station and others.
The joint venture operating structure for Enexus ensures that the core nuclear operations expertise currently in place at each of the non-utility nuclear plants will remain after the spin-off.  Entergy Nuclear Operations, Inc., the current NRC-licensed operator of the non-utility nuclear plants, is expected to be wholly-owned by EquaGen and will remain the operator of the plants after the separation.  Entergy Operations, Inc., the current NRC-licensed operator of Entergy's utility nuclear plants, will also remain in place as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy and will continue to be the operator of the utility nuclear plants.  The decision to retain the existing operators for the nuclear stations reflects Entergy's commitment to maintaining safety, security and operational excellence.
Leadership Team
The Entergy Board of Directors has approved certain elements of the leadership structure and designated individuals who will fill key board and management roles. The EquaGen Board of Managers will be comprised of equal membership from both Entergy and Enexus. Additional details on the structure and leadership will be made available in the coming months. Those assuming new roles or additional responsibilities include:
Entergy:
Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Mark Savoff; currently serves as Entergy's executive vice president of operations
Enexus:
Non-Executive Chairman Donald C. Hintz; currently serves as chairman of the nuclear committee for the Entergy Board of Directors
Chief Executive Officer Richard Smith; currently serves as Entergy's president and chief operating officer
Chief Operating Officer John R. McGaha; currently serves as president of planning, development and oversight for Entergy Nuclear
EquaGen:
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Nuclear Officer Michael R. Kansler; currently serves as president and chief nuclear officer, Entergy Nuclear
Chief Operating Officer John Herron; currently serves as Entergy senior vice president of nuclear operations
Executive management at Entergy that remains unchanged includes:
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer J. Wayne Leonard
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Leo Denault
Group President Utility Operations Gary Taylor
Executive Vice President of External Affairs Curt Hebert
Executive Vice President and General Counsel Robert Sloan
Chief Nuclear Officer Michael Kansler
Brief Overview of Each Business
After completion of the business separation, Entergy will consist of the current six electric utility subsidiaries in four contiguous states with generating capacity of more than 22,000 megawatts and 15,000 miles of transmission lines. Entergy will be a customer service-focused electric and gas utility with a unique growth opportunity through its portfolio transformation strategy that benefits customers. The company will deliver electricity to 2.7 million customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas and will remain headquartered in New Orleans, LA.
Enexus is expected to own nearly 5,000 megawatts of nuclear generation, most of which is located in the northeastern United States. This location has some of the highest average regional power prices in the United States both today and expected into the future through at least 2020. Enexus will be uniquely positioned to provide to the region the only pure-play, emission-free nuclear generation. The company will be headquartered in Jackson, Miss.
EquaGen is expected to be owned 50 percent each by Entergy and Enexus, and expected to have operating responsibility for Enexus' nuclear fleet. The company will be headquartered in Jackson, Miss.
As a premier nuclear operator, the joint venture will have broad nuclear experience building and operating boiling and pressurized water reactor technologies. EquaGen is expected to be uniquely positioned to grow through offerings of nuclear operating expertise, as well as ancillary nuclear services to third parties, including plant decommissioning and relicensing.
Financial Aspirations
The companies will continue to aspire to deliver superior value to owners as measured by total shareholder return. The companies believe top-quartile shareholder returns are achieved by growing earnings, delivering returns at or above the risk-adjusted cost of capital, maintaining credit quality and flexibility, and deploying capital in a disciplined manner, whether for new investments, share repurchases, dividends or debt retirements.
Financial aspirations currently in place for Entergy today can be tailored to each of the businesses going forward. Financial aspirations through 2012 include the following:
Top-quartile total shareholder return:
Entergy: 6-8% annual earnings per share growth, a 70 to 75% dividend payout ratio target, and capacity for a new share repurchase program targeted at $2.5 billion, $0.5 billion of which has already been authorized by the Entergy Board of Directors, with the balance to be authorized and to commence following completion of spin-off
Enexus: $2 billion in earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense (EBITDA), a non-GAAP financial measure defined in Appendix F, for the existing non-utility nuclear fleet portfolio by 2012, assuming an average power price on open positions of roughly $95/MWh, generating cash flow for acquisitions and/or distributions through share repurchases in the range of $0.5 billion to $1 billion annually
Credit quality and flexibility to manage risk and act on opportunities:
Entergy: investment grade credit with a lower risk profile
Enexus: strong merchant credit, relative to others (subject to market terms and conditions, Enexus expects to execute roughly $4.5 billion of debt financing)
The amount of repurchases may vary as a result of material changes in business results or capital spending or new investment opportunities.
Transaction Timing
Entergy is targeting around the end of third quarter 2008 as the effective date for the spin-off and joint venture transactions to be completed and expects the transactions to qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes for both Entergy and its shareholders. The transactions are subject to various approvals. Final terms of the transactions and spin-off completion are subject to the subsequent approval of the Entergy Board of DirectorsCitigroup and Goldman Sachs are serving as Entergy's financial advisors in this process.
. In addition, as Entergy pursues completion of the separation and establishment of the joint venture, Entergy will continue to consider, in conjunction with its financial advisors, possible modifications to and variations upon the transaction structure, including a sponsored spin-off, a partial initial public offering preceding the spin-off or the addition of a third party joint venture partner.

Appendix C provides a summary of selected regulatory cases and events that are pending.
Appendix D-1 provides comparative financial performance measures for the current quarter. Appendix D-2 provides historical financial performance measures and operating performance metrics for the trailing eight quarters. Financial performance measures in both tables include those calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), as well as those that are considered non-GAAP measures.
As-reported measures are computed in accordance with GAAP as they include all components of earnings, including special items. Operational measures are non-GAAP measures as they are calculated using operational earnings, which excludes the impact of special items. A reconciliation of operational earnings per share to as-reported earnings per share is provided in Appendix G-1.
Data for periods beginning 1Q07 reflect the re-consolidation of ENOI. Prior periods are not restated for this effect.
Data has been restated for the re-consolidation of ENOI which was the accounting adopted by Entergy in second quarter 2007. 4Q07 excludes the effect of the nuclear alignment special.
Excludes impact of major storm activity.
Restated to reflect MWh billed as the denominator in the calculation.
Restated data to reflect moving purchased power from production costs to non-fuel O&M. 4Q07 excludes the effect of the nuclear alignment special.
 
Appendix E: Planned Capital Expenditures
Entergy's capital plan from 2008 through 2010 anticipates $5.9 billion for investment, including $2.7 billion of maintenance capital. The remaining $3.2 billion is for specific investments such as the Utility's portfolio transformation strategy (i.e., Calcasieu and Ouachita acquisitions and Little Gypsy repowering), the steam generator replacement at Entergy's Waterford 3 nuclear unit, environmental compliance spending, transmission upgrades, business function relocation, dry cask storage and nuclear license renewal projects, NYPA value sharing and other initiatives. A potentially significant item not included in these estimates is the cost associated with the proposed inter-connection between Entergy Texas and ERCOT (up to approximately $1 billion). In addition, only minimal amounts for potential new nuclear development at the Grand Gulf and River Bend sites at the Utility are included.
Appendix F provides definitions of certain operational performance measures, as well as GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, all of which are referenced in this release.
Financial measures defined in the below table include measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, (GAAP), as well as non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP measures are included in this release in order to provide metrics that remove the effect of less routine financial impacts from commonly used financial metrics.
Appendices G-1 and G-2 provide reconciliations of various non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this release to their most comparable GAAP measure.

In , Utility, Parent & Other had earnings of $95.3 million, or 48 cents per share, on as-reported and operational bases, compared to $89.5 million, or 44 cents per share, in as-reported earnings and operational earnings in first quarter 2007. Earnings for Utility, Parent & Other in first quarter 2008 reflect higher revenues from sales growth and the absence of a regulatory charge taken in first quarter 2007, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expense. The higher expense reflects the timing of fossil outages and storm damages expensed at Entergy Arkansas, Inc.
first quarter 2008
Megawatt-hour sales in the residential sector in first quarter 2008, on a weather-adjusted basis, showed a 3 percent increase compared to first quarter 2007. Commercial and governmental sales, after adjusting for weather, were up 2 percent compared to first quarter of last year. Industrial sales in the current quarter were up 1 percent compared to the same period one year ago.
The residential sales sector showed an increase quarter-to-quarter with the most significant increase at Entergy New Orleans, Inc., where post-storm recovery continues. An increase in the number of customers also contributed to sales growth in the residential sector as well as the commercial and governmental sectors. Sales in the industrial sector for first quarter 2008 increased compared to the same quarter of 2007. High utilization in the refining and chemical segments is contributing to increased sales while the housing market is putting negative pressure on the building-related industries. Also, efficiency improvement driven by high energy prices is producing declining sales in some areas.
 
Entergy Nuclear earned $221.7 million, or $1.12 per share, on as-reported and operational bases in first quarter 2008, compared to $ 128.2 million, or 62 cents per share, in first quarter 2007 for as-reported and operational earnings. Entergy Nuclear's earnings increased as a result of higher power prices and additional production from the Palisades plant acquired in second quarter 2007 and fewer outage days. These items were partially offset by higher expense primarily associated with including Palisades in the portfolio.
Entergy's Non-Nuclear Wholesale Assets business incurred a loss of $8.2 million, or 4 cents per share, on both as-reported and operational bases in first quarter 2008 compared to a loss of $5.5 million, or 3 cents per share, on as-reported and operational bases in first quarter 2007.
Entergy is reaffirming 2008 earnings guidance in the range of $6.50 to $6.90 per share on both as-reported and operational bases on a business-as-usual basis. Guidance for 2008 does not include a special item for expenses anticipated in connection with the plan to pursue separation of Entergy's non-utility nuclear business and to enter into a nuclear services joint venture, both discussed below.
On Nov. 3, 2007, Entergy's Board of Directors approved a plan to pursue a separation of the non-utility nuclear business from Entergy's regulated utility business through a tax-free spin-off of the non-utility nuclear business. Enexus Energy Corporation, formerly referred to as SpinCo, will be a new, independent publicly traded company. In addition, Entergy and Enexus intend to enter into a nuclear services joint venture, with equal ownership.
EquaGen L.L.C. has been selected as the name for the joint venture.
Entergy is targeting around third quarter 2008 for completion of the spin-off transaction. Progress achieved during the last quarter includes:
The steering committee formed last November continues to lead the overall process and make final recommendations on all major business and operational issues. The steering committee's focus shifted from overall framework setting to spin-off implementation during the first quarter
The project management office, with a cross-section of organizational functions, continues to coordinate detailed activities necessary to execute the spin-off so that Enexus and EquaGen are fully prepared to commence independent operations post spin
Regulatory proceedings continued to advance in connection with filings at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Vermont and New York

Exhibit 99.3
Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 to this Report on Form 8-K (the "Releases"), contain non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, Entergy has provided quantitative reconciliations within the Releases and the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
Certain non-GAAP measures in the Releases could differ from GAAP only in that the figure or ratio states or includes operational earnings per share. Operational earnings per share is presented for each of Entergy's major business segments as well as on a consolidated basis. Operational earnings per share is not calculated in accordance with GAAP because it excludes the effect of "special items." Special items reflect the effect on earnings of events that are less routine, are related to prior periods, or are related to discontinued businesses. Entergy did not report any special items in the periods covered by the Releases. In addition, other financial measures including return on average invested capital (ROIC), return on average common equity (ROE), and net margin - operational are included on both an operational and as-reported basis. In each case, the metrics defined as "operational" would exclude the effect of special items as defined above. Management believes financial metrics calculated usin g operational earnings provides useful information to investors in evaluating the ongoing results of Entergy's businesses and assists investors in comparing the company's operating performance to the operating performance of others in the energy sector. Entergy management frequently references these non-GAAP financial measures in its decision-making, using them to facilitate historical and ongoing performance comparisons as well as comparisons to the performance of peer companies.
Other non-GAAP measures, total gross liquidity, net debt to net capital ratio, and net debt ratio including off-balance sheet liabilities are measures Entergy uses internally for management and board discussions, and cash budgeting and performance monitoring activities to gauge the overall strength of its business. Entergy believes the above data provides useful information to investors in evaluating Entergy's ongoing financial flexibility, and assists investors in comparing the company's cash availability to the cash availability of others in the energy sector.
Another non-GAAP measure presented in the Releases is EBITDA. EBITDA is a non-GAAP measurement Entergy has used to gauge Enexus' (formerly referred to as SpinCo) future operating performance. Entergy defines EBITDA as net earnings before the cumulative effect of interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and other regulatory charges. EBITDA is provided as a measure of Enexus' future performance and debt-service capacity that may be useful to securities analysis, investors and others. EBITDA is not, however, a measure of financial performance under GAAP. Due to the forward-looking nature of this non-GAAP measure, information to reconcile EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is not available at this time. Moreover, EBITDA is not calculated identically by all companies.
The non-GAAP financial measures and other reported adjusted items in Entergy's Releases are used in addition to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP.  These non-GAAP financial measures should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures.  These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business.  Investors are strongly encouraged to review our consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure.  Non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized; therefore, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names.
