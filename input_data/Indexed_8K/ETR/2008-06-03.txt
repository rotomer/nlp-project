ENTERGY NUCLEAR
Entergy's non-utility nuclear business owns and operates six nuclear units in the northern United States. This business is primarily focused on selling power produced by those plants to wholesale customers. This business also provides operations and management services to nuclear power plants owned by other utilities in the United States.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ENEXUS ENERGY CORPORATION/EQUAGEN, L.L.C.
In November 2007, Entergy's Board of Directors approved a plan to pursue a separation of the Non-Utility Nuclear business from Entergy through a tax-free spin-off of Non-Utility Nuclear to Entergy shareholders. Enexus will be a new, separate, and publicly-traded company. In addition, under the plan, Enexus and Entergy are expected to enter into a nuclear services business joint venture, EquaGen, with 50% ownership by Enexus and 50% ownership by Entergy.
Entergy expects that Enexus' business will be substantially comprised of Non-Utility Nuclear's assets, including its six nuclear units, and Non-Utility Nuclear's power marketing operation. Entergy's remaining business will primarily be comprised of the Utility business. EquaGen is expected to operate the nuclear assets owned by Enexus. EquaGen is also expected to offer nuclear services to third parties, including decommissioning, plant relicensing, and plant operations for the Cooper Nuclear Station and others.
Entergy is targeting around the end of the third quarter of 2008 as the effective date for the spin-off and nuclear services business joint venture transactions to be completed.

The energy commodity services business includes Entergy-Koch and Entergy's Non-Nuclear Wholesale Assets business.

Entergy-Koch sold both of these businesses in the fourth quarter of 2004, and Entergy-Koch is no longer an operating entity.
NON-NUCLEAR WHOLESALE ASSETS BUSINESS
Entergy's Non-Nuclear Wholesale Assets business sells to wholesale customers the electric power produced by power plants that it owns or controls (1,578 net MW generating capacity) while it focuses on improving performance and exploring sales or restructuring opportunities for its power plants. Such opportunities are evaluated consistent with Entergy's market-based point of view.
