Exhibit 99.1
News Release
 
Entergy Corporation (NYSE: ETR) today indicated that it expects second quarter 2008 as-reported earnings of approximately $1.36 per share and operational earnings of $1.45 per share compared to as-reported and operational results of $1.32 per share in second quarter 2007.
New Orleans, La. -
As-reported results are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and are comprised of operational earnings (described below) and special items. As-reported earnings in second quarter 2008 will include a special item at Utility, Parent and Other for expenses associated with outside services provided during the quarter in connection with the non-utility nuclear spin-off transaction. Entergy had no special items included in earnings for second quarter 2007.
The increase in second quarter 2008 operational earnings is due primarily to higher earnings at Utility, Parent and Other and Entergy Nuclear. Partially offsetting these increases were lower results at Entergy's Non-Nuclear Wholesale Assets business compared to second quarter 2007. In addition, Entergy's earnings for the current period include the positive effect of accretion associated with the company's share repurchase program.
The quarter on quarter increase in earnings at Utility, Parent and Other is attributed primarily to higher revenue from sales growth. The improved results at Utility, Parent and Other are expected to be partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expense. Current quarter weather also contributed to the improved results as second quarter 2008 weather was warmer-than-normal compared to essentially normal in second quarter 2007.
at Entergy Nuclear is attributed to higher revenue from increased production made available by fewer outage days and the addition of Palisades acquired in second quarter 2007, as well as higher energy pricing. These items were partially offset by an impairment recorded in the current period on decommissioning trust investments as well as higher expenses primarily associated with including Palisades in the portfolio.
The quarter on quarter increase in earnings
The quarter on quarter decrease in earnings at Entergy's Non-Nuclear Wholesale Assets business is attributed to higher income tax expense. Second quarter 2007 results included the effect on income tax expense of the resolution of tax audit issues while the current quarter has no similar item included in results for the period.
Entergy affirmed previously issued as-reported and operational earnings guidance for 2008 to be in the range of $6.50 to $6.90 per share.

Entergy Corporation is an integrated energy company engaged primarily in electric power production and retail distribution operations. Entergy owns and operates power plants with approximately 30,000 megawatts of electric generating capacity, and it is the second-largest nuclear generator in the United States.

In this release, Entergy makes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause the actual results to differ materially than the forward-looking information provided. These factors are discussed in more detail in Entergy Corporation's 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K including (a) Forward-Looking Information, (b) Item 1A. Risk Factors, and (c) Item 7. Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis and subsequent SEC filings.

Exhibit 99.2
Exhibit 99.1 to this Report on Form 8-K (the "Pre-Release") contains the non-GAAP financial measure of operational earnings per share. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, Entergy has provided quantitative reconciliations within the Pre-Release of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
Operational earnings per share is not calculated in accordance with GAAP because it excludes the impact of "special items". Special items reflect the impact on earnings of events that are less routine, are related to prior periods, or are related to discontinued businesses. Management believes the discussion of operational earnings provides useful information to investors in evaluating the ongoing results of Entergy's businesses and assists investors in comparing the company's operating performance to the operating performance of others in the energy sector. Entergy management frequently references operational earnings in its decision-making, using that measure to facilitate historical and ongoing performance comparisons as well as comparisons to the performance of peer companies.
The non-GAAP information in the Pre-Release is used in addition to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP.  The non-GAAP information should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures.  The non-GAAP information reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business.  Investors are strongly encouraged to review our consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure.  Non-GAAP information is not standardized; therefore, it may not be possible to compare this information with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names
