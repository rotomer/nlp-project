     (iii) no later than 10 Business Days following the last day of each calendar month, provide to the Administrative Agent (and the Administrative Agent shall provide a copy to each Lender requesting the same) and the Borrower separate schedules for Letters of Credit issued by it, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, setting forth the aggregate Letter of Credit Obligations, in each case outstanding at the end of each month and any information reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent relating thereto.
          (g) Immediately upon the issuance by an Issuer of a Letter of Credit in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such Issuer shall be deemed to have sold and transferred to each Lender, and each Lender shall be deemed irrevocably and unconditionally to have purchased and received from such Issuer, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation, to the extent of such Lender's Ratable Portion of the Commitments, in such Letter of Credit and the obligations of the Borrower with respect thereto (including all Letter of Credit Obligations with respect thereto) and any security therefor and guaranty pertaining thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any Issuer may require as a condition precedent to Issuing a Letter of Credit, and any Issuer may at any time require with respect to any outstanding Letter of Credit, that the Borrower (i) deposit cash collateral to an L/C Cash Collateral Account sufficient to cover any Defaulting Lender's Ratable Portion of the face amount of such Letter of Credit or (ii) put such other arrangements reasonably satisfactory to such Issuer in place with respect to such Defaulting Lender to eliminate its risk with respect to the participation in Letters of Credit by such Defaulting Lender. Upon the replacement of such Defaulting Lender, or such Lender ceasing to be a Defaulting Lender, any cash or other collateral pledged by the Borrower shall be promptly returned to the Borrower and such other arrangements entered into shall terminate (and, at the request of the Borrower, the relevant Issuer will use reasonable efforts to evidence such termination).
          (h) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Issuer of any Letter of Credit the amount of all Reimbursement Obligations owing to such Issuer under any Letter of Credit issued
 
for its account no later than the date that is the next succeeding Business Day after the Borrower receives written notice (which notice shall be delivered within 1 Business Day of the draw giving rise to such Reimbursement Obligation, , , that the failure to give such notice shall in no way impair, diminish, or otherwise affect the Borrower's obligation to pay such Reimbursement Obligations) from such Issuer that payment has been made under such Letter of Credit (the ""), irrespective of any claim, set-off, defense or other right that the Borrower may have at any time against such Issuer or any other Person. In the event that any Issuer makes any payment under any Letter of Credit and the Borrower shall not have repaid such amount to such Issuer pursuant to this clause (h) or any such payment by the Borrower is rescinded or set aside for any reason, such Reimbursement Obligation shall be payable on demand with interest thereon computed (i) from the date on which such Reimbursement Obligation arose to the Reimbursement Date, at the rate of interest applicable during such period to Loans that are ABR Loans and (ii) from the Reimbursement Date until the date of repayment in full, at the rate of interest applicable during such period to past due Loans that are ABR Loans, and such Issuer shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent, which shall promptly notify each Lender of such failure, and each Lender shall promptly and unconditionally pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuer the amount of such Lender's Ratable Portion of such payment in immediately available funds. If the Administrative Agent so notifies such Lender prior to 12:00 p.m. (New York time) on any Business Day, such Lender shall make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuer its Ratable Portion of the amount of such payment on such Business Day in immediately available funds. Upon such payment by a Lender, such Lender shall, except during the continuance of a Default or Event of Default under Sections 7.02(g) or 7.02(h) and notwithstanding whether or not the conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.01 shall have been satisfied (which conditions precedent the Lenders hereby irrevocably waive), be deemed to have made a Loan to the Borrower in the principal amount of such payment. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Issuer is hereby authorized by the Borrower (which authorization is irrevocable and coupled with an interest) to give, through the Administrative Agent, Borrowing Requests pursuant to this Section 2.03(h) in such amounts and at such times as may be required to reimburse an outstanding Reimbursement Obligation. Whenever any Issuer receives from the Borrower a payment of a Reimbursement Obligation as to which the Administrative Agent has received for the account of such Issuer any payment from a Lender pursuant to this clause (h), such Issuer shall pay over to the Administrative Agent any amount received in excess of such Reimbursement Obligation and, upon receipt of such amount, the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay over to each Lender, in immediately available funds, an amount equal to such Lender's Ratable Portion of the amount of such payment adjusted, if necessary, to reflect the respective amounts the Lenders have paid in respect of such Reimbursement Obligation. Upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of all amounts owing from the Lenders (including any Defaulting Lenders) pursuant to this clause (h), any cash or other collateral pledged by the Borrower in accordance with clause (g) above shall be promptly returned to the Borrower and any such other arrangement entered into pursuant to clause (g)(ii) shall terminate (and, at the request of the Borrower, the relevant Issuer will use reasonable efforts to evidence such termination).

(a) The Borrower shall make each payment hereunder (including fees and expenses) not later than 12:00 p.m. (New York time) on the day when due, in dollars, to the Administrative Agent at its address referred to in Section 9.01 in immediately available funds without set-off or counterclaim. The Administrative Agent shall promptly thereafter cause to be distributed immediately available funds relating to the payment of principal, interest or fees to the Lenders, in accordance with the application of payments set forth in clause (f) or (g) below, as applicable, for the account of their respective applicable lending offices; , , that amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14, Section 2.16 or Section 2.19 shall be paid only to the affected Lender or Lenders. Payments received by the Administrative Agent after 12:00 p.m. (New York time) shall be deemed to be received on the next Business Day.
Payments and Computations
provided
however
          (b) All computations of interest and of fees shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in the period for which such interest and fees are payable (including the first day but excluding the last day) (i) for ABR Loans based on the Base Rate (other than with respect to the Federal Funds Rate), over a year of 365/366 days, and (ii) for Eurodollar Loans, ABR Loans based on the Federal Funds Rate and all
 
fees, over a year of 360 days. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of a rate of interest hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.
          (c) Each payment by the Borrower of any Loan, Reimbursement Obligation (including interest or fees in respect thereof) and each reimbursement of various costs, expenses or other Secured Obligation shall be made in dollars; , , that other than for payments in respect of a Loan or Reimbursement Obligation, Loan Documents duly executed by the Administrative Agent or any hedging contract governing the applicable Interest Rate Hedging Transaction or Currency Hedging Transaction may specify other currencies of payment for Secured Obligations created by or directly related to such Loan Document or such hedging contract.
provided
however
          (d) Whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, the due date for such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or fees, as the case may be; , , that if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of any Eurodollar Loan to be made in the next calendar month, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day.
provided
however
          (e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower to the Lenders prior to the date on which any payment is due hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent that the Borrower shall not have made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon (at the Federal Funds Rate for the first Business Day and, thereafter, at the rate applicable to ABR Loans) for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Administrative Agent.
          (f) Except for payments and other amounts received by the Administrative Agent and applied in accordance with the provisions of clause (g) below (or required to be applied in accordance with Section 2.12(d)), all payments and any other amounts received by the Administrative Agent from or for the benefit of the Borrower shall be applied as follows: , to pay principal of, and interest on, any portion of the Loans the Administrative Agent may have advanced pursuant to the express provisions of this Agreement on behalf of any Lender, for which the Administrative Agent has not then been reimbursed by such Lender or the Borrower, , to pay all other Secured Obligations then due and payable and , as the Borrower so designates. Payments in respect of Loans received by the Administrative Agent shall be distributed to each Lender in accordance with such Lender's Ratable Portion of the Commitments and all payments of fees and all other payments in respect of any other Secured Obligation shall be allocated among such of the Lenders and Issuers as are entitled thereto and, for such payments allocated to the Lenders, in proportion to their respective Ratable Portions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, until such time as the Default Excess with respect to such Defaulting Lender shall have been reduced to zero, any payment of the Loans made under this Section 2.13 and applied pursuant to this clause (f) shall be applied first to the
first

Loans of other Lenders as if such Defaulting Lender had no Loans outstanding and the Revolving Credit Outstandings of such Defaulting Lender were zero.
          (g) The Borrower hereby irrevocably waives the right to direct the application of any and all payments in respect of the Secured Obligations under any Loan Document and any proceeds of Collateral after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default and agrees that, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.12(d) and clause (f) above, the Collateral Agent shall apply the proceeds of any collection, sale, foreclosure or other realization upon any Collateral received by it in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement and all other proceeds of Collateral constituting the applicable Designated Assets (as such term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) in the order set forth in Section 3.5 of the Intercreditor Agreement.
          SECTION 2.14. . (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Change in Law shall:
Reserve Requirements; Change in Circumstances
     (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by any Lender or Issuer, or
     (ii) impose on any Lender or Issuer or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein (except, in the case of both clause (i) and this clause (ii), any such reserve requirement which is reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate),
and, such Change in Law becomes effective after the date hereof and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or such Issuer of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or such Issuer of issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or purchasing or maintaining a participation therein or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or such Issuer hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise) by an amount reasonably deemed by such Lender or such Issuer to be material, then the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuer, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. This Section 2.14(a) shall not apply to Taxes, which shall be governed by Section 2.19 and related definitions.
          (b) If any Lender or Issuer shall have determined that any Change in Law regarding capital adequacy that becomes effective after the date of this Agreement has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such Issuer's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or such Issuer's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit purchased by, such Lender or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuer to a level below that which such Lender or such Issuer or such Lender's or such Issuer's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or such Issuer's policies and the policies of such Lender's or such Issuer's holding company, as the case may be, with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount reasonably deemed by such Lender or such Issuer to be material, then the Borrower shall pay to such Lender or such Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuer or such Lender's or such Issuer's holding company, as the case may be, for any such reduction suffered.
 
          (c) Any Lender or Issuer requesting compensation pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 2.14 shall deliver a written statement to Borrower setting forth the amount or amounts reasonably determined by such Lender or such Issuer to be necessary to compensate such Lender or such Issuer or such Lender's or such Issuer's holding company, as applicable, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 2.14, which written statement shall, absent clearly demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or such Issuer, as the case may be, the amount or amounts shown as due on any such written statement delivered by it within 10 days after its receipt of the same.
          (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's, the Administrative Agent's or such Issuer's right to demand such compensation; , that the Borrower shall not be under any obligation to compensate any Lender, the Administrative Agent or an Issuer under paragraph (a) or (b) above for increased costs or reductions suffered more than 180 days prior to the date of delivery of the written statement required by paragraph (c); provided further, that if the circumstances giving rise to such demand have retroactive application, such 180-day period shall be extended to include the period of such retroactive effect. The protection of this Section 2.14(d) shall be available to each Lender and Issuer regardless of any possible contention of the invalidity or inapplicability of the Change in Law that shall have occurred or been imposed.

Change in Legality
     (i) such Lender may declare that Eurodollar Loans will not thereafter (for the duration of such unlawfulness) be made by such Lender hereunder (or be continued for additional Interest Periods and ABR Loans will not thereafter (for such duration) be converted into Eurodollar Loans), whereupon any request for a Eurodollar Borrowing (or to convert an ABR Borrowing to a Eurodollar Borrowing or to continue a Eurodollar Borrowing for an additional Interest Period) shall, as to such Lender only, be deemed a request for an ABR Loan (or a request to continue an ABR Loan as such for an additional Interest Period or to convert a Eurodollar Loan into an ABR Loan, as the case may be), unless such declaration shall be subsequently withdrawn; and
     (ii) such Lender may require that all outstanding Eurodollar Loans made by it be converted to ABR Loans, in which event all such Eurodollar Loans shall be automatically converted to ABR Loans as of the effective date of such notice as provided in paragraph (b) below.
In the event any Lender shall exercise its rights under (i) or (ii) above, all payments and prepayments of principal that would otherwise have been applied to repay the Eurodollar Loans that would have been made by such Lender or the converted Eurodollar Loans of such Lender shall instead be applied to repay the ABR Loans made by such Lender in lieu of, or resulting from the conversion of, such Eurodollar Loans. Any such conversion of a Eurodollar Loan under clause (i) above shall be subject to Section 2.16.
 
          (b) For purposes of this Section 2.15, a notice to the Borrower by any Lender shall be effective as to each Eurodollar Loan made by such Lender, if lawful, on the last day of the Interest Period then applicable to such Eurodollar Loan; in all other cases such notice shall be effective on the date of receipt by the Borrower.
          (c) With respect to each Lender that has delivered a notice pursuant to this Section 2.15, the Base Rate with respect to Loans made by such Lender shall be calculated as if the proviso to the definition of "Base Rate" were not included in the definition of "Base Rate" during the period such notice remains in force and effect.
          SECTION 2.16. . The Borrower shall indemnify each Lender (and in the case of clause (c) below, also including the Administrative Agent) against any loss or expense that such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) any event, other than a default by such Lender in the performance of its obligations hereunder, which results in (i) such Lender receiving or being deemed to receive any amount on account of the principal of any Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the Interest Period in effect therefor, (ii) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan to an ABR Loan, or the conversion of the Interest Period with respect to any Eurodollar Loan, in each case other than on the last day of the Interest Period in effect therefor and (iii) any Eurodollar Loan to be made by such Lender (including any Eurodollar Loan to be made pursuant to a conversion or continuation under Section 2.10) not being made after notice of such Loan shall have been given by the Borrower hereunder (any of the events referred to in this clause (a) being called a ""); (b) any default in the making of any payment or prepayment required to be made hereunder or (c) without duplication under this Agreement, any amount withheld pursuant to Section 2.19 hereof. In the case of any Breakage Event, such loss shall include, in the case of a Lender, an amount equal to the excess, as reasonably determined by such Lender, of (i) its cost of obtaining funds for the Eurodollar Loan that is the subject of such Breakage Event for the period from the date of such Breakage Event to the last day of the Interest Period in effect (or that would have been in effect) for such Loan, as the case may be, over (ii) the amount of interest likely to be realized by such Lender in redeploying the funds released or not utilized by reason of such Breakage Event for such period. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts which such Lender believes it is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.16, including the calculations and criteria applied to determine such amount or amounts, and other documentation or information reasonably supporting the conclusions in such certificate, shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall, absent clearly demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.16, Borrower shall not be under any obligation to compensate any Lender or Issuer under this Section 2.16 for any amounts incurred more than 180 days prior to the date of delivery of such certificate, documentation and information; , that if the circumstances giving rise to such demand have retroactive application, such 180-day period shall be extended to include the period of such retroactive effect.

(a) Except as required under Section 2.05, 2.11, 2.12, 2.13, 2.15, 2.16, 2.19 and paragraph (b) of this Section 2.17, each Borrowing, each payment or prepayment of principal of any Borrowing, each payment of Reimbursement Obligations, each payment of interest on the Loans, each payment of the Unused Commitment Fees, each reduction of the Commitments and each conversion of any Borrowing to or continuation of any Borrowing as a Borrowing of any Type shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders (in the case of payments, to each Lender entitled to receive such payments) in accordance with their respective Commitments (or, if such Commitments shall have expired or
Pro Rata Treatment
 
been terminated, in accordance with the respective principal amounts of their outstanding Loans). Each Lender agrees that in computing such Lender's portion of any Borrowing to be made hereunder, the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, round each Lender's percentage of such Borrowing to the next higher or lower whole dollar amount.
          (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender constitutes a Defaulting Lender as a result of its failure to make available its Ratable Portion of any Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.02 or to pay (other than as a result of a good faith dispute) any amount required to be paid by such Lender to any Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03, then the Administrative Agent may, it its discretion (and subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender from or on behalf of the Borrower or any Loan Party or otherwise in respect of any amounts owed hereunder or under any other Loan Document to the satisfaction of its obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are paid in full.
          SECTION 2.18. . Each Lender agrees that if it shall, through the exercise of a right of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim against the Borrower or any other Loan Party, or pursuant to a secured claim under Section 506 of the Bankruptcy Code or other security or interest arising from, or in lieu of, such secured claim, received by such Lender under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law or otherwise, or by any other means, obtain payment (voluntary or involuntary) in respect of any Loan or Loans as a result of which the unpaid principal portion of its Loans shall be proportionately less than the unpaid principal portion of the Loans of any other Lender, it shall be deemed simultaneously to have purchased from such other Lender at face value, and shall promptly pay to such other Lender the purchase price for, a participation in the Loans of such other Lender, so that the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans and participations in Loans held by each Lender shall be in the same proportion to the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Loans then outstanding as the principal amount of its Loans prior to such exercise of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim or other event was to the principal amount of all Loans outstanding prior to such exercise of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim or other event; , , that if any such purchase or purchases or adjustments shall be made pursuant to this Section 2.18 and the payment giving rise thereto shall thereafter be recovered, such purchase or purchases or adjustments shall be rescinded to the extent of such recovery and the purchase price or prices or adjustment restored without interest.

A written statement as to the amount of such payment or liability shall be delivered to the Borrower by a Lender, or by the Administrative Agent on its behalf or on behalf of the Lender, promptly upon such party's determination of an indemnifiable event and such written statement shall be conclusive absent demonstrable error; that the failure to deliver such written statement shall not affect the obligations of the Borrower under this Section 2.19(c) except to the extent the Borrower is actually prejudiced thereby. The written statement shall include (i) in the event of a payment by the Lender or the Administrative Agent of an Indemnified Tax or Other Tax, the original or a copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment or other evidence of such payment together with a written statement setting forth the amount of such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes or (ii) in the event of payment to be made by the Borrower, the amount of such Taxes, in each case, delivered to Borrower by a Lender or by the Administrative Agent.
