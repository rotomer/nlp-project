Exhibit 99.1
 
Entergy Corporation 639 Loyola Avenue New Orleans, LA  70113
NEWS RELEASE
New Orleans, La. - Entergy Corporation (NYSE: ETR) today indicated that it expects first quarter 2009 as-reported earnings of approximately$1.19 per share and operational earnings of approximately $1.28per share compared to as-reported and operational results of $1.56 per share in first quarter 2008. Entergy also affirmed previously issued earnings guidance.
Entergy Nuclear earnings decreased primarily due to additional planned refueling outage days during the quarter, an impairment recognized on certain decommissioning trust fund investments, and a special item associated with the planned spin-off.
Utility, Parent & Other results were lower due to higher other taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses, and a special item related to the planned spin-off.
Entergy's non-nuclear wholesale assets business results were essentially flat.
As-reported results are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and are comprised of operational earnings (described below) and special items. As-reported earnings in first quarter 2009 will include a special item at Entergy Nuclear for spin-off dis-synergies. Utility, Parent & Other results will include a special item for expenses for outside services provided during the quarter to pursue the non-utility nuclear spin-off.
The quarter-over-quarter decrease in operational earnings at Entergy Nuclear is attributed to lower revenue primarily resulting from two planned refueling outages commencing during the quarter at Indian Point 3 and Palisades totaling 30 days compared to seven refueling outage days at Indian Point 2 a year ago and an impairment recorded in the current period on certain decommissioning trust investments. Also contributing to the decrease was lower revenue amortization for the Palisades below-market Power Purchase Agreement, as well as higher operation and maintenance expense.
Utility, Parent & Other operational results in first quarter 2009 were lower compared to earnings in first quarter 2008 due primarily to higher other taxes and depreciation and amortization expenses. Net revenue at the Utility was essentially flat, despite reporting lower sales volume. The effect of milder-than-normal weather in first quarter 2009 was roughly in line with the weather impact experienced in the same quarter last year.
Entergy affirmed previously issued as-reported earnings guidance for 2009 of $6.56 to $7.16 per share and operational earnings guidance of $6.70 to $7.30 per share. Entergy indicated that should the current economic climate and power prices on Entergy Nuclear's open position persist for the balance of the year, earnings could approach the lower end of the ranges.

In this news release, and from time to time, Entergy Corporation makes certain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Except to the extent required by the federal securities laws, Entergy undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
Forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties. There are factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, including (a) those factors discussed in (i) Entergy's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 and (ii) Entergy's other reports and filings made under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, (b) the uncertainties associated with efforts to remediate the effects of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike and the January 2009 Arkansas ice storm and recovery of costs associated with restoration, and (c) the following transactional factors (in addition to others described elsewhere in this news release and in subsequent securities filings): (i) risks inherent in the contemplated spin-off, joint venture and related transactions (including the level of debt to be incurred by Enexus Energy Corporation and the terms and costs related thereto), (ii) legislative and regulatory actions, and (iii) conditi ons of the capital markets during the periods covered by the forward-looking statements. Entergy cannot provide any assurances that the spin-off or any of the proposed transactions related thereto will be completed, nor can it give assurances as to the terms on which such transactions will be consummated.

Exhibit 99.2
Exhibit 99.1 to this Report on Form 8-K (the "Pre-Release") contains the non-GAAP financial measure of operational earnings per share. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, Entergy has provided quantitative reconciliations within the Pre-Release of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
Operational earnings per share is not calculated in accordance with GAAP because it excludes the impact of "special items". Special items reflect the impact on earnings of events that are less routine, are related to prior periods, or are related to discontinued businesses. Management believes the discussion of operational earnings provides useful information to investors in evaluating the ongoing results of Entergy's businesses and assists investors in comparing the company's operating performance to the operating performance of others in the energy sector. Entergy management frequently references operational earnings in its decision-making, using that measure to facilitate historical and ongoing performance comparisons as well as comparisons to the performance of peer companies.
The non-GAAP information in the Pre-Release is used in addition to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP.  The non-GAAP information should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures.  The non-GAAP information reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business.  Investors are strongly encouraged to review our consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure.  Non-GAAP information is not standardized; therefore, it may not be possible to compare this information with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names
