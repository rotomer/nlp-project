SYSTEM ENERGY RESOURCES, INC. (SERI)
System Energy owns or leases 90 percent of the Grand Gulf 1 nuclear generating facility. System Energy sells power and capacity from Grand Gulf 1 at wholesale to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans.
UTILITY NUCLEAR PLANTS
Entergy owns and operates five nuclear units at four plant sites to serve its regulated utility business: Arkansas Nuclear One (ANO) Units 1 and 2 near Russelville, Arkansas; Grand Gulf Nuclear Station in Port Gibson, Mississippi; River Bend Station in St. Francisville, Louisiana; and Waterford 3 in Taft, Louisiana.
 
 
 
ENTERGY NUCLEAR
Entergy's non-utility nuclear business owns and operates six nuclear units in the northern United States. This business is primarily focused on selling power produced by those plants to wholesale customers. This business also provides operations and management services to nuclear power plants owned by other utilities in the United States.
 Six units in northern U.S.
      Pilgrim Nuclear Station in Plymouth, Massachusetts
      James A. FitzPatrick in Oswego, New York
      Indian Point Units 2 and 3 in Buchanan, New York
      Vermont Yankee in Vernon, Vermont
      Palisades Nuclear Energy Plant in South Haven, Michigan
 4,998 MW owned generating capacity
 800 MW under management services contract
      Cooper Nuclear Station located near Brownville, Nebraska
ENEXUS ENERGY CORPORATION / EQUAGEN, LLC
In November 2007, Entergy's Board of Directors approved a plan to pursue a separation of the Non-Utility Nuclear business from Entergy through a tax-free spin-off of Non-Utility Nuclear to Entergy shareholders. Enexus will be a new, separate, and publicly-traded company. In addition, under the plan, Enexus and Entergy are expected to enter into a nuclear services business joint venture, EquaGen, with 50% ownership by Enexus and 50% ownership by Entergy.
Entergy expects that Enexus' business will be substantially comprised of Non-Utility Nuclear's assets, including its six nuclear units, and Non-Utility Nuclear's power marketing operation. Entergy's remaining business will primarily be comprised of the Utility business. EquaGen is expected to operate the nuclear assets owned by Enexus. EquaGen is also expected to offer nuclear services to third parties, including decommissioning, plant relicensing, and plant operations for the Cooper Nuclear Station and others.
Deteriorating financial market conditions in late 2008 and a longer than planned regulatory approval process caused the spin-off and nuclear services business joint venture transactions to be delayed. Entergy is in a position of rolling readiness, prepared to act once acceptable regulatory approvals are received and the timing is right to access financial markets. Entergy remains committed to maximizing the value that continues to exist in its non-utility nuclear assets.
ENERGY COMMODITY SERVICES
The energy commodity services business includes Entergy-Koch and Entergy's Non-Nuclear Wholesale Assets business. Entergy-Koch engaged in two major businesses: energy commodity marketing and trading through Entergy-Koch Trading, and gas transportation and storage through Gulf South Pipeline. Entergy-Koch sold both of these businesses in the fourth quarter of 2004, and Entergy-Koch is no longer an operating entity.
NON-NUCLEAR WHOLESALE ASSETS BUSINESS
Entergy's Non-Nuclear Wholesale Assets business sells to wholesale customers the electric power produced by power plants that it owns or controls (1,353 net MW generating capacity) while it focuses on improving performance and exploring sales or restructuring opportunities for its power plants. Such opportunities are evaluated consistent with Entergy's market-based point of view.
