Release
                                                                         
                                                      
New Orleans, La. - Entergy Corporation (NYSE: ETR) today indicated that it expects third quarter 2009 as-reported earnings of approximately $2.31 per share and operational earnings of approximately $2.39 per share compared to as-reported results of $2.41 per share and operational results of $2.50 per share in third quarter 2008.
 
As-reported results are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and are comprised of operational earnings (described below) and special items. As-reported earnings in third quarter 2009 will include a special item at Entergy Nuclear for spin-off dis-synergies.  Utility, Parent & Other third quarter results in both 2008 and 2009 will include a special item for expenses for outside services to pursue the non-utility nuclear spin-off.
 
The decrease in third quarter 2009 operational earnings is due primarily to lower results at Utility, Parent and Other, partially offset by increased earnings at Non-nuclear Wholesale Assets. Entergy Nuclear results were modestly higher compared to third quarter 2008.
 
Lower Utility, Parent & Other operational earnings in third quarter 2009 were primarily due to the absence of the 2008 adjustment reducing income tax expense (associated with the liquidation of a subsidiary resulting in an income tax loss) and higher operation and maintenance expense.  Partially offsetting lower results were higher net revenue and other income.  The effects of hurricanes Gustav and Ike reduced revenue in 2008.
 
Entergys non-nuclear wholesale assets business quarterly operational results improved due to the absence of the 2008 adjustment increasing income tax expense (associated with the redemption of an investment).
 
     The modest increase quarter-over-quarter in operational earnings at Entergy Nuclear is attributed to higher revenue primarily due to fewer planned and unplanned outages and increased other income.  Largely offsetting these items were increased operations and maintenance expense and the absence of the 2008 adjustment reducing income tax expense (associated with Massachusetts state tax law change).
   
 
     Entergy affirmed its previously issued earnings guidance ranges, with 2009 as-reported earnings guidance to be in the range of $6.00 to $6.60 per share and 2009 operational earnings guidance to be in the range of $6.20 to $6.80 per share.

Except to the extent required by the federal securities laws, Entergy undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

(i) Entergys Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, (ii) Entergys Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31 and June 30, 2009, and (iii) Entergys other reports and filings made under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, (b) the uncertainties associated with efforts to remediate the effects of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike and the January 2009 Arkansas ice storm and recovery of costs associated with restoration, and (c) the following transactional factors (in addition to others described elsewhere in this news release and in subsequent securities filings): (i) risks inherent in the contemplated spin-off, joint venture and related transactions (including the level of debt to be incurred by Enexus Energy Corporation and the terms and costs related thereto), (ii) legislative and regulatory actions, and (iii) conditions of the capital markets during the periods covered by the forward-looking statements.

Exhibit 99.2
Exhibit 99.1 to this Report on Form 8-K (the "Pre-Release") contains the non-GAAP financial measure of operational earnings per share.  Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, Entergy has provided quantitative reconciliations within the Pre-Release of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
Operational earnings per share is not calculated in accordance with GAAP because it excludes the impact of "special items".  Special items reflect the impact on earnings of events that are less routine, are related to prior periods, or are related to discontinued businesses.  Management believes the discussion of operational earnings provides useful information to investors in evaluating the ongoing results of Entergy's businesses and assists investors in comparing the company's operating performance to the operating performance of others in the energy sector. Entergy management frequently references operational earnings in its decision-making, using that measure to facilitate historical and ongoing performance comparisons as well as comparisons to the performance of peer companies.
The non-GAAP information in the Pre-Release is used in addition to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP.  The non-GAAP information should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures.  The non-GAAP information reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business.  Investors are strongly encouraged to review our consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure.  Non-GAAP information is not standardized; therefore, it may not be possible to compare this information with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names
