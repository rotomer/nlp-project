Whenever, subsequent to the receipt by the Trustee of any Board Resolution, Officers Certificate, Opinion of Counsel or other document or instrument, a clerical, typographical or other inadvertent or unintentional error or omission shall be discovered therein, a new document or instrument may be substituted therefor in corrected form with the same force and effect as if originally filed in the corrected form and, irrespective of the date or dates of the actual execution and/or delivery thereof, such substitute document or instrument shall be deemed to have been executed and/or delivered as of the date or dates required with respect to the document or instrument for which it is substituted.  Anything in this Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, if any such corrective document or instrument indicates that action h as been taken by or at the request of the Company which could not have been taken had the original document or instrument not contained such error or omission, the action so taken shall not be invalidated or otherwise rendered ineffective but shall be and remain in full force and effect, except to the extent that such action was a result of willful misconduct or bad faith.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any Securities issued under the authority of such defective document or instrument shall nevertheless be the valid obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits of this Indenture equally and ratably with all other Outstanding Securities, except as aforesaid.

Except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall beco me effective when such instrument or instruments or record or both are delivered to the Trustee and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Company.  Such instrument or instruments and any such record (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the Act of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments and so voting at any such meeting.  Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent, or of the holding by any Person of a Security, shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Section 901) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Company, if made in the manner provided in this Section.  The record of any meeting of Holders shall be proved in the manner provided in Section 1306.
 
(b)
 
The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof or may be proved in any other manner which the Trustee and the Company deem sufficient.  Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority.  The Trustee may in any instance require further proof with respect to any of the matter s referred to in this Section.
 
(c)
 
The principal amount (except as otherwise contemplated in clause (y) of the first proviso to the definition of Outstanding) and serial numbers of Securities held by any Person, and the date of holding the same, shall be proved by the Security Register.
 
(d)
 
Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, election, waiver or other Act of a Holder shall bind every future Holder of the same Security and the Holder of every Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Security.
 
(e)
 
Until such time as written instruments shall have been delivered to the Trustee with respect to the requisite percentage of principal amount of Securities for the action contemplated by such instruments, any such instrument executed and delivered by or on behalf of a Holder may be revoked with respect to any or all of such Securities by written notice by such Holder or any subsequent Holder, proven in the manner in which such instrument was proven.
 
(f)
 
Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, authenticated and delivered after any Act of Holders may, and shall if required by the Trustee, bear a notation in form approved by the Trustee as to any action taken by such Act of Holders.  If the Company shall so determine, new Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Trustee and the Company, to such action may be prepared and executed by the Company and authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in exchange for Outstanding Securities of such series or Tranche.
 
(g)
 
If the Company shall solicit from Holders any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, the Company may, at its option, fix in advance a record date for the determination of Holders entitled to give such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, but the Company shall have no obligation to do so.  If such a record date is fixed, such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act may be given before or after such record date, but only the Holders of record at the close of business on the record date shall be deemed to be Holders for the purposes of determining whether Holders of the requisite percentage of the Outstanding Securities have authorized or agreed or consented to such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, and for that purpose the Outstanding Securities shall be computed as of the record date.

SECTION 106.
 
Notice to Holders of Securities; Waiver.
 
Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, where this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of any event, such notice shall be sufficiently given, and shall be deemed given, to Holders if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder affected by such event, at the address of such Holder as it appears in the Security Register, not later than the latest date, if any, and not earlier than the earliest date, if any, prescribed for the giving of such notice.
 
In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice to Holders by mail, then such notification as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder.  In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders.
 
Any notice required by this Indenture may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event otherwise to be specified therein, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice.  Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.

Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to any series of Securities, or any Tranche thereof, the Securities of each series shall be issuable in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof.
 
SECTION 303.
 
Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating.
 
Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to any series of Securities, or any Tranche thereof, the Securities shall be executed on behalf of the Company by an Authorized Officer and may have the corporate seal of the Company affixed thereto or reproduced thereon attested by any other Authorized Officer or by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company.  The signature of any or all of these officers on the Securities may be manual or facsimile.
 
Securities bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at the time of execution Authorized Officers or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities or did not hold such offices at the date of such Securities.
 
The Trustee shall authenticate and deliver Securities of a series, for original issue, at one time or from time to time in accordance with the Company Order referred to below, upon receipt by the Trustee of:
 
(a)
 
the instrument or instruments establishing the form or forms and terms of such series, as provided in Sections 201 and 301;
 
(b)
 
a Company Order requesting the authentication and delivery of such Securities and, to the extent that the terms of such Securities shall not have been established in a supplemental indenture or in a Board Resolution, or in an Officers Certificate pursuant to a supplemental indenture or a Board Resolution, all as contemplated by Sections 201 and 301, either (i) establishing such terms or (ii) in the case of Securities of a series subject to a Periodic Offering, specifying procedures, acceptable to the Trustee, by which such terms are to be established (which procedures may provide, to the extent acceptable to the Trustee, for authentication and delivery pursuant to oral or electronic instructions from the Company or any ag ent or agents thereof, which oral instructions are to be promptly confirmed electronically or in writing), in either case in accordance with the instrument or instruments establishing the terms of the Securities of such series delivered pursuant to clause (a) above;
 
(c)
 
the Securities of such series, executed on behalf of the Company by an Authorized Officer;
 
(d)
 
an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that:
 
 
 
 
provided, however, that, with respect to Securities of a series subject to a Periodic Offering, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive such Opinion of Counsel only once at or prior to the time of the first authentication of such Securities (provided that such Opinion of Counsel addresses the authentication and delivery of all Securities of such series) and that in lieu of the opinions described in clauses (ii) and (iii) above such Opinion of Counsel may, alternatively, state that:
 
(x)  when the terms of such Securities shall have been established pursuant to a Company Order or Orders or pursuant to such procedures (acceptable to the Trustee) as may be specified from time to time by a Company Order or Orders, all as contemplated by and in accordance with the instrument or instruments delivered pursuant to clause (a) above, such terms will have been duly authorized by the Company and will have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and
 
(y)  such Securities, when (1) authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in accordance with this Indenture, (2) issued and delivered by the Company and (3) paid for, all as contemplated by and in accordance with the aforesaid Company Order or Orders, as the case may be, will have been duly issued under this Indenture and will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture, and enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject, as to enforcement, to laws relating to or affecting generally the enforcement of creditors rights, including, without limitation, bankruptcy and insolvency laws, and to general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
 
With respect to Securities of a series subject to a Periodic Offering, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the authorization by the Company of any of such Securities, the form, terms thereof and the legality, validity, binding effect and enforceability thereof, and compliance of the authentication and delivery thereof with the terms and conditions of this Indenture, upon the Opinion of Counsel and other documents delivered pursuant to Sections 201 and 301 and this Section, as applicable, at or prior to the time of the first authentication of Securities of such series unless and until such opinion or other documents have been superseded or revoked or expire by their terms.  In connection with the authentication and delivery of Securities of a series subject to a Periodic Offering, the Trustee shall be entitled to assume that the Companys instructions to authenticate and deliver such Securities do not violate any applicable law or any applicable rule, regulation or order of any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Company.
 
If the form or terms of the Securities of any series have been established by or pursuant to a Board Resolution, an Officers Certificate or a Company Order as permitted by Sections 201, 301 or 303(b), the Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Securities if the issuance of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will materially or adversely affect the Trustees own rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.
 
Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to any series of Securities, or any Tranche thereof, each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.
 
Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to any series of Securities, no Security shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee or an Authenticating Agent by manual signature, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder to the Company, or any Person acting on its behalf, but shall never have been issued and sold by the Company, and the C ompany shall deliver such Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 309 together with a written statement (which need not comply with Section 102 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel) stating that such Security has never been issued and sold by the Company, for all purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits hereof.
 
SECTION 304.
 
Global or Temporary Securities.
 
The Company may issue some or all of the Securities in temporary or permanent global form.  The Company may issue a global Security only to a depository, including The Depository Trust Company, or other clearing corporation or securities intermediary, or its nominee.  A depository or its nominee may transfer a Security in global form only to a nominee of a depository or to a successor depository, but upon request of such depository, the Company shall deliver non-global Securities in exchange for global Securities.  A global Security shall represent the amount of Securities specified in the global Security.  A global Security may have variations that the depository requires or that the Company considers appropriate for such a security, including grids for increasing or decreasing the principal amoun t of such Security.   Beneficial owners of part or all of a global Security are subject to the rules of the depository as in effect from time to time.  The Company, the Trustee and any Registrar and any Paying Agent shall not be responsible or liable for any acts or omissions of a depository, for any depository records of beneficial ownership interests, for any transactions between the depository and beneficial owners, for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in a global Security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.
 
Until definitive Securities are ready for delivery, the Company may use temporary Securities.  Temporary Securities shall be substantially in the form of definitive Securities but may have variations that the Company considers appropriate for temporary Securities.  Without unreasonable delay, the Company shall deliver definitive Securities in exchange for temporary Securities.  Until exchanged in full as hereinabove provided, temporary Securities shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of the same series and Tranche and of like tenor authenticated and delivered hereunder.
 
SECTION 305.
 
Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange.
 
The Company shall cause to be kept in each office designated pursuant to Section 602, with respect to the Securities of each series, a register (all registers kept in accordance with this Section being collectively referred to as the Security Register) in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Securities of such series, or any Tranche thereof, and the registration of transfer thereof.  The Company shall designate one Person to maintain the Security Register for the Securities of each series on a consolidated basis, and such Person is referred to herein, with respect to such series, as the Security Registrar.  Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company may designate one or more of its offi ces as an office in which a register with respect to the Securities of one or more series shall be maintained, and the Company may designate itself the Security Registrar with respect to one or more of such series.  The Security Register shall be open for inspection by the Trustee and the Company at all reasonable times.
 
Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to the Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security of such series or Tranche at the office or agency of the Company maintained pursuant to Section 602 in a Place of Payment for such series or Tranche, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of the same series and Tranche, of authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount.
 
Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to the Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, any Security of such series or Tranche may be exchanged at the option of the Holder, for one or more new Securities of the same series and Tranche, of authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at any such office or agency.  Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
 
All Securities delivered upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
 
Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company, the Trustee or the Security Registrar) be duly endorsed or shall be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company, the Trustee or the Security Registrar, as the case may be, duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
 
Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, no service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 304, 406 or 1206 not involving any transfer.
 
The Company shall not be required to execute or to provide for the registration of transfer of or the exchange of (a) Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, during a period of 15 days immediately preceding the date notice is to be given identifying the serial numbers of the Securities of such series or Tranche called for redemption, (b) any Security during the 15 days before an Interest Payment Date or (c) any Security selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part.
 
SECTION 306.
 
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities.
 
If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same series and Tranche, and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
 
If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (a) evidence to their satisfaction of the ownership of and the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (b) such security or indemnity as may be reasonably required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of the same series and Tranche, and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.
 
Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other reasonable expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) in connection therewith.
 
Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone other than the Holder of such new Security, and any such new Security shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of such series duly issued hereunder.
 
The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.
 
SECTION 307.
 
Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved.
 
Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to the Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, interest on any Security which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest; provided, that, any interest payable at Maturity shall be paid to the Person to whom the principal of such Security is payable.
 
Subject to Section 312, any interest on any Security of any series which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called Defaulted Interest), other than at Maturity, shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the related Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (a) or (b) below:

(h)
 
such other matters as the Company shall deem desirable or appropriate.
 
Unless otherwise specified with respect to any Securities in accordance with Section 301, with respect to any notice of redemption of Securities at the election of the Company, unless, upon the giving of such notice, such Securities shall be deemed to have been paid in accordance with Section 701, such notice may state that such redemption shall be conditional upon the receipt by the Paying Agent or Agents for such Securities, on or prior to the date fixed for such redemption, of money sufficient to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on such Securities and that if such money shall not have been so received such notice shall be of no force or effect and the Company shall not be required to redeem such Securities.  In the event that such notice of redemption contains such a condition and such money is not so received, the redemption shall not be made and within a reasonable time thereafter notice shall be given, in the manner in which the notice of redemption was given, that such money was not so received and such redemption was not required to be made, and the Paying Agent or Agents for the Securities otherwise to have been redeemed shall promptly return to the Holders thereof any of such Securities which had been surrendered for payment upon such redemption.

Upon surrender of any such Security for redemption in accordance with such notice, such Security or portion thereof shall be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest, if any, to the Redemption Date; provided, however, that no such surrender shall be a condition to such payment if so specified as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to such Security; and provided, further, that except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to such Security, any installment of interest on any Security the Stated Maturity of which installment is on or prior to the Redemption Date shall be payable to the Holder of such Security, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the related Regular Record Date according to the terms of such Security and subject to the provisions of Section 307.

The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee, and prompt notice to the Holders in the manner specified in Section 106, of any such designation or rescission and of any ch ange in the location of any such other office or agency.

money in an amount which shall be sufficient, or
 
(b)
 
in the case of a deposit made prior to the Maturity of such Securities or portions thereof, Eligible Obligations, which shall not contain provisions permitting the redemption or other prepayment thereof at the option of the issuer thereof, the principal of and the interest on which when due, without any regard to reinvestment thereof, will provide moneys which, together with the money, if any, deposited with or held by the Trustee or such Paying Agent, shall be sufficient, or
 
(c)
 
a combination of (a) or (b) which shall be sufficient,
 
to pay when due the principal of and premium, if any, and interest, if any, due and to become due on such Securities or portions thereof on or prior to Maturity; provided, however, that in the case of the provision for payment or redemption of less than all the Securities of any series or Tranche, such Securities or portions thereof shall have been selected by the Trustee as provided herein and, in the case of a redemption, the notice requisite to the validity of such redemption shall have been given or irrevocable authority shall have been given by the Company to the Trustee to give such notice, under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee; and provided, further, that the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee and such Paying Agent:

SECTION 802.
 
Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment.
 
If an Event of Default applicable to the Securities of any series but not applicable to other series of Outstanding Securities shall have occurred and be continuing, either the Trustee or the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series may then declare the principal amount (or, if any of the Securities of such series are Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount as may be specified in the terms thereof as contemplated by Section 301) of all Securities of such series and interest accrued thereon to be due and payable immediately.  If an Event of Default applicable to Outstanding Securities of more than one series shall have occurred and be continuing, either the Trustee or the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of all Securities then Outstanding of all such series (considered as one class), and not the Holders of the Securities of any one of such series, may declare the principal of all Securities of all such series and interest accrued thereon to be due and payable immediately.  As a consequence of each such declaration (herein referred to as a declaration of acceleration) with respect to Securities of any series, the principal amount (or portion thereof in the case of Discount Securities) of such Securities and interest accrued thereon shall become due and payable immediately.
 
At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to Securities of any series shall have been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due shall have been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Event or Events of Default giving rise to such declaration of acceleration shall, without further act,  be deemed to have been waived, and such declaration and its consequences shall, without further act, be deemed to have been automatically rescinded and annulled, if

(4)
 
all amounts due to the Trustee under Section 907;
 
and
 
(b)
 
any other Event or Events of Default with respect to Securities of such series, other than the nonpayment of the principal of Securities of such series which shall have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, shall have been cured or waived as provided in Section 813.
 
No such waiver or rescission and annulment shall affect any subsequent Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
 
SECTION 803.
 
Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee.
 
If an Event of Default described in clause (a) or (b) of Section 801 shall have occurred and be continuing, the Company shall, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the Holders of the Securities of the series with respect to which such Event of Default shall have occurred, the whole amount then due and payable on such Securities for principal and premium, if any, and interest, if any, and, to the extent permitted by law, interest on any overdue principal and interest, at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover any amounts due to the Trustee under Section 907.
 
If the Company shall fail to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree and may enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon such Securities and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon such Securities, wherever situated.
 
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series shall have occurred and be continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.
 
SECTION 804.
 
Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
 
In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities or the property of the Company or of such other obligor or their creditors, the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal of the Securities shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on the Company for the payment of overdue principal or interest) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise,
 
(a)
 
to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of principal, premium, if any, and interest, if any, owing and unpaid in respect of the Securities and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for amounts due to the Trustee under Section 907) and of the Holders allowed in such judicial proceeding, and
 
(b)
 
to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;
 
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amounts due it under Section 907.

(c)
 
such Holder or Holders shall have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request;
 
(d)
 
the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity shall have failed to institute any such proceeding; and
 
(e)
 
no direction inconsistent with such written request shall have been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of all series in respect of which an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, considered as one class;
 
it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other of such Holders or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all of such Holders.
 
SECTION 808.

SECTION 809.
 
Restoration of Rights and Remedies.
 
If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding shall have been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or shall have been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case, subject to any determination in such proceeding, the Company, and Trustee and such Holder shall be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and such Holder shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.

The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.
 
SECTION 811.
 
Delay or Omission Not Waiver.
 
No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein.  Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be.
 
SECTION 812.
 
Control by Holders of Securities.
 
If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing in respect of a series of Securities, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee, with respect to the Securities of such series; provided, however, that if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing with respect to more than one series of Securities, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of all such series, considered as one class, shall have the right to make such direction, and not the Holders of the Securities of any one of such series; and provided, further, that such direction s hall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture.  The Trustee may take any other action, deemed proper by the Trustee, which is not inconsistent with any such direction.

Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent.   No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section.

This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If all of the Securities of a series may not be originally issued at one time, and if the Trustee does not have an office capable of authenticating Securities upon original issuance located in a Place of Payment where the Company wishes to have Securities of such series authenticated upon original issuance, the Trustee, if so requested by the Company in writing (which writing need not comply with Section 102 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel), shall appoint, in accordance with this Section and in accordance with such procedures as shall be acceptable to the Trustee, an Authenticating Agent having an office in a Place of Payment designated by the Company with respect to such series of Securities.

(y)  if any such amendment shall permit one or more changes to, or the elimination of, any provisions hereof which, at the date of the execution and delivery hereof or at any time thereafter, are required by the Trust Indenture Act to be contained herein, this Indenture shall be deemed to have been amended to effect such changes or elimination, and the Company and the Trustee may, without the consent of any Holders, enter into a supplemental indenture to evidence such amendment hereof.
 
SECTION 1202.
 
Supplemental Indentures With Consent of Holders.
 
With the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all series then Outstanding under this Indenture, considered as one class, by Act of said Holders delivered to the Company and the Trustee, the Company, when authorized by a Board Resolution, and the Trustee may enter into a supplemental indenture or indentures for the purpose of adding any provisions to, or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of, this Indenture or modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series under the Indenture; provided, however, that if there shall be Securities of more than one series Outstanding hereunder and if a proposed supplemental indenture shall directly affect the rights of the Holders of Securities of one or more, but less than all, of such series, then the consent only of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of all series so directly affected, considered as one class, shall be required; and provided, further, that if the Securities of any series shall have been issued in more than one Tranche and if the proposed supplemental indenture shall directly affect the rights of the Holders of Securities of one or more, but less than all, of such Tranches, then the consent only of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of all Tranches so directly affected, considered as one class, shall be required; and provided, further, that no such supplemental indenture shall:
 
(a)
 
change the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any installment of principal of or interest on, any Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof or the rate of interest thereon (or the amount of any installment of interest thereon) or change the method of calculating such rate or reduce any premium payable upon the redemption thereof, or reduce the amount of the principal of a Discount Security that would be due and payable upon a declaration of acceleration of the Maturity thereof pursuant to Section 802, or change the coin or currency (or other property), in which any Security or any premium or the interest thereon is payable, or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after the Stated Maturity of any Security (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date), without, in any such case, the consent of the Holder of such Security, or
 
(b)
 
reduce the percentage in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, the consent of the Holders of which is required for any such supplemental indenture, or the consent of the Holders of which is required for any waiver of compliance with any provision of this Indenture or of any default hereunder and its consequences, or reduce the requirements of Section 1304 for quorum or voting, without, in any such case, the consent of the Holders of each Outstanding Security of such series or Tranche, or
 
(c)
 
modify any of the provisions of this Section, Section 607 or Section 813 with respect to the Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, except to increase the percentages in principal amount referred to in this Section or such other Sections or to provide that other provisions of this Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security affected thereby; provided, however, that this clause shall not be deemed to require the consent of any Holder with respect to changes in the references to the Trustee and concomitant changes in this Section, or the deletion of this proviso, in accordance with the requirements of Sections 911(b), 914 and 1201(h).
 
A supplemental indenture which changes or eliminates any covenant or other provision of this Indenture which has expressly been included solely for the benefit of the Holders of, or which is to remain in effect only so long as there shall be Outstanding, Securities of one or more particular series, or one or more Tranches thereof, or which modifies the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series with respect to such covenant or other provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under this Indenture of the Holders of Securities of any other series or Tranche.
 
It shall not be necessary for any Act of Holders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such Act shall approve the substance thereof.  A waiver by a Holder of such Holders right to consent under this Section shall be deemed to be a consent of such Holder.
 
SECTION 1203.
 
Execution of Supplemental Indentures.
 
In executing, or accepting the additional trusts created by, any supplemental indenture permitted by this Article or the modifications thereby of the trusts created by this Indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 901) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture and such supplemental indenture will be enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to customary exceptions including exceptions with respect to laws relating to or affecting generally the enforcement of creditors rights, including, without limitation, bankruptcy and insolvency laws and to general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

Upon the acceptance thereof by the Trustee, any such supplemental Board Resolution, Officers Certificate or Company Order shall be deemed to be a supplemental indenture for purposes of Section 1204 and 1206.

(A)

(B)
 
an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that, as a result of a change in law occurring after the date of this certificate, the Holders of such Senior Notes, or portions of the principal amount thereof, will not recognize income, gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes as a result of the satisfaction and discharge of the Companys indebtedness in respect thereof and will be subject to United States federal income tax on the same amounts, at the same times and in the same manner as if such satisfaction and discharge had not been effected.
 
 
 
Limitation on Lien.
 
So long as any Senior Notes remain Outstanding, the Company will not secure any Debt with a lien on any shares of the capital stock or other equity interests (including partnership interests or membership interests in a limited liability company) of any of its Significant Subsidiaries, which shares of capital stock or other equity interests the Company directly or indirectly owns from the date of the Indenture or thereafter, unless the Company equally and ratably secures all Senior Notes (or secures all Senior Notes on a priority basis).  However, this restriction does not apply to or prevent:
 
(1)           (i) liens upon capital stock or other equity interests acquired after the date of the Indenture, directly or indirectly, by the Company to secure (A) the purchase price of such capital stock or other equity interests or (B) Debt incurred solely for the purpose of financing the acquisition of any such capital stock or other equity interests, (ii) liens existing on any such capital stock or other equity interests at the time of acquisition, and (iii) extensions, renewals or replacements of any of the foregoing, provided that in connection with clause (iii), the principal amount of Debt so secured shall be for the same or a lesser principal amount of the Debt secured by the lien and no such lien shall extend to or cover any capital stock or other equity interests other tha n the capital stock or other equity interests being acquired or to more than the same proportion of all shares of capital stock or other equity interests as was covered by the lien that was extended, renewed or replaced; or
 
(2)           attachment, judgment or other similar liens arising in connection with court proceedings, provided that the execution or other enforcement of such liens is effectively stayed and (i) the claims secured by the lien are being actively contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings or (ii) payment of the claims is covered in full (subject to customary deductible amounts) by insurance maintained with responsible insurance companies.
 
Liens on any shares of the capital stock or other equity interests (including partnership interests or membership interests in a limited liability company) of any of the Significant Subsidiaries, other than liens described in (1) and (2) above, are referred to herein as Restricted Liens.  The foregoing limitations do not apply to the extent that the Company creates any Restricted Liens to secure Debt that, together with all of the Companys other Debt secured by Restricted Liens, does not at the time exceed 5% of the Consolidated Net Worth of the Company, as determined by the Company as of a month end not more than 90 days prior to the creation of the Restricted Lien.
 
For purposes of this covenant, the following terms shall be defined as follows:
 
Consolidated Net Worth means the sum of the capital stock, excluding treasury stock and capital stock subscribed for and unissued, and surplus, including earned surplus, capital surplus and the balance of the current profit and loss account not transferred to surplus, accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries appearing on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its subsidiaries prepared as of the date of determination in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistent with those applied in the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements, after eliminating all intercompany transactions and all amounts properly attributable to minority interests, if any, in the stock or other equity interests and surplus of subsidiaries.

Significant Subsidiary means Entergy Arkansas, Inc., Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C., Entergy Louisiana, LLC, Entergy Mississippi, Inc., Entergy Texas, Inc., System Energy Resources, Inc., and any other Domestic Regulated Utility Subsidiary:  (1) the total assets (after intercompany eliminations) of which exceed 5% of total assets of the Company and the total assets of its subsidiaries or (2) the net worth of which exceeds 5% of the Consolidated Net Worth of the Company and its subsidiaries, in each case as shown on the most recent audited consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its subsidiaries.  In no event shall Significant Subsidiary include any Domestic Regulated Utility Subsidiary that as of June 30, 2010, (1) had total assets (after intercompany eliminations) which were 5 % or less of the Companys total assets and the total assets of the Companys subsidiaries at such date or (2) had a net worth which was 5% or less of the Consolidated Net Worth of the Company and its subsidiaries at such date.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have executed this Officers Certificate this 13th day of September, 2010.

EXHIBIT A
 
Unless this certificate is presented by an authorized representative of The Depository Trust Company, a New York corporation (DTC), to Entergy Corporation or its agent for registration of transfer, exchange, or payment, and any certificate issued is registered in the name of Cede & Co. or in such other name as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC (and any payment is made to Cede & Co. or to such other entity as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE, OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL inasmuch as the registered owner hereof, Cede & Co., has an interest herein.
 
 
 
 
Entergy Corporation, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (herein referred to as the Company, which term includes any successor Person under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to _____________________________________________________________________________ or registered assigns, the principal sum of _______________________ Dollars on September 15, 2015, and to pay interest on said principal sum semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year commencing March 15, 2011 (each an Interest Payment Date) at the rate of 3.625% per annum, or as may be adjusted from time to time pursuant to the terms hereof, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment and to pay interest on any overdue principal and, to the exten t permitted by law, interest, at the rate then borne by the Securities of this series.  Interest on the Securities of this series will accrue from, and include, September 16, 2010, to the first Interest Payment Date, and thereafter will accrue from the last Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for.  In the event that any Interest Payment Date is not a Business Day, then payment of interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of such delay) with the same force and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date.

By:                                                                
 
 
 
This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
Dated:
 
WELLS FARGO BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, as Trustee
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
General.
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the Securities), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture (For Unsecured Debt Securities), dated as of September 1, 2010 (herein, together with any amendments thereto, called the Indenture, which term shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Trustee (herein called the Trustee, which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), and reference is hereby made to the Indenture, including the Board Resolutions and Officers Certificate filed with the Trustee on September 13, 2010 creating the series designated on the face hereof, for a statement of the respective rights, limit ations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.
 
Interest Rate Adjustment.
The interest rate payable on this Security shall be subject to adjustments from time to time if either Moodys Investors Service Inc. (Moodys) or Standard & Poors Ratings Services (S&P) or, if either Moodys or S&P ceases to rate the Securities of this series or fails to make a rating of the Securities of this series publicly available for reasons outside of the Companys control, a nationally recognized statistical rating organization within the meaning of Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), selected by the Company as a replacement agency for Moodys or S&P (a substitute rating agency) downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) the credit rating assigned to th e Securities of this series, in the manner described below.
 
If the rating from Moodys (or any substitute rating agency thereof) of the Securities of this series is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate on this Security will increase such that it will equal the interest rate set forth on the face of this Security plus the percentage set forth opposite the ratings from the table below:
 
 
 
If the rating from S&P (or any substitute rating agency thereof) of the Securities of this series is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate on this Security will increase such that it will equal the interest rate set forth on the face of this Security plus the percentage set forth opposite the ratings from the table below:
 
 
 
If at any time the interest rate on this Security has been adjusted upward and either Moodys or S&P (or, in either case, a substitute rating agency thereof), as the case may be, subsequently increases its rating of the Securities of this series to any of the threshold ratings set forth above, the interest rate on this Security will be decreased such that the interest rate for this Security equals the interest rate set forth on the face of this Security plus the percentages set forth opposite the ratings from the tables above in effect immediately following the increase in rating.  If Moodys (or any substitute rating agency thereof) subsequently increases its rating of the Securities of this series to Baa3 (or its successor or its equivalent, in the case of a substitute rating agency) or higher, and S&P (or any substitute rating agency thereof) increases its rating to BBB- (or its successor or its equivalent, in the case of a substitute rating agency) or higher the interest rate on this Security will be decreased to the interest rate set forth on the face of this Security.  In addition, the interest rate on this Security will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment described above (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by either or both rating agencies) if the Securities of this series become rated A-3 and A- (or the successor to or the equivalent of either such rating, in the case of a substitute rating agency) or higher by Moodys and S&P (or, in either case, a substitute rating agency thereof), respectively (or one of these ratings if the Securities of this series are only rated by one rating agency).
 
Each adjustment required by any decrease or increase in a rating set forth above, whether occasioned by the action of Moodys or S&P (or, in either case, a substitute rating agency thereof), shall be made independent of any and all other adjustments.  In no event shall (1) the interest rate for this Security be reduced to below the interest rate set forth on the face of this Security or (2) the total increase in the interest rate on this Security exceed 2.00% above the interest rate set forth on the face of this Security.
 
No adjustments in the interest rate of the Securities of this series shall be made solely as a result of a rating agency ceasing to provide a rating of the Securities of this series.  If at any time fewer than two rating agencies provide a rating of the Securities of this series for a reason beyond the Companys control, the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a rating of the Securities of this series from a substitute rating agency, to the extent one exists, and if a substitute rating agency exists, for purposes of determining any increase or decrease in the interest rate on this Security pursuant to the tables above (a) such substitute rating agency will be substituted for the last rating agency to provide a rating of the Securities but which has since ceased to provide such rating, (b)&# 160;the relative rating scale used by such substitute rating agency to assign ratings to senior unsecured debt will be determined in good faith by the Company and, for purposes of determining the applicable ratings included in the applicable table above with respect to such substitute rating agency, such ratings will be deemed to be the equivalent ratings used by Moodys or S&P, as applicable, in such table and (c) the interest rate on this Security will increase or decrease, as the case may be, such that the interest rate equals the interest rate set forth on the face of this Security plus the appropriate percentage, if any, set forth opposite the rating from such substitute rating agency in the applicable table above (taking into account the provisions of clause (b) above) (plus any applicable percentage resulting from a decreased rating by the other rating agency).  Subject to the first sentence of the immediately succeeding paragraph, for so long as only one rating agency pr ovides a rating of the Securities of this series, any subsequent increase or decrease in the interest rate of the Securities of this series necessitated by a reduction or increase in the rating by the agency providing the rating shall be twice the percentage set forth in the applicable table above.  Subject to the first sentence of the immediately succeeding paragraph, for so long as none of Moodys, S&P or a substitute rating agency provides a rating of the Securities of this series, the interest rate on this Security will increase to, or remain at, as the case may be, 2.00% above the interest rate set forth on the face of this Security.
 
Any interest rate increase or decrease described above will take effect from the first day of the interest period commencing after the date on which a rating change occurs that requires an adjustment in the interest rate.  If Moodys or S&P (or, in either case, a substitute rating agency thereof) changes its rating of the Securities of this series more than once during any particular interest period, the last change by such agency will control for purposes of any interest rate increase or decrease with respect to the Securities of this series described above relating to such rating agencys action.
 
The Company shall give notice to the Trustee under the Indenture of any interest rate adjustment described above within thirty (30) Business Days of the occurrence of a rating change that requires an adjustment in the interest rate, and shall state in such notice the date that such interest rate increase or decrease shall take effect as described above.
 
If the interest rate payable on this Security is increased as described above the term interest, as used with respect to this Security, will be deemed to include any such additional interest unless the context otherwise requires.
 
Optional Redemption.
The Securities of this series will be redeemable at the option of the Company prior to the Stated Maturity (each a Redemption Date), in whole or in part, at any time on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice prior to the Redemption Date.  If the Company redeems all or any part of the Securities of this series, it will pay a Redemption Price (the Redemption Price) equal to the greater of
 
(1) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities of this series being redeemed, or
 
(2) as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal of and interest on the Securities of this series being redeemed (excluding the portion of any such interest accrued to the Redemption Date), discounted (for purposes of determining such present values) to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate plus 0.35%,
 
plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the Securities of this series being redeemed to the Redemption Date.
 
 Adjusted Treasury Rate means, with respect to any Redemption Date:
 
(1) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated H.15(519) or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption Treasury Constant Maturities, for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue (if no maturity is within three months before or after the remaining term of the Securities of this series, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue shall be determined and the Adjusted Treasury Rate shall be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month); or
 
(2) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date for the Adjusted Treasury Rate or does not contain such yields, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date.
 
The Adjusted Treasury Rate shall be calculated on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date.
 
Comparable Treasury Issue means the United States Treasury security selected by the Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Securities of this series that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Securities of this series.
 
Comparable Treasury Price means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (1) the average of five Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations or (2) if the Independent Investment Banker obtains fewer than five such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations.
 
Independent Investment Banker means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers that the Company appoints to act as the Independent Investment Banker from time to time or, if any of such firms are unwilling or unable to select the Comparable Treasury Issue, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company.
 
Reference Treasury Dealer means (l) Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, BNP Paribas Securities Corp., Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and RBS Securities Inc. and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a Primary Treasury Dealer), the Company will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer, and (2) any other Primary Treasury Dealer selected by the Independent Investment Banker after consultation with the Company.
 
Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker at 5:00 p.m. on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
 
The Company shall deliver to the Trustee before any Redemption Date for the Securities of this series its calculation of the Redemption Price applicable to such redemption.  The Trustee shall be under no duty to inquire into, may presume the correctness of, and shall be fully protected in acting upon the Companys calculation of any Redemption Price of the Securities of this series.
 
In lieu of stating the Redemption Price, notices of redemption of the Securities of this series shall state substantially the following:  The Redemption Price of the Securities of this series to be redeemed shall equal the sum of (a) the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of such Senior Notes, or (ii) as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal of and interest on the Senior Notes being redeemed (excluding the portion of any such interest accrued to the redemption date), discounted (for purposes of determining such present values) to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate plus 0.35%.
 
If less than all of the Securities of this series are to be redeemed consistent with the terms hereof, the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee from the Outstanding Securities of such series in a manner it deems fair and appropriate.
 
If at the time notice of redemption is given, the redemption moneys are not on deposit with the Trustee, then the redemption shall be subject to their receipt on or before the Redemption Date and such notice shall be of no effect unless such moneys are received.
 
Upon payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Redemption Date, interest will cease to accrue on the Securities of this series or portions thereof called for redemption.
 
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness of this Security upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture including the Officers Certificate described above.
 
Events of Default.
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.

The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all series then Outstanding to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture.  The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each series at th e time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences.  Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
 
As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all series at the time Outstanding in respect of which an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in co mpliance with such request, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of Securities of all series at the time Outstanding in respect of which an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity.  The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.

The foregoing limitations do not apply to the extent that the Company creates any Restricted Liens to secure Debt that, together with all of the Companys other Debt secured by Restricted Liens, does not at the time exceed 5% of the Consolidated Net Worth of the Company, as determined by the Company as of a month end not more than 90 days prior to the creation of the Restricted Lien.

This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
Dated:
 
WELLS FARGO BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, as Trustee
 
 
 
 
General.
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the Securities), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture (For Unsecured Debt Securities), dated as of September 1, 2010 (herein, together with any amendments thereto, called the Indenture, which term shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Trustee (herein called the Trustee, which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), and reference is hereby made to the Indenture, including the Board Resolutions and Officers Certificate filed with the Trustee on September 13, 2010 creating the series designated on the face hereof, for a statement of the respective rights, limit ations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.
 
Interest Rate Adjustment.
The interest rate payable on this Security shall be subject to adjustments from time to time if either Moodys Investors Service Inc. (Moodys) or Standard & Poors Ratings Services (S&P) or, if either Moodys or S&P ceases to rate the Securities of this series or fails to make a rating of the Securities of this series publicly available for reasons outside of the Companys control, a nationally recognized statistical rating organization within the meaning of Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), selected by the Company as a replacement agency for Moodys or S&P (a substitute rating agency) downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) the credit rating assigned to th e Securities of this series, in the manner described below.
 
If the rating from Moodys (or any substitute rating agency thereof) of the Securities of this series is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate on this Security will increase such that it will equal the interest rate set forth on the face of this Security plus the percentage set forth opposite the ratings from the table below:
 
 
If the rating from S&P (or any substitute rating agency thereof) of the Securities of this series is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate on this Security will increase such that it will equal the interest rate set forth on the face of this Security plus the percentage set forth opposite the ratings from the table below:
 
 
 
If at any time the interest rate on this Security has been adjusted upward and either Moodys or S&P (or, in either case, a substitute rating agency thereof), as the case may be, subsequently increases its rating of the Securities of this series to any of the threshold ratings set forth above, the interest rate on this Security will be decreased such that the interest rate for this Security equals the interest rate set forth on the face of this Security plus the percentages set forth opposite the ratings from the tables above in effect immediately following the increase in rating.  If Moodys (or any substitute rating agency thereof) subsequently increases its rating of the Securities of this series to Baa3 (or its successor or its equivalent, in the case of a substitute rating agency) or higher, and S&P (or any substitute rating agency thereof) increases its rating to BBB- (or its successor or its equivalent, in the case of a substitute rating agency) or higher the interest rate on this Security will be decreased to the interest rate set forth on the face of this Security.  In addition, the interest rate on this Security will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment described above (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by either or both rating agencies) if the Securities of this series become rated A-3 and A- (or the successor to or the equivalent of either such rating, in the case of a substitute rating agency) or higher by Moodys and S&P (or, in either case, a substitute rating agency thereof), respectively (or one of these ratings if the Securities of this series are only rated by one rating agency).
 
Each adjustment required by any decrease or increase in a rating set forth above, whether occasioned by the action of Moodys or S&P (or, in either case, a substitute rating agency thereof), shall be made independent of any and all other adjustments.  In no event shall (1) the interest rate for this Security be reduced to below the interest rate set forth on the face of this Security or (2) the total increase in the interest rate on this Security exceed 2.00% above the interest rate set forth on the face of this Security.
 
No adjustments in the interest rate of the Securities of this series shall be made solely as a result of a rating agency ceasing to provide a rating of the Securities of this series.  If at any time fewer than two rating agencies provide a rating of the Securities of this series for a reason beyond the Companys control, the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a rating of the Securities of this series from a substitute rating agency, to the extent one exists, and if a substitute rating agency exists, for purposes of determining any increase or decrease in the interest rate on this Security pursuant to the tables above (a) such substitute rating agency will be substituted for the last rating agency to provide a rating of the Securities but which has since ceased to provide such rating, (b)&# 160;the relative rating scale used by such substitute rating agency to assign ratings to senior unsecured debt will be determined in good faith by the Company and, for purposes of determining the applicable ratings included in the applicable table above with respect to such substitute rating agency, such ratings will be deemed to be the equivalent ratings used by Moodys or S&P, as applicable, in such table and (c) the interest rate on this Security will increase or decrease, as the case may be, such that the interest rate equals the interest rate set forth on the face of this Security plus the appropriate percentage, if any, set forth opposite the rating from such substitute rating agency in the applicable table above (taking into account the provisions of clause (b) above) (plus any applicable percentage resulting from a decreased rating by the other rating agency).  Subject to the first sentence of the immediately succeeding paragraph, for so long as only one rating agency pr ovides a rating of the Securities of this series, any subsequent increase or decrease in the interest rate of the Securities of this series necessitated by a reduction or increase in the rating by the agency providing the rating shall be twice the percentage set forth in the applicable table above.  Subject to the first sentence of the immediately succeeding paragraph, for so long as none of Moodys, S&P or a substitute rating agency provides a rating of the Securities of this series, the interest rate on this Security will increase to, or remain at, as the case may be, 2.00% above the interest rate set forth on the face of this Security.
 
Any interest rate increase or decrease described above will take effect from the first day of the interest period commencing after the date on which a rating change occurs that requires an adjustment in the interest rate.  If Moodys or S&P (or, in either case, a substitute rating agency thereof) changes its rating of the Securities of this series more than once during any particular interest period, the last change by such agency will control for purposes of any interest rate increase or decrease with respect to the Securities of this series described above relating to such rating agencys action.
 
The Company shall give notice to the Trustee under the Indenture of any interest rate adjustment described above within thirty (30) Business Days of the occurrence of a rating change that requires an adjustment in the interest rate, and shall state in such notice the date that such interest rate increase or decrease shall take effect as described above.
 
If the interest rate payable on this Security is increased as described above the term interest, as used with respect to this Security, will be deemed to include any such additional interest unless the context otherwise requires.
 
Optional Redemption.
At any time prior to June 15, 2020 (three months prior to the Stated Maturity), the Securities of this series will be redeemable at the option of the Company (each a Redemption Date), in whole or in part, on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice prior to the Redemption Date.  If the Company redeems all or any part of the Securities of this series, it will pay a Redemption Price (the Redemption Price) equal to the greater of
 
(1) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities of this series being redeemed, or
 
(2) as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal of and interest on the Securities of this series being redeemed (excluding the portion of any such interest accrued to the Redemption Date), discounted (for purposes of determining such present values) to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate plus 0.40%,
 
plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the Securities of this series being redeemed to the Redemption Date.
 
At any time on or after June 15, 2020, the Securities of this series will be redeemable at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice prior to the Redemption Date, at the Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Securities of this series to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date.
 
Adjusted Treasury Rate means, with respect to any Redemption Date:
 
(1) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated H.15(519) or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption Treasury Constant Maturities, for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue (if no maturity is within three months before or after the remaining term of the Securities of this series, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue shall be determined and the Adjusted Treasury Rate shall be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month); or
 
(2) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date for the Adjusted Treasury Rate or does not contain such yields, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date.
 
The Adjusted Treasury Rate shall be calculated on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date.
 
Comparable Treasury Issue means the United States Treasury security selected by the Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Securities of this series that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Securities of this series.
 
Comparable Treasury Price means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (1) the average of five Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations or (2) if the Independent Investment Banker obtains fewer than five such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations.
 
Independent Investment Banker means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers that the Company appoints to act as the Independent Investment Banker from time to time or, if any of such firms are unwilling or unable to select the Comparable Treasury Issue, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company.
 
Reference Treasury Dealer means (l) Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, BNP Paribas Securities Corp., Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and RBS Securities Inc. and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a Primary Treasury Dealer), the Company will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer, and (2) any other Primary Treasury Dealer selected by the Independent Investment Banker after consultation with the Company.
 
Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker at 5:00 p.m. on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
 
The Company shall deliver to the Trustee before any Redemption Date for the Securities of this series its calculation of the Redemption Price applicable to such redemption.  The Trustee shall be under no duty to inquire into, may presume the correctness of, and shall be fully protected in acting upon the Companys calculation of any Redemption Price of the Securities of this series.
 
In lieu of stating the Redemption Price, notices of redemption of the Securities of this series shall state substantially the following:  The Redemption Price of the Securities of this series to be redeemed shall equal the sum of (a) the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of such Senior Notes, or (ii) as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal of and interest on the Senior Notes being redeemed (excluding the portion of any such interest accrued to the redemption date), discounted (for purposes of determining such present values) to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate plus 0.40%.
 
If less than all of the Securities of this series are to be redeemed consistent with the terms hereof, the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee from the Outstanding Securities of such series in a manner it deems fair and appropriate.
 
If at the time notice of redemption is given, the redemption moneys are not on deposit with the Trustee, then the redemption shall be subject to their receipt on or before the Redemption Date and such notice shall be of no effect unless such moneys are received.
 
Upon payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Redemption Date, interest will cease to accrue on the Securities of this series or portions thereof called for redemption.
 
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness of this Security upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture including the Officers Certificate described above.
