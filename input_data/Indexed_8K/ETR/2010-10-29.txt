October 29, 2010
Exhibit 99.2
NEW ORLEANS  Entergy Corporation today issued 2011 earnings guidance and outlined its preliminary three-year capital expenditure plan for the period 2011 through 2013.  In addition, Entergy provided an update to its long-term financial outlook.
Since April, weve identified additional sound, value-added utility investments that improve reliability, lower costs, or are necessary to meet expected additional regulatory standards and enhance the utilitys long-term financial outlook, said .  The abundance of natural gas has severely affected power prices at Entergy Wholesale Commodities and is not expected to significantly turn around in the short term. Nonetheless, our proprietary point of view and risk management practices assure that we retain the flexibility to execute on our balanced capital return and investment program.
J. Wayne Leonard, Entergys chairman and chief executive officer
As a result, the Entergy board of directors granted authority for an additional $500 million share repurchase program.  Execution of this incremental, on-the-shelf share repurchase capacity will occur when market conditions are favorable and our point of view and risk management metrics align.  Entergy expects to complete its current $750 million share repurchase program by year end.
Members of Entergys senior management, including Leonard and Leo Denault, executive vice president and chief financial officer, will attend the 45th Edison Electric Institute (EEI) Financial Conference and hold stakeholder meetings on October 31 through November 2, 2010, and take questions on the information included in this release and accompanying handout material.

Earnings Guidance
Entergy is initiating 2011 earnings guidance in the range of $6.35 to $6.85 per share on both as-reported and operational bases.  Year-over-year changes are shown as point estimates and are applied to an adjusted 2010 starting point to compute the 2011 guidance midpoint.  While Entergy affirmed its 2010 earnings guidance ranges of $5.95 to $6.80 per share on an as-reported basis and $6.40 to $7.20 per share on an operational basis, the starting point for 2010 was adjusted consistent with current indications that full year results will be above the midpoint.  As-reported earnings guidance for 2010 includes a special item, estimated in April 2010 at $0.40 to $0.45 per share, for the potential charge in connection with the previously announced business unwind of the internal organizations created for Enexu s Energy Corporation and EquaGen LLC as well as expenses for spin-off dis-synergies and outside services to pursue the spin-off.  Drivers for the 2011 guidance range are listed separately.  Because there is a range of possible outcomes associated with each earnings driver, a range is applied to the guidance midpoint to produce Entergys guidance range.  Revised business segments reflect the internal reorganization announced earlier this year combining all non-utility generation into Entergy Wholesale Commodities, or EWC.  Entergys 2011 earnings guidance is detailed in below.
