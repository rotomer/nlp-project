Entergy Corporation
639 Loyola Avenue
New Orleans, LA 70113
Exhibit 99.1
News
Release
 
 
 
 
 
New Orleans, La.  Entergy Corporation (NYSE: ETR) today indicated that it expects second quarter 2011 as-reported and operational earnings of approximately $1.75 per share. Results for second quarter 2010 were $1.65 per share on an as-reported basis and $1.71 per share on an operational basis. Entergy also affirmed its previously issued earnings guidance for 2011.
 
As-reported results are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and are comprised of operational earnings (described below) and special items. The special items, reflected in second quarter 2010 as-reported results for Entergy Wholesale Commodities and Parent & Other, were associated with the previously planned spin-off of the non-utility nuclear business.
 
The second quarter 2011 earnings improvement was due to higher earnings at Utility and Parent & Other, partially offset by lower results at Entergy Wholesale Commodities. Second quarter 2011 earnings also reflect accretion from Entergys share repurchase programs.
The increase in Utility second quarter 2011 earnings was driven by higher sales volume and pricing adjustments from previous rate actions, as well as lower interest expense. Utility sales volume growth reflected a favorable quarter-over-quarter weather variance and continued strength in the industrial sector. Well above-normal temperatures were recorded throughout the service territory in the current quarter.
 
The quarter-over-quarter decrease in earnings at Entergy Wholesale Commodities was driven by lower net revenue. Lower pricing on its nuclear fleet was the primary factor in net revenue. Also contributing to the lower results was a higher effective income tax rate arising out of a Michigan state tax law change.
 
Parent & Others results improved for the quarter due primarily to lower income tax expense on Parent & Other activities arising out of a reversal of a tax reserve as a result of an IRS settlement.
 
Entergy affirmed previously issued as-reported and operational earnings guidance for 2011 to be in the range of $6.35 to $6.85 per share.

In this news release, and from time to time, Entergy Corporation makes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Except to the extent required by the federal securities laws, Entergy undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
Forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties. There are factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, including (a) those factors discussed in: (i) Entergys Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010; (ii) Entergys Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2011; and (iii) Entergys other reports and filings made under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; (b) uncertainties associated with rate proceedings, formula rate plans and other cost recovery mechanisms; (c) uncertainties associated with efforts to remediate the effects of major storms and recover related restoration costs; (d) nuclear plant relicensing, operating and regulatory risks, including any changes resulting from the nuclear crisis in Japan following its catastrophic earthquake and tsunami; (e)

Exhibit 99.2
 
Exhibit 99.1 to this Report on Form 8-K (the "Pre-Release") contains the non-GAAP financial measure of operational earnings per share.  Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, Entergy has provided quantitative reconciliations within the Pre-Release of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
 
Operational earnings per share is not calculated in accordance with GAAP because it excludes the impact of "special items".  Special items reflect the impact on earnings of events that are less routine, are related to prior periods, or are related to discontinued businesses.  Management believes the discussion of operational earnings provides useful information in evaluating the ongoing results of Entergy's businesses and assists in comparing the company's operating performance to the operating performance of others in the energy sector.
 
The non-GAAP information in the Pre-Release is used in addition to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP.  The non-GAAP information should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures.  The non-GAAP information reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business.  Investors are strongly encouraged to review our consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure.  Non-GAAP information is not standardized; therefore, it may not be possible to compare this information with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names.
