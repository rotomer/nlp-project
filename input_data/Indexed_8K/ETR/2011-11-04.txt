INVESTOR NEWS
 
 
November 4, 2011
NEW ORLEANS  Entergy Corporation today issued 2012 earnings guidance and outlined its preliminary three-year capital expenditure plan for the period 2012 through 2014. In addition, Entergy affirmed its long-term financial outlook.
The Utility continues to work toward its long-term outlook of a 6 to 8 percent compound annual net income growth rate over the 2010  2014 horizon, said .  Several portfolio transformation projects are in progress, including two power plant acquisitions and the Ninemile new build project. Efforts for the operating companies to join the Midwest Independent System Operator regional transmission organization, which will provide significant savings for our Utility customers, will be a key area of focus over the short term. Our Entergy Wholesale Commodities segment continues to be affected by depressed gas and power prices. Work to preserve the value of that business is ongoing through operational excellence and license renewal efforts as well as continuously enhancing opportunities to capture additional value in that business, such as the planned acquisition of the Rhode Island State Energy Center power plant.
J. Wayne Leonard, Entergys chairman and chief executive officer
Members of Entergys senior management, including Leonard and Leo Denault, executive vice president and chief financial officer, will attend the 46 Edison Electric Institute (EEI) Financial Conference, hold stakeholder meetings on November 7 through November 8, 2011, and take questions on the information included in this release and accompanying handout material. This release and the handout material can also be accessed via Entergys website at .

Earnings Guidance
Entergy is initiating 2012 earnings guidance in the range of $5.40 to $6.20 per share on both as-reported and operational bases. Year-over-year changes are shown as point estimates and are applied to an adjusted 2011 starting point to compute the 2012 guidance midpoint. While Entergy affirms its updated 2011 earnings guidance range of $7.15 to $7.65 per share on as-reported and operational bases, the 2011 starting point by business segment was adjusted consistent with current indications. Drivers for the 2012 guidance range are listed separately. Because there is a range of possible outcomes associated with each earnings driver, a range is applied to the guidance midpoint to produce Entergys guidance range. Entergys 2012 earnings guidance is detailed in Table 1 below.
 
 
 
Key assumptions supporting 2012 earnings guidance are as follows:
Utility
 
 
 
Entergy Wholesale Commodities
Parent & Other
Share Repurchase Program
Other
Earnings guidance for 2012 should be considered in association with earnings sensitivities as shown in Table 2.  These sensitivities illustrate the estimated change in operational earnings resulting from changes in various revenue and expense drivers. Traditionally, the most significant variables for earnings drivers are utility sales for Utility and energy prices for Entergy Wholesale Commodities. The broader earnings guidance range for 2012 also takes into consideration the following:
 
 
 
Estimated annual impacts shown in Table 2 are intended to be indicative rather than precise guidance.
Overarching Financial Aspiration
Entergy continues to aspire to deliver superior value to owners as measured by total shareholder return. The company believes top-quartile total shareholder return is achieved by:
Long-term Financial Outlook
Entergy believes it offers a long-term, competitive utility investment opportunity combined with a valuable option represented by a unique, clean, non-utility generation business located in attractive power markets. Table 3 summarizes the current long-term financial outlook for 2010 through 2014.
 
 
 
The long-term financial outlook should be considered in association with 2014 financial sensitivities as shown in Table 4. These sensitivities illustrate the estimated change in earnings or adjusted EBITDA resulting from changes in business drivers. Estimated impacts shown in Table 4 are intended to be illustrative.
 
 
 
Planned Capital Expenditures
 Preliminary
The preliminary capital plan for 2012 through 2014 anticipates $7.1 billion for investment, including $3.2 billion of maintenance capital, as shown in Figure 1. The remaining $3.9 billion is for specific investments and other initiatives such as:
