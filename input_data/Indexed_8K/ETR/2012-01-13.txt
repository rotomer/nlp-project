McNeal, the Vice President and Treasurer of Entergy Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the Company), pursuant to the authority granted in the Board Resolutions of the Company dated August 27, 2010 and December 2, 2011, and Sections 102, 201 and 301 of the Indenture defined herein, does hereby certify to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the Trustee) under the Indenture (For Unsecured Debt Securities) of the Company dated as of September 1, 2010 (the Indenture) that:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(A)
 
an instrument wherein the Company, notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of its indebtedness in respect of the Senior Notes, shall assume the obligation (which shall be absolute and unconditional) to irrevocably deposit with the Trustee or Paying Agent such additional sums of money, if any, or additional Eligible Obligations (meeting the requirements of Section 701), if any, or any combination thereof, at such time or times, as shall be necessary, together with the money and/or Eligible Obligations theretofore so deposited, to pay when due the principal of and premium, if any, and interest due and to become due on such Senior Notes or portions thereof, all in accordance with and subject to the provisions of said Section 701; provided, however, that such instrument may state that the obligation of the Company to make additional deposits as aforesaid shall be subject to the delivery to the Company by the Trustee of a notice asserting the deficiency accompanied by an opinion of an independent public accountant of nationally recognized standing, selected by the Trustee, showing the calculation thereof; or
 
(B)
 
an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that, as a result of a change in law occurring after the date of this certificate, the Holders of such Senior Notes, or portions of the principal amount thereof, will not recognize income, gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes as a result of the satisfaction and discharge of the Companys indebtedness in respect thereof and will be subject to United States federal income tax on the same amounts, at the same times and in the same manner as if such satisfaction and discharge had not been effected.
 
 
 
Limitation on Lien.
 
So long as any Senior Notes remain Outstanding, the Company will not secure any Debt with a lien on any shares of the capital stock or other equity interests (including partnership interests or membership interests in a limited liability company) of any of its Significant Subsidiaries, which shares of capital stock or other equity interests the Company directly or indirectly owns from the date of the Indenture or thereafter, unless the Company equally and ratably secures all Senior Notes (or secures all Senior Notes on a priority basis).  However, this restriction does not apply to or prevent:
 
(1)           (i) liens upon capital stock or other equity interests acquired after the date of the Indenture, directly or indirectly, by the Company to secure (A) the purchase price of such capital stock or other equity interests or (B) Debt incurred solely for the purpose of financing the acquisition of any such capital stock or other equity interests, (ii) liens existing on any such capital stock or other equity interests at the time of acquisition, and (iii) extensions, renewals or replacements of any of the foregoing, provided that in connection with clause (iii), the principal amount of Debt so secured shall be for the same or a lesser principal amount of the Debt secured by the lien and no such lien shall extend to or cover any capital stock or other equity interests other than the capital stock or other equity interests being acquired or to more than the same proportion of all shares of capital stock or other equity interests as was covered by the lien that was extended, renewed or replaced; or
 
(2)           attachment, judgment or other similar liens arising in connection with court proceedings, provided that the execution or other enforcement of such liens is effectively stayed and (i) the claims secured by the lien are being actively contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings or (ii) payment of the claims is covered in full (subject to customary deductible amounts) by insurance maintained with responsible insurance companies.
 
Liens on any shares of the capital stock or other equity interests (including partnership interests or membership interests in a limited liability company) of any of the Significant Subsidiaries, other than liens described in (1) and (2) above, are referred to herein as Restricted Liens.  The foregoing limitations do not apply to the extent that the Company creates any Restricted Liens to secure Debt that, together with all of the Companys other Debt secured by Restricted Liens, does not at the time exceed 5% of the Consolidated Net Worth of the Company, as determined by the Company as of a month end not more than 90 days prior to the creation of the Restricted Lien.
 
For purposes of this covenant, the following terms shall be defined as follows:
 
Consolidated Net Worth means the sum of the capital stock, excluding treasury stock and capital stock subscribed for and unissued, and surplus, including earned surplus, capital surplus and the balance of the current profit and loss account not transferred to surplus, accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries appearing on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its subsidiaries prepared as of the date of determination in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistent with those applied in the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements, after eliminating all intercompany transactions and all amounts properly attributable to minority interests, if any, in the stock or other equity interests and surplus of subsidiaries.
 
Debt, with respect to any Person, means (without duplication) all liabilities, obligations and indebtedness, contingent or otherwise, of such Person:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Domestic Regulated Utility Subsidiary means a direct or indirect domestic subsidiary of the Company engaged in the generation, transmission or distribution of electricity or the transmission or distribution of natural gas that is regulated as to rates by the FERC (or successor federal agency) or a state or local governmental body on a cost-of-service basis.
 
lien means, with respect to any asset, any mortgage, lien, pledge or security interest of any kind in respect of such asset.
 
Significant Subsidiary means Entergy Arkansas, Inc., Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C., Entergy Louisiana, LLC, Entergy Mississippi, Inc., Entergy Texas, Inc., System Energy Resources, Inc., and any other Domestic Regulated Utility Subsidiary:  (1) the total assets (after intercompany eliminations) of which exceed 5% of total assets of the Company and the total assets of its subsidiaries or (2) the net worth of which exceeds 5% of the Consolidated Net Worth of the Company and its subsidiaries, in each case as shown on the most recent audited consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its subsidiaries.  In no event shall Significant Subsidiary include any Domestic Regulated Utility Subsidiary that as of September 30, 2011, (1) had total assets (after intercompany eliminations) which were 5% or less of the Companys total assets and the total assets of the Companys subsidiaries at such date or (2) had a net worth which was 5% or less of the Consolidated Net Worth of the Company and its subsidiaries at such date.
 
subsidiary means any corporation more than 50% of the outstanding voting stock of which is owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company or by one or more other subsidiaries, or by the Company and one or more other subsidiaries.  For the purposes of this definition, voting stock means stock or other interests (including partnership or limited liability company interests) that ordinarily has voting power for the election of directors, managers or trustees, whether at all times or only so long as no senior class of stock or other interests has such voting power by reason of any contingency.
 
 
 
 
(b)
 
The statements contained in this certificate are based upon the familiarity of the undersigned with the Indenture, the documents accompanying this certificate, and upon discussions by the undersigned with officers and employees of the Company familiar with the matters set forth herein;

EXHIBIT A
 
Unless this certificate is presented by an authorized representative of The Depository Trust Company, a New York corporation (DTC), to Entergy Corporation or its agent for registration of transfer, exchange, or payment, and any certificate issued is registered in the name of Cede & Co. or in such other name as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC (and any payment is made to Cede & Co. or to such other entity as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE, OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL inasmuch as the registered owner hereof, Cede & Co., has an interest herein.
 
 
 
 
Entergy Corporation, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (herein referred to as the Company, which term includes any successor Person under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to _____________________________________________________________________________ or registered assigns, the principal sum of _______________________ Dollars on January 15, 2017, and to pay interest on said principal sum semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year commencing July 15, 2012 (each an Interest Payment Date) at the rate of 4.70% per annum, or as may be adjusted from time to time pursuant to the terms hereof, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment and to pay interest on any overdue principal and, to the extent permitted by law, interest, at the rate then borne by the Securities of this series.  Interest on the Securities of this series will accrue from, and include, January 13, 2012, to the first Interest Payment Date, and thereafter will accrue from the last Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for.  In the event that any Interest Payment Date is not a Business Day, then payment of interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of such delay) with the same force and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date.  The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be the close of business on (i) the Business Day next preceding such Interest Payment Date so long as the Securities are held by a securities depository in book-entry form, or (ii) if the Securities are not held by a securities depository in book-entry form, the 15th calendar day next preceding such Interest Payment Date, provided, however, that interest payable at Maturity will be paid to the Person to whom principal is paid.  Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Securities of this series not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities of this series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture and on the reverse hereof.
 
Payment of the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on this Security will be made upon presentation at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in The City of New York, the State of New York in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts, provided, however, that, at the option of the Company, the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on this Security may be paid by check mailed to the address of the person entitled thereto, as such address shall appear on the Security Register or by wire transfer to an account designated by the person entitled thereto; and provided, further, that, after payment in full of this Security the Holder shall promptly surrender this Security at the office or agency of the Company in The City of New York, the State of New York.
 
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.  Any capitalized term which is used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in the Indenture.
 
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed.
 
ENTERGY CORPORATION
 
 
By:  ______________________________________________
 
 
 
This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
Dated:
 
WELLS FARGO BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, as Trustee
 
By:  ______________________________________________
          Authorized Signatory
 
 
 
 
 
 
General.
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the Securities), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture (For Unsecured Debt Securities), dated as of September 1, 2010 (herein, together with any amendments thereto, called the Indenture, which term shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Trustee (herein called the Trustee, which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), and reference is hereby made to the Indenture, including the Board Resolutions and Officers Certificate filed with the Trustee on January 13, 2012 creating the series designated on the face hereof, for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.
 
Interest Rate Adjustment.
The interest rate payable on this Security shall be subject to adjustments from time to time if either Moodys Investors Service Inc. (Moodys) or Standard & Poors Ratings Services (S&P) or, if either Moodys or S&P ceases to rate the Securities of this series or fails to make a rating of the Securities of this series publicly available for reasons outside of the Companys control, a nationally recognized statistical rating organization within the meaning of Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), selected by the Company as a replacement agency for Moodys or S&P (a substitute rating agency) downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) the credit rating assigned to the Securities of this series, in the manner described below.
 
If the rating from Moodys (or any substitute rating agency thereof) of the Securities of this series is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate on this Security will increase such that it will equal the interest rate set forth on the face of this Security plus the percentage set forth opposite the ratings from the table below:
 
 
 
If the rating from S&P (or any substitute rating agency thereof) of the Securities of this series is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate on this Security will increase such that it will equal the interest rate set forth on the face of this Security plus the percentage set forth opposite the ratings from the table below:
 
 
 
 
 
If at any time the interest rate on this Security has been adjusted upward and either Moodys or S&P (or, in either case, a substitute rating agency thereof), as the case may be, subsequently increases its rating of the Securities of this series to any of the threshold ratings set forth above, the interest rate on this Security will be decreased such that the interest rate for this Security equals the interest rate set forth on the face of this Security plus the percentages set forth opposite the ratings from the tables above in effect immediately following the increase in rating.  If Moodys (or any substitute rating agency thereof) subsequently increases its rating of the Securities of this series to Baa3 (or its successor or its equivalent, in the case of a substitute rating agency) or higher, and S&P (or any substitute rating agency thereof) increases its rating to BBB- (or its successor or its equivalent, in the case of a substitute rating agency) or higher the interest rate on this Security will be decreased to the interest rate set forth on the face of this Security.  In addition, the interest rate on this Security will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment described above (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by either or both rating agencies) if the Securities of this series become rated A-3 and A- (or the successor to or the equivalent of either such rating, in the case of a substitute rating agency) or higher by Moodys and S&P (or, in either case, a substitute rating agency thereof), respectively (or one of these ratings if the Securities of this series are only rated by one rating agency).
 
Each adjustment required by any decrease or increase in a rating set forth above, whether occasioned by the action of Moodys or S&P (or, in either case, a substitute rating agency thereof), shall be made independent of any and all other adjustments.  In no event shall (1) the interest rate for this Security be reduced to below the interest rate set forth on the face of this Security or (2) the total increase in the interest rate on this Security exceed 2.00% above the interest rate set forth on the face of this Security.
 
No adjustments in the interest rate of the Securities of this series shall be made solely as a result of a rating agency ceasing to provide a rating of the Securities of this series.  If at any time fewer than two rating agencies provide a rating of the Securities of this series for a reason beyond the Companys control, the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a rating of the Securities of this series from a substitute rating agency, to the extent one exists, and if a substitute rating agency exists, for purposes of determining any increase or decrease in the interest rate on this Security pursuant to the tables above (a) such substitute rating agency will be substituted for the last rating agency to provide a rating of the Securities but which has since ceased to provide such rating, (b) the relative rating scale used by such substitute rating agency to assign ratings to senior unsecured debt will be determined in good faith by the Company and, for purposes of determining the applicable ratings included in the applicable table above with respect to such substitute rating agency, such ratings will be deemed to be the equivalent ratings used by Moodys or S&P, as applicable, in such table and (c) the interest rate on this Security will increase or decrease, as the case may be, such that the interest rate equals the interest rate set forth on the face of this Security plus the appropriate percentage, if any, set forth opposite the rating from such substitute rating agency in the applicable table above (taking into account the provisions of clause (b) above) (plus any applicable percentage resulting from a decreased rating by the other rating agency).  Subject to the first sentence of the immediately succeeding paragraph, for so long as only one rating agency provides a rating of the Securities of this series, any subsequent increase or decrease in the interest rate of the Securities of this series necessitated by a reduction or increase in the rating by the agency providing the rating shall be twice the percentage set forth in the applicable table above.  Subject to the first sentence of the immediately succeeding paragraph, for so long as none of Moodys, S&P or a substitute rating agency provides a rating of the Securities of this series, the interest rate on this Security will increase to, or remain at, as the case may be, 2.00% above the interest rate set forth on the face of this Security.
 
Any interest rate increase or decrease described above will take effect from the first day of the interest period commencing after the date on which a rating change occurs that requires an adjustment in the interest rate.  If Moodys or S&P (or, in either case, a substitute rating agency thereof) changes its rating of the Securities of this series more than once during any particular interest period, the last change by such agency will control for purposes of any interest rate increase or decrease with respect to the Securities of this series described above relating to such rating agencys action.
 
The Company shall give notice to the Trustee under the Indenture of any interest rate adjustment described above within thirty (30) Business Days of the occurrence of a rating change that requires an adjustment in the interest rate, and shall state in such notice the date that such interest rate increase or decrease shall take effect as described above.
 
If the interest rate payable on this Security is increased as described above the term interest, as used with respect to this Security, will be deemed to include any such additional interest unless the context otherwise requires.
 
Optional Redemption.
At any time prior to December 15, 2016 (one month prior to the Stated Maturity), the Securities of this series will be redeemable at the option of the Company prior to the Stated Maturity (each a Redemption Date), in whole or in part, at any time on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice prior to the Redemption Date.  If the Company redeems all or any part of the Securities of this series, it will pay a Redemption Price (the Redemption Price) equal to the greater of
 
(1) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities of this series being redeemed, or
 
(2) as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal of and interest on the Securities of this series being redeemed (excluding the portion of any such interest accrued to the Redemption Date), discounted (for purposes of determining such present values) to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate plus 0.50%,
 
plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the Securities of this series being redeemed to the Redemption Date.
 
At any time on or after December 15, 2016, the Securities of this series will be redeemable at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice prior to the Redemption Date, at the Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Securities of this series to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date.
 
 Adjusted Treasury Rate means, with respect to any Redemption Date:
 
(1) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated H.15(519) or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption Treasury Constant Maturities, for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue (if no maturity is within three months before or after the remaining term of the Securities of this series, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue shall be determined and the Adjusted Treasury Rate shall be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month); or
 
(2) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date for the Adjusted Treasury Rate or does not contain such yields, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date.
 
The Adjusted Treasury Rate shall be calculated on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date.
 
Comparable Treasury Issue means the United States Treasury security selected by the Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Securities of this series that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Securities of this series.
 
Comparable Treasury Price means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (1) the average of five Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations or (2) if the Independent Investment Banker obtains fewer than five such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations.
 
Independent Investment Banker means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers that the Company appoints to act as the Independent Investment Banker from time to time or, if any of such firms are unwilling or unable to select the Comparable Treasury Issue, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company.
 
Reference Treasury Dealer means (l) Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Barclays Capital Inc., BNP Paribas Securities Corp. and Goldman, Sachs & Co. and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a Primary Treasury Dealer), the Company will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer, and (2) any other Primary Treasury Dealer selected by the Independent Investment Banker after consultation with the Company.
 
Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker at 5:00 p.m. on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
 
The Company shall deliver to the Trustee before any Redemption Date for the Securities of this series its calculation of the Redemption Price applicable to such redemption.  The Trustee shall be under no duty to inquire into, may presume the correctness of, and shall be fully protected in acting upon the Companys calculation of any Redemption Price of the Securities of this series.
 
In lieu of stating the Redemption Price, notices of redemption of the Securities of this series shall state substantially the following:  The Redemption Price of the Securities of this series to be redeemed shall equal the sum of (a) the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of such Senior Notes, or (ii) as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal of and interest on the Senior Notes being redeemed (excluding the portion of any such interest accrued to the redemption date), discounted (for purposes of determining such present values) to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate plus 0.50%.
 
If less than all of the Securities of this series are to be redeemed consistent with the terms hereof, the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee from the Outstanding Securities of such series in a manner it deems fair and appropriate.
 
If at the time notice of redemption is given, the redemption moneys are not on deposit with the Trustee, then the redemption shall be subject to their receipt on or before the Redemption Date and such notice shall be of no effect unless such moneys are received.
 
Upon payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Redemption Date, interest will cease to accrue on the Securities of this series or portions thereof called for redemption.
 
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness of this Security upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture including the Officers Certificate described above.
 
Events of Default.
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
 
Governing Law.
This Security shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York (including without limitation Section 5-1401 of the New York General Obligations Law or any successor statute), except to the extent that the law of any other jurisdiction shall be mandatorily applicable.

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of all series to be affected.  The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all series then Outstanding to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture.  The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences.  Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
 
As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all series at the time Outstanding in respect of which an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of Securities of all series at the time Outstanding in respect of which an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity.  The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
 
Authorized Denominations.

We have acted as counsel for Entergy Corporation (the Company) in connection with the Registration Statement on Form S-3, as amended (Registration Statement No. 333-169315) (the Registration Statement), relating to $500,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of the Companys 4.70% Senior Notes due January 15, 2017 (the Notes).  The Notes have been issued pursuant to the Companys Indenture, dated as of September 1, 2010, with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the Trustee) (the Indenture, as heretofore supplemented, including by the officers certificate establishing the terms of the Notes, being hereinafter referred to as the Indenture).
In our capacity as such counsel, we have examined the Registration Statement and the Indenture which has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  As to questions of fact material to the opinions expressed herein, we have relied upon representations and certifications of the officers of the Company and appropriate public officials without independent verification of such matters except as otherwise described herein.  We have also examined or have caused to be examined such other documents and have satisfied ourselves as to such other matters as we have deemed necessary in order to render this opinion.  In such examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of all natural persons, the authenticity of the documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity with the originals of all documents submitted to us as originals of the documents submitted to us as certified, facsimile or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of all documents submitted to us as copies.  We have not examined the Notes, except a specimen thereof, and we have relied upon a certificate of the Trustee as to the authentication and delivery thereof.
Subject to the foregoing and the further exceptions and qualifications set forth below, we are of the opinion that the Notes are legally valid and are binding obligations of the Company.
This opinion is limited to the laws of the State of New York, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the federal laws of the United States of America.
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as Exhibit 5.01 to the Registration Statement. We also consent to the reference to us in the prospectus included in the Registration Statement under the caption Legality. In giving the foregoing consent, we do not admit that we are within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
 
 
Very truly yours,
