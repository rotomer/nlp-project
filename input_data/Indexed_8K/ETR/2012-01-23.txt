Exhibit 99.1
News
Release
 
 
 
                
New Orleans, La.  Entergy Corporation (NYSE: ETR) today indicated that it expects fourth quarter 2011 as-reported earnings of approximately $0.86 per share and operational earnings of approximately $0.93 per share. Results for fourth quarter 2010 were $1.26 per share on an as-reported basis and $1.30 per share on an operational basis. Entergy also affirmed its previously issued operational earnings guidance for 2012.
 
As-reported results are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and are comprised of operational earnings (described below) and special items. Special items were reflected in both periods arising out of the following:

The decrease in fourth quarter 2011 earnings was driven by lower results at Parent & Other, which was partially offset by higher earnings at Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. As indicated below, income tax is cited as a quarter-over-quarter variance explanation in each of the disclosure segments. On an overall company basis, the effective income tax rate in the fourth quarter 2011 exceeded the prior year period.
 
Parent & Others operational results were lower for the quarter due primarily to an increase in income tax expense.
 
The increase in Utility fourth quarter 2011 earnings was driven by a decrease in income tax expense. Utility net revenue was not a significant driver quarter-over-quarter, with a negative weather effect essentially offsetting other price and volume variances. Weather was mild in the current quarter compared to cooler-than-normal weather last year.
 
The quarter-over-quarter increase in operational earnings at Entergy Wholesale Commodities was driven by a lower effective income tax rate. Also contributing to the higher results was a reduction in the decommissioning liability to reflect an updated decommissioning study finalized in the fourth quarter of 2011. Partially offsetting these positive items was the absence of a gain on a sale of a plant sold in December 2010 and lower net revenue. EWCs net revenue declined due primarily to lower pricing associated with the nuclear fleet. Providing a partial offset in net revenue was an increase in nuclear generation due to fewer planned and unplanned outages. The Vermont Yankee nuclear plant had 25 refueling days in the current quarter compared to 43 refueling days at two plants in fourth quarter 2010.

Entergy affirmed previously issued operational earnings guidance for 2012 to be in the range of $5.40 to $6.20 per share. Previously issued as-reported earnings guidance of $5.40 to $6.20 per share for 2012 does not reflect any potential future expenses for the special item noted above in connection with the proposed spin-merge of Entergys transmission business. As-reported earnings guidance will be updated to reflect this special item as actual costs are incurred throughout 2012.

Exhibit 99.2
 
Exhibit 99.1 to this Report on Form 8-K (the "Pre-Release") contains the non-GAAP financial measure of operational earnings per share.  Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, Entergy has provided quantitative reconciliations within the Pre-Release of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
 
Operational earnings per share is not calculated in accordance with GAAP because it excludes the impact of "special items".  Special items reflect the impact on earnings of events that are less routine, are related to prior periods, or are related to discontinued businesses.  Management believes the discussion of operational earnings provides useful information in evaluating the ongoing results of Entergy's businesses and assists in comparing the company's operating performance to the operating performance of others in the energy sector.
 
The non-GAAP information in the Pre-Release is used in addition to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP.  The non-GAAP information should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures.  The non-GAAP information reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business.  Investors are strongly encouraged to review our consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure.  Non-GAAP information is not standardized; therefore, it may not be possible to compare this information with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names.
