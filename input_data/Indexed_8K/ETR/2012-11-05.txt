INVESTOR NEWS
Exhibit 99.1
 
Nov. 5, 2012
NEW ORLEANS  Entergy Corporation (NYSE: ETR) reported earnings of $1.89 per share on an as-reported basis and $1.95 per share on an operational basis for third quarter 2012, as shown in Table 1 below. A more detailed discussion of quarterly results begins on page 2 of this release.
Operational Earnings Highlights for Third Quarter 2012
 
While our near-term financial results and outlook continue to reflect the current low commodity price environment, we remained focused on managing all aspects of our business that we can control day-to-day in a safe and efficient manner, said . Weve made substantial progress on our initiative to join MISO, a regional transmission organization. Most recently, the Arkansas Public Service Commission and the Public Utility Commission of Texas conditionally approved proposals put forth by their respective companies. These milestones move our customers significantly closer to achieving up to $1.4 billion in projected savings over the next decade.
J. Wayne Leonard, Entergys chairman and chief executive officer
We continue to focus on the future by managing risk and executing on all initiatives intended to create value for all stakeholders, such as the proposal to spin off and merge the transmission business with ITC Holdings Corp. The new management teams transition will be seamless as they take over responsibility to complete the initiatives underway, as well as identify new ideas and opportunities.
Entergys business highlights also included the following:

Consolidated Earnings
Table 2 provides a comparative summary of consolidated earnings per share for third quarter and year-to-date 2012 versus 2011, including a reconciliation of GAAP as-reported earnings to non-GAAP operational earnings. Third quarter 2012 earnings decreased compared to a year ago. A detailed discussion of the factors driving quarterly results at each business segment follows.
Detailed earnings variance analysis is included in Appendix B-1 and Appendix B-2 to this release. In addition, Appendix B-3 provides details of special items shown in Table 2 above.
Consolidated Net Cash Flow Provided by Operating Activities
Entergys net cash flow provided by operating activities in third quarter 2012 was $1,032 million compared to $1,153 million in third quarter 2011. The overall quarterly decrease was due primarily to:
 
Table 3 provides the components of net cash flow provided by operating activities contributed by each business with current quarter and year-to-date comparisons.
 
In third quarter 2012, Utility earnings were $1.66 per share on an as-reported basis and $1.72 per share on an operational basis, compared to as-reported and operational earnings per share of $2.95 in third quarter 2011. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was due largely to the absence of the net earnings benefit from a 2011 IRS settlement that resulted in a significant reduction in income tax expense, the majority of which was recorded at the Utility, and the regulatory charge recorded to reflect the agreement to share the benefits resulting from the settlement with ELL customers, which decreased net revenue.
Third quarter 2012 Utility net revenue increased. However, excluding the prior year regulatory charge, Utility net revenue decreased slightly due to several factors. Billed retail sales volume was down quarter over quarter driven primarily by the effects of weather and Hurricane Isaac. Overall, weather was warmer than normal for the current quarter, but fell short of the significantly above-normal temperatures experienced in the third quarter of 2011. The decreases were largely offset by the net effect of regulatory actions in several jurisdictions and increased net revenue attributable to weather-adjusted volume. Although total weather-adjusted retail sales growth was essentially flat, net revenue increased from sales growth due to growth in the higher-margin residential and commercial segments.
Higher non-fuel operation and maintenance expense and higher depreciation expense also contributed to the quarter-over-quarter decline. The non-fuel operation and maintenance expense increase was attributable to several factors, including the absence of a deferral of previously expensed outage costs at ENOI recorded in the third quarter of 2011, a temporary increase in EMIs storm damage reserve and higher costs related to EAIs energy efficiency program (both offset in net revenue) and higher compensation and benefits costs (largely pension). Those factors were partially offset by deferral or capitalization of Isaac storm restoration costs.
Current quarter results included adjustments recorded in several income statement categories following the PUCTs final order in ETIs rate case issued in September 2012. The net effect of approximately $21 million pre-tax was driven primarily by a reduction in ETI's regulatory asset associated with estimated Hurricane Rita insurance recoveries and the expected amortization period of that asset.
Retail electric sales, in billed gigawatt-hours, is summarized in Table 4by customer segment. Current quarter retail sales reflect the following:
 
 
 
Billed retail sales growth on a weather-adjusted basis was essentially flat quarter over quarter. Growth in residential and commercial and governmental sales was offset by a decline in industrial sales. The industrial sales decrease was due partly to an outage at a large industrial customer.
Table 4 provides a comparative summary of Utility operational performance measures.
 
 
Appendix C provides information on selected pending local and federal regulatory cases.
 
EWC operational adjusted EBITDA was $185 million in the third quarter of 2012, compared to $241 million in the same period a year ago, as shown in Table 5. The decline was due largely to lower net revenue from the nuclear portfolio primarily on lower energy pricing. The average realized revenue per megawatt hour for the nuclear fleet was approximately $52, down from approximately $56 in the same period last year. While nuclear generation declined due to an increase in refueling and unplanned outage days, the effect of outage days was partially offset by the exercise of resupply options provided for in power purchase agreements whereby, under these options, EWC may elect to supply power from another source when the plant is not running. Lower net revenue from EWCs nuclear fleet was partially offset by net revenue from the 583-megawatt RISEC, which was acquired in December 2011. Higher non-fuel operation and maintenance expense also contributed to the operational adjusted EBITDA decline, driven by higher compensation and benefits costs (largely pension) and the RISEC acquisition.
EWC earnings for the third quarter 2012 were $0.67 per share on an as-reported basis and an operational basis, compared to $0.73 per share in third quarter 2011. The decline was largely attributable to the operational EBITDA drivers noted above. These items were partially offset by lower depreciation expense and a lower effective income tax rate. The depreciation expense decrease was due primarily to the receipt of proceeds by Indian Point 2 for the resolution of litigation related to the DOEs failure to provide timely spent fuel storage. The lower effective income tax rate reflected a portion of Entergy Nuclear Power Marketing income tax expense being recorded at Parent & Other due to an ownership restructuring.
Table 6 provides a comparative summary of EWC operational performance measures.
Table 7 provides information on current forward capacity and generation contracts for EWCs fleet, as well as total revenue projections based on market prices as of Sept. 30, 2012. EWC uses a combination of forward physical and financial contracts, including swaps, collars, put and / or call options, to manage forward commodity price risk. Certain hedge volumes have price downside and upside relative to market price movements. The contracted minimum, current expected value and sensitivity are provided to show potential variations. While the sensitivity reflects the minimum, it may not reflect the total maximum upside potential from higher market prices. Information contained in Table 7 represents projections at a point in time and will vary over time based on numerous factors, such as future market prices, contracting activities and generation.
 
 
 
Parent & Other reported a loss of $(0.44) per share on an as-reported basis and an operational basis in third quarter 2012, compared to an as-reported and operational loss of $(0.15) per share in third quarter 2011. Higher income tax expense on Parent & Other activities was the primary factor driving the decrease. The major drivers were the absence of favorable income tax adjustments associated with the prior year IRS settlement and the 2012 Entergy Nuclear Power Marketing income tax expense noted earlier. Higher interest expense also contributed to the decrease.
Entergy updated its 2012 earnings guidance range to be $3.44 to $4.24 per share on an as-reported basis and affirmed operational guidance of $4.85 to $5.65 per share. Entergy noted that indications continue to point to the upper end of the guidance ranges. The revised as-reported guidance range reflects special items recorded in the current quarter for expenses in connection with the proposed spin-off and merger of Entergys transmission business with ITC. As-reported earnings guidance for 2012 does not reflect any potential future expenses for the proposed spin-merge.
The 2012 earnings guidance is detailed in Table 8. Year-over-year changes are shown as point estimates and are applied to 2011 earnings to compute the 2012 guidance midpoint. Drivers for the 2012 guidance range are listed separately. Because there is a range of possible outcomes associated with each earnings driver, a range is applied to the guidance midpoint to produce Entergys guidance range.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Key assumptions supporting 2012 operational earnings guidance are as follows:
Utility
Entergy Wholesale Commodities
Parent & Other
 
 
 
Share Repurchase Program
Other
2012 Guidance Range Revised April 2012
 
 
 
Entergy is initiating 2013 earnings guidance in the range of $4.60 to $5.40 per share on both an as-reported basis and an operational basis. Year-over-year changes are shown as point estimates and are applied to an adjusted 2012 starting point to compute the 2013 guidance midpoint. While Entergy affirmed its updated 2012 earnings guidance ranges, the 2012 starting point by business segment was adjusted consistent with current indications and also to improve the alignment of certain intercompany items and income tax activity within the EWC reporting segment. The full-year 2012 adjustment between EWC and Parent & Other is approximately $0.40 per share (reflecting a reduction at EWC and an increase at Parent & Other), which is split roughly 70 percent income tax expense and 30 percent interest income. The overall adjusted starting point per share is $5.55 on an operational basis and $4.14 on an as-reported basis, compared to 2012 earnings per share guidance of $4.85 to $5.65 on an operational basis and $3.44 to $4.24 on an as-reported basis.
As-reported earnings guidance for 2013 does not reflect potential future expenses for the proposed spin-merge of the transmission business with ITC. The as-reported 2013 guidance will be updated throughout the year as these transaction-related expenses are incurred. Drivers for the 2013 earnings guidance range are listed separately. Because there is a range of possible outcomes associated with each earnings driver, a range is applied to the guidance midpoint to produce Entergys guidance range. Entergys 2013 earnings guidance is detailed in Table 9 below.
 
 
 
Key assumptions supporting 2013 operational earnings guidance are as follows:
Utility
Entergy Wholesale Commodities
 
 
 
Parent & Other
Other
Earnings guidance for 2013 should be considered in association with earnings sensitivities as shown in Table 10. These sensitivities illustrate the estimated change in operational earnings per share resulting from changes in various revenue and expense drivers. Traditionally, the most significant variables for earnings drivers are retail sales for the Utility and energy prices for EWC. In addition, the earnings guidance range for 2013 takes into consideration a number of regulatory initiatives (rate actions) underway across the Utility jurisdictions.
Estimated annual impacts shown in Table 10 are intended to be indicative rather than precise guidance.
 
 
 
Entergy believes it offers a long-term, competitive utility investment opportunity combined with a valuable option represented by a unique, clean, non-utility generation business located in attractive power markets. Table 11 summarizes the updated long-term financial outlook for 2010 through 2014. The updated long-term outlook reflects Entergys expectations of economic, business and commodity market conditions through 2014. Entergy also noted that the long-term financial outlook does not reflect the effects of the proposed spin-merge of the transmission business discussed in Appendix A.
 
 
 
Seven appendices are presented in this section as follows:
 
 
 
In December 2011, the Entergy and ITC boards of directors approved a definitive agreement under which Entergy will spin off and then merge its electric transmission business with a subsidiary of ITC. The transaction is targeted to close in 2013 and is subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions. Primary filings required include the Entergy Utility operating companies retail regulators as well as several federal agencies. ITC shareholders must also approve the transaction.
Appendix A provides a summary of certain activities that are pending.
 
 
 
Additional Information and Where to Find It
On Sept. 25, 2012, ITC filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC registering shares of ITC common stock to be issued to Entergy shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, but this registration statement has not become effective. This registration statement includes a proxy statement of ITC that also constitutes a prospectus of ITC, and will be sent to ITC shareholders. In addition, Mid South TransCo LLC (TransCo) will file a registration statement with the SEC registering TransCo common units to be issued to Entergy shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions. Entergy shareholders are urged to read the proxy statement / prospectus included in the ITC registration statement and the proxy statement / prospectus to be included in the TransCo registration statement (when available) and any other relevant documents, because they contain important information about ITC, TransCo and the proposed transactions. ITC shareholders are urged to read the proxy statement / prospectus and any other relevant documents because they contain important information about TransCo and the proposed transactions. The proxy statement / prospectus and other documents relating to the proposed transactions (when they are available) can be obtained free of charge from the SECs website at www.sec.gov. The documents, when available, can also be obtained free of charge from Entergy upon written request to Entergy Corporation, Investor Relations, P.O. Box 61000, New Orleans, LA 70161 or by calling Entergys Investor Relations information line at 1-888-ENTERGY (368-3749), or from ITC upon written request to ITC Holdings Corp., Investor Relations, 27175 Energy Way, Novi, MI 48377 or by calling 248-946-3000.
 
 
 
Appendix B-1 and Appendix B-2 provide details of third quarter and year-to-date 2012 vs. 2011 as-reported and operational earnings variance analysis for Utility, Entergy Wholesale Commodities, Parent & Other and Consolidated.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Appendix B-3 lists special items by business with quarter-to-quarter and year-to-date comparisons. Amounts are shown on both an earnings per share basis and a net income basis. Special items are those events that are not routine, are related to prior periods or are related to discontinued businesses. Special items are included in as-reported earnings per share consistent with GAAP, but are excluded from operational earnings per share. As a result, operational earnings per share is considered a non-GAAP measure.
 
 
 
Appendix C provides a summary of selected regulatory cases and events that are pending.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Appendix D-1 provides comparative financial performance measures for the current quarter. Appendix D-2 provides historical financial performance measures and operating performance metrics for the trailing eight quarters. Financial performance measures in both tables include those calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, as well as those that are considered non-GAAP measures.
As-reported measures are computed in accordance with GAAP as they include all components of net income, including special items. Operational measures are non-GAAP measures as they are calculated using operational net income, which excludes the impact of special items. A reconciliation of operational measures to as-reported measures is provided in Appendix G.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The preliminary capital plan for 2013 through 2015 anticipates $6.6 billion for investment, including $3.3 billion of maintenance capital, as shown in Appendix E. The remaining $3.3 billion is for specific investments and other initiatives such as:
 
 
 
 
Appendix F provides definitions of certain operational performance measures, as well as GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, all of which are referenced in this release. Financial measures defined in the below table include measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP measures are included in this release in order to provide metrics that remove the effect of not routine financial impacts from commonly used financial metrics.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Appendix G-1, Appendix G-2 and Appendix G-3 provide reconciliations of various non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this release to their most comparable GAAP measure.

In third quarter 2012, Utility earnings were $296.2 million, or $1.66 per share, on an as-reported basis and $306.8 million, or $1.72 per share, on an operational basis, compared to $524.1 million, or $2.95 per share, on both as-reported and operational bases in third quarter 2011.  The quarter-over-quarter decrease was due largely to the absence of the net earnings benefit from a 2011 IRS settlement that resulted in a significant reduction in income tax expense, the majority of which was recorded at the Utility, and the regulatory charge recorded to reflect the agreement to share the benefits resulting from the settlement with Entergy Louisianas customers, which decreased net revenue.

Third quarter 2012 Utility net revenue increased. However, excluding the prior year regulatory charge, Utility net revenue decreased slightly due to several factors. Billed retail sales volume was down quarter over quarter driven primarily by the effects of weather and Hurricane Isaac. Overall, weather was warmer than normal for the current quarter, but fell short of the significantly above-normal temperatures experienced in the third quarter of 2011. The decreases were largely offset by the net effect of regulatory actions in several jurisdictions and increased net revenue attributable to weather-adjusted volume. Although total weather-adjusted retail sales growth was essentially flat, net revenue increased from sales growth due to growth in the higher-margin residential and commercial segments.
 
Higher non-fuel operation and maintenance expense and higher depreciation expense also contributed to the quarter-over-quarter decline. The non-fuel operation and maintenance expense increase was attributable to several factors, including the absence of a deferral of previously expensed outage costs at Entergy New Orleans recorded in the third quarter of 2011, a temporary increase in Entergy Mississippis storm damage reserve and higher costs related to Entergy Arkansas energy efficiency program (both offset in net revenue), and higher compensation and benefits costs (largely pension). Those factors were partially offset by deferral or capitalization of Isaac storm restoration costs.
 
Current quarter results included adjustments recorded in several income statement categories following the PUCTs final order in Entergy Texas' rate case issued in September 2012. The net effect of approximately $21 million pre-tax was driven primarily by a reduction in Entergy Texas' regulatory asset associated with estimated Hurricane Rita insurance recoveries and the expected amortization period of that asset.

Residential sales in third quarter 2012, on a weather-adjusted basis, increased 1.4 percent compared to third quarter 2011. Commercial and governmental sales, on a weather-adjusted basis, increased 0.9 percent quarter over quarter. Industrial sales in the third quarter decreased 2.5 percent compared to the same quarter of 2011. Billed retail sales growth on a weather-adjusted basis was essentially flat quarter over quarter. Growth in residential and commercial and governmental sales was offset by a decline in industrial sales. The industrial sales decrease was due partly to an outage at a large industrial customer.
 
Entergy Wholesale Commodities as-reported and operational earnings were $118.8 million, or 67 cents per share, for third quarter 2012, compared to $130.2 million, or 73 cents per share, for third quarter 2011. The decline was largely attributable to the operational EBITDA drivers noted below. These items were partially offset by lower depreciation expense and a lower effective income tax rate. The depreciation expense decrease was due primarily to the receipt of proceeds by Indian Point 2 for the resolution of litigation related to the DOEs failure to provide timely spent fuel storage. The lower effective income tax rate reflected a portion of Entergy Nuclear Power Marketing income tax expense being recorded at Parent & Other due to an ownership restructuring.
 
Entergy Wholesale Commodities operational adjusted EBITDA was $185 million in the third quarter of 2012, compared to $241 million in the same period a year ago. The decline was due largely to lower net revenue from the nuclear portfolio primarily on lower energy pricing. The average realized revenue per megawatt hour for the nuclear fleet was approximately $52, down from approximately $56 in the same period last year. While

nuclear generation declined due to an increase in refueling and unplanned outage days, the effect of outage days was partially offset by the exercise of resupply options provided for in power purchase agreements whereby, under these options, Entergy Wholesale Commodities may elect to supply power from another source when the plant is not running. Lower net revenue from Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear fleet was partially offset by net revenue from the 583-megawatt Rhode Island State Energy Center, which was acquired in December 2011. Higher non-fuel operation and maintenance expense also contributed to the operational adjusted EBITDA decline, driven by higher compensation and benefits costs (largely pension) and the Rhode Island State Energy Center acquisition.
 
Parent & Other reported a loss of $77.9 million, or 44 cents per share, on an as-reported basis and an operational basis for third quarter 2012. This compares to a loss of $26.3 million, or 15 cents per share, on both as-reported and operational bases in third quarter 2011. Higher income tax expense on Parent & Other activities was the primary factor driving the decrease. The major drivers were the absence of favorable income tax adjustments associated with the prior year IRS settlement and the 2012 Entergy Nuclear Power Marketing income tax expense noted earlier. Higher interest expense also contributed to the decrease.
 
Entergy updated its 2012 earnings guidance range to be $3.44 to $4.24 per share on an as-reported basis and affirmed operational guidance of $4.85 to $5.65 per share. Entergy noted that indications continue to point to the upper end of the guidance ranges. The revised as-reported guidance range reflects special items recorded in the current quarter for expenses in connection with the proposed spin-off and merger of Entergys transmission business with ITC. As-reported earnings guidance for 2012 does not reflect any potential future expenses for the proposed spin-merge.

In December 2011, the Entergy and ITC boards of directors approved a definitive agreement under which Entergy will spin off and then merge its electric transmission business with a subsidiary of ITC. The transaction is targeted to close in 2013 and is subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions. Primary filings required include the Entergy Utility operating companies retail regulators as well as several federal agencies. ITC shareholders must also approve the transaction.
On Sept. 25, 2012, ITC filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) registering shares of ITC common stock to be issued to Entergy shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, but this registration statement has not become effective. This registration statement includes a proxy statement of ITC that also constitutes a prospectus of ITC, and will be sent to ITC shareholders. In addition, Mid South TransCo LLC (TransCo) will file a registration statement with the SEC registering TransCo common units to be issued to Entergy shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions. Entergy shareholders are urged to read the proxy statement/prospectus included in the ITC registration statement and the proxy statement/prospectus to be included in the TransCo registration statement (when available) and any other relevant documents, because they contain important information about ITC, TransCo and the proposed transactions. ITC shareholders are urged to read the proxy statement/prospectus and any

Exhibit 99.3
Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 to this Report on Form 8-K (the "Earnings Releases") contain non-GAAP financial measures.  Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.  Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, Entergy has provided quantitative reconciliations within the Earnings Releases and the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
 
Certain non-GAAP measures in the Earnings Releases could differ from GAAP only in that the figure or ratio states or includes operational earnings per share.  Operational earnings per share is presented for each of Entergy's reportable business segments as well as on a consolidated basis.  Operational earnings per share is not calculated in accordance with GAAP because it excludes the effect of "special items."  Special items reflect the effect on earnings of events that are less routine or are related to discontinued businesses.  In addition, other financial measures including net income (or earnings), rolling 12 months including preferred dividends and tax effected interest expense, return on average invested capital, return on average common equity, and net margin are included on both an operational and as-reported basis.  In each case, the metrics defined as "operational" would exclude the effect of special items as defined above.  Management believes that financial metrics calculated using operational earnings could provide useful information to investors in evaluating the ongoing results of Entergy's businesses and could assist investors in comparing Entergy's operating performance to the operating performance of others in the energy sector.
 
Other non-GAAP measures, adjusted EBITDA; operational adjusted EBITDA; gross liquidity; debt to capital ratio, excluding securitization debt; net debt to net capital ratio, excluding securitization debt; and net debt to net capital ratio including off-balance sheet liabilities, excluding securitization debt; are measures Entergy uses internally for management and board discussions and cash budgeting and performance monitoring activities to gauge the overall strength of its business.  Entergy believes the above data could provide useful information to investors in evaluating Entergy's ongoing financial results and flexibility, and could assist investors in comparing Entergy's cash availability to the cash availability of others in the energy sector.
 
The non-GAAP financial measures and other reported adjusted items in the Earnings Releases are presented in addition to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP.  These non-GAAP financial measures should not be used to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures.  These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, could provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business.  Investors are strongly encouraged to review our consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure.  Non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized; therefore, it might not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names.
