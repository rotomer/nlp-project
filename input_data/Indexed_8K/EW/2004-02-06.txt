Item 2.  Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
 
On January 27, 2004, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Edwards") acquired Percutaneous Valve Technologies, Inc. ("PVT"), a privately held medical technology company based in Fort Lee, New Jersey with a subsidiary in Caesarea, Israel.  PVT's technology is a catheter-based (percutaneous) approach for replacing aortic heart valves through a combination of a percutaneously delivered balloon-expandable stent technology integrated with a tissue heart valve.  Under the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among Edwards, Edwards Acquisition, Inc. and PVT dated as of December 12, 2003, Edwards is paying the shareholders of PVT an aggregate of $125 million in cash, and may pay the shareholders of PVT an aggregate of up to an additional $30 million in cash upon the achievement of certain milestones.  Edwards expects to take an initial in-process research and development charge related to this acquisition in the first quarter of 2004, estimated to be between $60 million and $90 million ($1.00 to $1.50 per share).  However, this estimate is subject to a number of uncertainties and assumptions, and actual results may be different.
 
This report includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including those related to the estimated amount of the Edwards' initial in-process research and development charge related to the acquisition and other risks detailed in the Edwards' filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These forward-looking statements are based on estimates and assumptions made by management of Edwards and are believed to be reasonable, though are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict. Actual results or experience could differ materially from the forward-looking statements.

Claims Upon Contingent
Payments; Objections to Claims
 
.

Purchaser shall not be estopped by any estimate it may make of the amount of any anticipated or actual Losses claimed in any Officer's Certificate, or the bases therefor, and Purchaser may submit amendments to any Officer's Certificate, or additional Officer's Certificates, in the event that actual or anticipated Losses, or the bases therefor, subsequently change or are determined to be different than represented in an Officer's Certificate previously delivered.  Purchaser shall not offset any Losses against any Contingent Payments or other payments payable then or in the future until 45 days after the date of delivery of the Officer's Certificate to the Sellers' Agent (or at such earlier date as the Sellers' Agent may authorize).
(a)
                                 
Claims
 
.  Purchaser shall be entitled to offset against any Contingent Payments the full amount of Losses claimed in the Officer's Certificate immediately after the 45 day waiting period specified in Section 8.4(a) expires (or at such earlier date as the Sellers' Agent may authorize), unless prior to such time the Sellers' Agent delivers a written objection to the claim made in the Officer's Certificate (a "Notice of Dispute") to Purchaser.  The Notice of Dispute must include a reasonably detailed description of the basis of the objection, as
(b)
                                
Objections to Claims
 
well as the amount of Losses, if any, which the Sellers' Agent is not disputing.  Any undisputed Losses immediately shall be offset by Purchaser against any Contingent Payments or other payments and Purchaser shall be entitled to withhold any or all of the Contingent Payments reasonably anticipated to cover disputed or anticipated Losses described in the Officer's Certificate.  If the Sellers' Agent does not timely deliver a Notice of Dispute (or such Notice of Dispute does not reasonably describe the basis of the objection), the Sellers' Agent shall be deemed to have irrevocably approved and consented to the offset of all Losses specified in the Officer's Certificate (including any anticipated Losses, which will be deemed irrevocably by Sellers' Agent approved and shall be offset by Purchaser promptly upon their actual incurrence).  Purchaser shall be entitled to rely on and act in accordance with any written or deemed approval and consent of the Sellers' Agent in immediately offsetting the amount of any Losses claimed in a specific Officer's Certificate (and in offsetting any Contingent Payments or other payments reasonably anticipated to cover any Losses upon occurrence), even if the Sellers' Agent subsequently objects to or disputes the nature or amount of Losses.  At such time as the cash payable to cover the amount of Losses exceeds the payments pursuant to the Contingent Payments, all Sellers shall cease to have any rights to receive any further Merger Consideration under this Agreement.
