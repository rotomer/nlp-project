NEWS RELEASE
 
 
IRVINE, Calif., January 27, 2005
 Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE: EW), the world leader in products and technologies to treat advanced cardiovascular disease, today reported net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 of $25.9 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, compared to net income of $18.9 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, for the same period in 2003. 
Excluding the special items detailed in the tables below, net income was $28.9 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, compared to net income of $26.6 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, the previous year.
 
Fourth quarter net sales increased 5.8 percent to $237.1 million, compared to $224.1 million in the same quarter last year.  Growth this quarter was aided by $6.6 million in foreign exchange (FX).
 
"This quarter's results were driven by continued strong global heart valve sales growth, particularly in the U.S. and Europe," said Michael A. Mussallem, Edwards Lifesciences' chairman and CEO.  "Building for our future, we've made significant progress in peripheral stents, minimally invasive monitoring, and our three percutaneous heart valve programs."
 
 
Sales Results
 
For the fourth quarter, the company reported Heart Valve Therapy sales of $105.0 million, a 13.8 percent increase compared to the same quarter last year, with FX contributing $2.8 million to the growth.  "Again this quarter, underlying heart valve growth exceeded 10 percent, driven by our market-leading PERIMOUNT tissue valves," said Mussallem.  "In the U.S., total PERIMOUNT sales grew nearly 20 percent, led by our Magna aortic valve and Tricentrix mitral valve system."
 
Critical Care sales of $79.6 million grew 5.3 percent compared to last year's quarter, with FX contributing $2.3 million to the growth. 
This quarter's underlying growth was due primarily to robust pressure monitoring product sales resulting from market share gains, and sales of advanced technology catheters.
 
Cardiac Surgery Systems sales for the quarter were $26.8 million compared to $29.6 million last year.  Strong global sales growth in cannulae was more than offset by a decline in the Japan perfusion products business.  Yesterday, the company announced the divestiture of this low margin, distributed products business.
 
the same period in 2003, led by sales of interventional products and offset by discontinued businesses.  "LifeStent sales in the quarter continued to be constrained due to product availability issues.  We believe the supply constraints are behind us and expect acceleration in stent sales throughout 2005," Mussallem said.
Vascular sales were $15.5 million, a 3.3 percent increase compared to
 
Sales of Other Distributed Products were $10.2 million in the quarter compared to $11.6 million in the year ago period.  The decline compared to last year was driven by the de-emphasis of certain distributed cardiology products in Japan.
 
D
omestic and international sales for the fourth quarter were $105.0 million and $132.1 million, respectively.
Additional Operating Results
 
For the quarter, Edwards' gross profit margin increased to 61.5 percent from 58.1 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, primarily due to the expiration of currency hedging contracts earlier this year, the elimination of certain low margin businesses and sales of higher margin products.
 
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $82.7 million for the quarter, or 34.9 percent of sales, compared to $72.2 million in the year ago period.  The increase in SG&A was due primarily to higher sales and marketing expenses in the company's U.S. peripheral stent and heart valve therapy product lines, and higher international expenses due to foreign exchange rates.  Research and development expenses of $23.4 million increased 23.2 percent compared to the prior year's quarter, attributable to investments in percutaneous valve programs.
 
Long term debt at December 31 was $267.1 million, resulting in a debt-to-cap ratio of 29.8 percent.  Free cash flow generated during the quarter was $38.1 million, calculated as cash flow from operating activities of $57.8 million minus capital expenditures of $19.7 million.
 
In the quarter, the company repurchased approximately 700,000 shares of common stock for $25.7 million.
 
During the quarter, the company recorded a $4.9 million net pretax special charge related to the write-down of impaired investments and the establishment of a charitable fund offset by the sale of real estate development rights.
 
Twelve-Month Results
 
For the 12 months ended December 31, 2004, the company recorded net income of $1.7 million compared to net income of $79.0 million for 2003.  Excluding special items described in the tables below, net income was $104.1 million, or $1.67 per diluted share, compared to $96.6 million or $1.58 per diluted share for 2003.
Sales for the year totaled $931.5 million, an increase of 8.3 percent compared to 2003.  Domestic and international sales for the 12 months were $416.5 million and $515.0 million, respectively.
 
Free cash flow generated for the year was $138.1 million, calculated as cash flow from operating activities of $180.6 million minus capital expenditures of $42.5 million.
 
2005 Outlook
 
profitability," continued Mussallem.  "Moreover, we are beginning to see tangible results from our development efforts, and we are excited about the opportunity to expand clinical options for the many patients who can benefit from less invasive approaches.
"We're very proud of what we accomplished in 2004 and our momentum positions Edwards for another year of strong growth and
 
more than 100 basis points.  We also expect to deliver net income growth of 13 to 15 percent excluding the impact of special items, and generate free cash flow of $115 to $125 million.
"Even taking into consideration the Japan realignment we announced yesterday, we expect to meet our previously announced 2005 financial goals.  Specifically, we expect to generate total sales between $980 million to $1.02 billion, and increase our gross profit margin by
 
"Finally, we are comfortable with the first quarter First Call mean EPS estimate of $0.45 and expect full year EPS to be $1.85 to $1.95, excluding the expensing of stock options," Mussallem concluded.

Certain disclosures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") contained in this discussion are accompanied by disclosures that are not prepared in conformity with GAAP.  These non-GAAP disclosures exclude certain items from the GAAP presentations.  Management has determined that these non-GAAP disclosures provide (1) a more meaningful, consistent comparison of the Company's operating results for the periods presented, on a basis consistent with management's means of evaluating operating performance, and (2) additional information for investors to assess changes between periods that better reflect the Company's ongoing operations. The items included in these non-GAAP disclosures, and the basis for excluding them, are set forth below:
 
The Company incurred purchased in-process research and development expenses on the acquisition of PVT and ev3 this year and Jomed and Whitland last year.  Given the materiality and unusual nature of these expenses relative to the operating results for the periods presented, these expenses have been excluded in the Adjusted Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations and the Unaudited Reconciliation of Consolidated Statements of Operations.
In-Process Research and Development -
 
The Company generated certain special charges, net, related to (i) the 2004 termination of its Lifepath AAA program and its Interventional Cardiology products, (ii) the impairment of certain investments in 2004, (iii) the creation of a charitable fund in 2004, (iv) the sale of property development rights in 2004,  (v) the sale of its German perfusion business in 2003,  (vi) the headcount reduction program implemented in 2003, (vii) the resolution of arbitration with Baxter in 2003, and (viii) the suspension of the Puerto Rico pension plan in 2003. In addition, in 2003 the Company received a one-time Brazilian tax benefit.  Given the materiality and unusual nature of these items relative to the operating results for the periods presented, these items have been excluded in the Adjusted Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations and the Unaudited Reconciliation of Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Other Items -
 
The Company has exited certain businesses during the periods presented.  In light of the significance of the impact these businesses had on the profitability of the Company, the results of these businesses have been excluded in the Reconciliation of Sales by Product Line and Region.
Results of Discontinued Businesses 
 
- Fluctuation in exchange rates impacts the comparative results and growth rates of the Company's underlying business.  The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations have been excluded in the Reconciliation of Sales by Product Line and Region.  Management believes that excluding these impacts helps explain changes in the fundamental business operations.
