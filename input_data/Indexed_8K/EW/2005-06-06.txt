On June 2, 2005 (the "Effective Date"), Edwards Lifesciences PVT, Inc.

The Master Agreement provided for, as of the Effective Date, the termination of and, with certain exceptions, the mutual release of liability arising from, two development and supply agreements between 3F Therapeutics and the Company (as successor to Percutaneous Valve Technologies, Inc.).  In exchange, the Company agreed to pay $24.75 million to 3F Therapeutics, of which $22.75 million was paid on the Effective Date and $2 million is expected to be paid upon the termination of the Supply and Training Agreement.  In connection with the Non-Exclusive License Agreement, the Company paid $250,000 to 3F Therapeutics.
 
The Supply and Training Agreement provides for (i) the supply of certain products by 3F Therapeutics to the Company and (ii) the delivery of certain know-how documentation and provision of certain training services by 3F Therapeutics to the Company with respect to such products.
 
The Co-Exclusive License Agreement provides for the grant by the Company to 3F Therapeutics of royalty-bearing co-exclusive licenses under certain of the Company's patents to manufacture, use, import and sell licensed products in certain fields of use.  3F Therapeutics is obligated to pay the Company a royalty of 4% of the net sales of any such licensed products sold by 3F Therapeutics in the applicable field of use.
 
The Non-Exclusive License Agreement provides for the grant by 3F Therapeutics to the Company of royalty-free non-exclusive licenses under certain of its patents and know-how to manufacture, use, import and sell licensed products in certain fields of use.

CONFIDENTIALITY AND PUBLICITY; NON-SOLICITATION.
6.
            
 
Confidentiality.
6.1
         
 
Subject to the provisions of Section 6.2, each of the Parties agrees that it will not use to the detriment of the disclosing Party (except as permitted under this Agreement or the Related Transaction Agreements) or disclose to any third party any confidential or proprietary information of the other Party, except to the extent that such information (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by the receiving Party or its representatives in violation of this Agreement, (ii) was within the receiving Party's possession prior to its first being furnished to it, (iii) is, at any time, disclosed to the receiving Party by any third party having the right to disclose the same or (iv) is independently developed by an employee or agent/consultant of the receiving Party without reference to the confidential or proprietary information of the other Party.  Each Party may disclose the confidential information of the other Party to such Party's representatives, who shall not use such information except for the purposes contemplated hereby, and who shall maintain the confidentiality of such information, provided however, that each Party shall be responsible for any breach of this Section 6.1 by its representatives.
(a)
          
 
In the event that either Party or any of its representatives are requested or required to disclose any of the confidential information of the other Party, it shall provide the other Party with prompt written notice of any such request or requirement so that the disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy.  If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy, the receiving Party or any of its representatives are nonetheless, in the opinion of its outside counsel, legally compelled to disclose such confidential information to any governmental authority or else stand liable for contempt or suffer other censure or penalty, the receiving Party or its representative may, without liability hereunder, disclose to such governmental authority only that portion of such confidential information which such counsel advises is legally required to be disclosed.
(b)
          
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and any other agreement entered into by the parties, either Party to this Agreement (and their representatives) may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Related Transaction Agreements and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to it relating to such tax treatment and tax structure; provided, however, that this sentence shall not permit any disclosure that otherwise is prohibited by this Agreement (i) if such disclosure would result in a violation of federal or state securities laws or (ii) to the extent not related to the tax aspects of the transaction.  Moreover, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit in any way any Party's ability to consult any tax advisor regarding the tax treatment or tax structure of the Transactions.
(c)
          
 
.  Except for the information set forth on any of the exhibits to the Related Transaction Agreements (the ""), each of Edwards and 3F Therapeutics shall be entitled to disclose the terms of this Agreement and the Related Transaction Agreements as they deem appropriate, provided that any press release disclosing any of such terms shall be provided to the other Party at least one day in advance of the issuance of
6.2
         
Public Statements
Proprietary Information
such press release to permit the other Party to review the accuracy of such release [and provided that an initial press release disclosing this Agreement and the related Transaction Agreements shall be a joint press release by Edwards and 3F Therapeutics in the form attached hereto as ].  Except as required by law or the applicable regulations of a nationally recognized stock exchange (or as necessary in conjunction with a registration statement), neither Edwards nor 3F Therapeutics nor their affiliates shall release any Proprietary Information to any third party, other than as specifically may be permitted in this Agreement or the Related Transaction Agreements.  In the event that either Party or their affiliates are requested or required to disclose any of the Proprietary Information, the procedures and provisions of Section 6.1(b) above shall apply.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, Edwards may disclose Proprietary Information as necessary to any prior, current or future licensor under the Heartport License (as such term is defined in the Edwards License Agreement), and any of its affiliates, employees, agents, representatives, successors or assigns, in order for Edwards to comply with its obligations under the terms of the Heartport License, in each case without the prior consent of 3F Therapeutics.
Exhibit F
 
Non-Solicitation.
6.3
         
 
During the period from the Closing Date to the first anniversary of the expiration of the Term (as such term is defined in the Supply and Training Agreement) (the ""), each Party agrees that it will not directly or indirectly through another person or entity: (i) induce or attempt to induce any employee or independent contractor of the other Party who is involved in the execution of the Technology Transfer Plan (as such term is defined in the Supply and Training Agreement) to terminate his or her employment or engagement with such other Party or (ii) recruit, solicit or hire any employee or independent contractor of such other Party who is involved in the execution of the Technology Transfer Plan.
(a)
          
Non-Solicitation Period
 
It is the desire and intent of the Parties that the provisions of this Section 6.3 be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and public policies of each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought.  Accordingly, if, at the time of enforcement of any provision of this Section 6.3, a court holds that the restrictions stated herein are unreasonable under circumstances then existing, the Parties agree that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the maximum period or scope reasonable under such circumstances will be substituted for the Nonsolicitation Period or scope.  Furthermore, such substitution will apply only with respect to the operation of such provision in the particular jurisdiction in which such adjudication is made.
(b)
          
 
Among other matters, because each Party will have access to certain confidential and proprietary information of the other, each Party agrees that money damages would be an inadequate remedy for any breach of this Section 6.3.  Therefore, in the event of a breach or threatened breach of any provision of this Section 6.3 by either Party, the other Party or any of its successors or assigns may, in addition to other rights and remedies existing in its favor, apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for specific performance and/or injunctive or other relief in order to enforce, or prevent any violations of, the provisions of this Section 6.3 (without posting a bond or other security).  Each Party expressly agrees and acknowledges that its covenants contained in this Section 6.3 are (i) reasonably necessary for the protection of the other Party's interests, (ii) made in consideration of, among other matters, such Party's agreement to be bound by this Agreement and the Related Transaction Agreements and (iii) not unduly restrictive upon such Party.

INDEMNIFICATION.
9.
            
 
.  Each Party (the "") hereby indemnifies and agrees to defend and hold the other Party (the ""), its permitted successors, affiliates, and permitted assigns harmless from and against all claims, demands, liabilities, damages, losses and expenses suffered or incurred by the Indemnified Party ("") only to the extent arising out of or in connection with (i) any breach of any representation, warranty or acknowledgement of the Indemnifying Party set forth in this Agreement and (ii) any breach of any agreement, covenant or obligation of the Indemnifying Party set forth in this Agreement.

Indemnity
Indemnifying Party
Indemnified Party
Losses
 
.  If an Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnification pursuant to this Section 9, such Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of such claim.  The Indemnified Party will provide the Indemnifying Party with prompt written notice of any third party claim in respect of which indemnification is sought.  The failure to provide either such notice will not affect any rights hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced thereby.  Any such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the available facts, circumstances and basis of the claim. If such claim involves a claim by a third party against the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party may, after acknowledging in writing liability hereunder, assume, through counsel of its own choosing (so long as reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party) and at its own expense, the defense thereby and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with it in connection therewith (including by furnishing such information as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request), provided, that the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense through counsel chosen by it, at its own expense.  So long as the Indemnifying Party is contesting any such claim in good faith, the Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle, or admit any liability with respect to, any such claim which it continues to seek indemnification for without the Indemnifying Party's consent.

2.1
         
Manufacture of Products.
  3F Therapeutics agrees to manufacture and sell the Products exclusively to Edwards (, , that notwithstanding Section 5.7 hereof and the proviso contained in Section 2.2(b) of the Master Agreement, an inadvertent sale of any Product by 3F Therapeutics to any party other than Edwards shall not constitute a failure of the condition to Edwards' obligation to pay the Holdback Amount to 3F Therapeutics under Section 2.2(b) of the Master Agreement), and Edwards agrees to purchase the Products upon the following terms:
provided
however
 
(a)
          
Within thirty (30) days after the Effective Date, Edwards shall provide 3F Therapeutics with a good faith, non-binding forecast of its purchase requirements for (i) 3F-PVT SAs covering the 3F-PVT SA Supply Term and (ii) valve leaflets covering the Valve Leaflet Supply Term, updated on a quarterly basis.

2.2
         
Product/Process Changes. 
3F Therapeutics shall notify Edwards in advance and in writing of all proposed changes in the following aspects of the Products or their components (, , that notwithstanding Section 5.7 hereof and the proviso contained in Section 2.2(b) of the Master Agreement, if 3F Therapeutics is using commercially reasonable best efforts but fails to provide advance notice as required by this Section 2.2, such failure shall not constitute a failure of the condition to Edwards' obligation to pay the Holdback Amount to 3F Therapeutics under Section 2.2(b) of the Master Agreement): (i) composition or source of any raw material, (ii) method of producing, processing or testing, (iii) change in subcontractors for producing, processing or testing, (iv) site of manufacture and (v) labeling.

In no case shall non-conforming materials from any source be used in the manufacture of the Products.
provided
however

provided, however
 
2.4
         
Product Recall.

Losses
 
  If an Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnification pursuant to this Section 6, such Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of such claim.  The Indemnified Party will provide the Indemnifying Party with prompt written notice of any third party claim in respect of which indemnification is sought.  The failure to provide either such notice will not affect any rights hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced thereby.  Any such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the available facts, circumstances and basis of the claim. If such claim involves a claim by a third party against the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party may, after acknowledging in writing liability hereunder, assume, through counsel of its own choosing (so long as reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party) and at its own expense, the defense thereby and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with it in connection therewith (including by furnishing such information as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request), provided, that the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense through counsel chosen by it, at its own expense.  So long as the Indemnifying Party is contesting any such claim in good faith, the Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle, or admit any liability with respect to, any such claim which it continues to seek indemnification for without the Indemnifying Party's consent.  The Indemnifying Party will not without the Indemnified Party's prior written consent settle or compromise any claim or consent to entry of any judgment which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or the plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect of such claim. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), take any measure or step in connection with any settlement or compromise that imposes a material burden or encumbrance upon the operation or conduct of the Indemnified Party's business. If the Indemnifying Party is not contesting such claim in good faith, then the Indemnified Party may, upon at least ten (10) days' notice to the Indemnifying Party (unless the Indemnifying Party shall assume such settlement or defense within such ten (10) day period), conduct and control, through counsel of its own choosing and at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, the settlement or defense thereof, and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate with it in connection therewith.  The failure of the Indemnified Party to participate in, conduct or control such defense shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any obligation it may have hereunder.
6.2

) or, in the event that an injunction against future infringement is not granted and a party is permitted to continue to practice either the Licensed Patents or the Sublicensed Patents within the Fields of Use and Edwards receives on-going royalty payments for such practice in the Fields of Use (

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
IRVINE, Calif., June 2, 2005 
Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE: EW), the world leader in heart valve technologies, and 3F Therapeutics, Inc.,
a privately held medical device company,
announced they have restructured the development and supply agreements between Percutaneous Valve Technologies, Inc. (PVT) and 3F Therapeutics that were established before Edwards' acquisition of PVT in early 2004.  PVT was an e
arly-stage company engaged in the development of a catheter-based (or percutaneous) heart valve.
 
Under the terms of the new agreements, Edwards will pay 3F Therapeutics $25 million and will obtain the right to self-manufacture all components of its percutaneous heart valves and to apply the entire array of Edwards' capabilities and materials, including its PERIMOUNT heart valve technology, to those products.  Edwards may also apply any technologies developed for its percutaneous program in all other applications and is free to market any of these products.  3F Therapeutics will have co-exclusive royalty-bearing licenses to select Edwards patents related to minimally-invasive, beating heart, surgical valve replacement and venous valve systems aimed at tricuspid valve regurgitation associated with congestive heart failure.  Edwards expects to take the majority of the $25 million as a special charge in the current quarter.
 
Stanton J. Rowe, Edwards' corporate vice president, Percutaneous Valve
Our percutaneous heart valve programs continue to make significant progress," said
"
 
clarifying Edwards' ability to freely incorporate our significant research and manufacturing capabilities into future generations of heart valve products.  This arrangement represents just the latest demonstration of our commitment to continue leading innovation in all heart valve therapies."
.  "These agreements will further support that progress by
Interventions
 
"We are pleased to complete the restructuring of these agreements, which provide for a continued access to the intellectual property required in surgical, beating heart valve replacement products based on the 3F Aortic Bioprosthesis, model 1000. In addition, the restructuring of this agreement will provide 3F Therapeutics with a significant source of new capital, enabling us to achieve our clinical development and operating goals," said Walter A. Cuevas, president and CEO of 3F Therapeutics. "This transaction also frees up human resources within 3F that were previously dedicated to manufacturing Edwards products," concluded Mr. Cuevas.
