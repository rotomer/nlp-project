NEWS RELEASE
 
 
IRVINE, Calif., July 21 , 2005
 Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE: EW), the world leader in products and technologies to treat advanced cardiovascular disease, today reported net income for the quarter ended June 30, 2005 of $13.9 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, compared to net income $25.5 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, for the same period in 2004.  Adjusted net income, e
xcluding the special items detailed in the reconciliation tables below, was $32.3 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, compared to $26.5 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, in the comparable period of the previous year.
 
Second quarter net sales increased 10.1 percent to $258.2 million, compared to $234.6 million in the same quarter last year.  Foreign exchange (FX) contributed $5.1 million and was more than offset by discontinued businesses, resulting in underlying sales growth of 11.6 percent.
 
"This quarter's results were driven by strong underlying growth in every product line, particularly in Heart Valve Therapy," said Michael A. Mussallem, Edwards Lifesciences' chairman and CEO.  "Sales performance was solid in all regions, with particular strength in the U.S. and Europe."
 
 
Sales Results
 
For the second quarter, the company reported Heart Valve Therapy sales of $125.7 million, a 17.3 percent increase compared to the same quarter last year, with FX contributing $1.9 million to the growth. 
"This quarter's growth was driven by sales of new, premium-priced products, including the PERIMOUNT Magna valve, the Magna valve with the ThermaFix process and the Theon mitral valve system," said Mussallem.  "
Based on the strength of this quarter's sales and the continued momentum of new products, we are confident that we will exceed our previously stated goal of 10 percent underlying Heart Valve Therapy sales growth for the full year."
 
Critical Care sales of $81.6 million grew 7.9 percent compared to last year's quarter, with FX contributing $2.0 million to the growth.  Growth was due primarily to strong pressure monitoring sales resulting from market share gains, sales of advanced technology catheters and an expanded hemofiltration product line in Europe.
 
Cardiac Surgery Systems sales for the quarter were $26.2 million compared to $26.0 million for the same period last year.  TMR laser and cannula sales growth, as well as FX gains, were offset by discontinued businesses.
 
Vascular sales grew 10.5 percent compared to
the same period in 2004 to
$16.9 million,
led by sales of interventional products and modest FX gains.  "Throughout the quarter, we continued to expand the availability of LifeStent products to additional accounts, and we plan to introduce several new products later this year," Mussallem said.
 
Sales of Other Distributed Products declined to $7.8 million in the quarter compared to $10.5 million in the year ago period due to the discontinued Japan pacemaker business.
 
D
omestic and international sales for the second quarter grew to $119.0 million and $139.2 million, respectively.
Additional Operating Results
 
For the quarter, Edwards' gross profit margin increased to 62.1 percent from 60.6 percent in the same period last year.  The increase was primarily due to sales of higher margin heart valve products.
 
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $90.1 million for the quarter, or 34.9 percent of sales, compared to $81.0 million in the year ago period.  The increase in SG&A was due primarily to higher sales and marketing expenses and higher international expenses due to FX.  Research and development expenses of $24.2 million increased 16.9 percent compared to the prior year's quarter, primarily attributable to increased investments in percutaneous valve programs.
 
During the quarter, the company recorded a $27.6 million net pretax charge from special items, primarily related to the previously announced restructuring of the company's heart valve development and supply agreements with 3F Therapeutics.
 
Long-term debt at June 30 was $269.6 million, resulting in a debt-to-cap ratio of 28.9 percent.  Free cash flow generated during the quarter was $45.6 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $32.6 million minus capital expenditures of $9.8 million and excluding $22.8 million related to the 3F Therapeutics transaction.
 
In the quarter, the company repurchased approximately 80,000 shares of common stock for $3.5 million.
 
Six-Month Results
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2005, the company recorded net income of $45.1 million compared to a net loss of $36.6 million for the same period of 2004.  Excluding special items detailed in the reconciliation tables below, net income was $62.4 million, or $0.99 per diluted share, compared to $51.7 million, or $0.83 per diluted share, for the same period last year.
Net sales for the first six months of 2005 totaled $507.3 million, an increase of 8.0 percent over the same period last year.  Foreign exchange contributed $10.5 million to the period's growth and was more than offset by discontinued businesses.  Domestic and international sales for the six months were $230.2 million and $277.1 million, respectively.
 
2005 Outlook
 
our goals of increasing gross profit margin by more than 100 basis points, growing net income 13 to 15 percent, excluding the impact of special items, and generating free cash flow of $115 to $125 million.  At current FX levels, we project third quarter EPS of $0.43 to $0.45 and are comfortable at the higher end of our previous 2005 EPS guidance of $1.90 to $1.95, excluding special items.
We also expect to meet or exceed
"Based on our year-to-date results and outlook for the rest of the year, we remain solidly on track to achieve another year of strong performance and meet or exceed all of our 2005 financial goals," said Mussallem.  "Specifically, we expect total sales between $980 million to $1.02 billion.  
 
"Investment in our R&D pipeline is already demonstrating encouraging results, particularly in our proprietary tissue heart valve replacement and repair products, minimally invasive critical care monitoring and peripheral stent product lines," continued Mussallem.  "The strength of our core franchises provides a strong platform for sustainable growth.  Additionally, we remain very optimistic about the potential of our innovative percutaneous valve programs as we continue to lead the development in this field."

Notes to the Unaudited Reconciliation Schedules
 
Certain disclosures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") contained in this discussion are accompanied by disclosures that are not prepared in conformity with GAAP.  These non-GAAP disclosures exclude certain items from the GAAP presentations.  Management has determined that these non-GAAP disclosures provide (1) a more meaningful, consistent comparison of the Company's operating results for the periods presented, on a basis consistent with management's means of evaluating operating performance, and (2) additional information for investors to assess changes between periods that better reflect the Company's ongoing operations. The items included in these non-GAAP disclosures, and the basis for excluding them, are set forth below:
 
The Company incurred purchased in-process research and development expenses on the acquisition of PVT last year.  Given the materiality and unusual nature of these expenses relative to the operating results for the periods presented, these expenses have been excluded in the Adjusted Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations and the Unaudited Reconciliation of Consolidated Statements of Operations.
In-Process Research and Development -
 
The Company generated certain special credits and charges, related to (i) the 2005 sale of the Japan Perfusion Products business, (ii) the Japan realignment in 2005, (iii) the impairment of certain investments in 2005 and 2004, (iv) the restructure of the 3F agreements in 2005, and (iv) the 2004 termination of its Lifepath AAA program and its Interventional Cardiology products. Given the materiality and unusual nature of these items relative to the operating results for the periods presented, these items have been excluded in the Adjusted Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations and the Unaudited Reconciliation of Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Other Items -
 
The Company has exited certain businesses during the periods presented.  In light of the significance of the impact these businesses had on the profitability of the Company, the results of these businesses have been excluded in the Reconciliation of Sales by Product Line and Region.
Results of Discontinued Businesses 
 
- Fluctuation in exchange rates impacts the comparative results and growth rates of the Company's underlying business.  The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations have been excluded in the Reconciliation of Sales by Product Line and Region. Management believes that excluding these impacts helps explain changes in the fundamental business operations.
