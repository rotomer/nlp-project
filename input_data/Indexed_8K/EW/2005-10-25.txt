NEWS RELEASE
 
 
 
 
 
IRVINE, Calif., October 25, 2005
 Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE: EW), the world leader in products and technologies to treat advanced cardiovascular disease, today reported a net loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 of $4.4 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, compared to net income of $12.4 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, for the same period in 2004.  Adjusted net income, which e
xcludes the special items detailed in the reconciliation tables below, was $29.0 million compared to $23.5 million in the comparable period of the previous year.  Adjusted earnings per diluted share grew 21.1 percent to $0.46 per share, compared to $0.38 per share for the same period last year.
 
Third quarter net sales increased 7.2 percent to $240.9 million, compared to $224.8 million in the same quarter last year.  Foreign exchange (FX) contributed $1.5 million and was more than offset by discontinued businesses, resulting in underlying sales growth of 8.2 percent.
 
"We are pleased to report another solid quarter for Edwards Lifesciences, led by strong sales growth in our leading Heart Valve Therapy and Critical Care franchises," said Michael A. Mussallem, chairman and CEO.  "Consistent performance around the globe, with particular strength in the U.S., continues to drive increased sales growth."
Sales Results
 
For the third quarter, the company reported Heart Valve Therapy sales of $112.9 million, an 11.8 percent increase compared to the same quarter last year.  "Our innovative tissue heart valve and repair products continued to drive market share gains this quarter," said Mussallem.  "In the U.S., Heart Valve Therapy sales grew 15 percent due to the continuing penetration of PERIMOUNT Magna and ThermaFix.  Additionally this quarter, we introduced the Magna mitral heart valve in Europe and look forward to its U.S. market launch in the first half of 2006, pending regulatory approval."
 
Critical Care sales of $78.1 million grew 8.5 percent compared to last year's quarter.  Growth was due primarily to strong pressure monitoring sales resulting from market share gains and sales of advanced technology catheters.
 
Cardiac Surgery Systems sales for the third quarter were $27.4 million compared to $27.5 million for the same period last year, as the expected difficult year-over-year comparison of TMR sales and the impact of discontinued businesses more than offset cannula sales growth and FX gains.
 
Vascular sales increased to $15.6 million and grew 9.1 percent compared to the same period in 2004.  Third quarter sales of LifeStent products were slightly more than $2 million, and fourth quarter sales are expected to be $3 million.
 
Sales of Other Distributed Products declined to $6.9 million in the quarter compared to $10.0 million in the year ago period, due primarily to the discontinued pacemaker business in Japan.
 
D
omestic and international sales for the third quarter were $113.0 million and $127.9 million, respectively.
 
Additional Operating Results
 
For the quarter, Edwards' gross profit margin increased to 62.3 percent from 60.9 percent in the same period last year, primarily due to the increase in sales of higher margin heart valve products.
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses were 35.7 percent of sales for the quarter, or $85.9 million, compared to 35.5 percent of sales in the year ago period.  Research and development (R&D) expenses of $24.0 million increased 9.6 percent compared to the prior year's quarter, primarily attributable to increased investments in percutaneous valve programs.
 
During the quarter, the company recorded a $21.4 million net pretax special charge, primarily related to a previously announced $15.0 million contribution to the Edwards Lifesciences charitable fund, and a write-down of an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate. 
In addition to these special charges, the company also recorded a $15.8 million tax expense related to a distribution of approximately $260 million from its foreign affiliates, and a $1.2 million pretax charge for an in-process R&D expense associated with a technology acquisition
.
 
Long-term debt at September 30 was $251.5 million, resulting in a debt-to-cap ratio of 27.6 percent.  Free cash flow generated during the quarter was $43.2 million, which is defined as cash flow from operating activities of $39.0 million minus capital expenditures of $10.8 million, plus $15.0 million related to the charitable fund contribution.
 
In the quarter, the company repurchased approximately 460,000 shares of common stock for $20.4 million.
 
Nine-Month Results
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2005, the company recorded net income of $40.7 million compared to a net loss of $24.2 million for the same period in 2004.  Excluding special items detailed in the reconciliation tables below, net income was $91.4 million compared to $75.2 million for the same period last year.  Adjusted earnings per diluted share grew 19.8 percent to $1.45 per share, compared to $1.21 per diluted share for the same period last year.
 
Net sales for the first nine months of 2005 totaled $748.2 million, an increase of 7.7 percent over the same period last year.  Foreign exchange contributed $12.0 million to the growth and was more than offset by discontinued businesses, resulting in an underlying year-to-date sales growth rate of 8.7 percent.
 
Domestic and international sales for the nine months were $343.2 million and $405.0 million, respectively.
 
Free cash flow generated in the first nine months was $103.7 million, calculated as cash flow from operating activities of $92.5 million minus capital expenditures of $26.6 million, plus special items totaling $37.8 million.
 
2005 Outlook
 
 "Based on our strong year-to-date performance, we expect to meet or exceed all of our financial goals this year," said Mussallem.  "For 2005, we now expect total sales of approximately $1 billion, gross profit margin to be slightly above 62 percent of sales, net income growth of more than 18 percent excluding the impact of special items, and free cash flow of substantially more than $125 million.  And, at current FX levels and excluding special items, we are comfortable with the First Call mean EPS estimates for both the fourth quarter and full year 2005.
 
"The sales growth in our leading franchises demonstrates the underlying strength of Edwards' base businesses, and together with our near-term initiatives, moves us closer to achieving consistent double-digit sales growth," concluded Mussallem.  "Additionally, the potential of our innovative percutaneous valve technologies to address the needs of a large, untreated patient population suffering from heart valve disease represents a truly transformational growth opportunity for Edwards Lifesciences.  We look forward to providing additional details about our growth strategy and 2006 outlook at our upcoming Investor Conference next month."

Notes to the Unaudited Reconciliation Schedules
 
Certain disclosures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") contained in this discussion are accompanied by disclosures that are not prepared in conformity with GAAP.  These non-GAAP disclosures exclude certain items from the GAAP presentations.  Management has determined that these non-GAAP disclosures provide (1) a more meaningful, consistent comparison of the Company's operating results for the periods presented, on a basis consistent with management's means of evaluating operating performance, and (2) additional information for investors to assess changes between periods that better reflect the Company's ongoing operations. The items included in these non-GAAP disclosures, and the basis for excluding them, are set forth below:
 
- The Company incurred purchased in-process research and development expenses related to a technology acquisition for $1.2 million in the third quarter of 2005. In the first and third quarters of 2004, the Company incurred purchased in-process research and development expenses of $81.0 million for the acquisition of PVT and $12.3 million for the purchase of ev3, Inc. mitral valve repair program, respectively.  Given the materiality and unusual nature of these expenses relative to the operating results for the periods presented, these expenses have been excluded in the Adjusted Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations and the Unaudited Reconciliation of Consolidated Statements of Operations.
In-Process Research and Development
 
The Company incurred certain special charges and credits in 2005 and 2004, related to the following:

7)
             
an intellectual property litigation gain for $2.5 million in the third quarter of 2005
8)
             
 
Given the materiality and unusual nature of these items relative to the operating results for the periods presented, these items have been excluded in the Adjusted Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations and the Unaudited Reconciliation of Consolidated Statements of Operations.
 
The Company has exited certain businesses during the periods presented.  In light of the significance of the impact these businesses had on the profitability of the Company, the results of these businesses have been detailed in the Reconciliation of Sales by Product Line and Region.
Results of Discontinued Businesses 
 
- Fluctuation in exchange rates impacts the comparative results and growth rates of the Company's underlying business.  The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations have been detailed in the Reconciliation of Sales by Product Line and Region. Management believes that excluding these impacts helps explain changes in the fundamental business operations.
