IRVINE, Calif., February 2, 2006
 
Fourth quarter net sales increased 5.3 percent to $249.7 million, compared to $237.1 million in the same quarter last year.  Growth this quarter was negatively impacted by $5.1 million in foreign exchange (FX) and $5.5 million of discontinued businesses.
 
"Strong sales growth in all regions and across all of our market-leading franchises resulted in total underlying growth of 10.4 percent this quarter," said Michael A. Mussallem, Edwards Lifesciences' chairman and CEO.
 
 
EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES' FOURTH QUARTER 2005 RESULTS
 
Sales Results
 
For the fourth quarter, the company reported Heart Valve Therapy sales of $114.0 million, an 8.6 percent increase compared to the same quarter last year, with FX negatively impacting sales by $2.5 million.  "Heart Valve Therapy growth was 11.2 percent on an underlying basis this quarter, driven by our market-leading PERIMOUNT tissue valves and our innovative, disease-specific heart valve repair products," said Mussallem.
 
Critical Care sales of $84.5 million grew 6.2 percent compared to last year's quarter.  On a constant currency basis,
fourth quarter sales grew 9.1 percent, due primarily to sales of advanced technology catheters, hemofiltration products and the recently launched Edwards FloTrac minimally invasive monitoring system.
 
Cardiac Surgery Systems sales for the quarter declined to $25.8 million from $26.8 million in the same quarter last year, due to the previously announced discontinuation of the company's Japan perfusion products business.
 
the same period in 2004, led by sales of Edwards LifeStent peripheral stents, which were approximately $3.0 million for the fourth quarter.
Vascular sales were $17.3 million, an 11.6 percent increase compared to
 
Sales of Other Distributed Products were $8.1 million in the quarter compared to $10.2 million in the year ago period.  The decline was due to the impact of the discontinued pacemaker business in Japan.
 
Domestic and international sales for the fourth quarter were $112.7 million and $137.0 million, respectively.
 
Additional Operating Results
 
For the quarter, Edwards' gross profit margin improved to 64.1 percent from 61.5 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, primarily driven by an increasingly profitable product mix and a favorable FX impact.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $87.1 million for the quarter, or 34.9 percent of sales, compared to $82.7 million in the year ago period.  The increase in SG&A was due primarily to higher sales and marketing expenses related to the company's growth initiatives, and partially offset by FX.  Research and development expenses of $25.8 million increased 10.3 percent compared to the prior year's quarter, attributable primarily to investments in percutaneous valve programs and the Edwards FloTrac sensor.
 
During the quarter, the company recorded a $5.0 million net income benefit (detailed in the attached schedule), which resulted primarily from a gain on the sale of the company's ePTFE vascular graft business, the realization of a tax benefit, and charges from realignment expenses and royalty settlements.
 
Free cash flow generated during the quarter was $36.4 million, calculated as cash flow from operating activities of $58.3 million minus capital expenditures of $21.9 million.  Long-term debt at December 31 was $316.1 million, resulting in a debt-to-cap ratio of 31.4 percent.  The increase over prior periods was attributable to higher foreign-based debt associated with the company's repatriation of foreign earnings.
 
In the quarter, the company repurchased approximately 403,000 shares of common stock for $17.1 million.
 
Twelve-Month Results
 
For the 12 months ended December 31, 2005, the company recorded net income of $79.3 million, or $1.27 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.7 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, for 2004.  Excluding special items described in the attached schedules, non-GAAP net income for 2005 increased 20.1 percent to $125.0 million from $104.1 million in 2004.  Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share grew to $1.98 per share, compared to $1.67 per share for the previous year.
Sales for the year totaled $997.9 million, an increase of 7.1 percent compared to 2004.  Excluding the impact of discontinued businesses and FX, the growth rate was 9.1 percent.  Domestic and international sales for the 12 months were $455.9 million and $542.0 million, respectively.
 
Free cash flow generated for the year was $140.1 million, calculated as cash flow from operating activities of $150.8 million minus capital expenditures of $48.5 million plus $37.8 million related to the company's charitable fund contribution and the restructuring of the 3F Therapeutics agreement.
 
2006 Outlook
 
" Mussallem stated.
"Based on the strong and sustainable performance of our market-leading core franchises, as well as the expected contribution from our new products, we believe Edwards is ideally positioned for continued growth and profitability in 2006,
 
150 to 200 basis points, delivering non-GAAP net income growth of 12 to 15 percent excluding the impact of special items and stock option expensing, and generating free cash flow of $140 to $150 million.
"We are confident in our ability to achieve our 2006 financial goals.  These include generating total sales between $1.02 to $1.06 billion, increasing our gross profit margin by
 
"Finally, based on current FX rates, we are raising our 2006 sales estimate by $10 million to $1.03 billion to $1.07 billion.  Additionally, we are comfortable with the first quarter 2006 First Call mean EPS estimate of $0.54, and we are raising our full year EPS estimate by two cents to $2.16 to $2.26.  This excludes the expensing of stock options, which will reduce EPS by approximately $0.24," Mussallem concluded.

To supplement the consolidated financial results prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (
GAAP
), the Company uses non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain items, such as in-process research and development expenses, special charges and credits, results of discontinued businesses, and fluctuations in exchange rates.  Management does not consider the excluded items part of day-to-day business or reflective of the core operational activities of the Company as they result from transactions outside the ordinary course of business.  Management uses non-GAAP financial measures internally for strategic decision making, forecasting future results and evaluating current performance.  Guidance is provided only on a non-GAAP basis due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting such items.  By disclosing non-GAAP financial measures, management intends to provide investors with a more meaningful, consistent comparison of the Company

Non-GAAP Financial Information
 
To supplement the consolidated financial results prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), the Company uses non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain items, such as in-process research and development expenses, special charges and credits, results of discontinued businesses, and fluctuations in exchange rates.  Management does not consider the excluded items part of day-to-day business or reflective of the core operational activities of the Company as they result from transactions outside the ordinary course of business.  Management uses non-GAAP financial measures internally for strategic decision making, forecasting future results and evaluating current performance.  Guidance is provided only on a non-GAAP basis due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting such items. By disclosing non-GAAP financial measures, management intends to provide investors with a more meaningful, consistent comparison of the Company's core operating results and trends for the periods presented.
 
Non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP; therefore, the information is not necessarily comparable to other companies and should be considered as a supplement to, not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. 
 
The items excluded from the GAAP financial results are set forth below:
 
- The Company incurred purchased in-process research and development expenses related to a technology acquisition for $1.2 million in the third quarter of 2005. In the first and third quarters of 2004, the Company incurred purchased in-process research and development expenses of $81.0 million for the acquisition of PVT and $12.3 million for the purchase of ev3, Inc. mitral valve repair program, respectively.  Given the magnitude and unusual nature of these expenses relative to the operating results for the periods presented, these expenses have been excluded in non-GAAP net income.
In-Process Research and Development
 
- The Company incurred certain special charges and credits in 2005 and 2004, related to the following:
Special Charges, net
 
1)    
Restructure 3F Agreement:  $22.8 million charge for restructuring the 3F agreements in the second quarter of 2005;
 
2)    
Gain on Sale of Businesses:  $13.1 million net gain on the sale of the ePTFE vascular graft business in fourth quarter of 2005; $7.7 million gain on the sale of the Japan Perfusion Products business in the first quarter of 2005;
 
3)

4)    
Charitable Fund Contribution:  $15.0 million contribution to Edwards Lifesciences charitable fund in the third quarter of 2005, and a $5.0 million contribution to the charitable fund in fourth quarter of 2004;
 
5)    
Realignment Expenses:  $4.9 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2005 of primarily severance expenses resulting from a resource realignment, $5.7 million charge for the Japan realignment in the first quarter of 2005;
 
6)    
Royalty Settlements & Litigation Gain:  $5.4 million charge related to two royalty settlements in the fourth quarter of 2005, and a $2.5 million gain related to intellectual property litigation in the third quarter of 2005;
 
7)

9)    
Income Taxes:  $8.0M in the fourth quarter related to the reversal of a valuation allowance related to a capital loss, $15.8 million tax expense in the third quarter of 2005 related to repatriation.
 
Given the magnitude and unusual nature of these special charges and credits relative to the operating results for the periods presented, these items have been excluded in non-GAAP net income.
 
 The Company has exited certain businesses during the periods presented.  As discontinued businesses do not have a continuing contribution to operations, management believes that excluding such items from the Company's growth provides investors with a means of evaluating the Company's on-going operations. In light of the significance of the impact these businesses had on the growth of the Company, the results of these businesses have been detailed in the Reconciliation of Sales by Product Line and Region.
Results of Discontinued Businesses
 
- Fluctuation in exchange rates impacts the comparative results and growth rates of the Company's underlying business. Management believes that excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations from its growth provides investors a more meaningful comparison to historical financial results. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations has been detailed in the Reconciliation of Sales by Product Line and Region.
