ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
The annual meeting of stockholders for the election of directors and the transaction of other business shall be held at such time and date as shall be determined by the Board of Directors.
(a)
          
Each director to be elected by stockholders shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to the director at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present by the holders of shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the election of directors; provided that if the number of nominees for director exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy at any such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors.  For purposes of this Subsection (b), a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed 50% of the number of votes cast with respect to that director's election.  Votes cast shall include votes to withhold authority and exclude abstentions with respect to that director's election.  If directors are to be elected by a plurality, stockholders shall be permitted to withhold votes from a nominee but shall not be permitted to vote against a nominee.
(b)
          
If at any meeting for the election of directors a nominee for director who is an incumbent director is not elected and no successor has been elected at such meeting, the director shall promptly tender to the Board his or her offer of resignation as a director.  Such resignation shall be made subject to the Board's acceptance.  The Compensation and Governance Committee shall make a recommendation to the Board as to whether to accept or reject the tendered offer of resignation, or whether other action should be taken.  In determining whether to accept or reject the tendered offer of resignation, the Compensation and Governance Committee shall be entitled to consider all factors believed relevant by the members of such Committee, including without limitation: (1) any stated reason for the director not receiving the required vote and whether the underlying cause or causes are curable, (2) the factors, if any, set forth in the guidelines or other policies that are to be considered by the Compensation and Governance Committee in evaluating potential candidates for the Board as such factors relate to each director who has offered his or her resignation, (3) the length of service of such director, (4) the effect of such resignation on the Corporation's compliance with
any law, rule, regulation, stock exchange listing standards or contractual obligations, (5) such director's contributions to the Corporation, and (6) any other factors that the Compensation and Governance Committee deems to be in the best interests of the Corporation.  No director who has tendered his or her offer of resignation may participate in the Committee's recommendation.  If all of the members of the Compensation and Governance Committee have tendered their offers of resignations, then the Board shall act on the offers of resignation.
The Board shall act on the tendered offers of resignation, taking into account the recommendation of the Compensation and Governance Committee, and shall publicly disclose (by press release, a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission or other broadly disseminated means of communication) its decision regarding the tendered offers of resignation and the rationale behind the decision within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results.  In determining whether to accept or reject any offer of resignation, the Board shall be entitled to consider all of the factors considered by the Compensation and Governance Committee and any additional information and factors that the Board believes to be relevant.  No director who has tendered his or her offer of resignation may participate in the Board's decision.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the acceptance by the Board of all of the then pending offers of resignation would result in the Corporation having fewer than five directors who were in office prior to the applicable election, the Board may elect to extend such 90-day period by an additional 90 days if the Board shall determine that such an extension is in the best interests of the Corporation.
If any incumbent director's offer of resignation is not accepted by the Board, such director shall continue to serve until the next annual meeting or until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified, subject to such director's earlier death, resignation, disqualification or removal.  If a director's offer of resignation is accepted by the Board pursuant to this Subsection (b), or if a nominee for director is not elected and the nominee is not an incumbent director, then the Board, in its sole discretion, may fill any resulting vacancy pursuant to the provisions of Article V, Section 2 below or may decrease the size of the Board pursuant to the provisions of the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation.
Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the following procedures shall be eligible for election as directors of the Corporation, except as may be otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation with respect to the right of holders of Preferred Stock of the Corporation to nominate and elect a specified number of directors in certain circumstances.  Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at any annual meeting of stockholders, or at any special meeting of stockholders called for the purpose of electing directors, (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof) or (ii) by any stockholder of the Corporation (A) who is a stockholder of record or beneficial owner on the date of the giving of the notice provided for in this and on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting and (B) who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this .
