The Indemnitor shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim if the Third-Party Claim seeks any relief other than money damages, including any type of injunctive or other equitable relief.

The Indemnitor may elect to participate in such proceedings, negotiations or defense at any time at its own expense.  The Indemnitee will have full control of such defense and proceedings, including (except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence) any settlement thereof.
 
  Indemnification payments under this shall be paid by the Indemnitor without reduction for any tax benefits available to the Indemnitee.

Exhibit 99.1
 
EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION
 
Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements
 
On January 11, 2008, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation ("Edwards" or "Company") completed its disposition of certain assets related to the Edwards LifeStent peripheral vascular product line.  Edwards received an initial cash payment of $74 million at closing, and will receive an additional $65 million in cash upon the achievement of certain milestones, including the receipt of U.S. regulatory approval of Edwards' LifeStent products for a superficial femoral artery indication and the transfer of LifeStent device manufacturing.  Edwards will provide transition services for a period of up to two and a half years following the closing.
 
The unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed balance sheet as of September 30, 2007 reflects the financial position of the Company after giving effect to the disposition of the LifeStent product line, and reflects receipt of the $74 million initial cash payment, as if the disposition occurred on September 30, 2007.  The unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 and for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflect the disposition as if it had occurred as of January 1, 2006.
& nbsp;
The unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed financial statements include specific assumptions and adjustments related to the sale of the LifeStent product line as described in the accompanying notes.  The adjustments are based upon presently available information and assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of this filing.  However, actual adjustments may differ materially from the information presented.
 
The accompanying unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto of the Company.  The unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the operating results or financial position that would have occurred if the transaction had been consummated at the times indicated, nor is it necessarily indicative of the future financial position and the results of operations of the Company.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The pro forma adjustments footnoted in the unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed financial statements are explained below:
 
(a)
        
These adjustments represent the results of operations directly attributable to the LifeStent product line, net of Edwards' contract manufacturing that would have been performed for Bard assuming the agreement commenced on January 1, 2006 (the contract manufacturing volume is assumed to be the same as the actual historical volume).  LifeStent product line revenues of $22.6 million and $17.5 million, respectively, and contract manufacturing revenues of $12.9 million and $12.6 million, respectively, are reflected for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 and for the year ended December 30, 2006.
 
(b)
       
These adjustments record the sale of certain LifeStent assets and the receipt of $74 million cash as if the transaction occurred on September 30, 2007 in the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheet.
 
(c)
        
Recorded as liabilities in the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheet at September 30, 2007 are 1) employee severance payments of $10.2 million, 2) estimated transaction closing costs of $1.4 million, 3) $4.9 million and $2.4 million, respectively, of current and long term deferred revenue related to the contract manufacturing arrangement, and 4) the net tax effect of the transaction.
 
"
(d)
       
This amount represents the elimination of a pro rata allocation of goodwill associated with the Company's LifeStent Business due to the disposition of certain LifeStent assets as required by FAS 142 "
Goodwill and Other Intangibles.
 
(e)
        
This amount represents the estimated transaction loss after taxes, as if the transaction occurred on September 30, 2007.
