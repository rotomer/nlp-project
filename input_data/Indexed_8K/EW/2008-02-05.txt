NEWS RELEASE
 
 
IRVINE, Calif., February 5, 2008
 Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE: EW), a world leader in products and technologies to treat advanced cardiovascular disease, today reported net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2007 of $15.8 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, compared to net income of $20.7 million, or $0.34 per diluted share for the same period in 2006.  Excluding special items detailed in the reconciliation table below, fourth quarter 2007 net income was $33.7 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, compared to net income of $33.7 million, or $0.55 per diluted share for the previous
year.
 
Fourth quarter net sales increased 10.3 percent to $293.0 million, compared to $265.6 million in the same quarter last year.  Underlying sales growth was 9.7 percent excluding the impact of $11.4 million of sales from discontinued products and a $13.4 million contribution from foreign exchange.
 
"Our Critical Care franchise achieved 10 percent sales growth for full year 2007, capped by a very strong fourth quarter," said Michael A. Mussallem, Edwards Lifesciences' chairman and CEO.  "In the quarter, our market-leading Heart Valve Therapy franchise reported 9 percent growth and was led by strong international sales.
 
"With the successful launch of our SAPIEN valve in Europe, transcatheter heart valves contributed over $2 million of sales in the fourth quarter.  We continue to build momentum and are confident we will achieve more than $20 million of global transcatheter heart valve sales in 2008," continued Mussallem.
 
"W
e are the first company to provide the Ascendra transapical delivery system, which was recently approved for sale in Europe and just last week was cleared by the FDA to be included in our
U.S.
PARTNER trial."
EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES' REPORTS STRONG FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS
 
Sales Results
 
For the fourth quarter, the company reported Heart Valve Therapy sales of $131.4 million, which included a $6.4 million positive contribution from foreign exchange. 
"Strong sales growth in international markets, driven by recent product launches and share gains, is offsetting a U.S. market that remains competitive," said Mussallem.
 
Critical Care sales of $113.0 million grew 20.0 percent over last year, which included a $4.8 million positive contribution from foreign exchange.  "Sales of new products, led by our FloTrac system, continued to be the biggest growth driver this quarter," added Mussallem.  "Our world-leading pressure monitoring products continued to gain share.  In addition, growth was boosted by a sharp up-tick in sales of hardware products."
 
Cardiac Surgery Systems sales for the quarter were $15.1 million, a decline from $21.9 million in the same quarter last year due to the 2006 sale of the company's Brazil-based perfusion product line and this year's sale of the TMR product line.  "During the quarter, we completed our acquisition of CardioVations and are excited about integrating these minimally invasive products into our portfolio," stated Mussallem.
 
Vascular sales grew 19.5 percent to $25.1 million compared to the same period in 2006.  "The strong growth this quarter was driven by global sales of the LifeStent product line,
" Mussallem said.  "Consistent with our long-term strategy, we completed the sale of the LifeStent product line in January."
 
Domestic and international sales for the fourth quarter were $123.9 million and $169.1 million, respectively.
 
Additional Operating Results
 
For the quarter, Edwards' gross profit margin was 66.0 percent compared to 63.3 percent in the same period last year
, driven primarily by a more profitable product mix.
 
Selling
, general and administrative expenses were $114.5 million for the quarter, or 39.1 percent of sales, compared to $95.1 million last year.  This increase was due to expected higher levels of spending for both the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve launch in Europe and sales-related costs in the U.S., as well as the impact from foreign exchange.
 
Research and development expenses were $33.5 million for the quarter, or 11.4 percent of sales, compared to $30.0 million last year. The increased level of spending was focused primarily on the company's transcatheter valve and critical care development efforts.
During the quarter, Edwards recorded a net $25.8 million pre-tax special charge, primarily resulting from worldwide realignment charges of $13.9 million, principally related to the recently completed sale of the LifeStent product line, and pension plan related charges of $11.2 million, largely related to the previously announced closing of the company's Puerto Rico employee pension plan.  The total charge is detailed in the reconciliation table below.
 
Free cash flow generated during the quarter was $63.0 million, calculated as cash flow from operating activities of $76.9 million minus capital expenditures of $13.9 million.  Total debt at December 31, 2007 was $211.7 million.  Cash and cash equivalents were $141.8 million at the end of the quarter, resulting in net debt of $69.9 million.
 
In the quarter, the company repurchased 475,000 shares of common stock for $23.7 million.
 
Twelve-Month Results
 
For the full year ended December 31, 2007, the company recorded net income of $113.0 million, or $1.87 per diluted share, compared to $130.5 million, or $2.10 per diluted share for the same period of 2006. Excluding special items detailed in the reconciliation table below, non-GAAP net income for full year 2007 was $129.4 million, or $2.13 per diluted share, compared to net income of $127.7 million, or $2.06 per diluted share for the previous year.
 
Net sales for the year totaled $1.091 billion, an increase of 5.2 percent over the same period last year.  Underlying growth was 6.6 percent for the full year as foreign exchange contributed $30.2 million to the period's growth and was more than offset by discontinued businesses of $42.8 million.  Domestic and international sales for the full year were $486.6 million and $604.5 million, respectively.
 
Free cash flow generated for the year was $153.2 million, calculated as cash flow from operating activities of $210.2 million minus capital expenditures of $57.0 million.
2008 Outlook
 
"Edwards is very well positioned for a strong 2008, highlighted by a number of new product launches and progress on our pioneering transcatheter heart valve platform," said Mussallem.  "We also will remain focused on achieving our annual financial goals, which include generating total sales between $1.160 to $1.210 billion, increasing our gross profit margin by 100 to 150 basis points, and generating free cash flow of $155 to $165 million.  Finally, we estimate that first quarter 2008 diluted EPS will be between $0.47 and $0.51, and for the full year between $2.32 and $2.40."

This news release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the company's ability to achieve financial goals for sales, gross profit margin, net income, earnings per share and free cash flow; regulatory approval of new products in, and competitive dynamics associated with, the company's heart valve therapy product line; the continued adoption and sales of the FloTrac system; the timing and progress of clinical studies relating to the company's transcatheter valve technologies and the market opportunity for these products; and the impact on the company's results of foreign exchange and special items. Forward-looking statements are based on estimates and assumptions made by management of the company and are believed to be reasonable, though they are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict.
Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or experience to differ materially from that expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.  Factors that could cause actual results or experience to differ materially from that expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements include the opportunities for the company's transcatheter valve programs and the ability of the company to continue to lead in the development of this field; the success and timing of new product launches; the impact of currency exchange rates; the timing or results of pending or future clinical trials; actions by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory agencies; and other risks detailed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006.
 
To supplement the consolidated financial results prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), the company uses non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain items, such as in-process research and development expenses, special charges and gains, results of discontinued product lines, and fluctuations in exchange rates.  Management does not consider the excluded items part of day-to-day business or reflective of the core operational activities of the company as they result from transactions outside the ordinary course of business.  Management uses non-GAAP financial measures internally for strategic decision making, forecasting future results and evaluating current performance.  Certain guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis that excludes special items and foreign exchange fluctuations due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting such items.  By disclosing non-GAAP financial measures, management intends to provide investors with a more meaningful, consistent comparison of the company's core operating results and trends for the periods presented.  Non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP; therefore, the information is not necessarily comparable to other companies and should be considered as a supplement to, not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
