Item 8.01.              Other Events.
 
On March 2, 2009, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (the "Company") learned that its financial printer, Merrill Corporation, had erroneously changed the name under which the Company's IDEA (formerly EDGAR) filings appear to "Alliance HealthCare Services, Inc."  Due to this error, all documents in the Company's IDEA file, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008, filed on March 2, 2009, are currently filed under the name of Alliance HealthCare Services, Inc.  The Company did not change its name and has no affiliation with Alliance HealthCare Services, Inc., and the references to Alliance HealthCare Services, Inc., in its IDEA file and any individual filings contained therein are incorrect.  With the filing of this Current Report on Form 8-K, the name under which the Company's IDEA filings appear will be changed to the correct name, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation.
