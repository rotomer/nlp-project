NEWS RELEASE
 
 
IRVINE, Calif., July 20, 2009
 Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE: EW), a world leader in products and technologies to treat advanced cardiovascular disease, today reported net income for the quarter ended June 30, 2009 of $47.5 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, compared to net income of $39.7 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, for the same period in 2008.  Excluding special items detailed in the reconciliation table below, second quarter 2009 net income was $46.4 million, or $0.79 per diluted share, compared to net income of $39.0 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, for the same period last year. Second quarter diluted earnings per share increased 20.9 percent over last year.  Excluding special items, diluted earnings per share grew 19.7 percent.
 
Second quarter net sales increased 2.4 percent to $335.5 million.  Underlying
(1)
 sales growth was 9.8 percent, which primarily excludes an $18.4
million
negative impact
from foreign exchange and the divestiture of the LifeStent product line
.
 
"Share gains across all regions drove double digit heart valve therapy growth, resulting in strong second quarter results
,
" said Michael A. Mussallem, Edwards Lifesciences' chairman and CEO.
 
"With the continued adoption of our transcatheter heart valves, we remain confident that we will reach more than $100 million in sales outside of the U.S. this year.  Additionally, we continue to make progress towards bringing this exciting technology to U.S. patients as we approach completion of our PARTNER trial enrollment
."
 
Sales Results
 
For the second quarter, the company reported Heart Valve Therapy sales of $182.1 million.  Underlying growth of 16.7 percent over the prior year excluded the impact of $10.2 million from foreign exchange and $4.1 million related to the re-launch of previously retrieved mitral valve repair products.
 
EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES REPORTS STRONG SECOND QUARTER
"Our Heart Valve Therapy sales growth was driven primarily by our Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter valve, which grew to $26.5 million in the quarter.  Based on our current performance and foreign exchange rates, we are in
creasing the midpoint of our prior Heart Valve Therapy sales guidance for 2009 by $25 million to $690 to $710 million
," said Mussallem.
 
Critical Care sales were $113.0 million for the quarter. Underlying growth of 2.3 percent over prior year excluded a $6.2 million reduction from foreign exchange. Sales of new products achieved strong growth for the quarter, while constraints on hospital capital spending had a continued impact on overall sales growth.
 
"We expect new product introductions to drive higher Critical Care growth rates in the second half of the year.  However, in light of the divestiture of our hemofiltration business, and continued weakness in hardware sales, we are lowering
our prior Critical Care sales guidance for 2009 by $20 million to $435 to $455 million,
" said Mussallem.
 
Cardiac Surgery Systems sales for the quarter were $24.1 million. Excluding foreign exchange, underlying growth was 8.5 percent over prior year due primarily to strong sales of minimally invasive surgery products.
 
Vascular sales were $16.3 million,
a decline from $24.9 million in the same quarter last year
due primarily to the divestiture of the LifeStent product line.
 
Domestic and international sales for the second quarter were $143.5 million and $192.0 million, respectively.
 
Additional Operating Results
 
For the quarter, Edwards' gross profit margin was 69.6 percent compared to 65.5 percent in the same period last year
.  This improvement was due primarily to product mix and the favorable impact of foreign exchange hedge agreements.
 
Selling
, general and administrative expenses were $128.5 million for the quarter, or 38.3 percent of sales, compared to $126.5 million in the prior year.  The increase, driven primarily by higher transcatheter heart valve sales and marketing expenses in Europe, was partially offset by foreign exchange.
 
Research and development expenses (R&D) for the quarter were $42.6 million, or 12.7 percent of sales.  As a result of additional spending on the company's transcatheter heart valve and FloTrac programs, R&D investments increased 20.3 percent compared to the prior year.
EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES REPORTS STRONG SECOND QUARTER
During the quarter, Edwards recorded a $1.5 million special charge related to the pending hemofiltration product line divestiture.
 
Free cash flow for the quarter was $66.1 million, calculated as cash from operating activities of $63.9 million, minus capital expenditures of $17.1 million, plus $19.3 million in tax payments related to the sale of the LifeStent product line.
 
Total debt at June 30, 2009 was $113.9 million.  Cash and cash equivalents were $183.1 million at the end of the quarter, resulting in net cash of $69.2 million.
 
During the quarter, the company repurchased 445,000 shares of common stock for $27.7 million.
 
Six-Month Results
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2009, the company recorded net income of $108.0 million, or $1.85 per diluted share, compared to $57.9 million, or $0.98 per diluted share for 2008.  Excluding special items detailed in the reconciliation table below, net income for the first six months in 2009 was $87.4 million, or $1.49 per diluted share, compared to $72.2 million, or $1.22 per diluted share the same period last year.  For the six months ended June 30, 2009, diluted earnings per share increased 88.8 percent over last year. Excluding special items, diluted earnings per share grew 22.1 percent.
 
Net sales for the first six months of 2009 increased 3.9 percent to $649.0 million.  Underlying sales growth was 10.6 percent, which primarily excludes a $28.4 million negative impact from foreign exchange.
 
Domestic and international sales for the six months were $278.4 million and $370.6 million, respectively.
 
During the first six months, the company repurchased 907,500 shares of common stock for $54.5 million.
 
2009 Outlook
 
"Overall, we have had a very successful first six months, and are expecting a strong second half of the year.  Our underlying sales growth estimate of 10 to 12 percent for 2009 remains unchanged and we expect to meet or exceed all of our previously stated financial goals," said Mussallem.
 
"Excluding special items, we estimate that third quarter 2009 diluted earnings per share will be between $0.66 and $0.70.  For full year 2009, we are raising our diluted earnings per share estimate to between $3.00 and $3.06, and we now expect to be at the upper end of our goal to grow diluted earnings per share by 15 to 19 percent."

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES REPORTS STRONG SECOND QUARTER
To supplement the consolidated financial results prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), the company uses non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain items, such as special charges and gains, results of discontinued and acquired product lines, and fluctuations in exchange rates.  Management does not consider the excluded items part of day-to-day business or reflective of the core operational activities of the company as they result from transactions outside the ordinary course of business.  Management uses non-GAAP financial measures internally for strategic decision making, forecasting future results and evaluating current performance.  Certain guidance is provided on a non-GAAP (or "underlying") basis that excludes special items and foreign exchange fluctuations due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting such items.  By disclosing non-GAAP financial measures, management intends to provide investors with a more meaningful, consistent comparison of the company's core operating results and trends for the periods presented.  Non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP; therefore, the information is not necessarily comparable to other companies and should be considered as a supplement to, not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION
Non-GAAP Financial Information
 
To supplement the consolidated financial results prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), the Company uses non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain items such as special charges and gains, results of discontinued products, and fluctuations in exchange rates.  Management does not consider the excluded items part of day-to-day business or reflective of the core operational activities of the Company as they result from transactions outside the ordinary course of business.
 
Management uses non-GAAP financial measures internally for strategic decision making, forecasting future results and evaluating current performance.  Certain guidance is provided only on a non-GAAP (or "underlying") basis that excludes special items and foreign exchange fluctuations due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting such items.  By disclosing non-GAAP financial measures, management intends to provide investors with a more meaningful, consistent comparison of the Company's core operating results and trends for the periods presented.
 
Non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP; therefore, the information is not necessarily comparable to other companies and should be considered as a supplement to, not a substitute for, nor superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
 
The items described below are excluded from the GAAP financial results in the reconciliations that follow:
 
Gross profit
- In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company increased by $4.7 million its non-GAAP gross profit to exclude the impact of its voluntary retrieval of certain ring repair products pending clearance of its 510k application submission from the Food and Drug Administration. Upon the return of most of these ring repair products to customers in the second quarter of 2009, the Company excluded the $4.1 million impact from its non-GAAP gross profit. Given the magnitude and unusual nature of this adjustment relative to the operating results for the period presented, the financial impact of the retrieval has been excluded from non-GAAP net income.
 
Special charges (gains), net
- The Company incurred certain special charges and gains in 2009 and 2008 related to the following:
 
1)
             
Milestone receipt and net loss on sale of assets: 
$1.5 million charge in the second quarter of 2009 for transaction costs and employee severance related to the pending sale of the hemofiltration product line; $8.1 million net loss on the sale of the LifeStent product line in the first quarter of 2008;  $27.0 million gain in the first quarter of 2009 for achieving a milestone associated with the LifeStent PMA approval;
 
2)
             
Sale of distribution rights:
 $2.8 million gain related to the sale of distribution rights in Europe of a specialty vascular graft in the first quarter of 2009;
 
3)
             
Reserve reversal: 
$1.0 million gain in the first quarter of 2009 resulting from completion of the Lifepath AAA clinical obligations;
 
4)
             
L
itigation settlement:
 $2.1 million charge for a litigation settlement in the first quarter of 2008;
 
5)
             
R
ealignment expenses, net:
 $1.3 million charge for executive severance in the first quarter of 2008 associated with the Company's business realignment, offset by a $1.4 million gain in the first quarter of 2008 from the reversal of previously accrued severance costs from the fourth quarter of 2007 related to the sale of the LifeStent product line; $0.8 million gain in the second quarter of 2008 from the reversal of previously accrued severance costs in the fourth quarter of 2007 related to the global reduction in workforce.
 
Given the magnitude and unusual nature of these special charges and gains relative to the operating results for the periods presented, these items have been excluded from non-GAAP net income.
 
Results of Discontinued and Other Products
 The Company has discontinued certain products during the periods presented.  As discontinued products do not have a continuing contribution to operations, management believes that excluding such items from the Company's sales growth provides investors with a means of evaluating the Company's on-going operations. In light of the significance of the impact these products had on the sales growth of the Company, the sales results of these products have been detailed in the "Unaudited Reconciliation of Sales by Product Line and Region."
 
Foreign Exchange
- Fluctuation in exchange rates impacts the comparative results and sales growth rates of the Company's underlying business. Management believes that excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations from its sales growth provides investors a more meaningful comparison to historical financial results. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations has been detailed in the "Unaudited Reconciliation of Sales by Product Line and Region."

(A)  The tax effect on non-GAAP adjustments is calculated using the relevant tax jurisdictions' statutory tax rates.
 
(B)  Diluted non-GAAP earnings per share for 2008 was calculated by adding back to net income $0.7 million for the quarter in interest expense related to previous convertible debt, and $1.7 million for the six month period, then dividing by the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding.  The convertible debt was redeemed in June 2008.
