Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch and Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., as Co-Documentation Agents (the "Credit Agreement").
 
Item 1.02.   Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
As described in Item 2.03 below, on July 29, 2011, the Company terminated the Five-Year Unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement dated as of September 29, 2006, by and among the Company, the lenders party thereto, JP Morgan Chase Bank as Administrative Agent; J.P. Morgan Europe Limited as London Agent; Mizuho Corporate Bank, Limited as Tokyo Agent; Bank of America, N.A. as Syndication Agent; and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFI, Ltd., Mizuho Corporate Bank, Limited, Suntrust Bank, and Wachovia Bank, N.A., as Documentation Agents  (the "2006 Credit Agreement"). Under the 2006 Credit Agreement, all committed pro rata borrowings bore interest at the London interbank offering rate ("LIBOR") plus 0.325%. The revolving credit facility under the 2006 Credit Agreement would have matured September 29, 2011.
 
Item 2.03.   Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
 
On July 29, 2011, the Company entered into the Credit Agreement to establish a new four-year $500 million multi-currency unsecured revolving credit facility (including borrowings and letters of credit) to replace the existing $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility under the 2006 Credit Agreement.  All committed pro rata borrowings under the revolving facility will bear interest at a variable annual rate based on the LIBOR or base rate, at the Company's election, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, plus, in each case, an applicable margin based on the Company's leverage ratio.  Subject to certain terms and conditions, the Company may increase the amount of the revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement by up to $250 million in the aggregate.
 
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants, events of default, terms and conditions, including limitations on liens, incurrence of debt, mergers and significant asset dispositions. The Company must also comply with a leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio. The occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Agreement could result in all loans and other obligations being declared due and payable and the revolving credit facility being terminated.
 
The Company expects to make borrowings under the Credit Agreement for general corporate purposes, as well as for the repayment of amounts outstanding under the 2006 Credit Agreement.
 
The Company and its affiliates from time to time engage certain of the lenders under the Credit Agreement to provide banking and financial services. All of these engagements are negotiated at arm's length.
 
The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrowers shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.

Each Lender, each person acquiring a participation from any Lender as contemplated by and each Borrower hereby consents and agrees to the CAM Exchange.

provided
 
As a result of the CAM Exchange, on and after the CAM Exchange Date, each payment received by the Administrative Agent pursuant to any Loan Document in respect of any Specified Obligations shall be distributed to the Lenders pro rata in accordance with their respective CAM Percentages (to be redetermined as of each such date of payment or distribution to the extent required by the next paragraph).
 
In the event that, on or after the CAM Exchange Date, the aggregate amount of the Specified Obligations shall change as a result of the making by the Issuing Bank of an LC Disbursement that is not reimbursed by the applicable Borrower, then (a) each Multicurrency Lender shall, in accordance with Section 2.05(d), promptly purchase from the Issuing Bank the US Dollar Equivalent of a participation in such LC Disbursement in the amount of such Multicurrency Lender's Multicurrency Commitment Percentage of such LC Disbursement (without giving effect to the CAM Exchange), (b) the Administrative Agent shall redetermine the CAM Percentages after giving effect to such LC Disbursement and the purchase of participations therein by the Multicurrency Lenders, and the Lenders shall automatically and without further act be deemed to have made reciprocal purchases of interests in the Specified Obligations such that each Lender shall own an interest equal to such Lender's CAM Percentage in each of the Specified Obligations and (c) in the event distributions shall have been made in accordance with the preceding paragraph, the Lenders shall make such payments to one another in US Dollars as shall be necessary in order that the amounts received by them shall be equal to the amounts they would have received had each LC Disbursement been outstanding on the CAM Exchange Date.  Each such redetermination shall be binding on each of the Lenders and their successors and assigns and shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
 
In order to induce the Lenders to extend credit to the other Borrowers hereunder, the Company hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, the payment when and as due of the Obligations of such other Borrowers.  The Company further agrees that the due and punctual payment of such Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon its guarantee hereunder notwithstanding any such extension or renewal of any such Obligation.
 
The Company waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to any Borrower of any of the Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of its obligations and notice of protest for nonpayment.  The obligations of the Company hereunder shall not be affected by (a) the failure of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against any Loan Party under the provisions of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or otherwise; (b) any extension or renewal of any of the
 
Obligations; (c) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or release from, any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement, or any other Loan Document or agreement; (d) any default, failure or delay, wilful or otherwise, in the performance of any of the Obligations; or (e) any other act, omission or delay to do any other act which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of the Company or otherwise operate as a discharge of a guarantor as a matter of law or equity or which would impair or eliminate any right of the Company to subrogation.
 
The Company further agrees that its agreement hereunder constitutes a guarantee of payment when due (whether or not any bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall have stayed the accrual or collection of any of the Obligations or operated as a discharge thereof) and not merely of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of the Administrative Agent or any Lender in favor of any Borrower or any other Person.
 
The obligations of the Company hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, and shall not be subject to any defense or set-off, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever, by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any of the Obligations, any impossibility in the performance of any of the Obligations or otherwise.
 
The Company further agrees that its obligations hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by the Administrative Agent or any Lender upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower or otherwise.
 
In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have at law or in equity against the Company by virtue hereof, upon the failure of any other Borrower to pay any Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, the Company hereby promises to and will, upon receipt of written demand by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Administrative Agent or applicable Lender in cash an amount equal to the unpaid principal amount of such Obligations then due, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon.  The Company further agrees that if payment in respect of any Obligation shall be due in a currency other than US Dollars and/or at a place of payment other than New York and if, by reason of any Change in Law, disruption of currency or foreign exchange markets, war or civil disturbance or other event, payment of such Obligation in such currency or at such place of payment shall be impossible or, in the reasonable judgment of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, not consistent with the protection of its rights or interests, then, at the election of the Administrative Agent, the Company shall make payment of such Obligation in US Dollars (based upon the applicable Exchange Rate in effect on the date of payment) and/or in New York, and shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender against any losses or reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that it shall sustain as a result of such alternative payment.
 
Upon payment by the Company of any sums as provided above, all rights of the Company against any Borrower arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation or
 
otherwise shall in all respects be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the prior indefeasible payment in full of all the Obligations owed by such Borrower to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders.
 
Nothing shall discharge or satisfy the liability of the Company hereunder except the full performance and payment of the Obligations.
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the provisions of this shall apply only to the guarantee obligations of the Company under this (and each reference in this to "hereunder" shall mean under this ).

Administrative Agent
 
Reference is made to the Four Year Credit Agreement dated as of July 29, 2011 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the ""), among the Company, the other Borrowers party thereto, the lenders from time to time party thereto (the ""), Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and Issuing Bank, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Co-Syndication Agents and U.S. Bank, National Association, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch and Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., as Co-Documentation Agents.  Capitalized terms used herein and not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Credit Agreement.
Credit Agreement
Lenders
 
The Lenders have agreed to make Loans to the Borrowers and the Issuing Bank has agreed to issue Letters of Credit, in each case pursuant to, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions specified in, the Credit Agreement.  Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors acknowledges that it will derive substantial benefit from the making of the Loans by the Lenders and the issuance of such Letters of Credit.  The obligations of the Lenders to make Loans and the Issuing Bank to issue Letters of Credit are conditioned on, among other things, the execution and delivery by the Subsidiary Guarantors of this Subsidiary Guarantee Agreement.  In order to induce the Lenders to make Loans and induce the Issuing Bank to issue Letters of Credit, the Subsidiary Guarantors are willing to execute this Agreement.
 
Accordingly, the parties hereto agree as follows:
 
SECTION 1.  .  Each Subsidiary Guarantor unconditionally, absolutely, continually and irrevocably guarantees, jointly with the other Subsidiary Guarantors and severally, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, (a) the due and punctual payment of (i) the principal of and premium, if any, and interest (including interest accruing during the pendency of any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other similar proceeding, regardless of whether allowed or allowable in such proceeding) on the Loans made to any Borrower, when and as due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, upon one or more dates set for prepayment or otherwise, (ii) each payment required to be made by any Borrower under the Credit Agreement in respect of any Letter of Credit, when and as due, including payments in respect of reimbursement of disbursements, interest thereon and obligations to provide cash collateral and (iii) all other monetary obligations, including fees, costs, expenses and indemnities, whether primary, secondary, direct, contingent, fixed or otherwise (including monetary obligations incurred during the pendency of any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other similar
Guarantee
 
proceeding, regardless of whether allowed or allowable in such proceeding), of the Loan Parties under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and (b) unless otherwise agreed upon in writing by the applicable Lender party thereto, the due and punctual payment and performance of all obligations of the Company or any Subsidiary, monetary or otherwise, under each interest rate hedging agreement relating to Obligations referred to in the preceding clause (a) entered into with any counterparty that was a Lender (or an Affiliate thereof) at the time such hedging agreement was entered into (all the obligations referred to in the preceding clauses (a) and (b) being collectively called the "").  Each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that the Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon its guarantee notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any Obligation.
Obligations
 
Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that the due and punctual payment of such Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon its guarantee hereunder notwithstanding any such extension or renewal of any such Obligation.
 
Each Subsidiary Guarantor waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to any Borrower of any of the Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of its obligations and notice of protest for nonpayment.  The obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereunder shall not be affected by (a) the failure of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against any Loan Party under the provisions of the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document or otherwise; (b) any extension or renewal of any of the Obligations; (c) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or release from, any of the terms or provisions of the Credit Agreement, or any other Loan Document or agreement; (d) any default, failure or delay, wilful or otherwise, in the performance of any of the Obligations; or (e) any other act, omission or delay to do any other act which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Subsidiary Guarantor or otherwise operate as a discharge of a guarantor as a matter of law or equity or which would impair or eliminate any right of any Subsidiary Guarantor to subrogation.
 
Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that its agreement hereunder constitutes a guarantee of payment when due (whether or not any bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall have stayed the accrual or collection of any of the Obligations or operated as a discharge thereof) and not merely of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of the Administrative Agent or any Lender in favor of any Borrower or any other Person.
 
The obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise of any of the Obligations, and shall not be subject to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever, by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any of the Obligations (including lack of due authorization or execution of the Credit Agreement, any Loan Document or any other instrument or agreement), any impossibility in the performance of any of the Obligations or otherwise.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by the failure of the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other instrument or agreement, by any waiver or modification of any provision of any thereof, by any default, failure or delay, wilful or otherwise, in the performance of the Obligations, or by any other act or omission that may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Subsidiary Guarantor or that would otherwise operate as a discharge of each Subsidiary Guarantor as a matter of law or equity (other than the payment in full in cash of all the Obligations).
 
Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that its obligations hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by the Administrative Agent or any Lender upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower or otherwise.
 
In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have at law or in equity against any Subsidiary Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of any other Borrower to pay any Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby promises to and will, upon receipt of written demand by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the applicable Agent or Lender in cash an amount equal to the unpaid principal amount of such Obligations then due, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon.  Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that if payment in respect of any Obligation shall be due in a currency other than US Dollars and/or at a place of payment other than New York and if, by reason of any Change in Law, disruption of currency or foreign exchange markets, war or civil disturbance or other event, payment of such Obligation in such currency or at such place of payment shall be impossible or, in the reasonable judgment of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, not consistent with the protection of its rights or interests, then, at the election of the Administrative Agent, such Subsidiary Guarantor shall make payment of such Obligation in US Dollars (based upon the applicable Exchange Rate in effect on the date of payment) and/or in New York, and shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and Lender against any losses or reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that it shall sustain as a result of such alternative payment.
 
Upon payment by any Subsidiary Guarantor of any sums as provided above, all rights of such Subsidiary Guarantor against any Borrower arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation or otherwise shall in all respects be fully subordinated and junior in right of payment to the prior indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the Obligations owed by such Borrower to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders.

Nothing shall discharge or satisfy the liability of any Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder except the full performance and payment of the Obligations.
 
SECTION 2.  .  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each of the Subsidiary Guarantors waives any defense based on or arising out of
Defenses of Company Waived
any defense of the Company or any other Subsidiary Guarantor or the unenforceability of the Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of the Company or any other Subsidiary Guarantor, other than the final and payment in full in cash of the Obligations.  The Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders may, at their election, foreclose on any security held by one or more of them by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, accept an assignment of any such security in lieu of foreclosure, compromise or adjust any part of the Obligations, make any other accommodation with the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor or any other guarantor or exercise any other right or remedy available to them against the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor or any other guarantor, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder except to the extent the Obligations have been fully, finally and indefeasibly paid in cash.  Pursuant to applicable law, each of the Subsidiary Guarantors waives any defense arising out of any such election even though such election operates, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or to extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Subsidiary Guarantor against the Company or any other Subsidiary Guarantor or guarantor, as the case may be, or any security.
 
SECTION 3.  .  Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of the Borrowers' and the other Subsidiary Guarantors' financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks that such Subsidiary Guarantor assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that none of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Lenders will have any duty to advise any of the Subsidiary Guarantors of information known to it or any of them regarding such circumstances or risks.
Information

Items (i) through (iii) are sometimes hereinafter referred to collectively as the "".
Loan Documents
 
In our examination referred to above, we have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such copies.  In rendering the opinions set forth herein, we have relied upon, and assumed the truth and accuracy of, all factual matters set forth in certificates of the Companies, the representations and warranties of all parties set forth in the Loan Documents, documents and records supplied to us, and all certificates of public officials.  We have also assumed, with your permission and without independent investigation, that:
 
(i)            each party to the Loan Documents (including the Companies) is duly organized or formed, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization or formation, and each such party has the requisite power and authority to conduct its business and to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Loan Documents to which it is a party;
 
(ii)           the execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents by each party thereto (including the Companies) have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or other appropriate actions and proceedings on the part of each such party;
 
(iii)          each of the Loan Documents has been duly executed and delivered by, and constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of each party thereto, enforceable against each such party in accordance with its terms (except that no such assumptions are made with respect to the Companies to the extent matters assumed hereby are expressly addressed in below);
paragraph 1
 
(iv)          none of the execution, delivery or performance of any of the Loan Documents by any party thereto (including the Companies) does or will (a) contravene or violate any provision of any law, rule or regulation (except that no such assumption is made with respect to the Companies to the extent matters assumed hereby are expressly addressed in below), (b) contravene or violate any charter or other organizational document of such party or (c) conflict or be inconsistent with, or result in any breach of any of the terms, covenants, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default in respect of, or result in the creation or imposition of, or the obligation to create or impose, any lien or security interest upon any of the property or assets of such party under or in respect of the terms of any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, credit agreement, loan agreement or other agreement, contract or instrument to which such party is a party or by which its properties or assets are bound or to which it may otherwise be subject; and
paragraph 3
 
(v)           no consent, approval, authorization, order, filing, registration or qualification of or with any Governmental Authority is required for the execution, delivery or performance of any of the Loan Documents by any party thereto (except that no such assumption is made with respect to the Companies with respect to any consent, approval, registration or filing to the extent matters assumed hereby are expressly addressed in below).
paragraph 3
 
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, and subject to the other comments, qualifications and assumptions set forth herein, and having considered such questions of law as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions expressed below, we are of the opinion that, as of the date hereof:
 
1.             Each of the Loan Documents constitutes the valid and binding obligation of each Company party thereto, enforceable against such Company in accordance with its terms.
 
2.             None of the Companies is an "investment company" required to be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
 
3.             The execution and delivery by each Company of each of the Loan Documents to which it is a party and the performance by such Company of its obligations thereunder (a) do not require any consent or approval of, registration or filing with, any Governmental Authority pursuant to Applicable Law, except such as have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect, and (b) will not violate any Applicable Law.
 
The foregoing opinions are limited to the Applicable Laws of the State of New York and the United States of America.  As used herein, "" shall mean those state laws, rules and regulations of the State of New York, and those federal laws, rules and regulations of the United States of America which, in our experience and without independent investigation, are normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Loan Documents; , that the term "Applicable Laws" shall not include (i) any law, rule or regulation that is applicable to any Company, the Loan Documents or such transactions solely because such law, rule or regulation is part of a regulatory regime applicable to any Company or any other party to the Loan Documents or any of its affiliates due to the specific assets or business of such party or such affiliate, (ii) any federal or state securities or blue sky laws (including, without limitation, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended) other than, with respect to above, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended or (iii) any fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer laws, antifraud laws or commodities laws or, in each case, any rules or regulations thereunder.
Applicable Laws
provided
paragraph 2
 
Our opinions expressed above are subject to the following assumptions and qualifications:
 
(a)           Our opinion in above is subject to (i) the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in equity or at law), including the possible unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or any other equitable remedy, (iii) concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, and (iv) limitations under applicable law or public policy on waivers of rights or defenses. In applying principles of equity referred to in  above, a court, among other things, might not allow a creditor to accelerate maturity of a debt upon the occurrence of a default deemed immaterial. Such principles applied by a court might include a requirement that a creditor act reasonably and in good faith.
paragraph 1
clause (i)
 
(b)           We express no opinion as to the enforceability of any particular provision of any of the Loan Documents relating to (i) waivers of defenses, rights to trial by jury, or rights to object to jurisdiction or venue and other rights or benefits bestowed by operation of law, or waivers of unmatured claims or rights, or (ii) the collection of interest on interest or providing for a penalty rate of interest or late charges on overdue or defaulted obligations.
 
(c)           The enforceability of Section 11.03 of the Credit Agreement may be limited by (i) laws, rules and regulations (including any United States federal or state securities law, rule or regulation) rendering unenforceable indemnification contrary to any such laws, rules or regulations and the public policy underlying such laws, rules or regulations, (ii) laws limiting the enforceability of provisions exculpating or exempting a party from, or requiring indemnification of a party against or contribution to a party for, liability for its own gross negligence, misconduct or bad faith or the gross negligence, misconduct or bad faith of its agents and (iii) laws requiring collection and enforcement costs (including fees and disbursements of counsel) to be reasonable.
 
(d)           No opinion is expressed herein as to the enforceability of any provision of any Loan Document that purports to establish or may be construed to establish any evidentiary standards.
 
(e)           No opinion is expressed herein as to the enforceability of provisions in any Loan Document to the effect that terms may not be waived or modified except in writing.
 
(f)            No opinion is expressed herein as to the effect of the laws of any jurisdiction in which any Lender is located (other than the State of New York) that limit the interest, fees or other charges such Lender may impose.
 
(g)           No opinion is expressed herein as to Sections 2.18(b), 11.08, 11.09(d) and 11.10 of the Credit Agreement (or, in each case, any similar provision in any of the other Loan Documents).
 
(h)           In rendering our opinion set forth in above, as it pertains to the enforceability of the provisions contained in Section 11.09(a) of the Credit Agreement (and any similar provisions contained in any of the other Loan Documents) pursuant to which the parties thereto agree that the laws of the State of New York shall govern such documents, we have relied on Section 5-1401 of the New York General Obligations Law, which states in pertinent part that, "The parties to any contract, agreement or undertaking, contingent or otherwise, in consideration of, or relating to any obligation arising out of a transaction covering in the aggregate not less than two hundred fifty thousand dollars, . . . may agree that the law of this state shall govern their rights and duties in whole or in part, whether or not such contract, agreement or undertaking bears a reasonable relation to this state."  We note that one United States federal district court sitting in New York, in upholding the application of Section 5-1401 of the General Obligations Law in a case in which it found sufficient connections to New York State, suggested that the enforcement of the election of the parties to a contract to apply New York law might present a constitutional issue if New York State had no connection to either the parties or the transaction and if applying New York law would violate an important public policy of a more interested state.

Brothers Special Financing Inc. v. Minmetals International Non-Ferrous Metals Trading Company et al.
, 179 F.Supp. 2d 118 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (the "").  The Minmetals Opinion did not address, and we have not found any judicial interpretation of, what constitutes "no connection" for purposes of Section 5-1401 of the New York General Obligations Law, and we do not express any opinion as to the extent of the connections of the parties to the Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby to New York State. We call to your attention that the Minmetals Opinion stated that even if a contract were governed by New York law and could have been legally performed in New York, it is not enforceable under New York law if it is illegal in its place of performance and the parties entered into the contract knowing that it was illegal in its place of performance or were deliberately ignorant of such illegality.  For the purposes of our opinion set forth in above in respect of the Loan Documents, as it pertains to the enforceability of the provisions contained in Section 9.09(a) of the Credit Agreement (and any similar provisions contained in any of the other Loan Documents) pursuant to which the parties thereto agree that the laws of the State of New York shall govern such documents, we have assumed that the parties did not enter into the Loan Documents with knowledge or deliberate ignorance of the illegality of such document in its place of performance.

(i)            In rendering our opinion set forth in above, as it pertains to the enforceability of certain provisions contained in Section 11.09(b) of the Credit Agreement (and any similar provisions contained in any of the other Loan Documents) to the extent they relate to the submission by the parties thereto to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, we do not express any opinion as to whether the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York would have subject matter jurisdiction over an action or proceeding arising out of or relating to any Loan Document, or the enforcement of any judgment, if there were not diversity of citizenship between the parties under 28 U.S.C. 1332.  In connection with the provisions of the Loan Documents which relate to forum selection (including any waiver of any objection to venue in any court or of any objection that a court is an inconvenient forum), we note that, under Section 510 of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules, a New York state court may have discretion to transfer the place of trial and, under 28 U.S.C. 1404(a), a United States District Court has discretion to transfer an action from one United States District Court to another, and can exercise such discretion . In rendering our opinion in above with respect to Section 9.09(b) of the Credit Agreement (and any similar provisions contained in any of the Loan Documents), we express no opinion as to whether an action could be brought in any court other than those specified therein.

Re:          Four Year Credit Agreement dated as of the date hereof
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
This opinion is furnished in connection with Section 4.01(b)(ii) of the Four Year Credit Agreement dated as of the date hereof (the "Credit Agreement") by and among Edwards Lifesciences Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("ELC"), Edwards Lifesciences (U.S.) Inc., a Delaware corporation ("ELUS"), Edwards Lifesciences LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Edwards LLC"), Edwards Lifesciences World Trade Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("ELWT"), the Swiss borrowers parties thereto ("Swiss Borrowers"), the Japanese borrowers thereto ("Japanese Borrowers" and, together with ELC, ELUS, Edwards LLC, ELWT and the Swiss Borrowers, the "Borrowers"), the lenders parties thereto (the "Lenders"), Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent (in such capacity, the "Administrative Agent") Swing Line Lender and Issuing Bank, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Co-Syndication Agents (the "Co-Syndication Agents"), and U.S. Bank, National Association, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, and Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd. as Co-Documentation Agents (the "Co-Documentation Agents," and together with the Administrative Agent and the Co-Syndication Agents, the "Agents"). All capitalized terms used in this opinion shall have the meanings attributed to them in the Credit Agreement.
 
I am [    ] of ELC, which is the direct or indirect parent of the following subsidiaries: ELUS; Edwards LLC; ELWT; Edwards Lifesciences Corporation of Puerto Rico, a Delaware corporation, and Edwards Lifesciences Sales Corporation, a Delaware corporation (collectively, excluding ELC, the "Subsidiary Guarantors," and, together with ELC, the "Companies"). I have acted as counsel for the Companies in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents (as defined below).
 
In that connection I have examined:
 
(i)            The Credit Agreement, executed by each party thereto;
 
(ii)           The Indemnity, Subrogation and Contribution Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, executed by the Companies;
 
(iii)          The Subsidiary Guarantee Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, executed by the Subsidiary Guarantors;
 
(iv)          The Certificates of Incorporation of ELC and (with the exception of Edwards LLC) each Subsidiary Guarantor, and all amendments thereto and restatements thereof in effect on the date hereof (the "Charters");
 
(v)           The bylaws of ELC and (with the exception of Edwards LLC) each Subsidiary Guarantor, and all amendments thereto and restatements thereof in effect on the date hereof (the "Bylaws");
 
(vi)          The Certificate of Formation of Edwards LLC;
 
(vii)         The Restated Operating Agreement of Edwards LLC; and
 
(viii)        The Certificates of Status and Good Standing Letters for the Companies, as described on attached hereto and made a part hereof.
Exhibit A
 
The documents described in items (i) through (iii) above are collectively referred to herein as the "Loan Documents." I am also relying on certificates of the chief financial officers of the Companies, dated the date hereof and attached hereto as . In addition, I have examined the originals, or copies certified to my satisfaction, of such other corporate records of the Companies, certificates of public officials and of other officers of the Companies, and agreements, instruments and documents, as I have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. As to questions of fact material to such opinions, I have, when relevant facts were not independently established by me, relied upon certificates of other officers of the Companies or of public officials.
Exhibit B
 
For purposes of this opinion, I have made, with your consent, and without further inquiry as to their accuracy or completeness, the following assumptions:
 
A.            I have assumed that, except with respect to the Companies, where required, the Loan Documents were duly and properly authorized, executed and delivered by the parties thereto.
 
B.            I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, other than signatures of officers of the Companies, the legal capacity of all natural persons executing documents, the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals and the conformity with the authentic originals of all documents submitted to me as copies, including, without limitation, the contents of exhibits and schedules to such documents.
 
C.            I have assumed that the Loan Documents (i) constitute the entire agreement of the parties as to the subject matter thereof, (ii) have not been amended, modified, terminated or revoked in any respect, and (iii) remain in full force and effect as of the date hereof.
 
D.            I have assumed that, except with respect to the Companies, all of the parties to the Loan Documents are duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of their respective jurisdictions of organization and have the requisite corporate power to enter into the Loan Documents.
 
E.             I have assumed that, except with respect to the Companies, the execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents by each party thereto do not and will not conflict with, result in a breach of, or constitute a default under, any of the terms, conditions, or provisions of: (a) any present statute, rule, or regulation applicable to such Person; (b) the charter; code of regulations, operating agreement, or bylaws (or similar documents) of such Person; (c) any term of any agreement, contract, undertaking, indenture, or instrument by which such Person or the properties or assets of such Person is bound; or (d) any order, judgment, or decree of any court or other agency of government that is binding on any Person.
 
F.             I have assumed that each Lender and each Agent have the requisite power and authority, have obtained all necessary consents, licenses and permits, taken all necessary action and complied with any and all applicable laws with which each is required to comply, in each case relating to or affecting the matters and actions contemplated by the Loan Documents.
 
Based upon the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:
 
1.             Each of the Companies (other than Edwards LLC) is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and, except for the failure of ELWT to be in good standing in the State of California, has all requisite authority to conduct its business in each jurisdiction in which the failure so to qualify would have a material adverse effect on the business, properties, assets, operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of such Company.  Edwards LLC is a limited liability company duly formed, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of Delaware and has all requisite authority to conduct its business in each jurisdiction in which the failure so to qualify would have a material adverse effect on the business, properties, assets, operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of such Company.
 
2.             The execution, delivery and performance as of the date hereof by each of the Companies of the Loan Documents to which it is a party, and the performance as of the date hereof of the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents to which it is a party: (i) are within its corporate or limited liability company (as applicable) powers; (ii) have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or limited liability company (as applicable) action; (iii) do not, as of the date hereof, contravene (a) with respect to all the Companies other than Edwards LLC, the Charter or the Bylaws of such Company, (b) with respect to Edwards LLC, the Restated Operating Agreement or the Certificate of Formation, or (c) any law, rule or regulation applicable to any Company; (iv) do not, as of the date hereof, violate any material contractual or legal restriction binding on or affecting any Company contained in any document, order, writ, judgment, award, injunction or decree applicable to such Company. The Loan Documents have been duly executed and delivered on behalf of each Company that is a party thereto.
 
3.             No authorization, approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any Governmental Authority or regulatory body is required for the due execution, delivery and performance by any Company of any Loan Document to which it is a party.
4.             There is no pending or, to the best of my knowledge, threatened action or proceeding against any Company before any court, governmental agency or arbitrator, (i) which, except as specifically disclosed in Schedule 3.05 of the Credit Agreement, is likely to have a materially adverse effect upon the financial condition or operations of the Companies, taken as whole, or (ii) that purports to affect the legality, validity or enforceability of any Loan Document.
 
This opinion is limited solely to matters of law of the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as those laws are in effect as of the date hereof, and I express no opinion as to the laws of any other jurisdiction, including but not limited to, ordinances, regulations or practices of any county, city or other government agency or body within any state.
 
I am aware that Sidley Austin LLP will rely upon the statements in paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4 of this opinion in rendering their opinion furnished pursuant to Section 4.01(b)(i) of the Credit Agreement.
 
This opinion is limited to the matters expressly set forth herein, and no opinion is implied or may be inferred beyond the matters expressly set forth herein. The opinions expressed herein are being delivered to you as of the date hereof in connection with the transactions described hereinabove and are solely for your benefit in connection with the transactions described hereinabove and may not be relied on in any manner or for any purpose by any other person, nor any copies published, communicated or otherwise made available in whole or in part to any other person or entity without my specific prior written consent, except that you may furnish copies thereof (i) to any of your permitted successors and assigns in respect of the Loan Documents, although any such assignee may rely on this opinion only to the extent it would have been able to rely hereon if it were a party to such Loan Documents on the date hereof, (ii) to your independent auditors and attorneys, (iii) upon the request of any state or federal authority or official having regulatory jurisdiction over you, and (iv) pursuant to order or legal process of any court or governmental agency.
 
This opinion speaks solely as of the date hereof and I disclaim any obligation or undertaking to advise you of any changes which may occur after the date hereof.
 
Very truly yours,
