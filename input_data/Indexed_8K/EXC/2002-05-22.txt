[EXELON LOGO] News Release From: Exelon FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Corporate Communications --------------------- P.O. Box 805379 May 22, 2002 Chicago, IL 60680-5379 Contact: Mary Rucci, Media Relations 610.765.6925 Linda Byus, CFA, Investor Relations 312.394.7696 Exelon Corporation Affirms Delivery-Based Trading Strategy Chicago (May 22, 2002) - Exelon Corporation (NYSE: EXC) reported today that Exelon Power Team, its wholesale energy marketing and trading group, does not engage in the practice of simultaneous trading for the purpose of increasing trading volume and revenue. Incentive plans for Power Team traders are profit-oriented, not volume-oriented. The incentives are also based on overall team performance. Power Team is a division of Exelon Generation Company, LLC. The major purpose of Power Team's trading facility is to sell and deliver physical power from its own portfolio of generating assets and to reduce earnings volatility through hedging (i.e., entering into contracts that reduce exposure to the volatile spot market). Exelon Generation is one of the largest generation supply companies in the U.S. with a total operating portfolio of more than 40,000 MWs. Exelon also reported that its Power Team is one of more than 100 companies asked to respond to FERC's request for data in connection with its investigation of the California power markets during the period 2000 to 2001. Exelon responded to FERC that Power Team did not engage in "Death Star," "Get Shorty," "Fat Boy," or any of the other strategies put forth in the Enron memos referred to in FERC's data request. ### Exelon Corporation is one of the nation's largest electric utilities with approximately 5 million customers and more than $15 billion in annual revenues. The company has one of the industry's largest portfolios of electricity generation capacity, with a nationwide reach and strong positions in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic. Exelon distributes electricity to approximately 5 million customers in Illinois and Pennsylvania and gas to more than 440,000 customers in the Philadelphia area. The company also has holdings in such competitive businesses as energy, infrastructure services, energy services and telecommunications. Exelon is headquartered in Chicago and trades on the NYSE under the ticker EXC.
