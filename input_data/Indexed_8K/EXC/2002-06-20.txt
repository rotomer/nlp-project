[Logo for Exelon] Federal Overview Elizabeth A. Moler Senior Vice President Governmental Affairs & Policy Exelon Investor Conference New York City June 20, 2002
[Logo for Exelon] Federal Regulatory and Legislative Activities - - Update on Congressional action on Yucca Mountain Waste Repository - - Update on energy policy legislation - - FERC's policy initiatives
[Logo for Exelon] Yucca Mountain - - Congress is nearing final action on Yucca Mountain waste repository -- President Bush recommended approval Feb.15 -- Governor Guinn exercised Nevada's "veto" authority under the statute -- House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved a resolution to override the veto on May 8 (306-117) -- Senate Committee approved the resolution 13-10 -- Senate will consider by July 25; simple majority required -- If approved, DOE will seek license from NRC; lengthy regulatory proceedings
[Logo for Exelon] Energy Policy Legislation - - House of Representatives passed major energy policy bill last year - - Senate passed a bill after 6 weeks of debate - - Conferees have finally been appointed - - Huge job ahead resolving differences (1,000+ pages!) - - Senate electricity provisions have bipartisan support; generally positive impact -- PUHCA repeal -- PURPA repeal -- Clear FERC authority over munis & coops to require open access -- Negatives: Renewal Portfolio Standard; more FERC review of asset transfers (including generation) - - Prospects for enactment are uncertain
[Logo for Exelon] FERC: Focus on Wholesale Competition - - Developing "Standard Market Design" - - Reconsidering how to measure if a utility has market power - - Reconsidering standards governing market-based rate authority - - Redefining rules for Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) -- Original focus on transmission operations -- New focus on running markets -- No longer friendly to transcos -- Result for Exelon? Plan to put ComEd transmission into PJM - - Rewriting Order No. 888 "Open Access Transmission Tariff" requirements - - Codifying interconnection requirements and pricing - - Rewriting Standards of Conduct
[Logo for Exelon] Example: Standard Market Design Initiative - - New, controversial FERC initiative for SMD; plan to issue a final rule 12/02 - - Establishes requirements for energy and transmission markets throughout the country - - Same trading rules would apply everywhere - - Real-time and day-ahead bid-based market for energy using Locational Marginal Pricing (LMP) like PJM - - LMP-based congestion management - - Financial Transmission Rights - - Capacity or reserve requirement (maybe!)
[Logo for Exelon] SMD: Significant $$ and Operational Impact - - Exelon "second to none" in supporting SMD - - Power Team could save estimated $30 million annually by reducing its obligation to provide ancillary services - - If SMD includes a capacity or reserve requirement, it could mean Exelon Generation would receive significant revenue in capacity payments (depending on specifics) - - With a spot energy market and an RTO requirement, Exelon would be able to serve POLR load in the ComEd area without building/purchasing new capacity if the RES load comes back - - Reduces our exposure to complaints of market power; provides mitigation required to maintain market-based rates - - Major plus for "national" players like Exelon

[Logo for Exelon] ComEd Supply Vs. Demand [This slide illustrates the portfolio management challenge faced by Power Team. The slide shows Power Team's 2001 supply for ComEd from coal, nuclear, oil, peaking generation, PPAs and spot market purchases stack in thousands of MWs by month and ComEd demand by day. The need for 100% reliability combined with the fact that ComEd summer load can vary by over 10,000 MW within a day requires a pro-active approach to managing Exelon's Midwest portfolio.]
[Logo for Exelon] ComEd 2002 Summer Supply - - Resource planning assumes "high expected load" and requires 23,100 MWs -- Based on 20% load demand probability scenario -- Exceeds 15% reserve margin as required by MAIN - - Exelon Generation has approximately 23,200 MWs available for ComEd needs -- 10,000 MWs owned -- 13,200 MWs contracted -- About 4,000 additional MWs available in region -- About 1,000 MWs interruptible
[Logo for Exelon] ComEd 2002 Summer Supply - - What is different from last year? -- Earnings guidance assumes substantially lower summer prices -- Significantly more supply in region - Managing to a 20% probability vs. a 10% probability weather case -- EME labor dispute resolved -- Full year's experience of managing combined portfolio -- Hedging program fully implemented

Exhibit 99.3 [Logo for Exelon] Exelon Corporation www.exeloncorp.com P.O. Box 805398 Chicago, IL 60680-5398 TO OUR INVESTORS: EXELON - ONE COMPANY, ONE VISION. The Energy Industry is both complex and volatile, with one of its leaders collapsing and others losing most of their market capitalization. Within this chaotic environment, the Exelon management team and I have defined a course of action that focuses on real assets, real operations, real service and real income. We reviewed this strategy with our Board at its annual planning meeting in early June and would like to explain what it means to those who invest in our work. EXELON STRIVES TO BUILD EXCEPTIONAL VALUE - BY BECOMING THE BEST AND MOST CONSISTENTLY PROFITABLE ELECTRICITY AND GAS COMPANY IN THE UNITED STATES. We are serious about becoming both the best and the most consistently profitable. This means extending, throughout our company, the benchmarking and continuous improvement practices that have worked so well in our nuclear operations. This also means coordinating our operations and our marketing and hedging efforts to emphasize the quality and predictability of our earnings. LIVE UP TO OUR COMMITMENTS. We have commitments to our shareholders, our customers, our employees and to the larger society in which we operate. Meeting them is essential to delivering consistent, superior financial performance. These include keeping the lights on and assuring that our nuclear plants are models of safe operation. These commitments also include doing a better and better job of reporting our results, opportunities and challenges. PERFORM AT WORLD-CLASS LEVELS. Every time we look, we are reminded that superior operations are the best way to add superior value in a low-growth industry. The success of our corporate-wide Cost Management Initiative, the improvements in our Delivery business and the continued high performance of our nuclear fleet show what can be done. Superior performance also requires skillful management of the relationship between our businesses. The events of the last several years have strongly reinforced the value of having generation, wires and customer relationships in the same corporate family. INVEST IN OUR CONSOLIDATING INDUSTRY. Longer-term growth must come from participating in the consolidation of our industry. The merger of PECO and UNICOM to form EXELON created substantial shareholder value. So have some of our other acquisitions. But some have not. We are confining our acquisition interests to our core activities, reviewing our past results with care and sharpening our discipline so that we can take advantage of the opportunities that will occur during a chaotic period. We will find acquisition opportunities that add to our earnings in the short term and provide attractive returns over time. Sincerely, John W. Rowe Chairman and CEO

[Logo for Exelon] Securities Ratings for Exelon and its Subsidiary Companies
[Logo for Exelon] New Accounting Pronouncements SFAS No. 143 SFAS No. 143 provides accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible long-lived assets. Exelon expects to adopt SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003. Retirement obligations associated with long-lived assets included within the scope of SFAS No. 143 are those for which there is a legal obligation to settle under existing or enacted law, statute, written or oral contract or by legal construction under the doctrine of promissory estoppel. Adoption of SFAS No. 143 will change the accounting for the decommissioning of Exelon's nuclear generating plants. Currently, Exelon records the obligation for decommissioning ratably over the lives of the plants. The January 1, 2003 adoption of this standard will require a cumulative effect adjustment effective the date of adoption to adjust plant assets and decommissioning liabilities to the values they would have been had this standard been employed from the in-service dates of the plants. The effect of this cumulative adjustment will be to increase the decommissioning liability to reflect a full decommissioning obligation in current year dollars. Additionally, the standard will require the accrual of an asset related to the full amount of the decommissioning obligation, which will be amortized over the remaining lives of the plants. The difference between the asset recognized and the liability recorded upon adoption of the standard will be charged to earnings and recognized as a cumulative effect, net of expected regulatory recovery. The decommissioning liability to be recorded represents an obligation for the future decommissioning of the plants, and as a result interest expense will be accrued on this liability until such time as the obligation is satisfied. Exelon is in the process of evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 143 on its financial statements, and cannot determine the ultimate impact of adoption at this time, however the cumulative effect could be material to Exelon's earnings. Additionally, although over the life of the plant the charges to earnings for the depreciation of the asset and the interest on the liability will be equal to the amounts currently recognized as decommissioning expense, the timing of those charges will change and in the near-term period subsequent to adoption, the depreciation of the asset and the interest on the liability could result in an increase in expense.
