UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Washington, DC 20549 FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 June 27, 2002 (Date of earliest event reported)
Item 5. Other Events On June 27, 2002 Exelon issued the following note to its financial community: [EXELON LOGO] - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Exelon Corporation www.exeloncorp.com P.O. Box 805379 Chicago, IL 60680-5379 June 27, 2002 Note to Exelon's Financial Community: Exelon Generation Company, LLC Agrees to Purchase Sithe New England Holdings, LLC Exelon Generation (Exelon) has agreed to purchase Sithe New England Holdings, a subsidiary of Sithe Energies, Inc. (Sithe), in exchange for a $543 million note, plus the assumption of approximately $1.15 billion of project debt. In addition to this transaction, Exelon and Sithe's other shareholders contemplate entering into additional transactions to restructure the original Sithe transaction, although to date no agreement has been reached with respect to such transactions. The acquisition of Sithe New England Holdings enables potential future restructuring without additional risk to Exelon. Exelon has negotiated closing conditions to the acquisition agreement that allow Exelon flexibility to terminate the purchase if certain events do not happen as contemplated. The Sithe New England Holdings acquisition is not expected to affect Exelon's earnings guidance for 2002. On June 26, 2002, Exelon and Sithe filed a notice of change of status with the FERC to purchase Sithe New England Holdings, including its generating facilities and power marketing operations. The parties are seeking FERC and other required approvals by October 31, 2002. If approved, the transaction could be completed in November 2002. Exelon has been a 49.9 percent owner of Sithe since December 2000. In connection with the original investment, Exelon and Sithe's other shareholders executed a Put and Call Agreement (PCA) that gives Exelon the right to purchase (Call) the remaining 50.1 percent of Sithe, and gives the other Sithe shareholders the right to sell (Put) to Exelon. If the Put option is exercised, Exelon does have the obligation to complete the purchase. The PCA, which remains in effect, provides that the Put and Call options become exercisable as of December 18, 2002. Exelon's current financial outlook includes the assumption of the purchase of Sithe under the PCA in mid 2003. The Sithe New England Holdings acquisition, when considered with the other potential restructuring transactions, is not expected to affect Exelon's earnings outlook for 2003. Potential Benefits of Restructuring If the restructuring is completed, the benefits to Exelon are expected to be as follows: o Enables the acquisition of only the assets in the Sithe portfolio that fit Exelon's strategy rather than acquiring the whole company and divesting non-strategic assets in subsequent
transactions. This would reduce the size of the transaction and the amount of Exelon debt required to finance the acquisition; o Allows Exelon to more quickly integrate the Sithe assets and achieve steady-state staffing and cost levels - accelerates realization of acquisition synergies; o In addition to the economic and operating reasons, the restructured transaction would allow Exelon to integrate the Sithe assets in a tax-efficient manner; o Longer-term economic benefits are expected to include interest savings from issuing less acquisition debt, the elimination of losses from some of the non-strategic assets and acceleration of acquisition synergies. Sithe Assets Included in the Transaction The facilities covered under the transaction include Sithe's New England plants in operation and in various stages of construction: Sithe New Boston, South Boston, Mass.; Sithe Framingham, in Framingham, Mass.; Sithe West Medway, in West Medway, Mass.; Sithe Wyman, in Yarmouth, Maine; Sithe Mystic, in Everett, Mass.; Sithe ForeRiver in Weymouth, Mass. and Sithe Power Marketing. The plants are fossil-fueled plants, utilizing a combination of fuel oil and natural gas. Together, present capacity and capacity in development at these plants total 4,471 megawatts, 2,050 MWs operating and 2,421MWs under construction. The units under construction are expected to be completed in late 2002. For additional information please contact me at (312) 394-7696 or Marybeth Flater at (312) 394-8354. Sincerely, Linda C.
