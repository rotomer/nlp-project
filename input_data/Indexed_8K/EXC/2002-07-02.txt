UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Washington, DC 20549 FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 July 1, 2002 (Date of earliest event reported)
Item 5. Other Events On July 2, 2002, Exelon issued the following note to its financial community: [EXELON LOGO] - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Exelon Corporation www.exeloncorp.com P.O. Box 805379 Chicago, IL 60680-5379 July 2, 2002 Note to Exelon's Financial Community: Exelon Generation Company, LLC Exercises Options under Purchase Power Agreement with Midwest Generation, LLC On July 1, 2002, Exelon Generation notified Midwest Generation, LLC (Midwest) of its exercise of Exelon Generation's call option under the existing Coal Generating Stations Purchase Power Agreement dated December 15, 1999 (PPA). Exelon Generation is a subsidiary of Exelon Corporation (Exelon). Midwest is a subsidiary of Edison Mission Energy and Edison International. Exelon Generation has elected to exercise its call option on 1,265 MWs of the capacity for the fourth contract year, 2003. This option exercise is for the year 2003 and has no effect in 2002 because the 2002 supply plan is already in place. By exercising the call, Exelon Generation will take the output of the following Midwest generating units during 2003 at the contract price included in the PPA. Waukegan Unit 6---100 MWs Waukegan Unit 8---361 MWs Fisk Unit 19---326 MWs Crawford Unit 7---216 MWs Will County Unit 3---262 MWs Total ---1,265 MWs Exelon Generation did not exercise its option on the 2,684 MWs of capacity at the remaining option units and will not take the output from the following units during 2003. Will County Unit 1---156 MWs Will County Unit 2---154 MWs Joliet Unit 6---314 MWs Joliet Unit 7---522 MWs Powerton Unit 5---769 MWs Powerton Unit 6---769 MWs Total ---2,684 MWs The exercise of the call option is pursuant to the terms of the PPA. Under the PPA, during the fourth contract year, 2003, Exelon Generation contracted for 1,696 MWs of non-option capacity from Midwest with a call option on 3,949 MWs of capacity. With the July 1 exercise of the call option, Exelon Generation will take the 1,696 MWs of non-option capacity and 1,265 MWs of the option capacity from Midwest. Exelon Generation retains its options to purchase the 1,265 MWs
from these plants in 2004, the final year of the PPA, as well as options relating to Midwest's Collins and peaker units. Exelon Generation will not take the remaining 2,684 MWs of option capacity for the year 2003. Providing reliable service to customers in Illinois served by delivery subsidiary ComEd remains a top priority of Exelon. On June 20, 2002, Exelon provided earnings per share guidance of a 4.5% to 5.5% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) off a 2001 base. That guidance included a modeling assumption that one half of the 3,949 MW call option would be exercised and that about one half would not be exercised. The cost savings incorporated in Exelon's model total $120 million in 2003. With less than half of the options being exercised, the cost savings may be incrementally higher than the $120 million included in the model. The actual cost savings achieved will be a function of Exelon Generation's supply portfolio in 2003.
