Exhibit 99.1 [Exelon logo] News Release July 16, 2002 From: Exelon Corporation Corporate Communications P.O. Box 805379 Chicago, IL 60680-5379 Contact: Kellie Szabo, Media Relations, 312.394.3071 Linda Byus, CFA, Investor Relations, 312.394.7696 Exelon Corporation Sees Better than Expected Second Quarter Results Chicago (July 16, 2002) - Exelon Corporation (NYSE: EXC) announced that its second quarter 2002 earnings from operations, excluding the gain on the sale of an investment, are expected to be more than 15% higher than the consensus estimate of $0.95 per share. The company's prior guidance for the second quarter was 20% of the full year 2002 earnings range of $4.55 per share to $4.85 per share, which suggested operating earnings for the quarter between $0.91 per share and $0.97 per share. Exelon reported second quarter 2001 operating earnings of $0.97 per share. Guidance for the full year 2002 remains $4.55 to $4.85 per share. Exelon's second quarter reported results will include a gain of about $116 million, $0.36 per share, related to Exelon Enterprises' sale of its 49% interest in AT&T Wireless PCS of Philadelphia, LLC to a subsidiary of AT&T Wireless Services. The transaction closed on April 1, 2002. Exelon's guidance for operating earnings for the second quarter and for the full year 2002 excludes that gain. Operating earnings guidance for the full year 2002 also excludes the goodwill impairment and severance charge booked in the first quarter. The better than expected second quarter results reflect a weather-related increase in retail kilowatt-hour deliveries as a result of hot weather in late June. Also, the Cost Management Initiative contributed to strong results for the quarter, which helped offset the impact of lower revenues resulting from lower power prices compared to a year ago. However, given the continued deterioration of wholesale power prices, Exelon is not increasing earnings guidance for the full year at the present time. Exelon Corporation will report second quarter results on July 31, 2002. A Conference Call is scheduled for 11 AM ET (10 AM CT) on July 31 to discuss the second quarter results and the company's outlook for the balance of 2002. The call-in number in the U.S. is 877/691-0877, and the international call-in number is 973/582-2785.
