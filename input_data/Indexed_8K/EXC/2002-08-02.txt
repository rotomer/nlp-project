UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Washington, DC 20549 FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 July 31, 2002 (Date of earliest event reported)
Item 5. Other Events. On July 31, 2002, Exelon Corporation issued a press release disclosing its second quarter 2002 earnings results. The press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1. Also included in this report are the sales statistics by quarter for Energy Delivery, Commonwealth Edison Company (ComEd) and PECO Energy Company (PECO) for 2001. These schedules are attached as Exhibit 99.2. Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure As previously announced, on July 31, 2002 Exelon Corporation conducted its Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Members of management participating in the call included Chairman and CEO John W. Rowe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Ruth Ann M. Gillis, CEO of Exelon Delivery, Pamela B. Strobel, President of Enterprises, George H. Gilmore and Executive Vice President, Ian McLean. The call was open to all on a listen-only basis and was audio web-cast. Telephone replays will be available through August 15, 2002. The U.S. call-in number is 877.519.4471 and the international call-in number is 973.341.3080. The confirmation code is 3391011. In addition, the call will be archived on Exelon's web site, www.exeloncorp.com; please choose the Investor Relations page. During the call management reviewed issues outlined in the press release. Management indicated that the process for preparing to certify the Exelon financial statements filed with the SEC is nearly complete, and that the certifications are expected to be filed at the time of the second quarter 10-Q filing. Management indicated that wholesale market prices for energy continue to be weaker than expected, with average around-the-clock prices for July through December projected to be $28 per MWh in PJM and $22 per MWh in MAIN. These average price projections are about $3 per MWh lower than previous price projections. Management further observed that the around the clock price projections for the summer months are about $15 per MWh lower than previous projections and that those months are more sensitive to price changes because the portfolio is least hedged in those months. Previously provided estimates of a $0.03 per share sensitivity to each $1/MWh change in the average around the clock price still holds over the course of a year, but cannot be applied to individual months, such as July and August due to the higher than average level of price sensitivity in those months. Management indicated that it expected savings from the Cost Management Initiative to exceed plan and, coupled with warmer than normal weather in July, help to offset the effect of the lower wholesale prices. Management stated that a number of potentially offsetting factors will affect 2003 earnings: o wholesale energy price forecasts which are lower than previous projections
o potential increases in pension costs due to equity market performance, o the impact of implementing FAS 143, which is currently being evaluated o the release of a portion of the energy option contract with Edison Mission Energy which will affect 2003 earnings. Management indicated that the Enterprises business segment is expected to break even on an operating basis in the second half of 2002, exclusive of any gains or losses which could be incurred if businesses or investments are sold. Management also discussed ComEd's Provider of Last Resort proposal recently filed with the Illinois Commerce Commission. ComEd is seeking permission to limit the availability of its bundled fixed rate for electricity to 350 customers representing 2,500 MW's of load, of which customers representing approximately 1,600 MW's of load are currently obtaining service from Alternative Retail Electric Suppliers.

Exhibit 99.1 [EXELON LOGO] News Release From: Exelon Corporation FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE --------------------- Corporate Communications July 31, 2002 P.O. Box 805379 Chicago, IL 60680-5379 Contact: Linda Marsicano, Media Relations 312.394.3099 Linda Byus, CFA, Investor Relations 312.394.7696 Exelon Announces Second Quarter Operating Earnings of $1.14 Before Gain on Sale of Investment Chicago (July 31, 2002) - Exelon Corporation (NYSE: EXC) today reported consolidated earnings of $485 million, or $1.50 per share (diluted), for the second quarter of 2002. Operating earnings were $369 million, or $1.14 per share, before a $116 million, or $0.36 per share, after-tax gain related to Exelon Enterprises' sale of its 49% interest in AT&T Wireless PCS of Philadelphia. The transaction closed on April 1, 2002. Operating earnings in the second quarter of 2002 were up 18% compared with second quarter 2001 earnings of $0.97 per share. Improved operating results were due to increased weather related kWh deliveries, lower interest expense and lower operating and maintenance expense in the quarter compared to second quarter 2001. The Cost Management Initiative achieved $93 million of savings in the second quarter and $104 million year-to-date. The estimated net impact of favorable weather is $0.09 per share in the second quarter compared to the prior year and also $0.09 per share relative to the normal weather that was incorporated in Exelon's guidance. The cessation of goodwill amortization contributed $0.12 per share for the quarter relative to the second quarter of 2001. John W. Rowe, Exelon Chairman and CEO, stated, "Our strong second quarter earnings are the result of the efforts of Exelon employees to live up to our commitments and perform at world-class levels. Our Cost Management Initiative, led by Oliver Kingsley, is producing results. Based on everything we know today, we expect to meet or exceed the current consensus estimate of $4.65 per share. However, with the current economic and wholesale power price volatility, it is difficult to project earnings in a narrow range." 2002 Earnings Outlook Exelon's 2002 earnings outlook has been updated to incorporate year-to-date events including first half operating results and our expectations for the balance of the year. Exelon's guidance for consolidated 2002 earnings from operations excluding unusual items remains in the range of $4.55 to $4.85 per diluted share based on the assumption of normal weather for the balance of the year. Earnings from operations exclude the second quarter gain from the sale of the AT&T investment and first quarter goodwill impairment and severance costs. Third quarter earnings are expected to represent about 30% of the full year earnings.
Page 2 Second Quarter Highlights o Exelon Generation's nuclear group completed two scheduled refueling outages during the second quarter of 2002, the same as in the second quarter of 2001. The average refueling outage duration for the first half of 2002 was 23 days compared to 25 days for the first half of 2001. In the second quarter of 2002, there was a planned maintenance outage (non-refueling outage) at LaSalle Station with a duration of 15 days. Power uprate modifications were installed during both of the second quarter 2002 refueling outages, adding a total of 129 MWs of additional capacity. Exelon Generation's nuclear fleet, excluding AmerGen, produced 28,353 GWhs output for the second quarter of 2002, compared to 28,443 GWhs output for the second quarter of 2001. The fleet, including AmerGen, achieved a capacity factor of 92.1% for the second quarter of 2002, compared to 93.6% for the second quarter 2001. o Exelon Generation's fossil operations continued their strong performance in the second quarter with 98.9% on-time delivery and 94.2% dispatch availability. o Exelon Generation's power marketing organization, Power Team, mitigated the impact of depressed wholesale power prices during the second quarter with hedging activities. The average realized wholesale market price, excluding trading, for the quarter was $31/MWh, significantly higher than the average observed around-the-clock spot price of approximately $25/MWh in its two primary generation supply regions of MAIN and PJM. The average realized market price, excluding trading, in second quarter of 2001 was $38/MWh. o On April 25, 2002, Exelon Generation acquired two natural-gas and oil-fired plants from TXU Corp. (TXU) for an aggregate purchase price of $443 million. The purchase includes the 893-megawatt Mountain Creek Steam Electric Station in Dallas and the 1,441-megawatt Handley Steam Electric Station in Fort Worth. o Exelon Enterprises completed the sale of its 49% interest in AT&T Wireless PCS of Philadelphia, LLC to a subsidiary of AT&T Wireless Services for $285 million in cash. The transaction closed on April 1, 2002. The after-tax gain was $116 million with a resulting $0.36 earnings per share (diluted) gain included in reported earnings for the quarter but excluded from operating income. o On June 27, Exelon Generation announced an agreement to purchase Sithe New England Holdings, a subsidiary of Sithe Energies, Inc., in exchange for a $543 million note, plus the assumption of approximately $1.15 billion of project debt. If the transaction closing conditions are met and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and other approvals are received, the transaction could be completed in November 2002. o On July 1, 2002, Exelon Generation notified Midwest Generation of the exercise of its call options under the existing Coal Generation Purchase Power Agreement. Exelon Generation exercised options on 1,265 MWs of capacity and did not exercise options on 2,684 MWs of capacity. In 2003, Exelon Generation will take 1,696 MWs of non-option capacity and 1,265 MWs of option capacity under the existing contract.
Page 3 o On July 19, Exelon Energy Delivery's Illinois operating company, ComEd, filed a request with the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) to revise the Provider of Last Resort (POLR) obligation in Illinois. ComEd is seeking permission from the ICC to limit the availability by June 2006 of Rate 6L for its largest energy customers, those with demands of at least 3 megawatts, which typically include heavy industrial plants, large office buildings, government facilities and a variety of other businesses. Rate 6L is a bundled fixed rate offered to about 370 customers representing 2,500 MWs of load. The ICC has 120 days to act on the filing or it will be deemed approved. Other items: Exelon early adopted new accounting guidance issued by the Emerging Issues Task Force of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (EITF 02-3) in June, which requires that revenues and expenses related to energy trading contracts be presented on a net basis in the income statement. Prior to the second quarter of 2002, Exelon's trading revenues and costs were presented on a gross basis. For comparative purposes, page 14 of the attachment provides the impact of netting trading expenses with revenues for prior quarters. BUSINESS UNIT RESULTS Exelon Corporation's consolidated net income for the second quarter of 2002 was $485 million compared with net income of $315 million in the second quarter of 2001. Exelon Energy Delivery consists of the retail electricity transmission and distribution operations of ComEd and PECO Energy and the natural gas distribution business of PECO Energy. Energy Delivery's net income in the second quarter of 2002 was $322 million compared with net income of $264 million in the second quarter of 2001, primarily due to cost savings and increased weather-related kWh sales in 2002. Cooling degree days in the ComEd service territory were up 29% relative to last year and 33% above normal. In the PECO service territory cooling degree days were up 1% compared with 2001 and 36% above normal. Total retail KWh deliveries rose 2.2% for ComEd, with a 12% increase in deliveries to the weather-sensitive residential customer class. PECO's retail KWh deliveries increased 3.0% overall. Energy Delivery's total revenues for the second quarter of 2002 of $2,476 million were up 2% from $2,436 million in 2001, offset by a $31 million net increase in fuel and purchased power. Operating and maintenance expense decreased $23 million reflecting lower uncollectable accounts expense and Cost Management Initiative savings. The absence of the amortization of goodwill and lower interest expense contributed to the increase in Energy Delivery's operating results. The impact of the warmer summer weather increased Energy Delivery's second quarter 2002 earnings per share (diluted) by approximately $0.05 relative to 2001 and $0.06 relative to the normal weather that was incorporated in our earnings guidance.
Page 4 Exelon Generation consists of Exelon's electric generation operations and power marketing and trading functions. Generation's second quarter 2002 net income of $84 million was up from second quarter 2001 net income of $71 million. The increase is due to the positive impacts of Exelon's Cost Management Initiative, lower interest expense and lower depreciation expense, partially offset by higher trading portfolio losses. Energy sales for the second quarter of 2002 totaled 50,238 GWhs, exclusive of trading volumes, compared with 48,068 GWhs in 2001. Generation's second quarter 2002 revenue of $1,559 million includes a net trading portfolio loss of $16 million compared to second quarter 2001 revenue of $1,583 million, which includes a net trading portfolio loss of $6 million. As noted above, second quarter 2001 revenues have been revised to reflect the adoption of EITF 02-3, which requires that trading-related expenses be netted against trading revenues. Revenues, excluding the net trading portfolio losses, decreased 2.2% from the second quarter of 2001, reflecting lower market prices for energy. The average realized price excluding trading activity in the second quarter of 2002 was $31 per MWh compared with $33 per MWh in 2001. The average realized price reflects a higher proportion ot Generation's total sales being to Exelon Energy Delivery as a result of favorable weather conditions, which partially offset the impact of lower market prices during the second quarter of 2002 as compared to the second quarter of 2001. Revenue net fuel decreased $2 million to $630 million for the second quarter of 2002 as compared to the second quarter of 2001 as a result of the factors noted above. The second quarter 2002 revenue net fuel includes net mark-to-market losses of $5 million including non-cash mark-to-market gains on non-trading activities of $4 million and non-cash mark-to-market trading losses of $9 million. Operating and maintenance expenses increased $6 million reflecting the addition of the plants acquired from TXU, which are offset by savings generated by Exelon's Cost Management Initiative efforts. Depreciation and amortization decreased $10 million for the second quarter of 2002 as compared to the second quarter of 2001 due primarily to plant life extensions, which were incorporated in the depreciation calculation beginning in the latter half of 2001. Interest expense of $11 million was $15 million lower for the second quarter of 2002 as compared to the second quarter of 2001 due primarily to lower interest rates on borrowings and higher capitalized interest. Exelon Enterprises consists of Exelon's competitive retail energy sales, Energy Solutions and infrastructure services, venture capital investments and related businesses. Enterprises reported second quarter 2002 net income of $83 million, which includes the $116 million after-tax gain on the sale of the AT&T Wireless investment. Excluding that gain, second quarter 2002 results were a loss of $33 million. Second quarter 2001 results were a loss of $5 million. Enterprises second quarter 2001 results included an $18 million gain on investments. The $28 million decrease in 2002 earnings compared to 2001 is primarily due to $36 million of investment writedowns and $4 million of other net asset writedowns in the second quarter of 2002, partially offset by the cessation of goodwill amortization, lower interest expense and the absence of AT&T Wireless operating losses after the April sale. Enterprises revenues and operating expenses were each lower by approximately $70 million compared to 2001, as a result of reduced project activity at Energy Solutions, reduced construction activity at InfraSource due to the continued decline in the telecommunications industry, reduced gas prices, and Enterprises' unregulated Exelon Energy's exit from the retail energy business in the PJM region, partially offset by higher electric revenues from the Illinois energy market.
