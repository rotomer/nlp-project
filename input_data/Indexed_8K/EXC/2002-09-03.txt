Exhibit 99.1 News Release From: Exelon Corporation FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Corporate Communications --------------------- P.O. Box 805379 September 3, 2002 Chicago, IL 60680-5379 Contact: Don Kirchoffner, Exelon Media Relations 312.394.3001 John Hatfield, ComEd Media Relations 312.394.4214 Linda Byus, CFA, Investor Relations 312.394.7696 Exelon and ComEd to Seek Rehearing of FERC Ruling Chicago (September 3, 2002) - Exelon Corporation (NYSE: EXC) and its Illinois energy delivery subsidiary ComEd today announced they will seek rehearing of a ruling last week by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) staff. The staff ruled that unidentified amounts of goodwill on ComEd's books should be attributed to the nuclear units and power marketing activities it transferred to Exelon Generation in January 2001 as part of the company's post-merger restructuring. Exelon Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John W. Rowe stated, "I have reviewed this matter closely with the Exelon and ComEd finance and accounting staffs, as well as with our external auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers, and I am confident that our filings complied with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Even more important in this time of corporate misdeeds and public mistrust, the treatment of our goodwill was publicly disclosed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the FERC and the Illinois Commerce Commission." Pam Strobel, Chief Executive Officer of Exelon Energy Delivery and Chairman of ComEd, said "While FERC has the ability to interpret its own standards, I believe we have a substantial opportunity to persuade the FERC that any significant transfer of goodwill would be inconsistent with GAAP, with the operation of the Illinois Utility Restructuring Act and with FERC policy deferring to state actions in implementing retail competition and utility restructuring. It is also highly significant that a majority of the members of the Illinois Commerce Commission have indicated they individually support FERC's use of GAAP accounting." "The Illinois Restructuring Law of 1997 has been successful because it created a careful balance, with protections for customers, new suppliers and utilities," said Frank Clark, President of ComEd. "FERC's ruling could disrupt that balance by depriving ComEd of earnings opportunities provided by Illinois law through 2006. The result would be an unnecessary and unintentional threat to the continued development of competition here in Illinois." FERC had earlier approved Exelon's accounting method, which reflected the post-merger "fair value" accounting methodology and resulting goodwill at ComEd. ###
