UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Washington, DC 20549 FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 October 2, 2002 (Date of earliest event reported)
Item 5. Other Events On October 3, 2002 Exelon issued the following note to its financial community: Exelon Generation Company, LLC Exercises Options Under Purchase Power Agreement With Midwest Generation, LLC On October 2, 2002, Exelon Generation notified Midwest Generation, LLC (Midwest) of its exercise of certain of Exelon Generation's termination options under the existing Collins Generating Station and Peaking Unit Purchase Power Agreements (PPA). Exelon Generation is a subsidiary of Exelon Corporation (Exelon). Midwest is a subsidiary of Edison Mission Energy and Edison International. Exelon Generation has elected to exercise its termination options on Collins Units 2, 4, and 5 totaling 1,614 MWs of the capacity for the fourth and fifth contract years, 2003 and 2004. Exelon Generation has also elected to exercise its termination options with respect to Calumet units 33 and 34 and Lombard unit 33 totaling 113 MWs for the same period. The effect of exercising these termination options is that Exelon Generation will release the output of the following Midwest generating units during 2003 and 2004. Collins Unit 2 - 554 MW Collins Unit 4 - 530 MW Collins Unit 5 - 530 MW Calumet 33 - 38 MW Calumet 34 - 43 MW Lombard 33 - 32 MW -------- Total 1,727 MW Exelon Generation did not exercise its termination options on Collins Units 1 and 3 (1,084 MWs of capacity) or on the remaining 694 MWs of peaking capacity under contract (a total of 1,778 MWs of capacity). Accordingly, Exelon Generation will take output from the following units during 2003. Collins Unit 1 - 554 MW Unit 3 - 530 MW Peaking units - 694 MW -------- Total 1,778 MW
Exelon Generation also has a Coal Generating Stations Purchase Power Agreement with Midwest. Under that PPA, during the fourth contract year, 2003, Exelon Generation contracted for 1,696 MWs of non-option capacity from Midwest with a call option on 3,949 MWs of capacity. On July 1, 2002 Exelon Generation exercised it call option on 1,265 MWs of option capacity. For the contract year 2003, Exelon Generation will take the 1,696 MWs of non-option coal capacity, 1,265 MWs of the option coal capacity, 1,084 MWs of Collins station capacity and 694 MWs of peaking capacity from Midwest. In total, Exelon Generation has retained a total of 4,739 MWs of capacity under the terms of the three existing PPAs with Midwest Generation. Providing reliable service to customers in Illinois served by delivery subsidiary ComEd remains a top priority of Exelon. On June 20, 2002, Exelon provided earnings per share guidance of a 4.5% to 5.5% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) off a 2001 base. The cost savings related to the Midwest contract incorporated in Exelon's model at that time totaled $120 million in 2003. The $120 million represented an estimate of the cost savings that could be achieved if the company turned back 50% of the July 1 coal options relative to the estimated cost of the contract in 2003. With the release of about 70% of the coal options and 1,727 MWs of Collins and peaking capacity, the estimated savings in 2003 relative to the full Midwest contract price are about $250 million. However, since the PPAs included a significant step-up in cost in 2003, that contract savings number does not represent year-over-year savings in 2003 compared to 2002. With the exercise of the termination options on Collins and the peaking plants in addition to the options on the coal plants, the contract with Midwest is in place for 2003. By exercising the Midwest contract options and restructuring the 2003 supply portfolio, the expected capacity cost savings in 2003 compared with 2002 are approximately $130 million. The estimated cost savings are after recognition of capacity payments to other suppliers for the desired amount of contracted replacement of the released supply. Incremental savings related to the energy charge on purchased power will be a function of Exelon Generation's supply portfolio in 2003, fuel prices, wholesale market prices and volumes purchased.
