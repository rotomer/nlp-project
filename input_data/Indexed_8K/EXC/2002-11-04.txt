Item 5. Other Events. On October 30, 2002, Exelon Corporation issued a press release disclosing its first quarter 2002 earnings results. The press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1. On November 1, 2002, Exelon Generation Company, LLC issued a press release regarding the closing of its acquisition of Sithe New England Holdings, LLC. The press release is attached as Exhibit 99.2. Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure A. Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call As previously announced, on October 30, 2002 Exelon Corporation conducted its Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. The call was open to all on a listen-only basis and was audio web-cast. Telephone replays will be available through November 15, 2002. The U.S. call-in number is 877.519.4471 and the international call-in number is 973.341.3080. The confirmation code is 3524786. In addition, the call will be archived on Exelon's web site, www.exeloncorp.com; please choose the Investor Relations page. During the call management reviewed issues outlined in the press release. Management elaborated on the initial 2003 earnings guidance range of $4.70 to $5.00 per share, assuming normal weather. Detail on several of the large factors impacting 2003 estimated earnings include: Positive impacts - ---------------- o capacity charge redutions compared to 2002 due to the exercise of termination options under the Midwest Generation power purchase agreements, $130 million or $0.26 per share, and o three fewer planned nuclear refueling outages in 2003 (8), as compared to 2002 (11), $70 million or $0.14 per share Negative impacts - ---------------- o Exelon's interest in Sithe, other than Sithe New England purchase, about $0.20 to $0.25 per share o increased pension expense and other post-retirement benefit costs, $70 million, or $0.14 per share, and o up to $0.10 per share from the adoption of SFAS No. 143 Other factors - ------------- o weather normalized electric delivery growth rates of 1.9% and 0.6% for ComEd and PECO, respectively. Management provided additional information including projected around-the-clock pricing in NEPOOL of about $37 per MWh for the fourth quarter of 2002 and for 2003 of
about $34 per MWh and a gas price of $3.75 per MMBTU at the Henry Hub. Management observed that the three major cash outflows in 2003 are anticipated to be approximately $2 billion in capital expenditures, approximately $570 million in dividends and a pension contribution of approximately $300 million to $350 million. Additionally, a $650 million issuance of external debt is anticipated in order to complete the Sithe transaction. Management also discussed pension expense and indicated that the 2003 earnings guidance included $70 million in increased pension and other post-retirement benefits expense. Management noted that Exelon will not be required to make a pension contribution in 2002, but that it is considering making discretionary contributions of $100 million to $200 million in 2002 and of $300 million to $350 million in 2003. It further noted that Exelon could be required to recognize an additional minimum liability for pension as prescribed by FAS 87 and FAS 132 of between $500 million and $1 billion at year-end 2002. The liability would be recorded as a reduction to common equity, but does not affect earnings, and the equity would be restored to the balance sheet in future periods when the fair value of plan assets exceeds the accumulated benefit obligation. Management has assumed a return on assets of 4% and a discount rate of 7% for the year 2003 in its estimate of pension expense and other post-retirement benefit costs. Management indicated that it would review and finalize the assumptions for 2003 and subsequent years at the beginning of 2003 during the normal annual review process. Management noted that the previously announced equity gain of at least $1.5 billion related to the adoption of FAS 143 would offset the reduction to equity recorded to recognize the additional pension costs. Management stated that regulatory asset amortization in the third quarter of 2002 was $17 million higher, after income taxes, or $0.05 per share, than was included in previous earnings guidance. Additional fourth quarter amortization is expected to be $28 million higher than included in previous earnings guidance, after income taxes, which would lower earnings by about $0.09 per share relative to our prior earnings outlook for the quarter. Enterprises expects to have positive earnings in the second half of 2002 although it will report an operating loss for the full year 2002. Break even performance is expected from Enterprises in 2003.

EXELON [LOGO] - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- News Release From: Exelon Corporation FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Corporate Communications --------------------- P.O. Box 805379 Chicago, IL 60680-5379 October 30, 2002 Contact: Linda Marsicano, Media Relations 312.394.3099 Linda Byus, CFA, Investor Relations 312.394.7696 Exelon Reports Third Quarter Earnings of $1.70 Per Diluted Share Chicago (October 30, 2002) - Exelon Corporation (NYSE: EXC) today reported consolidated earnings of $551 million, or $1.70 per share (diluted), for the third quarter of 2002. There were no unusual earnings items in the quarter. Earnings in the third quarter of 2001 were $1.16 per share and included three unusual items that lowered earnings by $0.16 per share. Excluding those items, third quarter 2001 earnings from operations were $1.32 per share. Earnings for the third quarter 2002 were up 29% over earnings from operations in third quarter 2001. Improved operating results were due to increased weather-related kWh deliveries, lower interest expense, lower income taxes and higher interest income in the quarter compared with third quarter 2001. The Cost Management Initiative achieved $82 million of sustainable savings in the third quarter 2002 and $186 million year-to-date, which was partially offset by an increase in operating and maintenance expense related to the acquisition of two generating plants in April. The estimated net impact of favorable weather is $0.17 per share in the third quarter compared with the prior year and $0.16 per share relative to the normal weather that was incorporated in Exelon's guidance. The cessation of goodwill amortization contributed $0.11 per share for the quarter relative to the third quarter of 2001. "Our integrated asset portfolio and commitment to world-class performance enabled us to achieve a very solid third quarter," said John W. Rowe, Exelon Chairman and CEO. "Our Cost Management Initiative is producing results this year, and more importantly, this drive for improved efficiency and productivity has become an integral part of our operating culture, which will support earnings in the future. With three strong quarters on the books, we have revised our earnings guidance for 2002 to $4.65 to $4.80 per share. Based on the current outlook, we believe we are in a position to earn $4.70 to $5.00 per share in 2003." 2002 and 2003 Earnings Outlook Exelon's 2002 earnings outlook has been updated to incorporate year-to-date events including year-to-date operating results and our expectations for the balance of the year.
Exelon's guidance for consolidated 2002 earnings from operations, excluding unusual items, is a range of $4.65 to $4.80 per diluted share based on the assumption of normal weather in the fourth quarter. Earnings from operations exclude the second quarter gain from the sale of the AT&T Wireless investment and first quarter goodwill impairment and severance costs. Initial guidance for 2003 earnings from operations is a range of $4.70 to $5.00 per share, based on the assumption of normal weather, and excludes any potential asset sales. The guidance for 2003 earnings includes the impact of higher pension expense and the impact of the adoption of FAS 143. Third Quarter Highlights o Exelon Generation's nuclear fleet, excluding AmerGen, produced 29,817 GWhs for the third quarter of 2002, compared with 28,456 GWhs output for the third quarter of 2001. The fleet, including AmerGen, achieved a capacity factor of 93.9% for the third quarter of 2002, compared with 93.0% for the third quarter 2001. Exelon Generation's nuclear group did not have any outages scheduled during July and August and began two outages in September. The outage schedule was similar to third quarter 2001. During a planned refueling outage at Byron 2 (a pressurized water reactor) in late September, an NRC-required inspection of the reactor vessel head was completed and the head was found to be acceptable. The inspection was required to ensure there is no head degradation as a result of boron corrosion, similar to damage previously found at the Davis Besse reactor. o Exelon Generation's fossil operations continued their strong performance in the third quarter with 99.2% on-time delivery and 94.1% dispatch availability. o Exelon Generation's power marketing organization, PowerTeam, continued to face the challenge of depressed wholesale power prices. Market sales margins were negatively impacted by average market sales prices that were $7.05/MWh lower than the prior year. Excluding the benefit associated with the Texas plant acquisition, average market prices realized for the three months ended September 30, 2002 were $9.79/MWh lower than the same 2001 period. Those plants contributed $58 million of margin during the quarter. The effect of the lower sales prices was partially offset by lower average supply costs and increased market sales volumes. o On September 24, Exelon Generation received FERC approval to purchase Sithe New England Holdings, a subsidiary of Sithe Energies, Inc., representing about 4,470 MWs of generation. The purchase will be in exchange for a $543 million note, plus the assumption of approximately $1.15 billion of project debt. If closing conditions are satisfied, the transaction could close in November 2002. o On October 2, 2002, Exelon Generation notified Midwest Generation (Midwest) of the exercise of its termination options under the existing Collins and Peaking Purchase Power Agreements. Exelon Generation released 1,727 MWs of capacity and will retain the output of 1,778 MWs of Collins and peaking unit capacity in 2003. On July 1, Exelon exercised its call option on 1,265 MWs of coal capacity. For the contract year 2003, Exelon has contracted for 4,739 MWs of capacity from Midwest, which includes 1,696 MWs of non-option coal capacity. By exercising the Midwest contract options and restructuring the 2003 supply portfolio, the expected capacity savings in 2003 compared with 2002 are approximately $130 million.
o On October 10, 2002, the results of the audit of ComEd's 2000 test year expenditures that was required as part of its Delivery Services Rate Case were released to the public. The audit recommended a $106 million net rate base reduction, a $141 million reduction in operating expenses and a $153 million reduction in ComEd's delivery services revenue requirement relative to the April 1 interim rate order. The potential revenue impact of the order is not expected to be material, because the reduction in the delivery services revenue requirement is likely to be largely offset by increases in the competitive transition charges paid by customers who choose a new supplier. ComEd intends to contest the audit findings. However, depending on the final Illinois Commerce Commission decision, ComEd's estimated potential write-off could be up to approximately $100 million (pre-tax). In the third quarter 2002, ComEd recorded a $12 million (pre-tax), or $0.02 per share, non-cash charge representing the minimum probable write-off exposure resulting from the audit findings. BUSINESS UNIT RESULTS Exelon Corporation's consolidated net income for the third quarter of 2002 was $551 million compared with net income of $376 million in the third quarter of 2001. Exelon Energy Delivery consists of the retail electricity transmission and distribution operations of ComEd and PECO and the natural gas distribution business of PECO. Energy Delivery's net income in the third quarter of 2002 was $370 million compared with net income of $280 million in the third quarter of 2001, primarily due to increased weather-related kWh sales and cost savings in 2002. Cooling degree days in the ComEd service territory were up 26% relative to last year and 24% above normal. In the PECO service territory, cooling degree days were up 20% compared with 2001 and 27% above normal. Total retail KWh deliveries rose 4.4% for ComEd, with an 8.6% increase in deliveries to the weather-sensitive residential customer class. PECO's retail KWh deliveries increased 9.9% overall. Energy Delivery's total revenues for the third quarter of 2002 of $3,162 million were up 6% from $2,970 million in 2001, offset by a $100 million net increase in fuel and purchased power. Operating and maintenance expense decreased $14 million reflecting lower maintenance expenditures and the absence of a 2001 severance accrual at PECO, partially offset by an increase in the reserve for environmental liabilities. The absence of the amortization of goodwill and lower interest expense contributed to the increase in Energy Delivery's operating results. The impact of the warmer summer weather increased Energy Delivery's third quarter 2002 earnings per share (diluted) by approximately $0.14 relative to 2001 and $0.16 relative to the normal weather that was incorporated in our earnings guidance. Exelon Generation consists of Exelon's electric generation operations and power marketing and trading functions. Generation's third quarter 2002 net income of $163 million was up from third quarter 2001 net income of $140 million. The increase is due to weather-related increased margins from sales to affiliates, and lower average supply costs. The margin gains from sales to affiliates were offset by lower margins on market sales and a decrease in trading margin. Energy sales for the third quarter of 2002 totaled 57,173 GWhs, exclusive of trading volumes, compared with 52,511 GWhs in 2001. Generation's third quarter 2002 revenue of $2,213 million includes a net trading portfolio loss of $12 million compared with third quarter 2001 revenue of $2,191 million, which includes a net trading portfolio gain of $5 million. Revenues, excluding the trading portfolio, increased 1.8% from the third quarter of 2001, reflecting the increased revenue from the two plants in Texas acquired in 2002 partially offset by lower market prices for energy.
The average realized price excluding trading activity in the third quarter of 2002 was $38.69 per MWh compared with $41.13 per MWh in 2001. The average realized price reflects a lower proportion (60% in 2002 vs. 62% in 2001) of Generation's total sales being to Exelon Energy Delivery, as well as the impact of lower market prices during the third quarter of 2002 as compared with the third quarter of 2001. Revenue net fuel increased $2 million to $683 million for the third quarter of 2002 as compared with the third quarter of 2001 as a result of the factors noted above. The third quarter 2002 revenue net fuel includes mark-to-market gains of $1 million from non-trading activities. Operating and maintenance expenses increased $27 million reflecting the addition of the plants acquired from TXU, which were partially offset by savings generated by Exelon's Cost Management Initiative efforts. The $11 million increase in depreciation and amortization for the third quarter of 2002 as compared with the third quarter of 2001 is related to the plants acquired from TXU and other higher plant balances. Interest expense of $23 million was $18 million lower for the third quarter of 2002 as compared with the third quarter of 2001 primarily due to lower interest rates on borrowings. Higher earnings from unconsolidated affiliates of $27 million relate principally to mark-to-market gains on a tolling arrangement at Sithe and a cancellation of turbine orders and better station performance and station uprates at AmerGen. Exelon Enterprises consists of Exelon's competitive retail energy sales, Energy Solutions and infrastructure services, venture capital investments and related businesses. Enterprises reported third quarter 2002 net income of $15 million. Third quarter 2001 results were a loss of $33 million. Enterprises achieved a $15 million operating earnings improvement compared with 2001 primarily as a result of increased revenues and margins in infrastructure services, Exelon's Cost Management Initiative savings and the cessation of goodwill amortization. Enterprises third quarter 2001 results included a $36 million pre-tax writedown of its investment in Corvis, a telecommunications equipment manufacturer. The improved third quarter 2002 results were due to the absence of the 2001 Corvis writedown and 2001 losses related to Enterprises' AT&T Wireless investment, which was sold in the second quarter of 2002, and $10 million (pre-tax) of earnings from an unconsolidated communications joint venture related to its recovery of trade receivables previously considered uncollectible.

Exhibit 99.2 Exelon Generation [LOGO] - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- News Release FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Nov. 1, 2002 - --------------------- Contact: Exelon Generation, Ted Caddell 610-765-6911 Exelon Investor Relations, Linda Byus 312-394-7696 Exelon Generation Completes Acquisition of Sithe's New England Plants Exelon Generation today completed its acquisition of Sithe New England Holdings, LLC, which owns a number of New England generating stations, from Sithe Energies, Inc. Exelon Generation purchased a 49.9 percent interest in Sithe Energies in December, 2000. "Exelon invested in Sithe originally because of the company's Boston-based generating facilities," said Exelon Generation President Oliver D. Kingsley Jr. "Owning or having access to generation in key regions in the Northeast region, and serving city markets, is consistent with Exelon's strategy in Philadelphia and Chicago." Exelon Generation acquired Sithe New England for a $543 million note, plus the assumption of project debt supporting the construction of Mystic 8, 9, and Fore River generating stations. The acquired facilities include Sithe's New England plants in operation and in various stages of construction: Sithe New Boston, South Boston, Mass.; Sithe Framingham, in Framingham, Mass.; Sithe West Medway, in West Medway, Mass.; a 5 percent ownership of the Wyman facility in Yarmouth, Maine; Sithe Mystic, in Everett, Mass.; Sithe Fore River in Weymouth, Mass. and Sithe Power Marketing. The plants are fossil-fueled plants, utilizing a combination of fuel oil and natural gas. Together, present capacity and capacity in development at these plants totals about 4,400 megawatts. Also included in the acquisition is Sithe's power marketing operation, Sithe Power Marketing L.P. This operation will now come under Exelon Generation and be renamed Exelon New England Power Marketing. Sithe, which still has generation facilities in New York and other regions, will establish a new marketing entity called Sithe Energy Marketing Inc. (more)

Box 805379 Chicago, IL 60680-5379 November 4, 2002 Note to Exelon's Financial Community: Exelon Generation Completes Acquisition of Sithe New England Holdings On Friday, November 1, Exelon Generation announced the completion of its acquisition of Sithe New England Holdings, LLC (SNEH), a subsidiary of Sithe Energies, Inc. (Sithe), in exchange for a $543 million note, plus project debt of $1.15 billion. In addition to this transaction, Exelon and Sithe's other shareholders are contemplating additional transactions to restructure the original Sithe transaction. The completion of the SNEH transaction and the acquisition of the remaining ownership of Sithe Energies are already incorporated in Exelon's earnings guidance for 2002 and 2003. Sithe Assets Included in the Transaction The facilities covered under the transaction include Sithe's New England plants in operation and in various stages of construction. The plants are fossil fueled, utilizing a combination of fuel oil and natural gas. Table 1 shows a listing of the plants and some of their operating characteristics. Also included in the acquisition is Sithe Power Marketing, LP, a New York-based power marketing operation that will now become Exelon New England Power Marketing, LP, headquartered in Kennett Square, Pa. The units under construction are being built by Raytheon under a turn-key contract. Raytheon has indicated that December 2002 is the projected on-line date for the plants under construction, Mystic 8 & 9 and ForeRiver, but has suggested that there will likely be further delays into 2003. The original start-up dates for these plants were in spring 2002. Liquidated damages, as a result of the construction delays, are being paid on a monthly basis by Raytheon largely though a netting against their construction bills. Exelon's Position Relative to Sithe Exelon has been a 49.9 percent owner of Sithe since December 2000. The initial investment in Sithe Energies was $697 million. In connection with the original investment, Exelon and Sithe's other shareholders executed a Put and Call Agreement (PCA) that gives Exelon the right to purchase (Call) the remaining 50.1 percent of Sithe, and gave the other Sithe shareholders the right to sell (Put) to Exelon at the current Fair Market Value of the Sithe shares subject to floor and ceiling prices. If the put option is exercised, Exelon does have the obligation to complete the purchase. The PCA, which remains in effect, provides that the put and call options become exercisable as of December 18, 2002 and for three years thereafter. The SNEH transaction is an acquisition of assets from Sithe separate from the original PCA. Exelon Generation continues to own 49.9 percent of Sithe Energies. If no other restructuring transactions take place, the original Put and Call may still be exercised.
If the other contemplated transactions take place and the restructuring is completed, the benefits to Exelon are expected to be as follows: o Enables the acquisition of only the assets in the Sithe portfolio that fit Exelon's strategy rather than acquiring the whole company and divesting non-strategic assets in subsequent transactions. o Reduces the size of the transaction and the amount of Exelon debt required to finance the acquisition. o In addition to the economic and operating reasons, the restructured transaction would allow Exelon to integrate the Sithe assets in a tax-efficient manner. Financial Impact of Sithe Investment For financial planning purposes, it is assumed Exelon Generation acquires the remaining 50.1 percent of Sithe pursuant to the PCA in June 2003. Efforts continue to restructure the PCA, but there is no certainty the remaining transactions will be executed. The potential restructured transaction would include the already completed acquisition of Sithe New England Holdings and other contemplated transactions. The impact of the SNEH acquisition as well as any additional impacts of the restructuring transactions do not change the current Exelon earnings guidance with respect to Sithe in 2002 and 2003. Exelon's current earnings guidance includes approximately $0.05 per share dilutive impact from the Sithe investment in 2002 and $0.20-$0.25 per share dilutive impact in 2003. The actual earnings contribution in 2003 will be a function of the timing of the completion of the acquisition, the structure of the acquisition and wholesale market power prices. The estimated balance sheet impact of the SNEH acquisition and the expected Put and Call base case is shown below. The two scenarios are not additive. If no other restructuring transactions take place, the Put and Call acquisition debt will replace the SNEH acquisition note, and the incremental project debt and recourse debt will be added. Cash flow from the Sithe investment is expected to be modestly positive in 2003. Forecasted Balance Sheet Impact from Sithe Energies Investment (in millions) The original investment in Sithe Energies was $697 million financed with long-term debt at a cost of 6.95%. Sithe New England Holdings Acquisition (alone): Exelon Generation Note to Sithe Energies $ 543 Project Debt 1,150 --------- Total New Exelon Generation debt $ 1,693 ========= Put/Call Base Case (including SNEH): Estimated Cash Consideration (debt financed) $ 650 Project Debt 1,600 Recourse Debt Assumption 450 --------- Total New Exelon Generation Debt $ 2,700 ========= 2
Sithe Energies Investment Assumptions o The Put and Call is exercised on December 18, 2002. o Required regulatory approval by the FERC is received, and the transaction closes on June 30, 2003. o Mystic 8 & 9 and ForeRiver go into operation on March 1, 2003. o LNG for Mystic 8 & 9 and ForeRiver is supplied under a long-term contract with Distrigas. o The Qualifying Facilities (QFs) are sold prior to the mid-2003 closing. (Exelon is not permitted to own QFs.) o The plants included in the SNEH acquisition are uncontracted merchant plants. Observed average around-the-clock (ATC) price in NEPOOL in 2003 is $34 per MWH. o Sithe's Independence plant, a QF, is under various long-term agreements with Dynegy. Earnings guidance reflects Dynegy's continued performance under these agreements. Additionally, current earnings guidance, excluding potential restructuring transactions, assumes that Independence will be restructured and retained by Exelon. 3
