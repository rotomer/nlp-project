UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Washington, DC 20549 FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 January 29, 2003 (Date of earliest event reported)
Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure A. On January 29, 2002, Exelon Corporation issued a news release disclosing its earnings for the fourth quarter of 2002 and for the year ended December 31, 2002. The press release is attached as Exhibit 99. B. Fourth Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call As previously announced, on January 29, 2003 Exelon Corporation conducted its Fourth Quarter 2002 Earnings Conference Call. The call was open to all on a listen-only basis and was audio web-cast. Telephone replays will be available through February 15, 2003. The U.S. call-in number for replays is 877-519-4471 and the international call-in number is 973-341-3080. The confirmation code is 3653872. In addition, the call will be archived on Exelon's web site, www.exeloncorp.com; please choose the Investor Relations page. During the call, management reviewed issues outlined in the news release. Other matters management discussed associated with the year and quarter ended December 31, 2002 included: o Upon completing the 2003 budget in November 2002, the outlook for ComEd earnings weakened based on more modest sales growth and higher pension expense. Accordingly, ComEd accelerated the regulatory asset amortization by only $8 million after tax, or 2 cents per share, instead of $28 million after tax, or 9 cents per share, as was previously indicated in October 2002. This change resulted in a 7 cents per share increase in earnings in the fourth quarter 2002 compared to our guidance. As provided under the Illinois restructuring act, the regulatory asset amortization is not level quarter to quarter but changes based on ComEd's earnings expectations. o In December 2002, Exelon made a $150 million cash contribution to the pension fund. Also, Exelon recorded a $1 billion after-tax charge to Other Comprehensive Income related to our pension obligation. Neither of these items affected Exelon's earnings for 2002. Exelon's 2002 pension and postretirement obligation expense totaled $93 million. Also, in the fourth quarter of 2002, Exelon made a $150 million contribution to ComEd to reduce its payable to ComEd. ComEd recorded this payment in equity as reduction of its receivable from the parent company. 2003 Earnings Guidance - ---------------------- Management provided additional information on the change in the earnings release to the Exelon 2003 earnings guidance range of $4.80 to $5.00 per share, assuming normal weather. The 2003 earnings guidance is based on the actual 2002 results and the following assumptions for 2003:
o Nuclear Capacity factor: 94.2% o ComEd kWh sales: 1.5% annually assuming normal weather o PECO kWh sales: 0.6% assuming normal weather o ComEd load retention: 85%, same as 2002 o PECO load retention: 80% o Effective income tax rate: 37.3% Management noted that there is no longer simple earnings sensitivity to changes in wholesale power prices. The earnings sensitivity varies from region to region and quarter to quarter. Also, the New England assets are spark spread sensitive rather than simply power price sensitive. Exelon's 2002 weather normalized earnings were $4.75 per share. Detail on several of the large factors affecting 2003 estimated earnings include: Positive effects ---------------- o The exercise of options under the Midwest Generation contract is expected to provide net savings on the capacity charges of about $130 million pre-tax in 2003 compared to 2002. On an after-tax basis that is about 25 cents per share positive. o Three fewer nuclear plant refueling outages are scheduled in 2003, which should provide savings of about $60 million pre-tax or 11 cents per share positive. o Exelon anticipates Enterprises to break even or be slightly positive in 2003. This would result in approximately $51 million, or 16 cents per share, of earnings growth. o The ongoing program of debt refinancing and transition bond retirement is expected to provide 13 cents per share of earnings growth in 2003. o Exelon has a modest outlook for sales growth at Energy Delivery to provide 5 to 10 cents of earnings growth. o Management believes that the ongoing benefit of Cost Management Initiatives will offset inflation in operating expenses in 2003. Negative effects ---------------- o Exelon previously disclosed that the expected impact of the implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 143 (SFAS No. 143), "Asset Retirement Obligations," would be no more than 10 cents per share negative. Exelon now estimates that the effect will be approximately 7 cents per share negative based on its current interpretation of the accounting guidance. This estimate is subject to continued refinement and may change based on the finalization of the adoption of the standard. This amount includes Exelon's
portion of the effect of the adoption of the standard at AmerGen, a 50% owned joint venture between Exelon and British Energy plc. o As previously disclosed, the investment in Sithe is anticipated to be dilutive by 20 cents per share more in 2003 compared to 2002. o Exelon has revised some of its assumptions related to pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligation costs. For 2003, Exelon will use an expected return on plan assets of 9.0%, down from 9.5%. The discount rate assumption is now 6.75%, down from 7.35%. The estimated net impact of these changes is a $125 million pre-tax increase in the expense related to pension and postretirement benefits, approximately 24 cents per share. The 2003 earnings guidance does not include the potential impact of one-time items, such as the cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 143 that is anticipated to include a one-time gain of at least $1.5 billion. Exelon expects that first quarter 2003 earnings will represent between 20% and 25% of the full year's earnings. In first quarter 2002, we had very mild weather, which decreased earnings by 18 cents per share relative to normal weather. With normal weather, management expects an improvement in year-over-year first quarter earnings. Other forward-looking matters - ----------------------------- Exelon has initiated a new plan to develop a more fundamental and durable productivity improvement program to expand on 2002's Cost Management Initiative. This new initiative is called "The Exelon Way". The details on this program intended to assist Exelon in growing its earnings despite the effect of lower wholesale power prices will be released once completed. The plan is not expected to have a significant effect on 2003 earnings, but to begin producing meaningful results in 2004. Exelon's capital budget is approximately $2 billion in 2003 with non-fuel operating and maintenance expenditures in excess of $4 billion. Exelon is attempting to reduce this total number by between 5% and 10% by 2004. The Board of Directors adopted a long-term incentive compensation plan that includes goals of reducing capital spending by $1 billion over the next four years. Management estimates that 60% of its spending decreases will be in its regulated businesses and 40% in the non-regulated businesses. Also, management anticipates generating enough cash flow from operations to be able to fund its capital program, to fund its dividend payments, to fund its pension funding requirements and to fund the $600 million in transition bonds repayments. Management does not anticipate needing external financing sources in 2003 for these purposes; however, Exelon anticipates re-financing approximately $1.4 billion of debt in 2003. Exelon intends to grow its dividend at a rate of approximately four to five percent commensurate with its long-term earnings growth projection.
Exelon's Power Team is typically 80 to 95 percent hedged for near-term transactions. Exelon believes it is at the higher end of that range for the first quarter of 2003. Exelon currently tends to be more fully hedged in the near term, such as first quarter 2003, as compared to more distant periods. Exelon's goal is to secure its earnings while avoiding the downside risk, even though this reduces the potential upside due to price changes. Exelon has firm natural gas delivery contracts that are expected to provide a stable supply to Exelon's New England assets and to minimize spark-spread risk. Following Sithe's practices, Exelon is currently selling the energy generated by these assets in the spot market. Exelon is planning to sell energy into the market with six month to three-year sale contracts with this supply contract in place. ComEd Discussion - ---------------- Illinois electric utilities are allowed to collect a competitive transition charge (CTC) from customers who choose an alternate supplier of electric generation service or choose the ComEd Purchase Power Option (PPO). This CTC was intended to assist electric utilities, such as ComEd, in recovering stranded costs that might not otherwise be recoverable in a fully competitive market. The CTC rate represents the difference between the competitive price of delivered energy (the sum of generation service at competitive prices and the regulated price of energy delivery) and recoveries under historical bundled rates, reduced by a mitigation factor. The CTC rate is updated annually. Over time, to facilitate the transition to a competitive market, the mitigation factor increases, thereby reducing the CTC rate. Under the current rate structure at the end of 2006, ComEd will no longer collect CTCs from customers who elect to take service from a supplier other than ComEd. In 2001, ComEd collected $110 million of CTC revenue, while in 2002, CTC revenue collected increased to $306 million due to the change in the competitive price of delivered energy, primarily due to lower wholesale prices and more customers choosing alternative energy suppliers or the ComEd PPO. Based on increasing mitigation factors and our assumptions about the competitive price of delivered energy and customers' choice of electric suppliers, we estimate that CTC revenue will decrease to approximately $250 to $300 million by 2006. Under the statute as it stands, in 2007 this revenue may drop to zero. At the same time, ComEd will continue to sell electricity to its customers under a bundled rate. ComEd's bundled rate is an all-inclusive rate that does not separately break out charges for energy generation service commodity and energy delivery service, but charges a single set of prices. Much like the CTC collections, this revenue stream is authorized by the legislature through the transition period. After the transition ends in 2006, ComEd's bundled rates may be reset through a traditional or innovative regulator approval process, which may include performance incentives to ComEd. At this point in time it is impossible to predict the outcome of a potential regulatory proceeding to establish rates for 2007. It is also impossible to predict the impact to Exelon of a potential reduction in CTC since many other factors will be changing by 2007, for example market prices.
Exelon has completed the following four major steps to deal with this issue: o The maturities of the ComEd transition bonds are scheduled so that most will be repaid by the end of 2006. o The merger between Unicom and PECO created a larger and more diverse income stream with new growth opportunities when ComEd's transition revenues come to an end. o Exelon established Exelon Generation as a separate legal entity so that it can take advantage of higher wholesale prices when they occur. o Exelon cooperated with other parties who wanted a two-year extension in the bundled rate freeze that previously went into effect. In order to continue to address this matter, Exelon is doing the following going forward: o Exelon is constantly working with Illinois state leadership and business community leadership to facilitate the development of a competitive electricity market while providing consumer protection and system reliability. o Exelon is pursuing measures that would provide greater productivity, quality and innovation in our work practices (as previously described as The Exelon Way). o Exelon believes that the current wholesale power price market will remain sluggish over the next several years, but will start moving up to $29 per megawatt hour in the 2006 and 2007 period. o Finally, Exelon continues to contemplate successful and skillful acquisition(s) that will lessen the potential ComEd impact in 2007. Exelon believes that no one of these factors will solve the 2007 challenge, but that some combination of the four completed steps and the four components currently being worked on, together with other things Exelon may do over the next four years, will address the 2007 challenge.

Exhibit 99 News Release From: Exelon Corporation FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE --------------------- Corporate Communications January 29, 2003 P.O. Box 805379 Chicago, IL 60680-5379 Contact: Linda Marsicano, Media Relations 312.394.3099 Linda Byus, CFA, Investor Relations 312.394.7696 Exelon Reports Fourth Quarter Earnings of $1.22 Per Diluted Share; Common Dividend Increased by 4.5% Chicago (January 29, 2003) - Exelon Corporation (NYSE: EXC) today reported consolidated earnings of $397 million, or $1.22 per share (diluted), for the fourth quarter of 2002 and $1,440 million, or $4.44 per share (diluted), for the year ended December 31, 2002. There were no unusual earnings items in the quarter. Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2001 were $338 million or $1.05 per share (diluted) and included a severance charge that lowered earnings by $0.03 per share. "Earnings from operations" or "operating earnings" represent reported earnings excluding unusual items. Excluding the severance charge, fourth quarter 2001 earnings from operations were $1.08 per share. Earnings for the fourth quarter 2002 were up 13% over earnings from operations in fourth quarter 2001. Full year 2002 earnings from operations were $4.83 per share, up 7.6% over 2001 earnings from operations. Exelon's reported earnings for 2002 included three unusual items that lowered earnings by $0.39 per share, the second quarter gain from the sale of the AT&T Wireless investment and the first quarter charges for goodwill impairment and severance costs. Exelon's reported 2001 earnings of $1,428 million, or $4.43 per share (diluted), included a net negative $0.06 per share of unusual items. The unusual items in 2001 consisted of severance charges, litigation reserves, implementation of a new accounting principle for derivative contracts, the settlement of a transition bond swap, a wholesale rate settlement and the prepayment of competitive transition charges by a large PECO customer. Excluding these items, 2001 operating earnings were $4.49 per share. Improved operating earnings for both the quarter and the full year were due to higher sales (including increased weather-related kWh deliveries), lower interest expense, higher interest income and the cessation of goodwill amortization. For the full year, these positives were offset by lower energy margins resulting from lower wholesale power prices. The estimated net impact of favorable weather is $0.07 per share in the fourth quarter compared with the prior year and $0.01 per share relative to normal weather. For the full year 2002, the favorable impact of weather was $0.21 per share compared with 2001 and $0.08 per share relative to normal weather. The cessation of goodwill amortization contributed $0.11 per share for the quarter relative to the fourth quarter of 2001 and $0.46 per share for the full year 2002 compared with 2001.
"Our success in 2002 was the result of our drive to live up to our commitments and perform at world-class levels," said John W. Rowe, Exelon Chairman and CEO. "In 2003, we will build on our successful Cost Management Initiative and continue to push for improved efficiency and productivity. Based on the current outlook, we believe we are in a position to earn $4.80 to $5.00 per share in 2003." Common Dividend Increase Yesterday, the Exelon Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.46 per share on Exelon's common stock, payable March 10, 2003, to shareholders of record at 5:00 p.m. EST on February 15, 2003. The increase of $0.08 per share annually, approximately 4.5%, will result in an annual dividend rate of $1.84 per share or $0.46 per share quarterly. Payment of future dividends is subject to approval and declaration by the Board. Fourth Quarter Highlights o Exelon Generation's nuclear fleet, excluding AmerGen, produced 29,727 GWhs for the fourth quarter of 2002, compared with 29,442 GWhs output for the fourth quarter of 2001. The fleet, including AmerGen, achieved a capacity factor of 94.2% for the fourth quarter of 2002, compared with 92.5% for the fourth quarter of 2001. Exelon Generation's nuclear group (Nuclear) completed three scheduled outages during the fourth quarter of 2002 compared with two scheduled outages in the fourth quarter of 2001. Exelon Nuclear achieved a 92.7% capacity factor for the full year 2002 compared with 94.4% for 2001. The lower capacity factor in 2002 was the result of more numerous refueling outages in 2002, reflecting eleven planned outages in 2002 compared with six in 2001. o The Cost Management Initiative (CMI) achieved $154 million of sustainable savings in the fourth quarter of 2002 relative to Exelon's original 2002 financial plan. For the full year 2002, the CMI achieved $340 million of sustainable savings relative to Exelon's original 2002 financial plan. Out of the total $340 million of CMI savings, $269 million represents cash savings with the balance of savings from non-cash items. o On November 1, Exelon Generation completed the purchase of Sithe New England Holdings (Sithe New England), a subsidiary of Sithe Energies, Inc. (Sithe), representing about 4,445 MWs of capacity. The purchase price consisted of a $534 million note to Sithe, $14 million of direct acquisition costs and the assumption of various Sithe guarantees related to an equity contribution agreement between Sithe New England and Sithe Boston Generation, a project subsidiary of Sithe New England. Sithe Boston Generation has a $1.25 billion credit facility to finance construction of the Mystic 8 and 9 generating units and the ForeRiver unit. The $1.0 billion outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2002, is reflected on Exelon's consolidated Balance Sheet. o On November 22, Exelon announced the renewal of its $1.5 billion credit facility. Exelon, along with ComEd, PECO and Exelon Generation, participates in the $1.5 billion unsecured 364-day revolving credit facility with a group of 16 banks. The credit facility includes a term-out option that allows any outstanding borrowings at the end of the revolving credit period to be repaid on November 21, 2004. This facility is used principally to support the commercial paper programs at the Exelon holding company level and at ComEd, PECO and Generation. 2
o On January 22, 2003, ComEd closed on the sale of $350 million of 3.70% first mortgage bonds, which are due on February 1, 2008, and $350 million of 5.875% first mortgage bonds, which are due on February 1, 2033. The net proceeds from the sale of the bonds, together with available cash balances, will be used to pay off matured or called debt with interest rates averaging about 6.5%. The 5-year bonds were priced at 68 basis points over the 5-year U.S. Treasury Note at the date of the pricing, while the 30-year bonds were priced at 90 basis points over the 30-year U.S. Treasury Note at the date of the pricing. These bond sales are part of an effort at Exelon Corporation to manage ComEd's balance sheet and lower its interest expense. BUSINESS UNIT RESULTS Exelon Corporation's consolidated net income for the fourth quarter of 2002 was $397 million compared with net income of $338 million in the fourth quarter of 2001. Exelon Energy Delivery consists of the retail electricity transmission and distribution operations of ComEd and PECO and the natural gas distribution business of PECO. Energy Delivery's net income in the fourth quarter of 2002 was $361 million compared with net income of $212 million in the fourth quarter of 2001. This increase was primarily due to increased sales to residential customers, including weather-related electric and gas sales, the cessation of goodwill amortization, lower depreciation rates at ComEd, and cost savings in 2002. Heating degree days for the fourth quarter of 2002 in the ComEd service territory were up 27% relative to the same period in 2001 and 3% above normal. In the PECO service territory, heating degree days were up 42% compared with 2001 and 3% below normal. Retail KWh deliveries rose 3% for ComEd, with a 14% increase in deliveries to the residential customer class reflecting more heating degree days and a strong housing market. PECO's retail KWh deliveries increased 11% overall, reflecting an increase in the number of customers selecting PECO as their energy service provider. Energy Delivery's fourth quarter 2002 revenues were $2,484 million, up 10% from $2,268 million in 2001. Energy Delivery's fourth quarter 2002 fuel and purchased power expense was $1,044 million, up 8% from $970 million in 2001. Additionally, Energy Delivery's results improved due to a decrease in operating and maintenance expense, the cessation of the amortization of goodwill and lower interest expense. The impact of the colder weather increased Energy Delivery's fourth quarter 2002 earnings per share (diluted) by approximately $0.05 relative to 2001, and $0.01 relative to the normal weather that was incorporated in our earnings guidance. Exelon Generation consists of Exelon's electric generation operations and power marketing and trading functions. Generation's fourth quarter 2002 net income of $73 million decreased from fourth quarter 2001 net income of $143 million due to higher average supply costs and higher operating and maintenance expenses, partially offset by a weather-related increase in energy sales volumes to affiliates and the market, and higher power prices. Generation's fourth quarter 2002 revenue of $1,626 million includes a net trading portfolio loss of $2 million compared with fourth quarter 2001 revenue of $1,423 million, which included a net trading portfolio gain of $8 million. Revenues, excluding the trading portfolio, increased 15% from the fourth quarter of 2001, reflecting higher energy sales volumes, higher power prices and the 2002 acquisitions of the New England plants and two Texas plants. Energy sales volume, exclusive of trading volumes, totaled 51,804 GWhs in the fourth quarter of 2002 compared with 47,294 GWhs in fourth quarter 2001. 3
The average realized price excluding trading activity in the fourth quarter of 2002 was $30.04 per MWh compared with $29.66 per MWh in 2001. Higher market prices in both MAIN and PJM, driven by higher market gas and oil prices and cold weather, were largely offset by our hedge position during the quarter. The same factors, cold weather and higher gas prices, also resulted in higher supply costs, including purchase power costs. As a result of these factors margins contracted and revenue net fuel decreased $48 million to $660 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 as compared with the fourth quarter of 2001. The fourth quarter 2002 revenue net fuel includes net mark-to-market losses of $4 million from non-trading activities. Operating and maintenance expenses increased $67 million reflecting the addition of the Texas and New England plants, increased nuclear outages and a lower 2002 insurance distribution from Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited, partially offset by savings generated by Exelon's CMI efforts. The $22 million increase in depreciation and amortization in the fourth quarter of 2002 as compared with the fourth quarter of 2001 is related to the acquired Texas and New England plants and other capital investments. Exelon Enterprises consists of Exelon's competitive retail energy sales, energy and infrastructure services, venture capital investments and related businesses. Enterprises reported a fourth quarter 2002 net loss of $4 million, an improvement of $18 million compared with the same period in 2001. The improvement in net income was the result of increased revenues and margins in infrastructure services, mark-to-market adjustments, Exelon's CMI savings and the cessation of goodwill amortization. The positive operating results were partially offset by various income tax related items. Conference call information: Exelon has scheduled a conference call for 11 AM ET (10 AM CT) on January 29.
