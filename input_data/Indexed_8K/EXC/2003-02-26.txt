ITEM: 
UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Washington, DC 20549 FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 February 26, 2003 (Date of earliest event reported)
Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure Investors Meeting On February 27-28, 2002, Bob Shapard, Executive VP and CFO, and Linda Byus, VP Investor Relations, met with investors and presented the information in Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2. PECO Energy Company Customer Choice. The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission's (PUC's) Final Electric Restructuring Order provided for the phase-in of customer choice of electric generation suppliers (EGS) and as of January 1, 2000, all customers were eligible for customer choice. The Final Restructuring Order also established market share thresholds (MST) to promote competition. The MST requirements provided that, if as of January 1, 2001 and January 1, 2003, respectively, less than 35% and 50% of residential and commercial customers were shopping, the number of customers sufficient to meet the MST shall be randomly selected and assigned to an EGS through a PUC-determined process. For residential and small commercial customers, the threshold measurement is by number of customers. For large commercial customers the measurement is by load. On January 1, 2001, the 35% MST threshold was met for all customer classes as a result of agreements assigning customers to New Power Company (New Power) and Green Mountain as providers of last resort default service. During 2002, PECO experienced an increase in the number of customers selecting or returning to PECO as their EGS and at December 31, 2002, approximately 21% of PECO's residential load, 10% of its small commercial and industrial load and 7% of its large commercial and industrial load were purchasing generation from an alternative generation supplier. Customers who purchase energy from an EGS continue to pay a delivery charge. In January 2003, PECO submitted to the PUC an MST plan to meet the 50% threshold requirement for its small and large commercial customer classes, which was approved on February 6, 2003. According to the approved plan, randomly assigned customers who participated will be switched to winning MST bidders as of their respective meter read dates. On February 21, 2003, Strategic Energy LLC filed an Application for Stay or Supersedeas with the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court. In that Application, Strategic Energy requested that the Court stay implementation on the MST auction pending Court review of whether the process used to develop the auction was appropriate. The Court scheduled oral argument on the Application for March 18, 2003. On February 24, 2003, the small and large commercial MST auction was completed. There were three winning bidders who were awarded a total of 64,172 small commercial customers, at a clearing price of 1.25% off PECO's tariffed rate GS. No bids were received for the small commercial renewable auction or the large commercial (GS6) non-interval metered load auction. Also in February 2003, PECO filed an MST plan for the residential customer classes which is pending PUC approval. In February 2002, New Power notified PECO of its intent to withdraw from providing Competitive Default Service (CDS) to approximately 180,000 residential customers. As a result of that withdrawal, those CDS customers were returned to PECO in the second quarter of 2002. Pursuant to a tariff filing approved by the PUC, PECO is serving those returned customers at the discount energy rates on generation provided for under the original New Power CDS Agreement for the remaining term of that contract. Subsequently, in the second quarter of 2002, New Power also advised PECO it planned to withdraw from serving all of its customers in Pennsylvania, including approximately 15,000 non-CDS PECO customers. These customers were returned to PECO during the third quarter of 2002.
