Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure Earlier today, Exelon filed a Current Report on Form 8-K regarding remarks made by Mr. Rowe at an investor conference. This amendment to the 8-K is being filed to clarify the disclosure of Mr. Rowe's remarks regarding British Energy and AmerGen. Mr. Rowe's reference to discussions with British Energy related to preliminary discussions held some time ago. There are no current discussions between British Energy and Exelon relating to a sale of their interest in AmerGen to Exelon. * * * * * On March 13, 2003, John W. Rowe, Chairman, President and CEO, met with investors at an investor conference and addressed their questions. Exelon has previously disclosed that the delay in the effective date of Apollo Energy, LLC's put right allows Exelon to explore a further restructuring of its investment in Sithe Energies, Inc. Exelon is continuing discussions with Apollo and Marubeni regarding restructuring alternatives that are designed in part to resolve Exelon's ownership limitations of Sithe's qualifying facilities. Exelon would hope to implement any additional restructuring of its Sithe investment in 2003. If Exelon is unsuccessful in restructuring the Sithe transaction, Exelon will proceed to implement measures to address the ownership of the qualified facilities as well as divest non-strategic assets, for which the financial outcome is uncertain. At the March 13 conference, Mr. Rowe provided the additional information that Exelon is actively trying to sell its investment in Sithe. He noted that in the event of a sale, Exelon would likely recognize a one-time loss, would likely receive several hundred million dollars in cash, and would avoid having to consolidate Sithe's financial results, including an incremental $1.3 billion in debt associated with Sithe. Mr. Rowe indicated that Exelon's earnings for the first quarter of 2003 would be higher than expected by analysts, but would remain within the range of 20%-25% of Exelon's annual earnings for 2003, and that Exelon is affirming its guidance of $4.80-$5.00 operating earnings per share for 2003, which assumes normal weather and does not include the effect of one-time items. With respect to Power Team's transactions during January and February 2003, Mr. Rowe commented that Power Team was fully sold forward in the PJM market, and that its actual demand exceeded its forecast demand. Accordingly, Power Team had to purchase power to make up a small weather-related shortfall. With respect to AmerGen, Mr. Rowe observed that British Energy and Exelon have discussed the possibility of a sale of British Energy's interest in AmerGen to Exelon, but that British Energy and Exelon have been unable to agree on a price. He said that British Energy had indicated interest in selling for a price in excess of $300 million, while Exelon had indicated interest in purchasing British Energy's interest for a price in the range of $200 million.
