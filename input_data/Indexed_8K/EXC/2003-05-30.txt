[EXELON LOGO] Exhibit 99 www.exeloncorp.com Exelon Corporation P.O. Box 805379 Chicago, IL 60680-5379 May 30, 2003 Note to Exelon's Financial Community: Exelon Issues Call Notice for 50.1% Share of Sithe Energies, Inc.; Continues to Pursue Sale of Sithe Investment On May 29, 2003, Exelon Fossil Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Exelon Generation, issued an irrevocable call notice for the 35.2% interest in Sithe Energies, Inc. (Sithe) owned by Apollo Energy, LLC and the 14.9% interest owned by subsidiaries of Marubeni Corporation. The total call price will be based on the terms of the existing Put and Call Agreement among the parties, which we estimate will be approximately $650 million. The transfer of ownership requires various regulatory approvals including FERC, the state regulatory commissions in New York and New Jersey, and expiration of the Hart Scott Rodino waiting period. Under the terms of the Put and Call Agreement, the call must be funded within six months of the call notice being issued. Additionally, because the Public Utilities Holding Company Act restricts Exelon's ownership of 50% or more of Qualifying Facilities (QFs), the QFs owned by Sithe must be sold or restructured before closing to preserve their QF status. Despite the issuance of the call notice, Exelon Generation will continue to pursue options to sell its investment in Sithe Energies in its entirety. The issuance of the Call Notice is not expected to have any impact on Exelon's ongoing operating earnings.

Byus, CFA VP of Investor Relations ================================================================================
