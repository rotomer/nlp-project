UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Washington, DC 20549 FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 June 2, 2003 (Date of earliest event reported)
Item 5. Other Events As previously disclosed, Exelon Boston Generating, LLC (EBG), an indirect subsidiary of Exelon Corporation (Exelon) and Exelon Generation Company, LLC (Generation), has $1.1 billion of debt outstanding under a $1.25 billion credit facility (EBG Facility). That facility was entered into primarily to finance the construction of the Mystic 8 and 9 and Fore River generating units. The EBG Facility requires that all of the projects achieve "Project Completion," as defined in the EBG Facility, by June 12, 2003, which date was not met. The EBG Facility is non-recourse to Exelon and Generation and an event of default under the EBG Facility does not constitute an event of default under any other debt instruments of Exelon or its subsidiaries. Mystic 8 and 9 are in commercial operation and Fore River is substantially complete, and the unit is currently undergoing testing. On June 2, 2003, EBG and the administrative agent for the EBG Facility submitted to the lenders under the EBG Facility for their approval an amendment to the EBG Facility, extending the date for "Project Completion" to July 11, 2003. The proposed amendment required approval from 100% of the nineteen lenders in order to be effective. The proposed amendment has been approved. EBG does not expect that all of the projects will achieve "Project Completion" by July 11, 2003. EBG cannot predict whether it will be able to negotiate a further amendment or a waiver of the EBG Facility with the lenders or what action the lenders may take as a result of the failure to achieve "Project Completion" by July 11, 2003. EBG is continuing to evaluate all of its options and will continue discussions with the lenders. EBG, however, recognizes its continuing obligation to operate the plants in a safe and reliable manner and commits to continuing to do so pursuant to any applicable requirements of the New England Independent System Operator.
