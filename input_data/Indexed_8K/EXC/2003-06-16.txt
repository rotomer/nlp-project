Item 5. Other Events As previously disclosed, between May 8 and June 14, 2002, several class action lawsuits were filed in the Federal District Court in Chicago asserting nearly identical securities law claims on behalf of purchasers of Exelon Corporation (Exelon) common stock between April 24, 2001 and September 27, 2001 (Class Period). The complaints alleged that Exelon and three of its officers violated Federal securities laws by issuing a series of materially false and misleading statements relating to its 2001 earnings expectations during the Class Period. The Court consolidated the pending cases into one lawsuit and appointed two lead plaintiffs as well as lead counsel. On October 1, 2002, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint, which Exelon moved to dismiss. In an order dated June 13, 2003, the Court dismissed the amended complaint with prejudice. The decision is subject to appeal.
