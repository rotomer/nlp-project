Exhibit 99 [Exelon Logo] - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Exelon Corporation www.exeloncorp.com P.O. Box 805379 Chicago, IL 60680-5379 June 18, 2003 Note to Exelon's Financial Community: Exelon Corporation Announces Agreement to Sell its Subsidiary, InfraSource, to GFI Energy Ventures LLC and Oaktree Capital Management LLC On June 18, Exelon Enterprises Company, LLC, parent company of InfraSource, Inc. announced that it has entered into an agreement to sell the electric construction and services, underground and telecom businesses of InfraSource to GFI Energy Ventures LLC and Oaktree Capital Management LLC. InfraSource (formerly Exelon Infrastructure Services) is an industry leader providing transmission and distribution infrastructure services to electric, gas, telecommunications and cable utilities, in addition to the industrial market. The InfraSource companies being divested are MJ Electric, InfraSource Underground Services, Electric Services, Inc., Dashiell and Dacon Corporation, Blair Park Services, Inc./Sunesys Inc. and RJE Telecom. The sale price is $250 million of cash and a $30 million subordinated note maturing with interest in 2011. The interest rate on the note is 8% annually if paid in cash and 10% if paid in kind. The book value of the assets being sold is about $280 million. After valuing the note, recognition of transaction costs and minority interest, Exelon will record an approximate $30 million, $0.10 per share, loss as a fair market value adjustment to "assets held for sale" in the second quarter. The transaction requires various regulatory approvals, including the regulatory commissions in Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, Virginia and Washington, DC and expiration of the Hart Scott Rodino waiting period, and is expected to close in about four months. At closing, Exelon will receive about $240 million of cash proceeds representing its 95% ownership. The remaining 5% is owned by a number of minority shareholders. If the sale closes by the end of the third quarter of 2003, operating earnings could be reduced by about $0.02 per share. Exelon's full year operating earnings are expected to fall within a range of $4.80 to $5.00 per share. The earnings guidance is based on the assumption of normal weather for the last three quarters of 2003 and excludes the first quarter $0.34 per share gain from the cumulative effect for the change in accounting principle (SFAS 143), the net $0.05 per share charge related to the March 3 ComEd settlement and the $0.40 per share charge for the impairment of our Sithe Energies
investment. Operating earnings guidance also excludes the anticipated $0.10 per share second quarter loss resulting from the fair market value adjustment related to the InfraSource sale.
