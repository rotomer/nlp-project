Exhibit 99 [EXELON LOGO] ________________________________________________________________________________ News Release From: Exelon Corporation FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Corporate Communications --------------------- P.O. Box 805379 July 29, 2003 Chicago, IL 60680-5379 Contact: Linda Marsicano, Media Relations 312.394.3099 Linda Byus, CFA, Investor Relations 312.394.7696 Exelon Announces Second Quarter Earnings; Common Dividend Increased by 8.7% Chicago (July 29, 2003) - Exelon Corporation (NYSE: EXC) today announced operating earnings for the second quarter of 2003 of $402 million, or $1.23 per share (diluted), compared with operating earnings of $369 million, or $1.14 per share (diluted), for the same period in 2002. The 8% improvement in year-over-year operating earnings was due primarily to increased market sales and favorable mark-to-market adjustments at Generation, lower interest expense, and lower depreciation and amortization expense, which more than offset weather-related decreases in retail kWh deliveries and lower energy margins at Energy Delivery. Reported second quarter 2003 consolidated earnings prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) were $372 million, or $1.14 per share (diluted). Reported results for the second quarter include a $30 million, or $0.09 per share, goodwill impairment charge (after taxes) related to the agreement to sell Exelon Enterprises' InfraSource business. Reported earnings in the second quarter of 2002 were $485 million, or $1.50 per share (diluted), which included a $116 million, or $0.36 per share, after-tax gain related to Exelon Enterprises' sale of its 49% interest in AT&T Wireless PCS of Philadelphia. Today, the Exelon Board of Directors approved Exelon Generation's orderly transition out of the ownership of Exelon Boston Generating (EBG). For a period of time, Exelon expects to continue to provide administrative and operational services to EBG in its operation of the projects. Exelon informed the lenders that it will not provide additional funding to the projects beyond its existing contractual obligations. "Today we announce three major events, two that are most pleasant and one that was not pleasant, but all three are part of our commitment to delivering value to our investors," said John W. Rowe, Exelon Chairman and CEO. "The enjoyable announcements are that we produced quarterly operating earnings of $1.23 per share and increased our dividend by
$0.16 per share annually. The unpleasant event is our decision to wind up our investment in Exelon Boston Generating. Our increased operating earnings reflect the strength of our core businesses and our constant efforts to improve these businesses. The dividend increase reflects both that underlying strength and the fact that recent changes in the federal income tax laws make dividends a more efficient way to distribute value to our shareholders. Our Exelon Boston Generating decision illustrates that when investments do not work out as planned, we will not make it worse by throwing good money after bad." Common Dividend Increase The Exelon Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.50 per share on Exelon's common stock, payable September 10, 2003, to shareholders of record at 5:00 p.m. EDT on August 15, 2003. The increase of $0.16 per share annually, approximately 8.7%, will result in an annual dividend rate of $2.00 per share or $0.50 per share quarterly. Payment of future dividends is subject to approval and declaration by the Board. 2003 Earnings Guidance Exelon's full year operating earnings are expected to be toward the top of a range of $4.80 to $5.00 per share. The earnings guidance is based on the assumption of normal weather for the second half of 2003 and excludes the first quarter $0.34 per share gain from the cumulative effect for the change in accounting principle (SFAS 143), the net $0.05 per share charge related to the March 3 ComEd settlement agreement and the $0.40 per share impairment of our Sithe Energies investment. Our operating earnings guidance also excludes the second quarter $0.09 per share loss related to the sale of our InfraSource business. Operating earnings guidance excludes any potential impairment related to Exelon Boston Generating. Third quarter operating earnings are expected to represent about 30% of full year operating earnings. SECOND QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS o Nuclear Operations Exelon Generation's nuclear fleet, excluding AmerGen, produced 29,619 GWhs for the second quarter of 2003, compared with 28,776 GWhs (reflects reallocation) output for the second quarter of 2002. The fleet, including AmerGen, achieved a capacity factor of 94.0% for the second quarter of 2003, compared with 92.1% for the second quarter of 2002. Exelon Generation's nuclear group completed one planned refueling outage during the second quarter of 2003 compared with two in the second quarter of 2002. Additionally, there was one refueling outage in 2002 at a co-owned plant not operated by Exelon. Operating expenses associated with the two fewer planned refueling outages were approximately $30 million lower in the second quarter of 2003 compared with the prior year. o InfraSource Sale On June 18, Exelon Enterprises, parent company of InfraSource, Inc., announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell the electric construction and services, underground and telecom businesses of InfraSource to GFI Energy Ventures LLC and Oaktree Capital Management LLC. The sale is anticipated to result in net cash proceeds of $211 million and a $30 million subordinated note maturing with interest in 2011. The net book value of the assets being sold approximated $280 million at the time of the agreement to sell. After valuing the note, recognition of transaction costs and minority interest, Exelon recorded a $30 2
million, or $0.09 per share, goodwill impairment charge (after taxes) in the second quarter related to the agreement to sell InfraSource. Closing of the transaction is subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions, including regulatory approvals from the state utility commissions in Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, Virginia and Washington, DC, and other conditions, the satisfaction of which cannot be assured. If all closing conditions are satisfied, the transaction is expected to close in the third or fourth quarter of 2003.o o Sithe Energies, Inc. Investment On May 29, 2003, Exelon Fossil Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Exelon Generation, issued an irrevocable call notice for the 35.2% interest in Sithe Energies, Inc. (Sithe) owned by Apollo Energy, LLC and the 14.9% interest owned by subsidiaries of Marubeni Corporation. The total call price will be based on the terms of the existing Put and Call Agreement among the parties, which we estimate will be approximately $650 million. The transfer of ownership requires various regulatory approvals, including FERC, the state regulatory commission in New Jersey, and expiration of the Hart Scott Rodino waiting period. o Exelon Boston Generating Exelon Boston Generating's Mystic 9 generating plant began commercial operation on June 10, 2003. Mystic 9 is an 807-MW gas-fired combined cycle plant with an estimated 7,000 [BTU/kWh] heat rate located in Everett, MA (greater Boston area). The Mystic 8 plant began commercial operation in April 2003. Construction of Fore River is substantially complete and the unit is currently undergoing testing. o Summer Readiness ComEd successfully completed its plans to improve the performance of the transmission and distribution system to meet the peak summertime demand. In 2003, ComEd has completed 278 projects to improve the electric system across its northern Illinois service territory. As a result of this and other ongoing initiatives, both ComEd and PECO have reached all-time high levels of customer satisfaction. o March 3 Settlement Agreement The Illinois Commerce Commission denied petitions for rehearing on the ComEd March 3 Agreement, allowing the agreement to become effective in May. Customers representing an additional 4,500 GWhs annually, or 8% of ComEd's commercial and industrial load, elected to obtain energy from alternate suppliers during the election period that ended July 14. About one-half of these customers had previously received service under ComEd's market-based purchased power option. o ComEd Refinancing On April 7, 2003, ComEd closed on the sale of $395 million of first mortgage bonds maturing in 2015 with a coupon of 4.70%. The purpose of the issue was to refund debt with an average interest rate of about 8.2%. On May 8, ComEd issued $40 million in tax-exempt, pollution control variable rate bonds maturing on May 15, 2017. The bonds replace securities that had a 5.875% rate. Year-to-date, ComEd has completed $1.3 billion of securities offerings as part of its ongoing refinancing program, which will reduce interest and dividend requirements by $35 million on an annualized basis. o PECO Energy Refinancing On April 28, 2003, PECO Energy closed on the sale of $450 million of first mortgage bonds. The securities carry a 3.5% coupon and will mature in 2008. Proceeds were used to fund maturing debt with an average interest 3
rate of about 6.5%. On June 24, 2003, PECO closed on the sale of $100 million of 30-year trust preferred securities. The securities carry a coupon of 5.75% and will mature in June 2033. The yield on the offering is 5.793%. The purpose of the issue was to refund existing PECO 8% trust preferred securities and $7.48 preferred stock. Year-to-date, PECO Energy has completed $550 million of securities offerings as part of its ongoing refinancing program, which will result in annualized savings of $15 million. BUSINESS UNIT RESULTS Exelon Corporation's consolidated net income for the second quarter of 2003 was $372 million compared with net income of $485 million in the second quarter of 2002. Operating earnings were $402 million in the second quarter of 2003 compared with operating earnings of $369 million in the second quarter of 2002. Exelon Energy Delivery consists of the retail electricity transmission and distribution operations of ComEd and PECO and the natural gas distribution business of PECO. Energy Delivery's net income in the second quarter of 2003 was $291 million compared with net income of $322 million in the second quarter of 2002. The decrease in net income was primarily due to decreased sales to residential and small commercial and industrial customers, including weather-related electric sales, higher average costs for purchased power and fuel, and the negative impacts of customer choice primarily in the ComEd service territory. Partially offsetting these items were lower interest costs, lower depreciation rates at ComEd and lower taxes other than income related to refunds and tax settlements at both PECO and ComEd. Cooling degree-days for the second quarter of 2003 in the ComEd service territory were down 63% relative to the same period in 2002 and 49% below normal. In the PECO service territory, cooling degree-days were down 40% compared with 2002 and 21% below normal. Retail GWh deliveries decreased 5.4% for ComEd, with an 11.9% decrease in deliveries to the residential customer class reflecting fewer cooling degree-days. PECO's retail GWh deliveries decreased 3.1% overall, including a 7.9% decrease in total deliveries to residential customers. Energy Delivery's second quarter 2003 revenues were $2,322 million, down 6% from $2,476 million in 2002. Energy Delivery's second quarter 2003 fuel and purchased power expense was $986 million, down 2% from $1,011 million in 2002. The impact of the cooler weather decreased Energy Delivery's second quarter 2003 earnings by approximately $0.12 per share relative to 2002 and $0.06 per share relative to the normal weather that was incorporated in our earnings guidance. Exelon Generation consists of Exelon's electric generation operations and power marketing and trading functions. Second quarter 2003 reported net income of $142 million exceeded 2002 net income of $84 million by $58 million. Net income for the latest quarter includes a $32 million (before tax) unrealized mark-to-market gain from non-trading activities driven by higher forward fuel prices relative to our position as compared with the end of the first quarter 2003. Generation's second quarter 2003 revenue was $1,886 million, compared with second quarter 2002 revenue of $1,559 million. The revenue increase reflects higher energy market sales volumes, higher power prices and the 2002 acquisitions of the New England plants and two Texas plants. Energy sales volumes, exclusive of trading volumes, totaled 54,318 GWhs in the second quarter of 2003 compared with 50,238 GWhs in second quarter 2002. 4
Operating and maintenance expenses were up for the quarter as $19 million of additional expenses resulting from the acquisitions of the New England and Texas plants, higher pension and postretirement benefit expense and the effects of certain new accounting treatments under FAS 143, were partially offset by lower expenses from fewer planned nuclear outages and lower bad debt and other operating expenses. The net impact of FAS 143 was neutral in the second quarter of 2003 versus a net expense impact in the second quarter 2002. Generation's revenue net fuel increased by $80 million in second quarter 2003 over second quarter 2002 excluding the mark-to-market impact in both years. The improvement includes $31 million of incremental margin contribution from the New England and Texas plants acquired during and after the second quarter of 2002. The increase was driven by higher wholesale power prices in all regions in which Power Team operates, a higher average power price to ComEd and higher nuclear generation, offset partially by higher supply costs, including fuel and purchased power. The average realized price excluding trading activity in the second quarter of 2003 was $33.83 per MWh compared with $31.50 per MWh in 2002. Higher market prices, driven by higher market gas and oil prices, were partially offset by our hedged position during the quarter. Higher gas prices resulted in higher supply costs, including purchased power and fuel costs. Trading margins were neutral for the quarter compared with a $16 million loss in the second quarter of 2002. Depreciation expense was $19 million lower in the second quarter 2003 versus 2002 due to the impact of FAS 143, partially offset by additional depreciation for the acquired New England and Texas plants and new capital additions. Exelon Enterprises consists of Exelon's competitive retail energy sales, energy and infrastructure services, venture capital investments and related businesses. Enterprises' second quarter 2003 net loss was $61 million, which includes the $30 million goodwill impairment (after taxes) related to the agreement to sell certain InfraSource business segments and $23 million loss (after taxes) related to the impairment of certain Enterprises' venture capital investments. Enterprises had second quarter 2002 net income of $83 million, which included the $116 million after-tax gain on the sale of the AT&T Wireless investment. Absent that gain, Enterprises $33 million loss included $22 million of investment impairments (after taxes) and $2 million of other net asset impairments (after taxes) in the second quarter of 2002.
