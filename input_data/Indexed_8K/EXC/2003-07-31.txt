ITEM: Regulation FD Disclosure
UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Washington, DC 20549 FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 July 30, 2003 (Date of earliest event reported)
Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure A. As previously announced, on July 30, 2003, Exelon Corporation (Exelon) conducted its Second Quarter 2003 Earnings Conference Call. The call was open to all on a listen-only basis and was audio web-cast. Telephone replays will be available through August 15, 2003. The U.S. call-in number for replays is 877/660-6853, and the international call-in number is 201/612-7415. The account number is 4094 and the conference call number is 70578. In addition, the call will be archived on Exelon's web site, www.exeloncorp.com; please select the Investor Relations page. During the call, management reviewed Exelon's financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2003, which were disclosed in the news release issued on July 29, 2003. Other matters that management discussed included: Forward-looking matters - ----------------------- Exelon's third quarter 2002 earnings of $1.70 per share included a positive impact of $0.16 per share related to better-than-normal weather conditions. Exelon has assumed normal weather for the balance of 2003, and so far in July, it has been cooler than normal. Also, due to the changes in the competitive transition charges (CTC)at Commonwealth Edison Company (ComEd) that were effective on June 1, 2003 and customer switching, Exelon expects about a $0.15 decrease in earnings at ComEd in the second half of 2003 relative to 2002. Exelon's full year earnings are impacted by increased pension and other post-retirement benefit costs from the prior year of about $125 million before income taxes, or about $0.24 per share. The exercise of Exelon's options under the Midwest Generation contract is expected to provide net savings on capacity charges of about $130 million before income taxes in 2003 compared with 2002. On an after-tax basis that is about $0.25 per share positive for the full year 2003. Both of these items will continue to impact earnings in the second half of 2003. Exelon's investment in Sithe Energies, Inc. and its Exelon New England operations will be modestly dilutive in 2003 compared to 2002. Dilution of about $0.20 per share related to the Exelon New England operations is included in Exelon's full year earnings guidance. Given the delay in the start-up of the new Exelon New England plants, the dilution may be lower than $0.20 per share, but it will be weighted to the second half of the year. It is anticipated that with the pending exit from its ownership of the assets of Exelon Boston Generating, that between $0.14 and $0.15 per share of dilution will be eliminated in 2004. Also, fewer nuclear plant refueling outages in 2003 provided savings of about $60 million pre-tax, or $0.11 per share during the first half of 2003. Exelon previously expected Exelon Enterprises Company, LLC (Enterprises) to be breakeven during 2003, a $0.16 improvement over 2002. In the first half of 2003, Enterprises reported a $79 million net loss, which includes a $30 million after-tax impairment charge associated with the anticipated sale of InfraSource, Inc. Exelon expects Enterprises to be about break even over the last six months of 2003. Lower interest expense will continue to have positive impact to Exelon over the last six months of 2003. Previously, Exelon had indicated that it would target its dividend payout to grow to 60% of regulated operating earnings. Exelon is now targeting to increase its dividend payout commensurate with total corporate earnings growth. Exelon management stated that there are various opportunities to utilize its cash aside from Exelon's continued plans of paying down debt balances. Three other possible cash uses include 1) increases in dividend payouts, 2) increases to the equity at ComEd and PECO Energy Company (PECO), and 3) Exelon share buybacks. The share buyback possibility is not considered a short-term opportunity, but rather, something that would be considered several years from now. B.
