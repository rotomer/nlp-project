Shareholders of record at the close of business on April 19, 2004 will be issued one additional share of Exelon common stock for each share owned as of that date. Exelon anticipates that the additional shares resulting from the split will be issued in book-entry form on or about May 5, 2004, the distribution date. Exelon's Board of Directors approved the stock split on January 27, 2004, subject to the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals and the filing of an amendment to Exelon's articles of incorporation. Exelon has received the required regulatory approvals and the Board of Directors has approved the filing of the amendment to the articles of incorporation on or before the record date. The amendment to the articles of incorporation increases the number of authorized shares from 600,000,000 to 1,200,000,000. The stock split, which will occur after Exelon's April 27, 2004 annual meeting, will have no effect on the number of shares voting at that meeting. Shareholders will vote their shares at the meeting on a pre-split basis. Exelon's next quarterly dividend, scheduled for payment on June 10, 2004, will be paid on a post-split basis. ### Exelon Corporation is one of the nation's largest electric utilities with approximately 5.1 million customers and more than $15 billion in annual revenues.
