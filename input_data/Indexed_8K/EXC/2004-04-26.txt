News Release
 Exelon Corporation's (Exelon) first quarter 2004 consolidated earnings prepared in accordance with GAAP were $406 million, or $1.22 per diluted share, compared with $361 million, or $1.11 per diluted share, in first quarter 2003.
Chicago (April 26, 2004)
Exelon's adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the first quarter of 2004 were $378 million, or $1.14 per diluted share, compared with $397 million, or $1.22 per diluted share, for the same period in 2003. The 7% earnings per share decline was primarily due to decreased competitive transition charge (CTC) revenue, as expected, at Commonwealth Edison (ComEd) and more planned nuclear refueling outages, partially offset by higher wholesale margins and lower interest expense. Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the quarter included a loss of $16 million after-tax, or $0.05 per share, at Exelon Enterprises Company, LLC (Enterprises) and an unrealized mark-to-market loss of $22 million after-tax, or $0.07 per share, from non-trading activities at Exelon Generation Company, LLC (Generation). The loss at Enterprises is expected to be offset by gains in the second and third quarters as we sell or discontinue these businesses. The mark-to-market loss at Generation will reverse in subsequent quarters, $0.05 per share before the end of the year. Excluding these two timing-related items, adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings would have been $1.26 per share.
Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the first quarter of 2004 do not include the following items that are included in reported GAAP earnings:
 
Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the first quarter of 2003 did not include the following items that were included in reported earnings:
"Our first quarter results are in line with our expectations and keep us on target to achieve our previously announced earnings guidance that is $5.55 to $5.85 per share under GAAP and operating earnings of $5.35 to $5.65 per share for the year," said John W. Rowe, Exelon Chairman and CEO. "Through our unyielding pursuit of top quartile performance across all of Exelon, we continue to drive growth in earnings and cash flow, creating value for our investors and adding flexibility to our balance sheet. This combined with our low-cost generation portfolio and our recent significant progress in getting ComEd into PJM positions us well to meet the challenges ahead."
Earnings guidance is based on the assumption of normal weather for the last three quarters of 2004. Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings guidance excludes earnings from investments in synthetic fuel producing facilities, the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 46-R and any profit or loss related to Boston Generating. Second quarter operating earnings are expected to be between $1.20 and $1.40 per share.
FIN 46-R
Exelon, through Generation, has a 50% interest in Sithe and had accounted for its investment as an equity investment prior to March 31, 2004. In accordance with FIN 46-R, Exelon consolidated Sithe within its financial statements as of March 31, 2004, resulting in an increase in both total assets and total liabilities of $1.3 billion and an after-tax cumulative effect gain of $32 million. The consolidation of Sithe did not have an impact on Exelon's income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles for the three months ended March 31, 2004, and Exelon does not anticipate the consolidation will have a significant impact on net income in future periods.
First Quarter Highlights
 
BUSINESS UNIT RESULTS
consists of the retail electricity transmission and distribution operations of ComEd and PECO and the natural gas distribution business of PECO. Energy Delivery's net income in the first quarter of 2004 was $312 million compared with net income of $330 million in the first quarter of 2003. First quarter 2003 net income included the net $17 million after-tax charge resulting from the March 3 ComEd Settlement Agreement and income of $5 million after-tax for the cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 143. Excluding the impact of the items listed above, Energy Delivery's net income was down $30 million compared to the same quarter last year primarily due to lower CTC collections at ComEd, milder winter weather in 2004 as compared to 2003 and increased depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by lower interest expense and lower taxes other than income

Heating degree-days for the first quarter of 2004 in the ComEd service territory were down 5% relative to the same period in 2003 and 2% below normal. In the PECO service territory, heating degree-days were down 3% compared with 2003 and 3% above normal. Retail kWh deliveries increased 1% for ComEd, with a 2% increase in deliveries to the residential customer class. PECO's retail kWh deliveries increased 1% overall, with residential deliveries down 2%. PECO's gas deliveries decreased 7% for the quarter; however, gas revenue increased $56 million, or 19%, to $344 million due to additional gas cost recoveries, which had no impact on margins. Energy Delivery's first quarter 2004 revenues were $2,575 million, down 3% from $2,642 million in 2003. Energy Delivery's first quarter 2004 fuel and purchased power expense was $1,179 million compared to $1,191 million in 2003, which included approximately $56 million of additional gas fuel costs, offsetting the gas revenue increase. The impact of milder winter weather decreased first quarter 2004 earnings per share by approximately $0.04 relative to 2003, and had no effect relative to the normal weather that was incorporated in our earnings guidance.
consists of Exelon's electric generation operations and power marketing and trading functions. First quarter 2004 reported net income was $99 million compared with net income of $56 million in the first quarter of 2003. First quarter 2004 net income included the positive cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $32 million and after-tax losses due to Boston Generating of $18 million. First quarter 2003 net income included the positive cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $108 million and a $130 million after-tax impairment of Generation's investment in Sithe. Excluding the impact of the items listed above, Generation's net income was up $7 million compared with the same quarter last year primarily due to higher wholesale margins and Exelon Way cost and productivity initiatives, partially offset by increased costs due to additional nuclear refueling outages.
Exelon Generation
Energy sales, exclusive of trading volumes, totaled 51,447 GWhs for the first quarter of 2004 compared with 54,409 GWhs in 2003 reflecting the adoption of a new accounting standard, which required certain energy transactions to be netted with revenues, and lower sales volumes to Energy Delivery due to unfavorable weather conditions and customer switching, partially offset by higher market sales and the acquisition of the remaining 50% of AmerGen. The new standard resulted in a reduction of 5,453 GWhs for the first quarter of 2004. Generation's first quarter 2004 revenue of $1,953 million and first quarter 2003 revenue of $1,879 million were relatively unaffected by trading activities. Revenues increased 4% from the first quarter of 2003, reflecting the acquisition of the remaining 50% of AmerGen, the transfer of Exelon Energy Company from Enterprises to Generation as of January 1, 2004, and the operations of Mystic 8 and 9 and Fore River (which began commercial operations in April, June and July 2003, respectively), partially offset by a decrease in deliveries to Energy Delivery and the adoption of a new accounting standard (EITF 03-11) that required certain energy transactions to be netted within revenues. This new standard resulted in reductions in revenues, purchased power expense and fuel expense of $213 million, $206 million and $7 million, respectively, but had no impact on net income. Earnings from prior periods were not affected.
Generation's revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense increased by $182 million in the first quarter of 2004 compared with the first quarter of 2003, excluding an unfavorable variance of $8 million related to mark-to-market activity. The improvement includes $120 million of incremental margin contribution from AmerGen. The remaining increase was driven by an increase in average realized wholesale prices and a decrease in capacity payments to Midwest Generation. The average realized price, excluding trading activity, in the first quarter of 2004 was $33.90 per MWh compared with $33.49 per MWh in 2003.
Operating and maintenance expenses were up for the quarter reflecting $105 million of incremental expenses for AmerGen (including a refueling outage), higher costs associated
 
with an additional non-AmerGen nuclear refueling outage and the commencement of commercial operations of Mystic Units 8 and 9 and Fore River after the first quarter of 2003.
Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates decreased $21 million in the first quarter of 2004 compared with first quarter 2003 primarily due to the acquisition of the remaining 50% of AmerGen.
consists of the energy services business of Exelon Services, the district cooling business of Exelon Thermal, the electrical contracting business of F&M Holdings, Inc., the communications joint venture of PECO TelCove, and other investments weighted towards the communications, energy services and retail services industries. Enterprises reported a first quarter 2004 net loss of $16 million compared with a first quarter 2003 net loss of $18 million. Enterprises reported significant decreases in revenues, purchased power and fuel expense and operating and maintenance expense mainly due to the sale of InfraSource, Inc. during the third quarter of 2003 and the transfer of its retail energy business, Exelon Energy Company, to Generation as of January 1, 2004. Enterprises had a decrease in operating losses of $7 million primarily reflecting a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense of $10 million due to the sale of the InfraSource assets during the third quarter of 2003 and the classification of certain assets of Exelon Services and Exelon Thermal as held for sale during the first quarter of 2004.
