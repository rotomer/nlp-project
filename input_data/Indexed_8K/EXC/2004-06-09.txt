Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
As previously disclosed, on May 25, 2004, Exelon Corporation (Exelon) and Exelon Generation Company, LLC (Generation) completed the sale, transfer and assignment of ownership of Boston Generating, LLC (BG) to a special purpose entity owned by the lenders under BG's $1.25 billion credit facility.
The transfer of ownership of BG was completed pursuant to a settlement agreement reached with BG's lenders on February 23, 2004. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved the sale of BG on May 10, 2004. Responsibility for plant operations and power marketing activities will be transferred to the lenders' special purpose entity at a later date. Certain aspects of the transfer of operations and marketing are also subject to approval of the FERC. The parties expect to file an application with the FERC within the next several weeks for an order authorizing the transfer of responsibility for plant operations and power marketing, and the parties expect to complete that transfer during the third quarter of 2004. Pending completion of the transfer of operation and marketing activities, Generation affiliates will continue to operate and market power from the plants on behalf of the owners.
Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits
     (b) Pro forma financial information
Pursuant to SEC regulations, unaudited pro forma combined financial statements for Exelon and Generation are included below, giving effect to the disposition of BG. The unaudited pro forma combined statements of income for the three months ended March 31, 2004 and for the year ended December 31, 2003 have been prepared as if the disposition had been completed on January 1, 2003. The unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet as of March 31, 2004 has been prepared as if the disposition had occurred as of that date.
The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements do not give effect to the cost, if any, for procurement of replacement power by Exelon and Generation if the companies had not purchased power from BG to supply Exelon and Generation's power sales contracts.
The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements do not reflect the effects of recording the fair value of the guarantee issued by Exelon New England, LLC, a subsidiary of Generation, for performance under long-term gas supply agreements with Distrigas of Massachusetts, LLC as the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 45, were not applicable for modifications of guarantees prior to February 1, 2003. In addition, the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements do not reflect operating fees, if any, which may be earned by Exelon and Generation in the transition period between the sale of BG and the ultimate transfer of the plant operations and power marketing activities to the lenders' special purpose entity.
Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness to Others
The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements are for illustrative purposes only. They are not necessarily indicative of the financial position or operating results that would have occurred had these transactions been completed on January 1, 2003 or March 31, 2004, as assumed above, nor is the information necessarily indicative of future financial position or operating results.
