Section 8 - Other Events Item 8.01 Other Events On November 25, 2003, Exelon Generation Company, LLC (Generation), Reservoir Capital Group (Reservoir) and Sithe Energies, Inc. (Sithe) completed a series of transactions resulting in Generation and Reservoir each indirectly owning a 50% interest in Sithe. Both Generation's and Reservoir's 50% interests in Sithe were subject to put and call options that could result in either party owning 100% of Sithe. On September 29, 2004, Generation exercised its call option to acquire Reservoir's 50% interest in Sithe for $97 million. The closing of the call is subject to state and Federal regulatory approvals. Generation's intent is to fully divest its interest in Sithe and it is actively pursuing opportunities to dispose of Sithe. Generation believes that exercising its call option will provide it with greater certainty of a timely exit from Sithe on favorable terms and conditions. ***** This combined Form 8-K is being furnished separately by Exelon Corporation (Exelon) and Generation (Registrants).
