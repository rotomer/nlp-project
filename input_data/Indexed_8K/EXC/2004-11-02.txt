Section 1 - Registrant's Business and Operations Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement On September 29, 2004, Exelon Corporation (Exelon) and Exelon Generation Company, LLC (Generation), announced that Generation had exercised its call option to acquire Reservoir Capital Group's (Reservoir) 50% interest in Sithe Energies, Inc. (Sithe) for $97 million. The announcement also stated that Generation's intent is to fully divest its interest in Sithe and that Generation is actively pursuing opportunities to dispose of Sithe. On November 1, 2004, Generation entered into an agreement to sell Sithe to Dynegy Inc. for $135 million in cash. Exelon expects that, prior to closing on the sale to Dynegy, it will receive from Sithe approximately $60 million in cash distributions. The sale will enable Exelon to deconsolidate from its balance sheet approximately $836 million of debt associated with the Independence plant. Exelon expects that the sale will not materially impact future earnings. Sithe's remaining operating assets total approximately 1,350 MWs, including 1,020 MWs in the Independence plant. The sale will not include Sithe International Inc. (Sithe International), which has been sold to a subsidiary of Generation. Sithe International is the entity that indirectly owns a 49.5% interest in the Mexican Business Trusts, which own the TEG projects consisting of two gas-fired plants in Mexico that commenced commercial operations in the second quarter of 2004. The sale of Sithe to Dynegy is subject to Federal and state regulatory approvals. The parties anticipate closing early in the first quarter 2005. ***** This combined Form 8-K is being filed separately by Exelon and Generation (Registrants).
