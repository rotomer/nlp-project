Aggregate net proceeds to Exelon from the issue and sale of the Senior Notes were $1,685,213,000 after underwriting discounts, but before expenses. The net proceeds were used to repay the approximately $1,500,000,000 in remaining principal and accrued and unpaid interest due on term loan borrowings made pursuant to the $2,000,000,000 Term Loan Agreement, dated as of March 7, 2005, among Exelon, Citicorp North America, Inc., as Administrative Agent, Citicorp Global Markets, Inc., as Lead Arranger and Sole Book Runner, and the lenders thereunder. The remainder of the net proceeds from the sale of the Senior Notes was applied to pay a portion of the $500,000,000 of outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest due on term loan borrowings made pursuant to the $500,00,000 Term Loan Agreement, dated as of April 1, 2005, among Exelon, Dresdner Bank AG, New York and Grand Cayman Branches, as Administrative Agent, and the lenders thereunder.
The Senior Notes were issued and sold in the following amounts and in the following three series and bear interest at the following interest rates, respectively:
$400,000,000 4.45% Senior Notes due 2010, $800,000,000 4.90% Senior Notes due 2015, and $500,000,000 5.625% Senior Notes due 2035.
Interest will accrue on the Senior Notes from June 9, 2005 or from the most recent interest payment date to which interest has been paid or provided for. Interest is payable twice a year to holders of record at the close of business on the June 1 or December 1 immediately preceding the interest payment date.
