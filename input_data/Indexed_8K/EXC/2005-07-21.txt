July 21, 2005

 
(July 21, 2005)  Exelon Corporation's (Exelon) second quarter 2005 consolidated earnings prepared in accordance with GAAP were $514 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, compared with $521 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2004.
Chicago
Exelon's adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the second quarter of 2005 were $506 million, or $0.75 per diluted share, compared with $467 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, for the same period in 2004. The 7 percent increase in adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings per share was primarily due to higher margins at Exelon Generation Company, LLC (Generation) and warmer June weather, partially offset by a reserve recorded for estimated potential asbestos-related claims and one additional planned nuclear refueling outage.
A non-GAAP financial measure, adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the second quarter of 2005 do not include the following items that are included in reported GAAP earnings (all after-tax):
Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the second quarter of 2004 did not include the following items that were included in reported GAAP earnings (all after-tax):

"Our continued strong results and year-over-year earnings growth are being driven primarily by higher margins in our Generation business. We continue to realize the benefits of owning a large fleet of well-run, low-cost nuclear plants in a market environment of high gas and oil prices, increasing environmental pressures on burning fossil fuels, especially coal, and the beginning of a downward trend in generation reserve margins," said John W. Rowe, Exelon's chairman, president and CEO. "With the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's recent approval of our proposed merger with PSEG, we are focused on securing the remaining regulatory approvals and accelerating our integration planning in anticipation of a first quarter or early second quarter 2006 close. As we prepare for the merger with PSEG, we continue to contain costs across all our businesses while maintaining safe and reliable operations."
2005 Earnings Outlook
Rowe added, "We are confirming our 2005 adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings guidance range of $2.90 to $3.10 per share, which reflects a strong first half and our confidence in continued earnings growth in the second half of the year."
Exelon's outlook for adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings excludes unrealized mark-to-market adjustments from non-trading activities, income resulting from investments in synthetic fuel-producing facilities, the financial impact of the company's investment in Sithe and certain severance costs. Giving consideration to these factors, Exelon estimates 2005 GAAP earnings will fall in the range of $2.95 to $3.15 per share. This estimate does not include any impact of future changes to GAAP. Third quarter adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings are expected to be between $0.85 and $1.00 per share. Earnings guidance is based on the assumption of normal weather.
Second Quarter Highlights

BUSINESS UNIT RESULTS
consists of the retail electricity transmission and distribution operations of ComEd and PECO Energy Company (PECO) and the natural gas distribution business of PECO. Energy Delivery's net income in the second quarter of 2005 was $218 million compared with net income of $303 million in the second quarter of 2004. Second quarter 2005 net income included after-tax costs of $4 million related to the proposed merger with PSEG and severance and severance-related credits of $2 million after-tax. Second quarter 2004 net income included severance and severance-related costs of $12 million after-tax. Excluding the impact of these items, Energy Delivery's net income decreased $95 million compared with the same quarter last year, primarily due to higher purchased power expense attributable to a contractual increase in prices associated with ComEd's power purchase agreement with Generation, partially offset by increased retail kWh deliveries at ComEd, due to warmer weather in June, and lower interest and pension costs.
Exelon Energy Delivery
Cooling degree-days for the second quarter of 2005 in the ComEd service territory were up 69 percent relative to the same period in 2004 and were 45 percent above normal. In the PECO service territory, cooling degree-days were down 21 percent compared with 2004 but were 3 percent above normal. Retail kWh deliveries increased 5 percent in 2005 as compared with 2004 for ComEd, with an 8 percent increase in deliveries to the residential customer class. PECO's retail kWh deliveries decreased 2 percent, with residential deliveries relatively unchanged. Energy Delivery's second quarter 2005 revenues were $2,532 million, up 4 percent from $2,435 million in 2004. Weather had a favorable impact of $0.04 on second quarter 2005 earnings per diluted share relative to 2004 and had a $0.02 favorable impact relative to the normal weather that was incorporated in earnings guidance.

consists of Exelon's electric generation operations, competitive retail sales and power marketing and trading functions. Second quarter 2005 net income was $296 million compared with $178 million in the second quarter of 2004. Second quarter 2005 net income included after-tax unrealized mark-to-market losses of $14 million from non-trading activities, an after-tax cost of $1 million related to the proposed merger with PSEG and severance and severance-related costs of $1 million after-tax. Second quarter 2004 net income included unrealized mark-to-market gains of $9 million from non-trading activities and earnings of $42 million from the transfer of ownership of Boston Generating to its lenders, net of losses on operations prior to the transfer. Excluding the impact of the items listed above, Generation's net income increased $185 million compared with the same quarter last year, primarily due to a contractual increase in prices associated with its power sales agreement with ComEd and higher margins on wholesale sales, partially offset by a reserve recorded for estimated potential future asbestos-related claims.
Exelon Generation
Energy sales, exclusive of trading volumes, totaled 46,992 GWhs for the second quarter of 2005 compared with 51,109 GWhs in 2004. The GWh variance was primarily due to the sale of Boston Generating in May 2004 and the expiration of the purchase power agreement with Midwest Generation at the end of 2004.
Generation's revenue, net of purchased power and fuel expense, increased by $300 million in the second quarter of 2005 compared with the second quarter of 2004 excluding the mark-to-market impact in both years and the impact of Boston Generating in the second quarter of 2004. The increase in revenue, net of purchased power and fuel expense quarter over quarter, was primarily due to the contractual increase in prices associated with Generation's power sales agreement with ComEd along with higher realized margins on wholesale sales. The increased margins on wholesale sales compared with last year were due to having previously re-priced forward hedges at higher market prices combined with higher off-peak spot market prices in the Midwest. Generation's average realized margin on all electric sales, including sales to affiliates and excluding trading activity, was $23.06 per MWh in the second quarter of 2005 compared with $15.63 per MWh in the second quarter of 2004.
Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings
Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings, which generally exclude significant one-time charges or credits that are not normally associated with ongoing operations and unrealized mark-to-market adjustments from non-trading activities, are provided as a supplement to results reported in accordance with GAAP. Management uses such adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings measures internally to evaluate the company's performance and manage its operations. Reconciliations of GAAP to adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for historical periods are attached. Additional earnings release attachments, which include these reconciliations on pages 7 and 8, are posted on Exelon's web site: and have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 8-K on July 21, 2005.
