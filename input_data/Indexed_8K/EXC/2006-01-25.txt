(Jan. 25, 2006)  Exelon Corporation's (Exelon) fourth quarter 2005 consolidated loss prepared in accordance with GAAP was $844 million, or $1.26 per share, compared with earnings of $363 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2004. Full year 2005 consolidated earnings prepared in accordance with GAAP were $916 million, or $1.35 per diluted share, compared with $1,864 million, or $2.78 per diluted share in 2004.
CHICAGO
The fourth quarter loss in reported earnings was driven by an impairment of the goodwill at Commonwealth Edison Company (ComEd), resulting in a non-cash charge of $1,207 million, or $1.81 per share. The current fair value of ComEd does not support the carrying value of its goodwill, in part, driven by the impending termination of a nine-year transition period to competition in Illinois and associated transition revenues at ComEd. This fourth quarter charge was greater than ComEd's net income for 2004 and 2005 combined, exclusive of the goodwill impairment. For full year 2005, ComEd reported a net loss of $685 million, compared with net income of $676 million in 2004, primarily reflecting the impairment charge.
Full Year Operating Results
Full year 2005 adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings were $3.09 per diluted share, up 11 percent over 2004 adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings of $2.78 per diluted share. The full year adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings improvement was due to higher margins at Exelon Generation Company, LLC (Generation) and increased retail kWh deliveries at ComEd and PECO Energy Company (PECO), mostly attributable to favorable weather conditions that accounted for an estimated positive $0.12 per share.
"Our strong operating results in 2005 reflect the ongoing benefits of owning a large fleet of well-run, low-cost, low-emissions nuclear plants in today's market environment," said John W. Rowe, Exelon's

chairman, president and CEO. "With $3.09 of operating earnings per share in 2005, Exelon has achieved nearly 10 percent average annual operating EPS growth since its formation in late 2000. Improving power market fundamentals, along with stable growth in our delivery businesses, will further drive earnings growth in 2006 and beyond."
Fourth Quarter Operating Results
Exelon's adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2005 were $488 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, compared with $416 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, for the same period in 2004. The 16 percent year-over-year increase in adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings per share was the result of higher margins on wholesale market sales at Generation and increased retail deliveries at ComEd and PECO.
A non-GAAP financial measure, adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2005 do not include the following items that are included in reported GAAP earnings (all after tax):
Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2004 did not include the following items that were included in reported GAAP earnings (all after tax):

Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) Approves Electricity Procurement Plan
The ICC yesterday approved ComEd's procurement case, authorizing ComEd to procure power after 2006 through a "reverse-auction" competitive bidding process and to recover the costs from retail customers with no markup. The auction will be administered by an independent auction manager, with oversight by the ICC staff. The first auction is scheduled to take place during the fall at which time ComEd's entire load will be up for bid. To mitigate the effects of changes in future prices, the load will be staggered in three-year contracts. To further mitigate the impact on its residential customers of transitioning to this process, ComEd has pledged to develop a "cap and deferral" proposal to keep residential rates at or below 1995 levels through the end of 2009. The company plans to work with interested stakeholders to ease the transition from frozen rates.
"Opposition to ComEd's procurement proposal had put a cloud of uncertainty over both ComEd's financial future and its ability to supply reliable electricity at a reasonable price to residents of northern Illinois," said Rowe. "Yesterday's decision by the Illinois Commerce Commission to approve that proposal is an important milestone for ComEd as it lifts much of the uncertainty about its financial future. Now ComEd can get on with managing the normal business risks that any electric utility faces. The ICC decision is also an important victory for Illinois consumers because the ICC recognizes that a competitive procurement process will help ensure the lowest available market prices for the energy ComEd delivers."
2006 Earnings Outlook
"We are reaffirming our 2006 guidance range of $3.00 to $3.30 per share," said Rowe, "which reflects our expectations for continued strength in our core businesses." Exelon's 2006 guidance is for adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings.
Exelon's outlook for 2006 adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings excludes unrealized mark-to-market adjustments from non-trading activities, income resulting from investments in synthetic fuel-producing facilities, significant impairments of intangible assets, certain severance costs, and costs associated with the proposed merger with PSEG. Giving consideration to these factors, Exelon estimates GAAP earnings will fall in the range of $3.05 to $3.35 per share in 2006. These estimates do not include any impact of future changes to GAAP. Earnings guidance is based on the assumption of normal weather.

BUSINESS UNIT RESULTS
consists of the retail and wholesale electricity transmission and distribution operations in northern Illinois. ComEd's net loss in the fourth quarter of 2005 was $1,088 million compared with net income of $164 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. The fourth quarter 2005 net loss included (all after tax) a non-cash charge of $1,207 million related to the impairment of ComEd's goodwill, losses of $9 million for the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47, expenses of $2 million related to certain integration costs associated with the proposed merger with PSEG and a reduction in severance and severance-related reserves of $1 million. Fourth quarter 2004 net income at ComEd included (all after tax) charges of $14 million related to costs associated with ComEd's debt retirements and severance and severance-related costs of $4 million. Excluding the impact of these items, ComEd's net income decreased $53 million compared with the same quarter last year, primarily due to higher purchased power expense attributable to a contractual increase in prices associated with ComEd's power purchase agreement with Generation, and higher operating and maintenance expenses, partially offset by increased retail kWh deliveries and lower interest expense.
ComEd
Heating degree-days for the fourth quarter of 2005 in the ComEd service territory were up 11 percent relative to the same period in 2004 and close to normal. Retail kWh deliveries increased 4 percent in 2005 as compared with 2004 for ComEd, with a 10 percent increase in deliveries to the residential customer class. ComEd's fourth quarter 2005 revenues were $1,442 million, up 7 percent from $1,344 million in 2004. For ComEd, weather had a favorable after-tax impact of $16 million on fourth quarter 2005 earnings relative to 2004 and had a favorable after-tax impact of $7 million relative to the normal weather that was incorporated in earnings guidance.
consists of the retail electricity transmission and distribution operations and the retail and wholesale natural gas distribution business in southeastern Pennsylvania. PECO's net income in the fourth quarter of 2005 was $101 million compared with net income of $84 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. Fourth quarter 2005 net income included (all after tax) costs of $4 million related to certain integration costs associated with the proposed merger with PSEG and losses of $3 million for the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47. Fourth quarter 2004 net income included after-tax severance and

severance-related costs of $3 million. Excluding the impact of these items, PECO's net income increased $21 million compared with the same quarter last year, primarily due to increased retail kWh deliveries and lower interest expense, partially offset by higher competitive transition cost (CTC) amortization.
In the PECO service territory, heating degree-days were up 3 percent compared with 2004 and were 2 percent below normal. PECO's retail kWh deliveries increased 3 percent, with residential deliveries up 10 percent. PECO's fourth quarter 2005 revenues were $1,249 million, up 14 percent from $1,092 million in 2004. For PECO, weather had a favorable after-tax impact of $5 million on fourth quarter 2005 earnings relative to 2004 and was neutral relative to the normal weather that was incorporated in earnings guidance.
consists of Exelon's electric generation operations, competitive retail sales and power marketing and trading functions. Fourth quarter 2005 net income was $151 million compared with $74 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. Fourth quarter 2005 net income included (all after tax) unrealized mark-to-market losses of $86 million from non-trading activities, losses of $30 million for the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47, expenses of $3 million related to certain integration costs associated with the proposed merger with PSEG and income of $2 million associated with its previous investment in Sithe. Fourth quarter 2004 net income included (all after tax) unrealized mark-to-market losses of $25 million from non-trading activities, expenses of $11 million associated with its previous investment in Sithe, severance-related costs of $9 million and expenses of $3 million associated with its previous investment in Boston Generating. Excluding the impact of these items, Generation's net income increased $146 million compared with the same quarter last year, primarily due to higher revenue, net of purchased power and fuel expense.
Exelon Generation
Generation's revenue, net of purchased power and fuel expense, increased by $213 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared with the fourth quarter of 2004 excluding the mark-to-market impact in both years. The quarter-over-quarter increase in revenue, net of purchased power and fuel expense, was driven by higher average margins on wholesale market sales due to having previously re-priced forward hedges at higher prices, combined with higher spot market prices, the contractual increase in prices associated with Generation's power sales agreement with ComEd and the impact of higher nuclear output.
Generation's average realized margin on all electric sales, including sales to affiliates and excluding trading activity, was $22.03 per MWh in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared with $17.91 per MWh in the fourth quarter of 2004.
Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings
Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings, which generally exclude significant one-time charges or credits that are not normally associated with ongoing operations and unrealized mark-to-market adjustments from non-trading activities, are provided as a supplement to results reported in accordance with GAAP.
