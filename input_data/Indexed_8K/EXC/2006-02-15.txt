Section 2  Financial Information
Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
Today, Exelon Corporation (Exelon) will file its 2005 Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and revise its previously reported earnings due to two events that occurred subsequent to its release of earnings on January 25, 2006 and before the filing of its Form 10-K. Previously reported full year 2005 consolidated earnings prepared in accordance with GAAP increased from $916 million, or $1.35 per diluted share, to $923 million, or $1.36 per diluted share. Previously reported full year 2005 adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings increased from $3.09 per diluted share, to $3.10 per diluted share. For a discussion of adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings and a reconciliation with GAAP earnings, please refer to Exelon's earnings release issued on January 25, 2006 or the Current Report on Form 8-K Exelon filed with the SEC that day.
Exelon's revised earnings were the result of two separate events that occurred at two of its subsidiaries, PECO Energy Company (PECO) and Exelon Generation Company, LLC (Generation). These two events provided new information not available at the time of Exelon's release of earnings on January 25, 2006. Accounting guidance requires the consideration of information and events occurring subsequent to the date of the financial statements (December 31, 2005) that impact the recognition of loss contingencies existing as of the date of the financial statements. As such, Exelon, PECO and Generation are required to reflect these subsequent events in their 2005 year-end results.
With respect to PECO, on February 1, 2006, the Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue approved a request for resettlement of certain tax matters. As a result, Exelon and PECO reduced previously recorded liabilities resulting in an $11 million (after tax) increase to previously reported 2005 net income.
With respect to Generation, on February 2, 2006, Generation submitted a report to the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency addressing a Violation Notice issued to Generation alleging that Generation had violated state groundwater standards due to the discharge of liquid tritium from a line at the Braidwood Nuclear Generating Station. Generations report was filed after performing an initial analysis of various remediation options. As a result, Exelon and Generation recorded a reserve for this matter, resulting in a $4 million (after tax) decrease to previously reported 2005 net income.
For more information regarding these matters, see Exelon's 2005 Form 10-K.
