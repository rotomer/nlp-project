Section 1  Registrant's Business and Operations
Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     On February 10, 2006, Exelon Generation Company, LLC (Generation) entered into separate unsecured one-year revolving bilateral credit facilities with each of Wachovia Bank, National Association, Citibank, N.A. and HSBC Bank USA, National Association, and, on February 13, 2006, Generation entered into separate unsecured one-year revolving bilateral credit facilities with each of The Royal Bank of Scotland plc, Barclays Bank PLC and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (Credit Facilities). The Credit Facilities provide for an aggregate commitment of $875 million, which may be drawn down in the form of loans and/or letters of credit. The Credit Facilities will be used principally to meet short-term financing needs at Generation and to issue letters of credit.
     Loans outstanding under the Credit Facilities will bear interest at a rate equal to (a) at any time a loan is a LIBOR Loan, the LIBO Rate for each applicable interest period plus a specific margin and (b) at any time a loan is a Base Rate Loan, the applicable lender's standard prime rate as in effect. In addition, Generation will pay a facility fee at a rate per annum equal to a specified facility fee rate on the individual commitment amount under each Credit Facility regardless of usage.
     The Credit Facilities incorporate by reference the covenants in Generation's existing syndicated credit facility dated as of July 16, 2004 among Generation, Exelon Corporation, Commonwealth Edison Company, PECO Energy Company and various financial institutions and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, as amended (Syndicated Credit Facility). These covenants include, among others: a limitation on liens; a limitation on mergers, consolidations and a disposition of assets; and maintenance of specified interest coverage ratios.
     The Credit Facilities also incorporate by reference the events of default in the Syndicated Credit Facility, which are standard events of default for agreements of this type. The nonpayment of any outstanding principal, interest, fees or amounts due under the Credit Facilities and the failure to perform or observe covenants, among other things, could result in an event of default.
     The description of the Credit Facilities set forth above is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Facilities, copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1 through 10.6 and are incorporated by reference herein.

To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person or entity that opens an account, including any deposit account, treasury management account, loan, other extension of credit, or other financial services product. What this means for the Borrower: When a borrower opens an account, if such borrower is an individual, the Bank will ask for such borrower's name, residential address, tax identification number, date of birth, and other information that will allow the Bank to identify such borrower; and, if such borrower is not an individual, the Bank will ask for such borrower's name, tax identification number, business address, and other information that will allow the Bank to identify such borrower. The Bank may also ask, if such borrower is an individual, to see such borrower's driver's license or other identifying documents; and, if such borrower is not an individual, to see such borrower's legal organizational documents or other identifying documents.

     For the purposes of the foregoing (but subject to the final paragraph of this Pricing Schedule):
     "Level I Status" exists at any date if, on such date, the Borrower's Moody's Rating is A2 or better or the Borrower's S&P Rating is A or better.
     "Level II Status" exists at any date if, on such date, (i) Level I Status does not exist and (ii) the Borrower's Moody's Rating is A3 or better or the Borrower's S&P Rating is A- or better.
     "Level III Status" exists at any date if, on such date, (i) neither Level I Status nor Level II Status exists and (ii) the Borrower's Moody's Rating is Baa1 or better or the Borrower's S&P Rating is BBB+ or better.

     "Status" means Level I Status, Level II Status, Level III Status, Level IV Status, Level V Status or Level VI Status.
     If the S&P Rating and the Moody's Rating for the Borrower create a split-rated situation and the ratings differential is one level, the higher rating will apply. If the differential is two levels or more, the intermediate rating at the midpoint will apply. If there is no midpoint, the higher of the two intermediate ratings will apply. If Borrower has no Moody's Rating or no S&P Rating, Level VI Status shall exist.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT. To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person or entity that opens an account, including any deposit account, treasury management account, loan, other extension of credit, or other financial services product. What this means for the Borrower: When a borrower opens an account, if such borrower is an individual, the Bank will ask for such borrower's name, residential address, tax identification number, date of birth, and other information that will allow the Bank to identify such borrower; and, if such borrower is not an individual, the Bank will ask for such borrower's name, tax identification number, business address, and other information that will allow the Bank to identify such borrower. The Bank may also ask, if such borrower is an individual, to see such borrower's driver's license or other identifying documents; and, if such borrower is not an individual, to see such borrower's legal organizational documents or other identifying documents.

     The Status in effect on any date is based on the Moody's Rating and S&P Rating in effect at the close of business on such date.
     For the purposes of the foregoing (but subject to the final paragraph of this Pricing Schedule):
     "Level I Status" exists at any date if, on such date, the Borrower's Moody's Rating is A2 or better or the Borrower's S&P Rating is A or better.
     "Level II Status" exists at any date if, on such date, (i) Level I Status does not exist and (ii) the Borrower's Moody's Rating is A3 or better or the Borrower's S&P Rating is A- or better.
     "Level III Status" exists at any date if, on such date, (i) neither Level I Status nor Level II Status exists and (ii) the Borrower's Moody's Rating is Baa1 or better or the Borrower's S&P Rating is BBB+ or better.
     "Level IV Status" exists at any date if, on such date, (i) none of Level I Status, Level II Status or Level III Status exists and (ii) the Borrower's Moody's Rating is Baa2 or better or the Borrower's S&P Rating is BBB or better.
     "Level V Status" exists at any date if, on such date, (i) none of Level I Status, Level II Status, Level III Status or Level IV status exists and (ii) the Borrower's Moody's Rating is Baa3 or better or the Borrower's S&P Rating is BBB- or better.
     "Level VI Status" exists at any date for Borrower if, on such date, none of Level I Status, Level II Status, Level III Status, Level IV Status or Level V Status exists.
 
     "Status" means Level I Status, Level II Status, Level III Status, Level IV Status, Level V Status or Level VI Status.
     If the S&P Rating and the Moody's Rating for the Borrower create a split-rated situation and the ratings differential is one level, the higher rating will apply. If the differential is two levels or more, the intermediate rating at the midpoint will apply. If there is no midpoint, the higher of the two intermediate ratings will apply. If Borrower has no Moody's Rating or no S&P Rating, Level VI Status shall exist.
