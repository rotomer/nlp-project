(April 26, 2006)  Exelon Corporation's (Exelon) first quarter 2006 consolidated earnings prepared in accordance with GAAP were $400 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, compared with earnings of $521 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2005.
CHICAGO
Exelon's adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the first quarter of 2006 were $420 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, compared with $452 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, for the same period in 2005. The decrease in adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings per share was primarily the result of unfavorable weather conditions in the Commonwealth Edison Company (ComEd) and PECO Energy Company (PECO) service territories; higher operating and maintenance expenses, including expenses related to stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No.123-R; and increased depreciation and amortization, including the higher competitive transition charge (CTC) amortization scheduled at PECO; partially offset by higher margins on wholesale market sales at Exelon Generation Company, LLC (Generation). Excluding the effects of unfavorable weather and timing-related items in the first quarter of 2006 and favorable one-time items in the first quarter of 2005, operating earnings increased in line with management expectations.
"While very mild weather and the timing of certain expense items put some pressure on first quarter results, Exelon's earnings engine remains healthy," said John W. Rowe, Exelon's chairman, president and CEO. "Operational performance was strong, as demonstrated by a higher nuclear capacity factor and improved availability of our fossil fleet. Generation margins increased, as expected, over the first quarter of last year, and we had solid core growth in our delivery service business." Rowe continued, "While our efforts to secure approval of our proposed merger with PSEG have progressed slowly, we believe we will be able to complete the merger and are committed to that end as long as the deal continues to make economic sense. Our most significant success in the first quarter came with the Illinois Commerce Commission's approval of the auction process for ComEd's power procurement beginning next year."
A non-GAAP financial measure, adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the first quarter of 2006 do not include the following items that are included in reported GAAP earnings (all after tax):

Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the first quarter of 2005 did not include the following items that were included in reported GAAP earnings (all after tax):
2006 Earnings Outlook
"We are reaffirming our 2006 operating earnings guidance range of $3.00 to $3.30 per share," said Rowe, "due to the ongoing strength of our core generation and delivery businesses. We remain comfortable with our original guidance range despite the challenge of mild weather and ongoing cost pressures across our businesses."
Exelon's outlook for 2006 adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings excludes mark-to-market adjustments from non-trading activities, income resulting from investments in synthetic fuel-producing facilities, significant impairments of intangible assets, certain severance costs, and certain costs associated with the proposed merger with PSEG. Giving consideration to these factors, Exelon estimates GAAP earnings in 2006 will also fall in the range of $3.00 to $3.30 per share, down from the previous estimate of $3.05 to $3.35 per share due to the expected partial phase-out of tax credits related to synthetic fuel-producing facilities. Continued high oil prices could result in a further reduction in GAAP earnings related to synthetic fuel-producing facilities due to an additional phase-out of tax credits and a potentially significant asset impairment related to the credits. These earnings estimates do not include any impact of future changes to GAAP. Earnings guidance is based on the assumption of normal weather.

BUSINESS UNIT RESULTS
consists of the retail and wholesale electricity transmission and distribution operations in northern Illinois. ComEd's net income in the first quarter of 2006 was $54 million compared with net income of $70 million in the first quarter of 2005. The first quarter 2006 net income included (all after tax) unrealized mark-to-market losses of $6 million from one wholesale contract at ComEd and expenses of $1 million related to certain integration costs associated with the proposed merger with PSEG. Excluding the impact of these items, ComEd's net income decreased $9 million compared with the same quarter last year, primarily due to the impact of unfavorable weather, an increase in a reserve for potential refunds related to transmission revenues, and higher expenses related to stock-based compensation, partially offset by lower purchased power expense attributable to a contractual decrease in prices associated with ComEd's power purchase agreement with Generation.
ComEd
In the ComEd service territory, heating degree-days were down 11 percent relative to the same period in 2005 and were 16 percent below normal. January weather was the warmest in more than 30 years. ComEd's total retail kWh deliveries decreased less than 1 percent in 2006 as compared with 2005, with a 4 percent decrease in deliveries to the residential customer class. ComEd's first quarter 2006 revenues were $1,426 million, up 3 percent from $1,386 million in 2005, primarily due to increased deliveries to commercial, industrial and Power Purchase Option (PPO) customers. For ComEd, weather had an unfavorable after-tax impact of $4 million on first quarter 2006 earnings relative to 2005 and had an unfavorable after-tax impact of $9 million relative to the normal weather that was incorporated in earnings guidance.
consists of the retail electricity transmission and distribution operations and the retail natural gas distribution business in southeastern Pennsylvania. PECO's net income in the first quarter of 2006 was $93 million compared with net income of $129 million in the first quarter of 2005. The first quarter 2006 net income included (all after tax) expenses of $4 million related to certain integration costs associated with the proposed merger with PSEG and severance charges of $1 million. First quarter 2005 net income included after-tax charges of $2 million related to certain integration costs associated with the proposed merger with PSEG. Excluding the impact of these items, PECO's net income decreased $33 million compared with the same quarter last year, primarily due to unfavorable weather conditions, higher CTC amortization and higher operating and maintenance expense, partially offset by increased electric revenues associated with certain authorized rate increases, including a scheduled CTC rate increase. The increases in CTC amortization expense and CTC rates are in accordance with PECO's 1998 restructuring settlement with the PAPUC.
PECO
In the PECO service territory, heating degree-days were down 17 percent compared with the same period in 2005 and were 15 percent below normal. PECO's total electric retail kWh deliveries decreased 2 percent, with residential deliveries down 5 percent. Retail gas sales were down 16 percent from the 2005 period. PECO's first quarter 2006 revenues were $1,407 million, up 9 percent from

$1,295 million in 2005, primarily due to the above-mentioned electric rate increases and a net increase in gas rates through PAPUC-approved changes to the purchased gas adjustment clause. For PECO, weather had an unfavorable after-tax impact of $19 million on first quarter 2006 earnings relative to 2005 and an unfavorable after-tax impact of $18 million relative to the normal weather that was incorporated in earnings guidance.
consists of Exelon's electric generation operations, competitive retail sales and power marketing and trading functions. First quarter 2006 net income was $268 million compared with $320 million in the first quarter of 2005. First quarter 2006 net income included (all after tax) mark-to-market losses of $13 million from non-trading activities, a charge of $4 million associated with the settlement of a tax matter related to its previous investment in Sithe and expenses of $4 million related to certain integration costs associated with the proposed merger with PSEG. First quarter 2005 net income included (all after tax) mark-to-market gains of $39 million from non-trading activities and earnings of $16 million associated with the sale of Generation's investment in Sithe. Excluding the impact of these items, Generation's net income increased $24 million compared with the same quarter last year, primarily due to higher revenue, net of purchased power and fuel expense, partially offset by higher operating and maintenance expenses and interest expense.
Exelon Generation
Generation's revenue, net of purchased power and fuel expense, increased by $119 million in the first quarter of 2006 compared with the first quarter of 2005 excluding the mark-to-market impact in both years. The quarter-over-quarter increase in revenue, net of purchased power and fuel expense, was driven by higher average margins on wholesale market sales due to having previously re-priced forward hedges at higher prices, combined with higher spot market prices and the impact of higher nuclear output, as well as the contractual increase in the prices associated with Generation's power sales agreement with PECO, partially offset by the contractual decrease in prices associated with Generation's power sales agreement with ComEd.
Generation's average realized margin on all electric sales, including sales to affiliates and excluding trading activity, was $27.42 per MWh in the first quarter of 2006 compared with $23.89 per MWh in the first quarter of 2005.
Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings
Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings, which generally exclude significant one-time charges or credits that are not normally associated with ongoing operations and mark-to-market adjustments from non-trading activities, are provided as a supplement to results reported in accordance with GAAP. Management uses such adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings measures internally to evaluate the company's performance and manage its operations. Reconciliations of GAAP to adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for historical periods are attached. Additional earnings release attachments, which include the reconciliations on page 6 are posted on Exelon's Web site: www.exeloncorp.com and have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 8-K on April 26, 2006.
Prior to the fourth quarter of 2005, Exelon operated in two business segments  Energy Delivery (ComEd and PECO) and Generation. As a result of the regulatory and organizational changes, ComEd and PECO are no longer reported as a combined Energy Delivery segment and are presented as separate segments.
