Item 8.01. Other Events
Exelon Corporation (Exelon), through three separate wholly owned subsidiaries, owns interests in two limited liability companies and one limited partnership that own synthetic fuel-producing facilities. These facilities chemically convert coal, including waste and marginal coal, into a synthetic fuel that is used at power plants. The Internal Revenue Code provides tax credits for the sale of synthetic fuel produced from coal.
The synthetic fuel-producing facilities in which Exelon has interests were recently idled. The decision to idle synthetic fuel production was primarily driven by the current level and volatility of oil prices. In addition, the proposed federal legislation that would have provided certainty that tax credits would exist for 2006 production was not included in the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005. Synthetic fuel production may resume in the future, but is dependent upon various factors including a reduction in oil prices or the enactment of future federal tax legislation. As previously disclosed in Exelon's 2005 Annual Report on Form 10-K and first quarter 2006 Form 10-Q, the suspension of production at the synthetic fuel-producing facilities could result in the impairment of the intangible assets associated with Exelon's investment in synthetic fuel-producing facilities, possibly in the second quarter of 2006.
Except for the historical information contained herein, certain of the matters discussed in this Report are forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that are subject to risks and uncertainties.

Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this Report. Exelon does not undertake any obligation to publicly release any revision to its forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Report.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
