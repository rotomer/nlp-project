PSEG
CHICAGO and NEWARK (June 19, 2006)  Exelon Corporation (NYSE: EXC) and Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (NYSE: PEG) announced today that they are continuing their efforts to obtain approval of their proposed merger before the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU).
Under the Exelon/PSEG Merger Agreement, either party has the option to terminate the transaction without penalty at any time after June 20, 2006. However, both companies will continue their efforts to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals. Neither Exelon nor PSEG has taken any action to terminate the Merger Agreement or extend the June 20, 2006 date in the Merger Agreement.
"We are moving ahead to get our last two remaining regulatory approvals," said John W. Rowe, chairman, president, and CEO of Exelon. "We continue to make progress in our discussions with the Department of Justice, and we are involved in ongoing settlement discussions in New Jersey. We are trying to successfully complete these discussions as soon as possible. It obviously has taken longer than expected to get through the regulatory approval process."
DOJ is reviewing issues related to competition. Rowe said, "We are working with DOJ to reach a settlement that addresses its concerns. We made an enhanced offer several weeks ago in New Jersey to demonstrate the significant benefits the merger will bring to the state. Although our settlement proposals make the economics of the transaction somewhat thinner, our board recently re-evaluated the transaction, and has agreed that we should proceed on the assumption that we can reach reasonable settlements at DOJ and in New Jersey. On that basis, we continue to believe that this merger will create substantial long-term value for our shareholders. Higher energy prices have raised the values of Exelon and PSEG about proportionately since the merger was announced in December 2004. And in our view, the strategic value of the merger remains compelling. Of course, our board will make an independent assessment and evaluation of the merger after the terms and conditions of all regulatory requirements are known."
"We at PSEG also continue to believe the merger makes economic and strategic sense," said Jim Ferland, chairman and CEO of PSEG. "Like Exelon, our board recently reviewed the transaction. In

addition to providing value to our shareholders through a larger, more diverse company, we believe the transaction offers substantial benefits to our customers. We believe it is important to try to gain a reasonable settlement with DOJ and a reasonable regulatory approval in New Jersey to achieve these benefits."
The final decision on whether to proceed with the merger will rest with the boards of both Exelon and PSEG after the terms and conditions of regulatory requirements are known. Closing is anticipated in the third quarter upon completion of all required regulatory actions.
Exelon and PSEG expect to hold a conference call for investors following the next major development in regulatory proceedings.
