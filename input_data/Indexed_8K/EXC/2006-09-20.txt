Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On September 19, 2006, Exelon Generation Company, LLC (Generation) entered into three separate 364-day revolving credit facilities (Credit Facilities) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Barclays Bank PLC, and Wachovia Bank, N.A.. These Credit Facilities will provide for an aggregate commitment of $1,000,000,000, which may be drawn down in the form of loans and/or letters of credit. The Credit Facilities will be used principally to meet short-term financing needs at Generation and requirements for letters of credit.
Loans outstanding under the new credit facilities will bear interest at a variable rate, determined at the borrower's election, equal to (a) at any time a loan is a Libor Loan, the LIBO Rate for each applicable interest period plus a specified margin and (b) at any time a loan is a Base Rate Loan, the applicable lender's standard prime rate as in effect. In addition, Generation will pay a facility fee, payable on the last day of each calendar quarter and on the date the commitments to lend under the credit facility are reduced to zero, at a rate per annum equal to a specified facility fee rate on the total amount of the Credit Facility regardless of usage.
Lending commitments under each Credit Facility will terminate 364 days after the effective date of the facility, or earlier upon the effective date of substitute credit facilities.
The Credit Facilities include covenants generally similar to covenants in existing bi-lateral bank credit facilities for Generation established in February 2006, including, among other covenants: limitations on liens; limitations on mergers, consolidations and dispositions of assets; and maintenance of a specified interest coverage ratio.
The Credit Facilities also include events of default generally similar to events of default in the existing bi-lateral bank credit facilities for Generation established in February 2006, including customary events of default for agreements of this type, such as: failure to pay outstanding principal, interest, fees or other amounts due under the credit facilities; cross default to other debt in excess of a specified amount; and the failure to observe or perform covenants.
The description of the Credit Facilities set forth above is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Facilities, copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibits 99.1 through 99.3 and are incorporated herein by reference.
