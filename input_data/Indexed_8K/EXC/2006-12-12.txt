(December 12, 2006)  At its annual investor conference held today, Exelon Corporation announced that the Board of Directors of Exelon had declared a regular first-quarter 2007 dividend of $0.44 per share on Exelon's common stock, a 10% increase over the dividend for the fourth quarter of 2006. The first-quarter dividend is payable on March 10, 2007, to Exelon shareholders of record at 5:00 p.m. New York Time on February 15, 2007. The first-quarter dividend action was taken by the Exelon Board of Directors in connection with the Board's approval of a "value return" policy that established a base dividend that Exelon expects will grow modestly over time. The value return policy contemplates the use of share repurchases from time to time, when authorized by the Board of Directors, to return cash or balance sheet capacity to Exelon shareholders after funding maintenance capital and other commitments and in the absence of higher value-added growth opportunities. Previously, Exelon had maintained a dividend payout policy of between 50-60% of ongoing operating earnings, and its dividend had not increased since 2004. Commonwealth Edison (ComEd) is not expected to make any dividend distributions to Exelon in 2007.
CHICAGO
Exelon also released its earnings outlook for 2007, with adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings guidance of $4.00 to $4.30 per share. Its guidance reflects the end of the transition period in Illinois and related power purchase agreements as well as the negative impact of ComEd's unfavorable ICC distribution rate case order in July, which is currently on rehearing. ComEd's contribution to Exelon's operating earnings per share is projected to be $0.10 to $0.20 in 2007, about 80% lower than its contribution of $0.75 to $0.80 per share in 2006.
Exelon's adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings guidance excludes unrealized mark-to-market adjustments from non-trading activities, income resulting from investments in synthetic fuel-producing facilities, certain costs associated with the terminated merger with PSEG, significant impairments of intangible assets including goodwill, significant changes in decommissioning obligation estimates, certain severance and severance-related charges, and losses on extinguishments of long-term debt to be recovered by ComEd as approved in the July 26, 2006, ICC rate order. Giving consideration to these factors, Exelon estimates 2007 GAAP earnings will fall in the range of $4.10 to $4.40 per share in 2007. These estimates do not include any impact of unusual items that the company is unable to forecast, including any future changes to GAAP. Earnings guidance is based on the assumption of normal weather.
