(January 24, 2007)  Exelon Corporation's (Exelon) fourth quarter 2006 consolidated earnings prepared in accordance with GAAP were $592 million, or $0.87 per diluted share, compared with a loss of $837 million, or $1.25 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2005. Full year 2006 consolidated earnings prepared in accordance with GAAP were $1,592 million, or $2.35 per diluted share, compared with $923 million, or $1.36 per diluted share in 2005. The fourth quarter 2005 loss in reported earnings was driven by an impairment of the goodwill at Commonwealth Edison Company (ComEd), resulting in a non-cash charge of $1,207 million, or $1.81 per share.

Full Year Operating Results
Full year 2006 adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings were $3.22 per diluted share, up 4% percent over 2005 adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings of $3.10 per diluted share. The full year adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings improvement was due to higher margins at Exelon Generation Company, LLC (Generation), which were partially offset by higher operating and maintenance expense and unfavorable weather conditions. Year over year, weather alone accounted for an estimated negative $0.18 per diluted share. On a weather-adjusted basis, full year 2006 adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings were up 10% over 2005.
"Our 2006 operating results reflected both improved generation margins and excellent operating performance, including record-setting nuclear output and summer capacity factor for our nuclear plants of 98.1%," said John W. Rowe, Exelon's chairman, president and CEO. "Improving power market fundamentals and the end of the transition period in Illinois will further drive earnings growth in 2007."
Fourth Quarter Operating Results
Exelon's adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2006 were $487 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, compared with $495 million, or $0.73 per diluted share, for the same period in 2005. Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings per share were down slightly as higher margins on wholesale market sales at Generation and higher electric revenues associated with certain authorized rate increases at PECO Energy Company (PECO) were offset by the effects of unfavorable weather

conditions as compared with last year in the ComEd and PECO service territories, higher operating and maintenance expense, and increased depreciation and amortization, including the scheduled higher competitive transition charge (CTC) amortization at PECO.
A non-GAAP financial measure, adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2006 do not include the following items that are included in reported GAAP earnings (all after tax):

OPERATING COMPANY RESULTS
consists of Exelon's electric generation operations, competitive retail sales and power marketing and trading functions.
Exelon Generation
Fourth quarter 2006 net income was $245 million compared with $147 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. Fourth quarter 2006 net income included (all after tax) mark-to-market losses of $17 million, severance and severance-related charges of $1 million and an impairment charge of $1 million related to its investments in Termoelctrica del Golfo (TEG) and Termoelctrica Peoles (TEP), the sale of which is expected to close in 2007. Fourth quarter 2005 net income included (all after tax) unrealized mark-to-market losses of $86 million from non-trading activities, a $30 million charge for the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47, expenses of $3 million related to certain integration costs associated with the now terminated merger with PSEG and income of $2 million associated with its previous investment in Sithe Energies, Inc. Excluding the impact of these items, Generation's net income in the fourth quarter of 2006 was unchanged compared with the same quarter last year. Higher revenue, net of purchased power and fuel expense, was largely offset by increased operating and maintenance expense, which was driven primarily by inflationary cost pressures and favorable fourth quarter 2005 non-recurring items related to decommissioning and a settlement regarding postretirement benefits with PSEG related to our co-owner relationship.
Generation's revenue, net of purchased power and fuel expense, increased by $103 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 compared with the fourth quarter of 2005 excluding the mark-to-market impact in both years. The quarter-over-quarter increase in revenue, net of purchased power and fuel expense, was driven by higher average margins due to lower purchased power costs and the contractual increase in the prices associated with Generation's power sales agreement with PECO, partially offset by the contractual decrease in prices associated with Generation's power sales agreement with ComEd. Generation's average realized margin on all electric sales, including sales to affiliates and excluding trading activity, was $24.81 per MWh in the fourth quarter of 2006 compared with $22.03 per MWh in the fourth quarter of 2005.
consists of the retail and wholesale electricity transmission and distribution operations in northern Illinois.
ComEd
ComEd recorded net income in the fourth quarter of 2006 of $213 million compared with a net loss of $1,088 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. Fourth quarter 2006 net income included a one-time after-tax benefit of $95 million attributable to the ICC's December 20, 2006 amended order to recover previously incurred severance costs. The fourth quarter 2005 net loss included (all after tax) a non-cash charge of $1,207 million related to the impairment of ComEd's goodwill, a $9 million charge for the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47, expenses of $2 million related to certain integration costs associated with the now terminated merger with PSEG and a reduction in severance and severance-related reserves of $1 million. Excluding the impact of these items, ComEd's net income in the fourth quarter of 2006 decreased $11 million compared with the same quarter last year, primarily due to unfavorable weather and increased customer switching, partially offset by lower purchased power expense attributable to a contractual decrease in prices associated with ComEd's power purchase agreement with Generation. That power purchase agreement ended at year-end 2006.
In the ComEd service territory in the fourth quarter of 2006, heating degree-days were down 8 percent relative to the same period in 2005, and were 8 percent below normal. ComEd's total retail kWh
5
 
deliveries decreased 1 percent in 2006 as compared with 2005, with a 1 percent decrease in deliveries to the residential customer class, largely due to less favorable weather. ComEd's fourth quarter 2006 revenues were $1,381 million, down 4 percent from $1,442 million in 2005, primarily due to decreased deliveries to residential and an increase in customer switching reducing the amount of revenue for supplying energy to end use customers. For ComEd, weather had an unfavorable after-tax impact of $13 million on fourth quarter 2006 earnings relative to 2005 and had an unfavorable after-tax impact of $5 million relative to the normal weather, which was incorporated in earnings guidance.
The number of customers being served in the ComEd region has increased 1.5 percent since the fourth quarter of 2005, and weather-normalized kWh deliveries increased 1.3 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2005, according to our models.
consists of the retail electricity transmission and distribution operations and the retail natural gas distribution business in southeastern Pennsylvania.
PECO
PECO's net income in the fourth quarter of 2006 was $121 million, an increase from net income of $112 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. Fourth quarter 2006 net income included after-tax severance and severance-related charges of $1 million. Fourth quarter 2005 net income included (all after tax) costs of $4 million related to certain integration costs associated with the now terminated merger with PSEG and a $3 million charge for the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47. Excluding the impact of these items, PECO's net income in the fourth quarter of 2006 increased $3 million compared with the same quarter last year primarily due to higher revenues, net of purchased power and fuel expense, and the settlement of a research and development tax credit claim, partially offset by higher CTC amortization and the reversal of certain tax reserves in 2005. The increases in CTC amortization expense and CTC rates are in accordance with PECO's 1998 restructuring settlement with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PAPUC). As expected, the increase in CTC amortization expense exceeded the increase in CTC revenues.
In the PECO service territory in the fourth quarter of 2006, heating degree-days were down 17 percent from 2005, and were 18 percent below normal. PECO's total electric retail kWh deliveries decreased 2 percent, with residential deliveries down 7 percent. Total gas retail deliveries were down 16 percent from the 2005 period. PECO's fourth quarter 2006 revenues were $1,235 million, down slightly from $1,249 million in 2005, primarily due to the above-mentioned unfavorable weather and by decreases in gas rates effective September 1 and December 1 through PAPUC-approved changes to the purchased gas adjustment clause, partially offset by electric rate increases and a change in the estimate for electric unbilled revenues. For PECO, weather had an unfavorable after-tax impact of $18 million on fourth quarter 2006 earnings relative to 2005 and an unfavorable after-tax impact of $16 million relative to the normal weather, which was incorporated in earnings guidance.
The number of electric customers being served in the PECO region has increased 0.6 percent since the fourth quarter of 2005, with weather-normalized kWh growth of 1.3 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2005, according to our models.
