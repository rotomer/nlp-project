Exhibit 99.1
(April 25, 2007)  Exelon Corporation's (Exelon) first quarter 2007 consolidated earnings prepared in accordance with GAAP were $691 million, or $1.02 per diluted share, compared with earnings of $400 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2006.
CHICAGO
Exelon's adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the first quarter of 2007 were $722 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, compared with $420 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, for the same period in 2006. The increase in adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings per share was primarily due to higher margins on energy sales at Exelon Generation Company, LLC (Generation), higher nuclear output reflecting fewer outage days, the effects of favorable weather conditions as compared with last year in the Commonwealth Edison Company (ComEd) and PECO Energy Company (PECO) service territories, and a PJM billing settlement with PPL Electric (PPL). These positive factors were partially offset by significantly lower net income at ComEd primarily due to the end of its nine-year regulatory transition period, and higher operating and maintenance expense and increased depreciation and amortization across Exelon's operating companies, including the scheduled higher competitive transition charge (CTC) amortization at PECO.
A non-GAAP financial measure, adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the first quarter of 2007 do not include the following items that are included in reported GAAP earnings (all after tax):

Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the first quarter of 2006 do not include the following items that are included in reported GAAP earnings (all after tax):
2007 Earnings Outlook
Exelon affirmed its adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings guidance range for 2007 of $4.00 to $4.30 per share. The following table indicates guidance ranges by operating company contribution to 2007 adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings per Exelon share, excluding Exelon holding company.
The outlook for 2007 adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for Exelon and its subsidiaries excludes the following items:
2
 
Giving consideration to these factors, Exelon estimates GAAP earnings in 2007 will fall in the range of $4.10 to $4.40 per share. Both Exelon's operating earnings and GAAP earnings guidance are based on the assumption of normal weather and exclude any impact of the possible outcome of legislation and settlement discussions in Illinois, beyond the $44 million that ComEd has recently proposed in rate relief programs for its customers in 2007.
Beginning in 2007, earnings per share reflect a change in Exelon's quarterly earnings profile, which will result in a slightly different distribution than in prior years. Earnings will be more equally distributed quarter to quarter due to several factors, including the end of ComEd's power purchase agreement (PPA) with Generation and the timing and increased volume of energy sales into the wholesale market. As previously disclosed, Exelon expects the quarterly operating earnings per share distribution ranges of total earnings for the balance of 2007 to be as follows:

First quarter 2007 net income was $560 million compared with $268 million in the first quarter of 2006. First quarter 2007 net income included (all after tax) mark-to-market losses of $69 million, a gain of $9 million related to the sale of its investments in TEG and TEP and earnings of $5 million associated with the settlement of a tax matter related to its previous investment in Sithe. First quarter 2006 net income included (all after tax) mark-to-market losses of $13 million, a charge of $4 million associated with the settlement of a tax matter related to its previous investment in Sithe and expenses of $4 million related to certain integration costs associated with the now terminated merger with PSEG. Excluding the impact of these items, Generation's net income of $615 million in the first quarter of 2007 increased $326 million compared with the same quarter last year, primarily due to higher revenue, net of purchased power and fuel expense, and decreased operating and maintenance expense as lower nuclear refueling outage expense more than offset inflationary cost pressures.
Generation's revenue, net of purchased power and fuel expense, increased by $485 million in the first quarter of 2007 compared with the first quarter of 2006 excluding the mark-to-market impact in both years. The increase in revenue, net of purchased power and fuel expense, was driven by higher average margins primarily due to the end of the below-market price PPA with ComEd at year-end 2006, higher nuclear output reflecting fewer outage days, the contractual increase in the prices associated with Generation's PPA with PECO and a PJM billing settlement with PPL. Generation's average realized margin on all electric sales, including sales to affiliates and excluding trading activity, was $36.61 per MWh in the first quarter of 2007 compared with $27.42 per MWh in the first quarter of 2006.

ComEd
ComEd recorded net income in the first quarter of 2007 of $5 million, a substantial reduction from net income of $54 million in the first quarter of 2006. First quarter 2006 net income included (all after tax) unrealized mark-to-market losses of $6 million from economic hedging activities at ComEd and expenses of $1 million related to certain integration costs associated with the now terminated merger with PSEG. Excluding the impact of these items, ComEd's net income in the first quarter of 2007 decreased $56 million compared with the same quarter last year, primarily due to the end of its regulatory transition period and associated transition revenues, the end of its below-market price PPA with Generation in 2006, and higher operating and maintenance expense primarily due to wages and benefits, partially offset by the effects of favorable weather and an ICC-authorized increase in delivery service rates.
In the ComEd service territory in the first quarter of 2007, heating degree-days were up 15 percent relative to the same period in 2006, but were 4 percent below normal. ComEd's total retail kWh deliveries increased 4 percent in 2007 as compared with 2006, with a 4 percent increase in deliveries to the residential customer class, largely due to favorable weather. ComEd's first quarter 2007 revenues were $1,490 million, up 4 percent from $1,426 million in 2006 primarily due to higher prices, particularly for electricity. For ComEd, weather had a favorable after-tax impact of $8 million on first quarter 2007 earnings relative to 2006 and had an unfavorable after-tax impact of $1 million relative to normal weather, which was incorporated in earnings guidance.
The number of customers being served in the ComEd region has increased 1.1 percent since the first quarter of 2006, and weather-normalized kWh retail deliveries increased 1.5 percent compared with the first quarter of 2006.

PECO
PECO's net income in the first quarter of 2007 was $128 million, an increase from net income of $93 million in the first quarter of 2006. First quarter 2006 net income included (all after-tax) expenses of $4 million related to certain integration costs associated with the now terminated merger with PSEG and severance charges of $1 million. Excluding the impact of these items, PECO's net income in the first quarter of 2007 increased $30 million compared with the same quarter last year primarily due to higher revenues, net of purchased power and fuel expense, partially offset by higher CTC amortization. The increase in CTC amortization expense is in accordance with PECO's 1998 restructuring settlement with the PAPUC.
In the PECO service territory in the first quarter of 2007, heating degree-days were up 15 percent from 2006, but were 2 percent below normal. PECO's total electric retail kWh deliveries increased 6 percent, with residential deliveries up 7 percent. Total gas retail deliveries were up 16 percent from the 2006 period. PECO's first quarter 2007 revenues were $1,500 million, up from $1,407 million in 2006, primarily due to the effects of favorable weather and an authorized electric generation rate increase under the 1998 restructuring settlement, partially offset by a decrease in average gas rates effective through PAPUC-approved changes to the purchased gas adjustment clause. For PECO, weather had a favorable after-tax impact of $17 million on first quarter 2007 earnings relative to 2006 and an unfavorable after-tax impact of $1 million relative to normal weather, which was incorporated in earnings guidance.
The number of electric customers being served in the PECO region has increased 0.1 percent since the first quarter of 2006, with weather-normalized kWh growth of 2.7 percent compared with the first quarter of 2006.
Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings
