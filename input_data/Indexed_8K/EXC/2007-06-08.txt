Item 8.01  Other Events.
As previously disclosed, on March 1, 2007, Exelon Corporation (Exelon) subsidiary Commonwealth Edison Company (ComEd) filed a request with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) seeking approval to increase the rate it receives for transmission services.  The proposed rate increase would have increased an average residential customer bill about 1.5%. On June 5, 2007 the FERC issued an order that conditionally approves ComEd's proposal to implement a formula based transmission rate, effective as of May 1, 2007, but subject to refund.  The FERC order provides that further hearing and settlement procedures be conducted to determine the reasonableness of certain elements of ComEd's formula rate. The issues set for hearing include the 11.70% base return on equity proposed by ComEd and various elements of rate base.  The order denied both ComEd's request for incentive rate treatment on investment in two new transmission projects and the inclusion of Construction Work in Progress in rate base. The order directs ComEd to file a revised formula reflecting these findings within 30 days.  The new rate will increase an average residential customer bill by about 1%, depending on the outcome of the settlement and hearing procedures.  ComEd's transmission rate was last updated in 2003.  Between 2003 and the end of 2007, ComEd will have invested over $800 million in transmission-related plant to meet increasing demand and improve reliability.  ComEd cannot predict how much of a transmission rate increase the FERC may ultimately approve following the settlement and hearing procedures or when these proceedings will be completed.  A copy of the FERC order is available at the following website: http://ferc.gov/EventCalendar/Files/20070605183328-EL07-41-000.pdf
