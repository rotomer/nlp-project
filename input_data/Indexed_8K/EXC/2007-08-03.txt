Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.
 
As previously disclosed on July 24 and 25, 2007, Exelon Generation Company, LLC (Generation) and Commonwealth Edison Company (ComEd) have entered into a financial swap contract (the Contract) to promote price stability for residential and small business customers as part of a settlement agreement to address concerns about higher electric bills in Illinois without a rate freeze, generation tax or other legislation that would be harmful to consumers of electricity, electric utilities, generators of electricity and the State of Illinois. The Contract is fully executed but is not effective until Senate Bill 1592 (the Legislation) is enacted into law. Pricing will remain confidential until the Legislation is enacted into law. On July 26, 2007, the Legislation was passed by both the Illinois House of Representatives and the Illinois Senate. To be enacted into law, the Legislation must be signed by the Governor of Illinois (the Governor). On the afternoon of August 2, 2007, the Governor's staff indicated the Governorintends to conduct a thorough review of the Legislation. Under the Illinois constitution, the Governor has 60 days from the receipt of the Legislation to act; that 60-day period will expire near the end of September 2007. If the Legislation is not enacted into law by September 5, 2007, neither Generation nor ComEd would have any further liability or obligation to the other under the Contract. However, Generation and ComEd would consider alternatives including amending the Contract to extend the September 5, 2007 deadline and possibly adjusting the pricing or entering into a new financial swap contract.
