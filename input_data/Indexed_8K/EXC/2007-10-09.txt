Item 8.01  Other Events.
 
As previously disclosed, on March 1, 2007, Exelon Corporation's (Exelon) subsidiary Commonwealth Edison Company (ComEd) filed a request with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) seeking approval to increase the rate it receives for transmission services.  On June 5, 2007, the FERC issued an order that conditionally approved ComEd's proposal to implement a formula based transmission rate, effective as of May 1, 2007, but subject to refund.  The FERC order provided that further hearing and settlement procedures be conducted to determine the reasonableness of certain elements of ComEd's formula rate. The issues set for hearing included the 11.70% base return on equity proposed by ComEd and various elements of rate base.  On October 5, 2007, ComEd made a filing with the FERC seeking approval of a settlement agreement reached among ComEd, the FERC Trial Staff and the active interveners in the proceeding.  The settlement agreement is a comprehensive resolution of all issues in the proceeding, other than ComEd's pending request for rehearing on incentive returns on new investment.  The agreement establishes the treatment of costs and revenues in the determination of network service transmission rates and the process for updating the formula rate calculation on an annual basis.  The agreement provides for a base return on equity on transmission rate base of 11.0% plus an adder of 0.50% in recognition of ComEds participation in a Regional Transmission Organization, a cap of 58% on the equity component of ComEd's capital structure (declining to 55% by 2011), and a debt-only return of 6.61% on ComEd's pension asset.   The agreement results in a first year transmission network service revenue requirement of $363.4 million, or a  $23.7 million reduction from the $387.1 million revenue requirement conditionally approved by the FERC in its June 5, 2007 order.  The reduction in the revenue requirement will be implemented upon receipt of the FERC approval of the settlement agreement.  ComEd cannot predict whether the FERC will ultimately approve the settlement or when these proceedings will be completed.  A copy of the filing is available at the following website:  .
