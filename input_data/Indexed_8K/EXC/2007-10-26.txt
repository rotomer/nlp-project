Exhibit 99.1
 
(October 26, 2007)  Exelon Corporation's (Exelon) third quarter 2007 consolidated earnings prepared in accordance with GAAP were $780 million, or $1.15 per diluted share, compared with a loss of $44 million, or $0.07 per share, in the third quarter of 2006.
CHICAGO
Exelon's adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the third quarter of 2007 were $823 million, or $1.21 per diluted share, compared with $690 million, or $1.02 per diluted share, for the same period in 2006. The increase in adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings per share was primarily due to higher margins on energy sales at Exelon Generation Company, LLC (Generation), previously authorized transmission and delivery service revenue increases for Commonwealth Edison Company (ComEd), higher nuclear output reflecting fewer refueling outage days, and the effects of warmer weather conditions as compared with last year in the ComEd service territory. These positive factors were partially offset by significantly lower net income at ComEd primarily due to the end of its nearly ten-year regulatory transition period and associated transition revenues, higher operating and maintenance expense, and increased depreciation and amortization primarily related to the scheduled higher competitive transition charge (CTC) amortization at PECO Energy Company (PECO).
"Our people delivered a very fine third quarter," said John W. Rowe, Exelon chairman and CEO. "Our nuclear fleet drove improved generation margins. And ComEd and PECO performed admirably in the face of unusually warm late summer weather and severe storms. In view of our financial results thus far, we are very confident in our full year operating earnings guidance range of $4.15 to $4.30 per share."
Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the third quarter of 2007 do not include the following items that are included in reported GAAP earnings (all after tax):
 
 
 
Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the third quarter of 2006 did not include the following items that were included in reported GAAP earnings (all after tax):
 
 
 
 
 
 
2007 Earnings Outlook
Exelon affirmed its adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings guidance range for 2007 of $4.15 to $4.30 per share. The following table indicates guidance ranges by operating company contribution to 2007 adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings per Exelon share, excluding Exelon holding company.
 
 
The outlook for 2007 adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for Exelon and its subsidiaries excludes the following items:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Giving consideration to these factors, Exelon estimates GAAP earnings in 2007 will fall in the range of $3.90 to $4.20 per share, up from $3.70 to $4.00 per share previously. Both Exelon's operating earnings and GAAP earnings guidance are based on the assumption of normal weather.
Third Quarter and Recent Highlights
 
Exelon has committed to contributing approximately $800 million to rate relief programs over four years, including partial funding for the IPA, in addition to approximately $11 million of rate relief credits provided by ComEd prior to June 14, 2007 under rate relief programs previously announced. ComEd will continue to provide its $64 million rate relief package announced on April 23, 2007. Generation will contribute a total of up to $747 million, of which $435 million will be available to reimburse ComEd for rate relief programs for its customers, $307.5 million will be for rate relief programs for customers of other Illinois utilities, and $4.5 million will be for funding operations of the IPA. Of the $800 million to be contributed to rate relief by Generation and ComEd, it is estimated that $459 million, $222 million, $105 million and $14 million will be provided to Illinois customers for electricity consumed in 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. In September, ComEd began issuing rate relief credits in its customers' bills.
 
To fulfill a requirement of the Settlement Legislation, ComEd and Generation entered into a five-year financial swap contract, the effect of which will cause ComEd to pay fixed prices and cause Generation to pay a market price for a portion of ComEd's load. The financial terms cover energy costs only, not capacity or ancillary services. The contract is designed to dovetail with ComEd's remaining auction contracts for energy, increasing in volume as the contracts expire. The contract volumes will be 1,000 MW for the period from June 2008 through May 2009, 2,000 MW for the period from June 2009 through May 2010, and 3,000 MW in each of the periods June 2010 through May 2011, June 2011 through May 2012, and June 2012 through May 2013. This arrangement is deemed prudent and ComEd will receive full cost recovery in rates. The contract became effective upon enactment of the Settlement Legislation.
 
 
 
 
 
 
The last of these transitional auctions will occur in January 2008 for the period June 2010 to May 2011. Subsequent auctions will take place 36 months ahead of the scheduled delivery year.
 
 
 
 
On October 5, 2007, ComEd made a filing with the FERC seeking approval of a settlement agreement reached among ComEd, the FERC Trial Staff and the active interveners in the proceeding. The settlement agreement is a comprehensive resolution of all issues in the proceeding, other than ComEd's pending request for rehearing at FERC on incentive returns on investments for two transmission projects. The formula-based rate will be updated annually to assure that customers pay the actual costs of transmission services for each year. The agreement provides for a base return on equity on transmission rate base of 11.0 percent plus an adder of 0.50 percent in recognition of ComEd's participation in a regional transmission organization, a cap of 58 percent on the equity component of ComEd's capital structure (declining to 55 percent by 2011), and a debt-only return of 6.51 percent on ComEd's pension asset. The agreement would result in an initial increase in the annual revenue requirement of $93 million, or a $24 million reduction from the revenue requirement conditionally approved by the FERC in its June 2007 order, effective as of May 1, 2007. The reduction in the revenue requirement would be implemented following FERC approval of the settlement agreement. The timing of a FERC ruling is uncertain. Customer refunds will be required upon FERC approval, but are not expected to impact ComEd's net income due to previously recorded reserves for refunds.
 
 
 
 
 
 
On September 6, 2007, S&P upgraded ComEd's and PECO's senior secured debt ratings following a revision of its rating methodology for senior secured debt. ComEd's senior secured debt rating was upgraded to "BBB" from "BBB-", and PECO's senior secured debt rating was upgraded to "A" from "A-".
On September 21, 2007, Moody's removed Exelon's and Generation's ratings from Review for Possible Upgrade. Exelon's issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings were upgraded to "Baa1" from "Baa2", and Generation's issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings were upgraded to "A3" from "Baa1". The rating actions reflect the anticipated strong future financial credit metrics at Exelon and Generation driven by robust cash flows expected at Generation. Exelon's and Generation's outlooks are stable.
 
On September 24, 2007, Exelon, Generation and PECO received consent from nearly all of their lenders to extend the term of their credit agreements by one year. The extension took effect on October 26, 2007 and extended the termination date of the credit agreements to October 26, 2012.
On September 28, 2007, Generation issued $700 million of 6.20 percent Senior Notes due 2017. The proceeds were used to refinance commercial paper and for general corporate purposes.

Exelon Generation
Third quarter 2007 net income was $548 million compared with $394 million in the third quarter of 2006. Third quarter 2007 net income included (all after tax) a charge of $77 million for the costs associated with the Illinois electric rate settlement, income of $18 million resulting from decreases in decommissioning obligations primarily related to the AmerGen nuclear plants and a charge of $1 million
 
related to Generation's prior investment in Sithe, which is reflected as discontinued operations. Third quarter 2006 net income included (all after tax) mark-to-market gains of $56 million from economic hedging activities, severance charges of $6 million, certain integration costs of $2 million associated with the terminated merger with PSEG and income of $1 million related to Generation's prior investment in Sithe, which is reflected as discontinued operations. Excluding the impact of these items, Generation's net income in the third quarter of 2007 increased $263 million compared with the same quarter last year, primarily due to higher revenue, net of purchased power and fuel expense, more than offsetting inflationary cost pressures.
Generation's revenue, net of purchased power and fuel expense, increased by $413 million in the third quarter of 2007 compared with the third quarter of 2006 excluding the mark-to-market impacts and costs associated with the Illinois electric rate settlement. The increase in revenue, net of purchased power and fuel expense, was driven by higher average margins primarily due to the end of the below-market price PPA with ComEd at year-end 2006, the contractual increase in the prices associated with Generation's PPA with PECO, and higher nuclear output reflecting fewer refueling outage days. Generation's average realized margin on all electric sales, including sales to affiliates and excluding trading activity, was $32.60 per MWh in the third quarter of 2007 compared with $22.09 per MWh in the third quarter of 2006. Generation's operating and maintenance expenses increased slightly as inflationary and cost pressures were partially offset by lower nuclear refueling outage costs.

ComEd
ComEd recorded net income of $65 million in the third quarter of 2007, compared with a net loss of $506 million in the third quarter of 2006. Third quarter 2007 net income included (both after tax) a charge of $3 million for the costs associated with the Illinois electric rate settlement, including ComEd's previously announced customer rate relief programs, and mark-to-market gains of $1 million. The third quarter 2006 net loss included (all after tax) a non-cash charge of $776 million related to the impairment of ComEd's goodwill, a one-time benefit of $52 million approved by the ICC's July 26, 2006 rate order to recover previously incurred losses on the extinguishment of debt as part of ComEd's 2004 Accelerated Liability Management Plan, severance charges of $5 million, mark-to-market gains of $1 million and certain integration costs of $1 million associated with the terminated merger with PSEG. Excluding the impact of these items, ComEd's net income in the third quarter of 2007 decreased $156 million compared with the same quarter last year, primarily due to the end of its regulatory transition period and associated transition revenues, the end of its below-market price PPA with Generation in 2006 and higher operating and maintenance expense partially due to increased incremental storm costs. These items were partially offset by the effects of warmer weather, the FERC-approved transmission rate increase, and an ICC-authorized increase in delivery service rates.
In the ComEd service territory in the third quarter of 2007, cooling degree-days were up 5 percent relative to the same period in 2006 and were 24 percent above normal. ComEd's total retail kWh deliveries increased 2 percent in 2007 as compared with 2006, with a 4 percent increase in deliveries to the residential customer class, largely due to warmer weather. ComEd's third quarter 2007 revenues were $1,758 million, down 4 percent from $1,840 million in 2006 primarily due to customers switching to alternative electric generation suppliers. For ComEd, weather had a favorable after-tax impact of $4 million on third quarter 2007 earnings relative to 2006 and had a favorable after-tax impact of $13 million relative to normal weather, which was incorporated in earnings guidance.
 
The number of customers being served in the ComEd region increased by 1.2 percent since the third quarter of 2006, and weather-normalized kWh retail deliveries increased by 1.7 percent compared with the third quarter of 2006.

PECO
PECO's net income in the third quarter of 2007 was $168 million, an increase from net income of $134 million in the third quarter of 2006. Third quarter 2006 net income included (all after tax) severance charges of $3 million, and certain integration costs of $3 million associated with the terminated merger with PSEG. Excluding the impact of these items, PECO's net income in the third quarter of 2007 increased $28 million compared with the same quarter last year, primarily due to higher revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense and lower storm costs, partially offset by higher CTC amortization. The increase in CTC amortization expense is in accordance with PECO's 1998 restructuring settlement with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. Additionally, PECO recognized $22 million of income (after tax) as a result of a determination that a portion of the liability related to previously contested tax assessments under the Pennsylvania Public Utility Realty Tax Act was no longer necessary.
In the PECO service territory in the third quarter of 2007, cooling degree-days were up 4 percent from 2006 and were 12 percent above normal. PECO's total electric retail kWh deliveries increased 2 percent, with residential deliveries up 3 percent. Total gas retail deliveries were up 11 percent from the 2006 period. PECO's third quarter 2007 revenues were $1,459 million, up from $1,379 million in 2006, primarily due to the effects of an authorized electric generation rate increase under the 1998 restructuring settlement and increased electric volumes due to increased usage across all customer classes. For PECO, weather had no impact on third quarter 2007 earnings relative to 2006 and a favorable after-tax impact of $6 million relative to normal weather, which was incorporated in earnings guidance.
The number of electric customers being served in the PECO region increased by 0.2 percent since the third quarter of 2006, with weather-normalized kWh growth of 2.5 percent compared with the third quarter of 2006.
