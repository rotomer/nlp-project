Exhibit 99.1
    
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
(January 23, 2008)  Exelon Corporation's (Exelon) fourth quarter 2007 consolidated earnings prepared in accordance with GAAP were $562 million, or $0.84 per diluted share, compared with earnings of $592 million, or $0.87 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2006. Full year 2007 consolidated earnings prepared in accordance with GAAP were $2,736 million, or $4.05 per diluted share, compared with $1,592 million, or $2.35 per diluted share in 2006.
CHICAGO
"Our company and its employees delivered an exceptional year in 2007. Our results reflected both improved generation margins and excellent operating performance, including all-time record-setting nuclear output and fleet capacity factors. In addition, our nuclear fleet recorded its lowest industrial safety accident rate ever," said John W. Rowe, Exelon's chairman, president and CEO. "ComEd and PECO also had strong performance amid severe storms and hot weather late last summer. We are now at work to meet, and if possible to exceed, the financial and operating targets we have set for 2008."
Full Year Operating Results
Full year 2007 adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings were $2,923 million, or $4.32 per diluted share, up 34 percent over 2006 adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings of $2,175 million, or $3.22 per diluted share. The full year adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings improvement was due to higher margins on energy sales at Exelon Generation Company, LLC (Generation), authorized transmission and delivery service revenue increases for Commonwealth Edison Company (ComEd), and higher electric delivery volume at ComEd and PECO Energy Company (PECO). These positive factors were partially offset by significantly lower net income at ComEd primarily due to the end of its nearly ten-year regulatory transition period, higher operating and maintenance expense, and increased depreciation and amortization primarily related to the scheduled higher competitive transition charge (CTC) amortization at PECO.

Fourth Quarter Operating Results
Exelon's adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2007 were $677 million, or $1.02 per diluted share, compared with $487 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, for the same period in 2006. The increase in adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings per share was primarily due to the higher margins at Generation, the transmission and delivery service revenue increases for ComEd, and the effects of favorable weather conditions as compared with the prior year in the ComEd and PECO service territories. These positive factors were partially offset by the impacts of the end of the Illinois transition period at ComEd, higher operating and maintenance expense, and increased depreciation and amortization expense.
Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2007 do not include the following items, representing an after-tax net loss of $115 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, that are included in reported GAAP earnings (all after tax):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2006 did not include the following items, representing an after-tax net gain of $105 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, that were included in reported GAAP earnings (all after tax):

2008 Earnings Outlook
Exelon affirmed its adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings guidance range for 2008 of $4.00 to $4.40 per share. The following table indicates estimated contribution ranges by operating company to 2008 adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings per Exelon share, excluding Exelon holding company.
 
The outlook for 2008 adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for Exelon and its subsidiaries excludes the following items:
 
Giving consideration to these factors, Exelon estimates GAAP earnings in 2008 will fall in the range of $3.70 to $4.10 per share. Both Exelon's operating earnings and GAAP earnings guidance are based on the assumption of normal weather.

Also on December 19, 2007, Exelon's board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $500 million of Exelon's outstanding common stock. This new program is in addition to the $1.25 billion share repurchase executed in September 2007 and to any additional share repurchases that may be authorized by the board of directors later in 2008 based on availability of cash and other factors. Exelon's value return policy considers the use of share repurchases from time to time, when authorized by the board of directors, to return cash or balance sheet capacity to Exelon shareholders after funding maintenance capital and other commitments and in the absence of higher value-added growth opportunities.
 
For the full year 2007, the Exelon-operated nuclear plants achieved an average capacity factor of 94.5 percent, an all-time record for the company, compared with 93.9 percent for 2006. The Exelon-operated plants have achieved average capacity factors of more than 93 percent in each of the past five years. In addition, the Exelon-operated nuclear plants produced a total of 132,341 GWhs in 2007, their highest annual production ever.

The NRC is also currently reviewing a license renewal application for Oyster Creek Generating Station in New Jersey filed in July 2005. In December 2007 and January 2008, two milestones in this license renewal process were achieved  the NRC Atomic Safety and Licensing Board decision regarding the safety of the drywell containment structure and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection certification regarding compliance with the Federal Coastal Zone Management Act. As a result, Generation expects to receive approval from the NRC during 2008.

On October 5, 2007, ComEd made a filing with FERC seeking approval of a settlement agreement reached among ComEd, the FERC Trial Staff and the active interveners in the proceeding. The settlement agreement provides for an initial increase in the revenue requirement of $93 million (effective as of May 1, 2007), or a $23 million reduction from the revenue requirement conditionally approved by FERC in its June 2007 order. The settlement agreement is a comprehensive resolution of all issues in the proceeding, other than ComEd's request for rehearing at FERC on the incentive returns. FERC approved the settlement agreement on January 16, 2008. ComEd believes that appropriate reserves have been established for this issue.
On January 18, 2008, FERC issued an order on rehearing approving, in part, incentive rate treatment. The January 18, 2008 order approved the inclusion of construction work in progress (CWIP) in rate base for ComEd's investment in a new 345-kV transmission line in Chicago's West Loop and allowed a 1.50 percent adder to the return on equity on the project, but denied incentive rate treatment on a smaller transmission project. The inclusion of CWIP in rate base and the return on equity adder for the West Loop project will increase the revenue requirement, effective May 1, 2007.

On January 16, 2008, ComEd issued $450 million of 6.45 percent First Mortgage Bonds due 2038. ComEd used the net proceeds from the sale of the bonds to refinance trust preferred securities and will refinance maturing First Mortgage Bonds.

Exelon Generation
Fourth quarter 2007 net income was $343 million compared with $245 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. Fourth quarter 2007 net income included (all after tax) a charge of $179 million for the costs associated with the Illinois electric rate settlement, income of $130 million for termination of the State Line PPA, a charge of $72 million associated with the tolling agreement with Georgia Power, charges of $34 million related to non-cash deferred tax items, and mark-to-market losses of $21 million from

economic hedging activities. Fourth quarter 2006 net income included (all after tax) mark-to-market losses of $17 million from economic hedging activities, severance and severance-related charges of $1 million and an impairment charge of $1 million related to its investments in Termoelctrica del Golfo (TEG) and Termoelctrica Peoles (TEP), the sale of which closed in February 2007. Excluding the impact of these items, Generation's net income in the fourth quarter of 2007 increased $255 million compared with the same quarter last year, primarily due to higher revenue, net of purchased power and fuel expense, more than offsetting inflationary and other cost pressures and costs associated with the new nuclear plant COL application.
Generation's revenue, net of purchased power and fuel expense, increased by $441 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared with the fourth quarter of 2006 excluding the mark-to-market impacts, costs associated with the Illinois electric rate settlement, income related to the termination of the State Line PPA and the loss associated with the tolling agreement with Georgia Power. The increase in revenue, net of purchased power and fuel expense, was driven by higher average margins primarily due to the end of the below-market price PPA with ComEd at year-end 2006 and the contractual increase in the prices associated with Generation's PPA with PECO. Generation's average realized margin on all electric sales, including sales to affiliates and excluding trading activity, was $35.70 per MWh in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared with $24.81 per MWh in the fourth quarter of 2006.

ComEd
ComEd recorded net income of $67 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, compared with net income of $213 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. Fourth quarter 2007 net income included (all after tax) a charge of $5 million for the costs associated with the Illinois electric rate settlement, including ComEd's previously announced customer rate relief programs, a charge of $14 million for the City of Chicago settlement agreement and mark-to-market gains of $2 million. Fourth quarter 2006 net income included a one-time after-tax benefit of $95 million attributable to the ICC's December 20, 2006 amended order to recover previously incurred severance costs. Excluding the impact of these items, ComEd's net income in the fourth quarter of 2007 decreased $34 million compared with the same quarter last year, primarily due to the end of its regulatory transition period, and higher operating and maintenance expense, which partially reflected increased labor and contracting costs and allowance for uncollectible accounts expense. These items were partially offset by the FERC-approved transmission rate increase and ICC-authorized increase in delivery service rates. In addition, ComEd recorded a net benefit associated with a change in its tax method of capitalizing overhead costs.
In the ComEd service territory in the fourth quarter of 2007, heating degree-days were up 1 percent relative to the same period in 2006 but were 7 percent below normal. ComEd's total retail kWh deliveries increased 3 percent in 2007 as compared with 2006, with a 3 percent increase in deliveries to the residential customer class, largely due to colder weather. ComEd's fourth quarter 2007 revenues were $1,436 million, up 4 percent from $1,381 million in 2006 primarily due to the above-mentioned rate increases plus increases in the cost of power and the impact of favorable weather, partially offset by customers switching to alternative electric generation suppliers. For ComEd, weather had a favorable after-tax impact of $10 million on fourth quarter 2007 earnings relative to 2006 and a favorable after-tax impact of $5 million relative to normal weather, which was incorporated in earnings guidance.
The number of customers being served in the ComEd region increased by 1.0 percent since the fourth quarter of 2006, and weather-normalized kWh retail deliveries increased by 0.6 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2006.

PECO
PECO's net income in the fourth quarter of 2007 was $115 million, a decrease from net income of $121 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. Fourth quarter 2006 net income included after-tax severance and severance-related charges of $1 million. Excluding the impact of this item, PECO's net income in the fourth quarter of 2007 decreased $7 million compared with the same quarter last year, primarily due to higher operating and maintenance expense, which partially reflected increased labor and contracting costs and allowance for uncollectible accounts expense, and higher CTC amortization, which was in accordance with PECO's 1998 restructuring settlement with the PAPUC. As expected, the increase in amortization expense exceeded the increase in CTC revenues. These items were partially offset by higher revenues, net of purchased power and fuel expense, largely due to the effects of favorable weather compared to 2006. In addition, PECO recorded a net benefit associated with a change in its tax method of capitalizing overhead costs.
In the PECO service territory in the fourth quarter of 2007, heating degree-days were up 12 percent from 2006 but were 8 percent below normal. PECO's total electric retail kWh deliveries increased 4 percent, with residential deliveries up 3 percent. Total gas retail deliveries were up 16 percent from the 2006 period. PECO's fourth quarter 2007 revenues were $1,385 million, up from $1,235 million in 2006, primarily due to the effects of an authorized electric generation rate increase under the 1998 restructuring settlement and the effects of favorable weather compared with 2006. For PECO, weather had a favorable after-tax impact of $23 million on fourth quarter 2007 earnings relative to 2006 and a favorable after-tax impact of $5 million relative to normal weather, which was incorporated in earnings guidance. The favorable impact relative to normal weather reflected a significant increase in cooling degree-days in October due to unusually warm weather.
The number of electric customers being served in the PECO region increased by 0.8 percent since the fourth quarter of 2006, with weather-normalized kWh growth of 2.9 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2006.
Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings
