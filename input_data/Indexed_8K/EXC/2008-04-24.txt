Exhibit 99.1
 
(April 24, 2008)  Exelon Corporation's (Exelon) first quarter 2008 consolidated earnings prepared in accordance with GAAP were $581 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, compared with earnings of $691 million, or $1.02 per share, in the first quarter of 2007.
CHICAGO
Exelon's adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the first quarter of 2008 were $620 million, or $0.93 per diluted share, compared with $722 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, for the same period in 2007. The lower level of earnings was primarily due to lower nuclear output at Exelon Generation Company, LLC (Generation) largely reflecting increased planned refueling outages, realized investment losses in connection with the implementation of a favorable tax law change, increased operating and maintenance expense, in part due to more nuclear refueling outages, and increased depreciation and amortization expense primarily related to the higher scheduled competitive transition charge (CTC) amortization at PECO Energy Company (PECO). First quarter 2007 results included a one-time favorable PJM Interconnection, LLC (PJM) billing settlement with PPL Electric. The year-over-year earnings decrease was partially offset by higher average margins on energy sales at Generation, increased transmission revenue as a result of Commonwealth Edison Company's (ComEd) 2007 transmission rate case and a favorable impact of certain tax items.
"In the first quarter, we began five and completed four planned nuclear refueling outages, compared with beginning two and completing one in last year's first quarter. As expected, the impact of these additional refueling outages resulted in lower first quarter earnings than last year. Exelon's full-year 2008 earnings outlook remains on plan," said John W. Rowe, Exelon's chairman, president and CEO. "Year-to-date, our nuclear fleet operations continued industry-leading performance as the refuelings averaged less than 24 days per outage, substantially below the 2007 industry average of 41 days. In addition, ComEd is progressing in its pending rate case and PECO continues to work towards a successful transition to competitive markets in Pennsylvania."

2008 Earnings Outlook
Exelon reaffirmed its adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings guidance range for 2008 of $4.00 to $4.40 per share. The outlook for 2008 adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for Exelon and its subsidiaries excludes the following items:

Giving consideration to these factors, Exelon estimates GAAP earnings in 2008 will fall in the range of $3.70 to $4.10 per share. Both Exelon's operating earnings and GAAP earnings guidance are based on the assumption of normal weather.
First Quarter and Recent Highlights
 
 
 
On March 12, 2008, ComEd filed rebuttal testimony that supported an adjusted revenue requirement increase of approximately $355 million. Various intervenors and the ICC Staff have filed testimony challenging the amount of the increase. The ICC Staff's rebuttal testimony, filed on April 10, 2008, indicated that ComEd's revenue increase should be approximately $269 million on an annual basis, primarily reflecting a stipulation reached with ComEd on several contested issues. The stipulation is also subject to approval by the ICC. On April 21, 2008, ComEd filed its surrebuttal testimony, which included the impacts of the stipulation and various other agreements. As part of the stipulation and if the ICC agrees, ComEd will incur a write-off of about $20 million pre-tax when the final order is issued. Hearings are scheduled during the period from April 28 to May 5, 2008. Based on typical rate cases, the Administrative Law Judges' recommended order in the case is expected by July, with a final ICC order in September.

In August 2007, Illinois electric rate settlement legislation established a new competitive process to be used for procurement of electricity by Illinois utilities, replacing the reverse-auction bidding process approved in 2006. The energy supply contracts awarded as a result of the 2006 reverse-auction will remain in effect through their original terms, but as those contracts expire, the energy will be replaced with contracts awarded through the new process. For energy needs beginning June 2009, the Illinois Power Agency (IPA) will participate in the design of an electricity supply portfolio and will administer a competitive process for ComEd to procure its electricity supply resources identified in the supply portfolio plans, all with the oversight of the ICC.
 
 
 
 
On March 3, 2008, PECO issued $500 million of 5.35 percent First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds due 2018. The net proceeds of the bonds were used to refund commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes.
On March 5, 2008, PECO issued $150 million of 4.00 percent First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds to secure tax-exempt pollution control bonds and notes issued to refinance three series of

auction-rate, tax-exempt bonds on their most recent auction dates. The final series was retired on April 3, 2008.
On March 27, 2008, ComEd issued $700 million of 5.80 percent First Mortgage Bonds due 2018. The proceeds are being used to repay borrowings made under ComEd's revolving credit facilities, to refinance the $120 million outstanding principal amount of its First Mortgage 8.00 percent Bonds, Series 83, which mature on May 15, 2008, and for general corporate purposes.
 
OPERATING COMPANY RESULTS
consists of owned and contracted electric generating facilities, wholesale energy marketing operations and competitive retail sales operations.
Exelon Generation
First quarter 2008 net income was $438 million compared with $560 million in the first quarter of 2007. First quarter 2008 net income included (all after tax) mark-to-market gains of $38 million from economic hedging activities, a charge of $47 million for the costs associated with the Illinois electric rate settlement and unrealized losses of $42 million related to nuclear decommissioning trust fund investments. First quarter 2007 net income included (all after tax) mark-to-market losses of $69 million from economic hedging activities, a gain of $9 million related to the sale of its investments in TEG and TEP and earnings of $5 million associated with the settlement of a tax matter related to its previous investment in Sithe. Excluding the impact of these items, Generation's net income in the first quarter of 2008 decreased $126 million compared with the same quarter last year, primarily due to lower revenue, net of purchased power and fuel expense, realized investment losses associated with nuclear decommissioning trust funds in connection with the implementation of a favorable tax law change under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, and higher operating and maintenance costs associated with more planned nuclear refueling outages, continuing work on the license application submittal for a possible new nuclear plant in Texas, and inflationary and other cost pressures.
Generation's revenue, net of purchased power and fuel expense, decreased by $96 million in the first quarter of 2008 compared with the first quarter of 2007 excluding the above-mentioned unusual items. The decrease in revenue, net of purchased power and fuel expense, was driven primarily by lower nuclear output reflecting increased refueling and non-refueling outage days and the favorable PJM billing settlement with PPL Electric in 2007, which more than offset higher average margins on energy sales. Generation's average realized margin on all electric sales, including sales to affiliates and excluding trading activity, was $38.77 per MWh in the first quarter of 2008 compared with $36.61 per MWh in the first quarter of 2007.
consists of the electricity transmission and distribution operations in northern Illinois.
ComEd
ComEd recorded net income of $41 million in the first quarter of 2008, compared with net income of $5 million in the first quarter of 2007. First quarter 2008 net income included an after-tax charge of $3
 
5
million for the costs associated with the Illinois electric rate settlement. Excluding the impact of this item, ComEd's net income in the first quarter of 2008 increased $39 million compared with the same quarter last year primarily due to increased transmission revenue as a result of ComEd's 2007 transmission rate case including the impact of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved formula rate, higher electric delivery volume, the impact of favorable weather and an Illinois distribution tax refund, partially offset by increased interest expense and higher operating and maintenance expense, which partially reflected increased labor costs and allowance for uncollectible accounts expense.
In the ComEd service territory in the first quarter of 2008, heating degree-days were up 9 percent relative to the same period in 2007 and were 7 percent above normal. ComEd's total retail kWh deliveries increased 2.4 percent in 2008 as compared with 2007, with a 2.8 percent increase in deliveries to the residential customer class, largely due to colder weather. For ComEd, weather had a favorable after-tax impact of $7 million on first quarter 2008 earnings relative to 2007 and a favorable after-tax impact of $4 million relative to normal weather that was incorporated in earnings guidance. ComEd's first quarter 2008 revenues were $1,440 million, down 3 percent from $1,490 million in 2007 primarily due to a decrease in the number of customers purchasing energy directly from ComEd, and the expiration of four wholesale energy contracts with municipalities.
The number of customers being served in the ComEd region increased by 1.1 percent over the first quarter of 2007, and weather-normalized kWh retail deliveries increased by 1.4 percent over the first quarter of 2007.
consists of the electricity transmission and distribution operations and the retail natural gas distribution business in southeastern Pennsylvania.
PECO
PECO's net income in the first quarter of 2008 was $97 million, a decrease from $128 million in the first quarter of 2007. This decline was primarily due to the impact of unfavorable weather, higher operating and maintenance expense, which partially reflected increased allowance for uncollectible accounts expense, and higher CTC amortization, which was in accordance with PECO's 1998 restructuring settlement with the PAPUC. As expected, the increase in amortization expense exceeded the increase in CTC revenues.
In the PECO service territory in the first quarter of 2008, heating degree-days were down 7 percent from 2007 and were 7 percent below normal. Retail gas deliveries were down 9 percent from the 2007 period. PECO's total electric retail and residential kWh deliveries remained relatively level quarter over quarter. First quarter 2008 revenues were $1,476 million, down from $1,500 million in 2007, primarily due to the effects of unfavorable weather compared with 2007. For PECO, weather had an unfavorable after-tax impact of $14 million on first quarter 2008 earnings relative to 2007 and an unfavorable after-tax impact of $14 million relative to normal weather that was incorporated in earnings guidance.
The number of electric customers being served in the PECO region increased by 0.8 percent over the first quarter of 2007, with weather-normalized kWh growth of 1.8 percent over the first quarter of 2007.
