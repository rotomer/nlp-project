Item 8.01 Other Events
John W. Rowe, Chairman, President and CEO of Exelon Corporation (Exelon), together with the Rowe Family Charitable Trust, has established a fifth structured, prearranged stock trading plan in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Mr. Rowes first 10b5-1 stock trading plan was announced in February 2004 and expired in February 2005. Exercises of options and sales under Mr. Rowes current 10b5-1 plan, announced in September 2007, are expected to continue until August 2008.
Under the new trading plan, Mr. Rowe will transfer 80,000 shares of Exelon common stock to fund the Rowe Family Charitable Trust. The shares will be transferred to the Rowe Family Charitable Trust on a date in November 2008, and the Rowe Family Charitable Trust will sell the shares upon receipt. The proceeds of the sale will be used by the Rowe Family Charitable Trust to make charitable contributions, including supporting The Rowe-Clark Math and Science Academy, The Rowe Family Professorship in Engineering at IIT, the Rowe Family Professorship in the History of Greece at the University of Wisconsin, and the Rowe Family Curator of Evolutionary Biology at the Field Museum.
Exelons stock ownership guidelines require Mr. Rowe to own the lesser of either a fixed number of shares or share equivalents (excluding stock options) or a variable number of shares based on a multiple of five times his base salary, calculated annually. Mr. Rowe holds stock and stock equivalents (excluding options) amounting to about 520% of this guideline. After this contribution, he will hold about 430% of this guideline. Mr. Rowe and his wife will own over 275,000 shares. Mr. Rowe also owns nearly 125,000 performance shares and over 1,000 shares or share equivalents deferred until he retires. He holds options to acquire 493,000 shares in addition to the options that are included in his stock trading plans.
Since February 2005 a total of ten of Exelons senior officers have also entered into one or more similar pre-arranged stock trading plans to sell a limited number of shares of Exelon common stock in order to diversify their assets. Under Exelons stock ownership guidelines, executive vice presidents should own a fixed number of shares of Exelon stock or stock equivalents (excluding stock options) based on a multiple of three times their base salary, and senior vice presidents should own a fixed number of shares based on a multiple of two times their base salary. Each of the senior officers who entered into a stock trading plan held stock and stock equivalents (excluding options) exceeding the applicable stock ownership guideline, and each of those officers will continue to meet the applicable stock ownership guideline after the completion of the sales contemplated by the stock trading plans.
