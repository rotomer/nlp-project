EXHIBIT 99.1
 
(July 23, 2008)  Exelon Corporation's (Exelon) second quarter 2008 consolidated earnings prepared in accordance with GAAP were $748 million, or $1.13 per diluted share, compared with earnings of $702 million, or $1.03 per share, in the second quarter of 2007.
CHICAGO
Exelon's adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the second quarter of 2008 were $746 million, or $1.13 per diluted share, compared with $700 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, for the same period in 2007. "Our strong second quarter results primarily reflected higher margins at Generation largely due to our first-rate operating performance. We also continue to realize the benefits of a large fleet of extremely well-run nuclear plants amid rising environmental pressures," said John W. Rowe, Exelon's chairman, president and CEO. "We recognize, however, that protecting these benefits requires that we actively meet our customers' needs for affordable energy in a climate constrained environment. As a result, last week we announced a comprehensive strategy to reduce, offset or displace more than 15 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 with both efficiency and new sources of supply."
The increased level of second quarter 2008 earnings was primarily due to:
 
 
 
 
 
The quarter-over-quarter earnings increase was partially offset by:
 
 
 
 
Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the second quarter of 2008 do not include the following items that were included in reported GAAP earnings (all after tax):
 
 
 
Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the second quarter of 2007 did not include the following items that were included in reported GAAP earnings (all after tax):
 
 
 
2008 Earnings Outlook
Exelon reaffirmed its adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings guidance range for 2008 of $4.00 to $4.40 per share. The outlook for 2008 adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for Exelon and its subsidiaries excludes the following items:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Giving consideration to these factors, Exelon estimates GAAP earnings in 2008 will likely be in the range of $3.70 to $4.10 per share. Both Exelon's operating earnings and GAAP earnings guidance are based on the assumption of normal weather.
Second Quarter and Recent Highlights

OPERATING COMPANY RESULTS
consists of owned and contracted electric generating facilities, wholesale energy marketing operations and competitive retail sales operations.
Exelon Generation
 
Second quarter 2008 net income was $653 million compared with $578 million in the second quarter of 2007. Second quarter 2008 net income included (all after tax) mark-to-market gains of $47 million from economic hedging activities, a charge of $44 million for the costs associated with the Illinois electric rate settlement and unrealized losses of $15 million related to nuclear decommissioning trust fund investments. Second quarter 2007 net income included (all after tax) mark-to-market losses of $13 million and a gain of $2 million related to the sale of Generation's 49.5 percent ownership interests in Termoelctrica del Golfo (TEG) and Termoelctrica Peoles (TEP), two generating facilities in Mexico. Excluding the impact of these items, Generation's net income in the second quarter of 2008 increased $76 million compared with the same quarter last year, primarily due to higher revenue, net of purchased power and fuel expense.
The quarter-over-quarter increase in net income was partially offset by:
 
 
 
Generation's revenue, net of purchased power and fuel expense, increased by $177 million in the second quarter of 2008 compared with the second quarter of 2007 excluding the above-mentioned unusual items. The increase in revenue, net of purchased power and fuel expense, was driven primarily by:
 
 
 
 
Generation's average realized margin on all electric sales, including sales to affiliates and excluding trading activity, was $40.53 per MWh in the second quarter of 2008 compared with $35.97 per MWh in the second quarter of 2007.
consists of the electricity transmission and distribution operations in northern Illinois.
ComEd
ComEd recorded net income of $35 million in the second quarter of 2008, compared with net income of $29 million in the second quarter of 2007. Second quarter 2008 net income included an after-tax charge of $1 million for the costs associated with the Illinois electric rate settlement. Second quarter 2007 net income included an after-tax charge of $14 million for costs associated with ComEd's Rate Relief and Assistance Initiative. Excluding the impact of these items, ComEd's net income in the second quarter of 2008 decreased $7 million from the same quarter last year primarily due to:
 
 
Partially offsetting items included:
 
 
 
In the ComEd service territory in the second quarter of 2008, cooling degree-days were down 37 percent relative to the same period in 2007 and were 14 percent below normal. ComEd's total retail kWh deliveries decreased by 3.6 percent in 2008 as compared with 2007, with a 3.8 percent decrease in deliveries to the residential customer class, largely due to unfavorable weather. For ComEd, weather had an unfavorable after-tax impact of $12 million on second quarter 2008 earnings relative to 2007 and an unfavorable after-tax impact of $4 million relative to normal weather that was incorporated in earnings guidance. ComEd's second quarter 2008 revenues of $1,425 million remained relatively unchanged from $1,420 million in 2007.
The number of customers being served in the ComEd region increased by 0.6 percent over the second quarter of 2007, and weather-normalized kWh retail deliveries decreased by 0.2 percent over the second quarter of 2007.
consists of the electricity transmission and distribution operations and the retail natural gas distribution business in southeastern Pennsylvania.
PECO
PECO's net income in the second quarter of 2008 was $58 million, a decrease from $96 million in the second quarter of 2007. This decline was primarily due to:
 
 
Partially offsetting items included:
 
In the PECO service territory in the second quarter of 2008, cooling degree-days were down 1 percent from 2007 and were 18 percent above normal, and heating degree-days decreased by 19 percent from 2007 and were 10 percent below normal. Retail gas deliveries were down 18 percent from the 2007 period. Second quarter 2008 revenues were $1,277 million, up from $1,269 million in 2007, primarily due to higher electricity delivery volume driven by an increase in customers across all customer classes partially offset by a decline in retail gas deliveries and the effects of unfavorable weather for electric and gas compared with 2007. For PECO, weather had an unfavorable after-tax impact of $3 million on second quarter 2008 earnings relative to 2007 and a favorable after-tax impact of $5 million relative to normal weather that was incorporated in earnings guidance.
The number of electric customers being served in the PECO region increased by 0.8 percent over the second quarter of 2007, with weather-normalized kWh growth of 0.6 percent over the second quarter of 2007.
Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings
