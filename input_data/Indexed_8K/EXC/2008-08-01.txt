Additional Gross-Up Amounts
(a) the sum of (1) such additional Excise Taxes and (2) any interest, penalties, expenses or other costs incurred by Executive as a result of having taken a position in accordance with a determination made pursuant to Section 8.5 or 8.6, as applicable, multiplied by
(b) the Gross-Up Multiple.
8.8 . The Gross-Up Multiple shall equal a fraction, the numerator of which is one (1.0), and the denominator of which is one (1.0) minus the lesser of (i) the sum, expressed as a decimal fraction, of the effective after-tax marginal rates of all Taxes and any
Gross-Up Multiple
 
Excise Taxes applicable to the Gross-Up Payment or (ii) 0.80, it being intended that the Gross-Up Multiple shall in no event exceed five (5.0). (If different rates of tax are applicable to various portions of a Gross-Up Payment, the weighted average of such rates shall be used.)

"Company Counsel Opinion" means an opinion of nationally-recognized executive compensation counsel to the effect that (i) the amount of the Gross-Up Payment set forth in the Company Certificate is the amount that a court of competent jurisdiction, based on a final judgment not subject to further appeal, is most likely to decide to have been calculated in accordance with this Article and applicable law and (ii) for purposes of Section 6662 of the Code, Executive has substantial authority to report on his federal income tax return the amount of Excise Taxes set forth in the Company Certificate.
Opinion of Counsel
8.10 .
Amount Increased or Contested
(a) Executive shall notify the Company in writing (an "Executive's Notice") of any claim by the IRS or other taxing authority (an "IRS Claim") that, if successful, would require the payment by Executive of Excise Taxes in respect of Potential Parachute Payments in an amount in excess of the amount of such Excise Taxes determined in accordance with Section 8.5 or 8.6, as applicable. Such Executive's Notice shall include the nature and amount of such IRS Claim, the date on which such IRS Claim is due to be paid (the "IRS Claim Deadline"), and a copy of all notices and other documents or correspondence received by Executive in respect of such IRS Claim. Executive shall give his Executive's Notice as soon as practicable, but no later than the earlier of (i) 10 business days after Executive first obtains actual knowledge of such IRS Claim or (ii) five business days before the IRS Claim Deadline; provided, however, that Executive's failure to give such notice shall affect the Company's obligations under this Article only to the extent that the Company is actually prejudiced by such failure. If at least one business day before the IRS Claim Deadline the Company shall:
(1) deliver to Executive a Company Certificate to the effect that the IRS Claim has been reviewed by the Company's independent auditors and, notwithstanding the IRS Claim, the amount of Excise Taxes, interest and penalties payable by Executive is either zero or an amount less than the amount specified in the IRS Claim,
(2) pay to Executive an amount (which shall also be deemed a Gross-Up Payment) equal to the positive difference between (x) the product of the amount of Excise Taxes, interest and penalties specified in the Company Certificate, if any, multiplied by the Gross-Up Multiple, and (y) the portion of such product, if any, previously paid to Executive by the Company, and
 
(3) direct Executive pursuant to Section 8.10(d) to contest the balance of the IRS Claim,
then Executive shall pay only the amount, if any, of Excise Taxes, interest and penalties specified in the Company Certificate. In no event shall Executive pay an IRS Claim earlier than 30 days after having given an Executive's Notice to the Company (or, if sooner, the IRS Claim Deadline).
(b) At any time after the payment by Executive of any amount of Excise Taxes or related interest or penalties in respect of Potential Parachute Payments (whether or not such amount was based upon a Company Certificate, an Executive's Determination or an IRS Claim), the Company may in its discretion require Executive to pursue a claim for a refund (a "Refund Claim") of all or any portion of such Excise Taxes, interest or penalties as the Company may specify by written notice to Executive.
(c) If the Company notifies Executive in writing that the Company desires Executive to contest an IRS Claim or to pursue a Refund Claim, Executive shall:
(i) give the Company all information that it reasonably requests in writing from time to time relating to such IRS Claim or Refund Claim, as applicable,
(ii) take such action in connection with such IRS Claim or Refund Claim (as applicable) as the Company reasonably requests in writing from time to time, including accepting legal representation with respect thereto by an attorney selected by the Company, subject to the approval of Executive (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
(iii) cooperate with the Company in good faith to contest such IRS claim or pursue such Refund Claim, as applicable,
(iv) permit the Company to participate in any proceedings relating to such IRS Claim or Refund Claim, as applicable, and
(v) contest such IRS Claim or prosecute such Refund Claim (as applicable) to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the Company may from time to time determine in its discretion.
The Company shall control all proceedings in connection with such IRS Claim or Refund Claim (as applicable) and in its discretion may cause Executive to pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the IRS or other taxing authority in respect of such IRS Claim or Refund Claim (as applicable); provided that (i) any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes for the taxable year of Executive relating to the IRS Claim is limited solely to such IRS Claim, (ii) the Company's control of the IRS Claim or Refund Claim (as applicable) shall be limited to issues with respect to which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable, and (iii) Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the IRS or other taxing authority.
 
(d) The Company may at any time in its discretion direct Executive to (i) contest the IRS Claim in any lawful manner or (ii) pay the amount specified in an IRS Claim and pursue a Refund Claim; provided, however, that if the Company directs Executive to pay an IRS Claim and pursue a Refund Claim, the Company shall advance the amount of such payment to Executive on an interest-free basis and shall indemnify Executive, on an after-tax basis, for any Taxes, Excise Taxes, and any related interest or penalties imposed with respect to such advance.
(e) The Company shall pay directly all legal, accounting and other costs and expenses (including additional interest and penalties) incurred by the Company or Executive in connection with any IRS Claim or Refund Claim, as applicable, and shall indemnify Executive, on an after-tax basis, for any Taxes, Excise Taxes and related interest and penalties imposed on Executive as a result of such payment of costs and expenses.
8.11 .
Limitation on Gross-Up Payments
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article VIII, if the aggregate After-Tax Amount (as defined below) of the Potential Parachute Payments and Gross-Up Payment that, but for this Section 8.11, would be payable to Executive, does not exceed 110% of the After-Tax Floor Amount (as defined below), then no Gross-Up Payment shall be made to Executive and the aggregate amount of Potential Parachute Payments payable to Executive shall be reduced (but not below the Floor Amount) to the largest amount which would both (i) not cause any Excise Taxes to be payable by Executive and (ii) not cause any Potential Parachute Payments to become nondeductible by the Company by reason of Section 280G of the Code (or any successor provision). For purposes of the preceding sentence, Executive shall be deemed to be subject to the highest effective after-tax marginal rate of Taxes.
(b) For purposes of this Section:
(i) "After-Tax Amount" means the portion of a specified amount that would remain after payment of all Taxes and Excise Taxes paid or payable by Executive in respect of such specified amount;
(ii) "Floor Amount" means the greatest pre-tax amount of Potential Parachute Payments that could be paid to Executive without causing him to become liable for any Excise Taxes in connection therewith; and

If, after the receipt by
Refunds
 
Executive of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to Section 8.10, a determination is made that Executive shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the Company does not notify Executive in writing of its intent to contest such determination within 30 days after the Company receives written notice of such determination, then such advance shall be forgiven and shall not be required to be repaid and the amount of such advance shall offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of Gross-Up Payment required to be paid. Any contest of a denial of refund shall be controlled by Section 8.10.
9.1 .
Confidential Information
(a) Executive acknowledges that it is the policy of the Company and its Affiliates to maintain as secret and confidential all Confidential Information, and that Confidential Information has been and will be developed at substantial cost and effort to the Company and its Affiliates. Executive acknowledges that he will have access to Confidential Information with respect to the Company and its Affiliates which information is a valuable and unique asset of the Company and its Affiliates and that disclosure of such Confidential Information would cause irreparable damage to the business and operations of the Company and its Affiliates.
(b) Executive acknowledges that the Confidential Information is, as between the Company and its Affiliates and Executive, the exclusive property of the Company and its Affiliates.
(c) Both during Executive's employment by the Company (whether during or after the Contract Term) and at any time after the Termination Date, Executive:
(i) shall not, directly or indirectly, divulge, furnish or make accessible to any Person any Confidential Information (except (x) to the extent Executive reasonably and in good faith believes that such actions are related to, and required by, Executive's performance of his duties under this Agreement, or (y) as may be compelled by applicable law or administrative regulation; provided that Executive, to the extent not prohibited from doing so by applicable law or administrative regulation, shall give the Company written notice of the information to be so disclosed pursuant to clause (y) of this sentence as far in advance of its disclosure as is practicable, shall cooperate with the Company in its efforts to protect the information from disclosure, and shall limit its disclosure of such information to the minimum disclosure required by law or administrative regulation unless the Company agrees in writing to a greater level of disclosure);
(ii) shall not use for his own benefit in any manner, any Confidential Information;
(iii) shall not cause any such Confidential Information to become publicly known; and
 
(iv) shall take all reasonable steps to safeguard such Confidential Information and to protect it against disclosure, misuse, loss and theft.
(d) For purposes of this Agreement, Confidential Information represents trade secrets subject to protection under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, as adopted by the State of Illinois, or to any comparable protection afforded by applicable laws.
9.2 .
Non-Competition
(a) During the period beginning on March 10, 1998 and ending two years after the Termination Date, Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, in any capacity, engage or participate in, become employed by, serve as a director of, or render advisory or consulting or other services in connection with, any Competitive Business (as defined in Section 9.2(c)).
(b) During the period beginning on March 10, 1998 and ending two years after the Termination Date, Executive shall not at any time make any financial investment, whether in the form of equity or debt, or own any interest, directly or indirectly, in any Competitive Business. Nothing in this subsection shall, however, restrict Executive from making an investment in any Competitive Business if such investment does not (i) represent more than 1% of market value of the outstanding capital stock or debt (as applicable) of such Competitive Business, (ii) give Executive any right or ability, directly or indirectly, to control or influence the policy decisions of any Competitive Business, and (iii) create a conflict of interest between Executive's duties under this Agreement and his interest in such investment. In addition, nothing in this subsection shall restrict Executive's ability to retain any interest (including any interest in common stock held on March 10, 1998 or subsequently acquired upon exercise of options or similar rights held on March 10, 1998 or upon the conversion of convertible securities held on March 10, 1998) in New England Electric System or any of its successors received by Executive as a result of his former employment relationship with such entity.
(c) "Competitive Business" means as of any date (including during the two-year period commencing on the Termination Date) any Person (and any branch, office or operation thereof) which engages in, or proposes to engage in (i) the production, transmission, distribution, marketing or sale of electricity or (ii) any other business engaged in by the Company or its Affiliates prior to the Termination Date which represents for any calendar year during the Contract Term, or is projected by the Company (as reflected in a business plan adopted by the Company or any Affiliate thereof before the Termination Date) to yield during any year during the first three-fiscal year period commencing on or after the Termination Date, more than 5% of the gross revenue of the Company, and which is located (i) anywhere in the United States, or (ii) anywhere outside of the United States where the Company or any Affiliate thereof is then engaged in, or proposes to engage in, any of such activities.
9.3 . During the period beginning on the date hereof and ending two years after the Termination Date, Executive shall not, directly or indirectly:
Non-Solicitation
(a) other than in connection with the performance of his duties as an officer of the Company, encourage any Key Employee to terminate his or her employment;
 
(b) employ, engage as a consultant or adviser, or solicit the employment or engagement as a consultant or adviser of, any Key Employee (other than by the Company or its Affiliates), or cause any Person to do any of the foregoing;
(c) establish a business with, or encourage others to establish a business with, any Key Employee; or
(d) interfere with the relationship of the Company or any of its Affiliates with, or endeavor to entice away from, the Company or any of its Affiliates any Person who or which at any time during the period commencing one year prior to March 16, 1998 was a material customer or material supplier of, or maintained a material business relationship with, the Company or any of its Affiliates.
9.4 .
Reasonableness of Restrictive Covenants
(a) Executive acknowledges that the covenants contained in Sections 9.1, 9.2 and 9.3 are reasonable in the scope of the activities restricted, the geographic area covered by the restrictions, and the duration of the restrictions, and that such covenants are reasonably necessary to protect the Company's legitimate interests in its Confidential Information and in its relationships with employees, customers and suppliers. Executive further acknowledges such covenants are essential elements of this Agreement and that, but for such covenants, the Company would not have entered into this Agreement.
(b) The Company and Executive have each consulted with their respective legal counsel and have been advised concerning the reasonableness and propriety of such covenants. Executive acknowledges that his observance of the covenants contained in Sections 9.1, 9.2 and 9.3 will not deprive him of the ability to earn a livelihood or to support his dependents.
9.5 .
Right to Injunction; Survival of Undertakings
(a) In recognition of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information, and in recognition of the necessity of the limited restrictions imposed by Sections 9.1, 9.2 and 9.3, the parties agree that it would be impossible to measure solely in money the damages which the Company would suffer if Executive were to breach any of his obligations under such Sections. Executive acknowledges that any breach of any provision of such Sections would irreparably injure the Company. Accordingly, Executive agrees that if he breaches any of the provisions of such Sections, the Company shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedies to which the Company may be entitled under this Agreement or otherwise, to an injunction to be issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, to restrain any breach, or threatened breach, of such provisions, and Executive hereby waives any right to assert any claim or defense that the Company has an adequate remedy at law for any such breach.
(b) If a court determines that any of the covenants included in this Article IX is unenforceable in whole or in part because of such covenant's duration or geographical or other scope, such court shall have the power to reduce the duration or scope of such provision, as the case may be, so as to cause such covenant to be thereafter enforceable.
 
(c) All of the provisions of this Article IX shall survive any Termination of Employment without regard to (i) the reasons for such termination or (ii) the expiration of the Contract Term.
9.6 . During the two-year period commencing on the Termination Date, Executive shall not (a) make any written or oral statement that brings the Company or any of its Affiliates or the employees, officers or agents of the Company or any of its Affiliates into disrepute, or tarnishes any of their images or reputations or (b) publish, comment upon or disseminate any statements suggesting or accusing the Company or any of its Affiliates or any agents, employees or officers of the Company or any of its Affiliates of any misconduct or unlawful behavior. This Section shall not be deemed to be breached by testimony of Executive given in any judicial or governmental proceeding which Executive reasonably believes to be truthful at the time given or by any other action of Executive which he reasonably believes is taken in accordance with the requirements of applicable law or administrative regulation.
Non-Disparagement
10.1 . The Company may deduct or withhold from payments or other benefits otherwise payable to Executive pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement any amounts that are required by applicable law.
Required Withholding
10.2 . In the event of any Termination of Employment or any breach of this Agreement by the Company, Executive's exclusive remedies shall be as specified in Article VII (or Article VIII, if applicable) or to enforce any other undertaking of the Company expressly provided in this Agreement; provided that nothing herein shall guarantee Executive continued employment for any specific period nor deny Executive the right to seek a final judicial determination (or, if Executive reasonably determines, based upon the advice of counsel, that it is more likely than not that each of the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois and the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois will decline to adjudicate the issue, a final decree in an arbitration proceeding conducted in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association, with such arbitration proceeding to be conducted in Chicago, Illinois before a panel of three arbitrators) that any Termination of Employment purportedly made for Cause was, in fact, made not in good faith or was made without adherence to the requirements or procedures set forth in this Agreement. If Executive obtains such a final judicial or arbitral determination, as applicable, the Termination of Employment shall be treated as a Termination Without Cause for all purposes of this Agreement.
Remedies

Assignment; Successors
10.4 .

Beneficiary
 
10.5 . Benefits payable under this Agreement shall not be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, charge, garnishment, execution or levy of any kind, either voluntary or involuntary, prior to actually being received by Executive, and any such attempt to dispose of any right to benefits payable hereunder shall be void.
Nonalienation of Benefits
10.6 . If all or any part of this Agreement is declared by any court or governmental authority to be unlawful or invalid, such unlawfulness or invalidity shall not serve to invalidate any portion of this Agreement not declared to be unlawful or invalid. Any paragraph or part of a paragraph so declared to be unlawful or invalid shall, if possible, be construed in a manner which will give effect to the terms of such paragraph or part of a paragraph to the fullest extent possible while remaining lawful and valid.
Severability
10.7 . This Agreement shall not be amended or modified except by a written agreement between the Company and Executive. A waiver of any term, covenant or condition contained in this Agreement shall not result in a waiver of any other term, covenant or condition, and any waiver of any default shall not result in a waiver of any later default.
Amendment; Waiver
10.8 . All notices hereunder shall be in writing, delivered by hand, nationally-recognized courier service that guarantees overnight delivery or by certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, and addressed as follows:

in each case the consent of the other parties hereto, which consent shall not be withheld or delayed where such release, announcement or disclosure shall be required by applicable law or administrative regulation.
10.10 . Nothing in this Agreement, including Sections 9.1, 9.6 or 10.9, shall be construed to prohibit Executive from communicating with, including testifying in any administrative proceeding before, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or the United States Department of Labor, or from otherwise addressing issues related to nuclear safety with any party or taking any other action protected under Section 211 of the Energy Reorganization Act.
Communications
10.11 . The Company shall pay to Executive all reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by Executive in disputing in good faith any termination of his employment hereunder or in seeking in good faith to obtain or enforce any benefit or right under this Agreement, provided that Executive shall have a reasonable basis for his position.
Legal Expenses
10.12 . Except where otherwise indicated by the context, any reference to an "Article" or "Section" shall be to an Article or Section of this Agreement.
Articles and Sections
10.13 . This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.
Counterparts
10.14 . This Agreement shall be binding immediately upon its execution and shall become effective immediately without further action of the Company or Executive. This Agreement forms the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to its subject matter, and shall supersede all prior agreements, promises and representations of the parties regarding employment or severance, whether in writing or otherwise, including but not limited to the Prior Agreement.
Effectiveness; Entire Agreement
10.15 .
Applicable Law; Avoidance of Section 409A Penalty
(a) This Agreement shall be interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois, without regard to its choice of law principles, and the applicable provisions of the Code.
(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in the event of a payment to be made, or a benefit to be provided, pursuant to this Agreement based upon Executive's "separation from service" (as defined herein) for a reason other than death at a time when the Executive is a Specified Employee and such payment or provision of such benefit is not exempt or otherwise permitted under Section 409A of the Code without the imposition of any Section 409A Penalty, such payment shall not be made, and such benefit shall not be provided, before the earlier of the date which is six (6) months and one day after the Executive's separation from service or 30 days after the Executive's death. All payments or benefits delayed pursuant to this Section shall be aggregated into one lump sum payment to be made as of the Company's first business day following the first day of the seventh month after Executive's separation from service (or if earlier, as of 30 days after Executive's death). For purposes of this Section, "separation from service" shall have the meaning provided under Section 409A of the Code and the related Treasury Regulations.
 
(c) This Agreement is intended not to result in the imposition of any Section 409A Penalty and shall be administered, interpreted and construed in a manner consistent with such intent.
(d) Executive and the Company agree to cooperate to amend the Agreement from time to time as appropriate to avoid the imposition of any Section 409A Penalty.
(e) In no event shall the Company be required to provide a tax gross-up payment to Executive with respect to any Section 409A Penalty.
10.16 . All of Executive's rights hereunder, including his rights to compensation and benefits prior to the Termination Date, his right to severance and other benefits subject to the terms and conditions of Article VII and VIII after the Termination Date, and his obligations under Article IX hereof, shall survive a Termination of Employment and the termination of this Agreement.

Withholding Taxes
(b) The Holder may, with the consent of the Company, elect to satisfy his or her obligation to advance the Required Tax Payments by any of the following means: (1) a cash payment to the Company pursuant to Section 5.3(a), (2) delivery (either actual delivery or by attestation procedures established by the Company) to the Company of previously owned whole shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value, determined as of the date the obligation to withhold or pay taxes first arises in connection with the Award (the "Tax Date"), equal to the Required Tax Payments, (3) authorizing the Company to withhold from the shares of Common Stock otherwise to be delivered to the Holder pursuant to the Award, a number of whole shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value, determined as of the Tax Date, equal to the Required Tax Payments, (4) a cash payment by a broker-dealer acceptable to the Company through whom the Holder has sold the shares with respect to which the Required Tax Payments have arisen or (5) any combination of (1), (2) and (3). The Committee shall have sole discretion to disapprove of an election pursuant to any of clauses (2)-(5). Shares of Common Stock to be delivered or withheld may not have a Fair Market Value in excess of the minimum amount of the
 
Required Tax Payments. Any fraction of a share of Common Stock which would be required to satisfy such an obligation shall be disregarded and the remaining amount due shall be paid in cash by the Holder. No certificate representing a share of Common Stock shall be delivered until the Required Tax Payments have been satisfied in full.
5.4. . In the event of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, combination, exchange of shares, liquidation, spin-off or other similar change in capitalization or event, or any distribution to holders of Common Stock other than a regular cash dividend, the number and class of securities subject to the Award shall be appropriately adjusted by the Committee. The decision of the Committee regarding any such adjustment shall be final, binding and conclusive.
Adjustment
5.5. . The Award is subject to the condition that if the listing, registration or qualification of the shares subject to the Award upon any securities exchange or under any law, or the consent or approval of any governmental body, or the taking of any other action is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the vesting or delivery of shares hereunder, the shares of Common Stock subject to the Award shall not vest or be delivered, in whole or in part, unless such listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval shall have been effected or obtained, free of any conditions not acceptable to the Company. The Company agrees to use reasonable efforts to effect or obtain any such listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval.
Compliance with Applicable Law
5.6. . Subject to Section 5.3, as soon as practicable after the vesting of the Award, in whole or in part, the Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered one or more certificates (or book entries) issued in the Holder's name representing the number of vested shares. The Company shall pay all original issue or transfer taxes and all fees and expenses incident to such delivery, except as otherwise provided in Section 5.3.
Delivery of Certificates
5.7. . In no event shall the granting of the Award or its acceptance by the Holder give or be deemed to give the Holder any right to continued employment by the Company or any affiliate of the Company.
Award Confers No Rights to Continued Employment
