Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On October 16, 2008, Exelon Corporation (Exelon), Exelon Generation Company, LLC (Generation), Commonwealth Edison Company (ComEd) and PECO Energy Company (PECO)(collectively, the Registrants) executed amendments to each of their respective revolving credit facilities (the Amendments), as described below. The Registrants have entered into these amendments in conjunction with the termination of Lehman Brothers Bank's participation in their respective revolving credit facilities in September 2008.
The Amendments permit the applicable borrower, at its option, provided that certain conditions are satisfied, to terminate the commitment of a lender that, under its revolving credit facility, (a) has not made available its ratable portion of a requested borrowing or provided reimbursement for its pro rata share of funding under a letter of credit issued pursuant to the applicable revolving credit facility; (b) has notified the borrower or the administrative agent that it does not intend to comply with its obligations under the applicable credit facility; (c) has been downgraded to a non-investment grade rating from Moody's Investors Service, Inc., Standard & Poor's Ratings Services or another nationally-recognized rating agency or (d) is, or is a subsidiary of a person that is, the subject of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding. The Amendments also allow the borrower to replace a defaulting lender or a lender that has been downgraded or that is, or is a subsidiary of a person that is, the subject of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding, and if the lender is not replaced, the aggregate commitment under the applicable revolving credit facility will be reduced.
The description of the Amendments set forth above is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the credit facilities, copies of which are attached as exhibits 99.1, 99.2, 99.3 and 99.4, respectively, which are incorporated herein by reference.
The disclosure set forth in Item 8.01 below is incorporated by reference in this Item 1.01.
Section 8  Other Events
Item 8.01. Other Events
Following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., Exelon, Generation, ComEd, and PECO were each notified by Lehman Brothers Bank that it would not fund its commitments under their respective revolving credit facilities. Pursuant to the Amendments, the commitment of Lehman Brothers Bank under each borrower's revolving credit facility has been terminated by the borrowers effective September 30, 2008. Prior to termination, Lehman Brothers Bank's total commitment within these credit facilities was $283 million, of which Exelon, Generation, ComEd, and PECO had $43 million, $166 million, $48 million, and $26 million, respectively.
