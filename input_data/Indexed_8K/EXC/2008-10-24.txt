EXHIBIT 99.1
 
(October 24, 2008)  Exelon Corporation's (Exelon) third quarter 2008 consolidated earnings prepared in accordance with GAAP were $700 million, or $1.06 per diluted share, compared with earnings of $780 million, or $1.15 per share, in the third quarter of 2007.
CHICAGO
Exelon's adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the third quarter of 2008 were $706 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, compared with $823 million, or $1.21 per diluted share, for the same period in 2007.
"Our third quarter earnings reflected certain unusual events, including several related to the nation's economic turmoil. The results also demonstrate, however, the underlying strength of the operating performance at Generation. We expect to be well within our original 2008 earnings guidance range, but due to the effects of these unfavorable items, such as weather and macro economic factors, we expect our full-year 2008 results to be near the bottom of the $4.15 to 4.30 per share range that we announced on September 4th," said John W. Rowe, Exelon's chairman and CEO. "We continue to be well positioned  our operations are stronger than ever and our financial fundamentals remain sound, with a strong balance sheet, positive cash flows and sufficient access to liquidity."
The decreased level of third quarter 2008 earnings was primarily due to:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The decreased level of third quarter 2008 earnings was partially offset by:
 
 
 
 
Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the third quarter of 2008 do not include the following (after-tax) items that were included in reported GAAP earnings:
 
 
 
 
Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the third quarter of 2007 did not include the following (after-tax) items that were included in reported GAAP earnings:
 
 
 
2008 Earnings Outlook
Exelon expects its full-year adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for 2008 to be near the bottom of its guidance range of $4.15 to $4.30 per share. The following table indicates estimated ranges by operating company contribution to 2008 adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings per Exelon share, excluding Exelon holding company.
 
The outlook for 2008 adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for Exelon and its subsidiaries excludes the following items:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Giving consideration to these factors, Exelon estimates GAAP earnings in 2008 will likely be in the range of $3.90 to $4.30 per share, excluding any costs associated with the proposed offer to acquire NRG. Both Exelon's operating earnings and GAAP earnings guidance are based on the assumption of normal weather for the remainder of the year.
Third Quarter and Recent Highlights
 
 
 
Also as part of its value return policy, Exelon uses share repurchases from time to time to return cash or balance sheet capacity to Exelon shareholders after funding maintenance capital and other commitments and in the absence of higher value-added growth opportunities. On September 2, 2008, Exelon's board of directors approved a share repurchase program for up to $1.5 billion of Exelon's outstanding common stock. Exelon has now determined to defer indefinitely any share repurchases. This decision was made in light of a variety of factors, including: developments in recent weeks affecting the world economy and commodity markets, including those for electricity and gas; the continued uncertainty in capital and credit markets and the potential impact of those events on Exelon's future cash needs.
 
As of October 20, 2008, Exelon had $7.3 billion of aggregate bank commitments with a diverse group of 24 banks, excluding commitments previously made by Lehman Brothers Bank. No single bank has more than 10 percent of the aggregate outstanding commitments at Exelon, and these commitments extend largely through 2012. As of October 20, 2008, Exelon had utilized only approximately $500 million of its capacity under its facilities, leaving $6.8 billion of the total $7.3 billion of capacity available to Exelon. In addition, Exelon had a total of $35 million of commercial paper outstanding.
 
 
 
 
 
The ICC order required ComEd to expense $37 million (pre-tax) for the disallowance of certain plant costs, partially offset by a benefit associated with recovery of certain previously incurred costs amounting to $13 million (pre-tax). A net decrease in operating income of $24 million (pre-tax) was recorded in the third quarter of 2008.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Exelon is committed that its proposed transaction with NRG will not cause Exelon or its subsidiaries to go below investment grade for senior unsecured debt. The offer for NRG is the culmination of a long-term strategic review process by Exelon, and Exelon believes the combination will create superior long-term value for its stakeholders.
Exelon is fully committed to utilize excess cash flow to reduce debt following the closing of the proposed NRG transaction and return to the ratings in effect prior to the S&P downgrade on October 21. Exelon will continue to work closely with S&P and the other rating agencies to make sure they understand Exelon's plan for paying down the debt Exelon will take onto its balance sheet at completion of the proposed acquisition of NRG, including the pay-down schedule, expected synergies, and overall plan to integrate and manage NRG's assets.
On September 11, 2008, S&P upgraded ComEd's corporate credit rating to "BBB-" from "BB", its senior secured rating to "BBB+" from "BBB" and its commercial paper rating to "A-3" from "B". ComEd's senior unsecured rating of "BBB-" remains unchanged. According to an S&P research report, "The rating action is based on Standard & Poor's opinion that the Illinois regulatory and political environments have returned to a credit supportive level."
On October 3, 2008, Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) upgraded the long-term unsecured rating of ComEd to "Baa3" from "Ba1" and the commercial paper rating to "Prime-3" from "Not Prime". ComEd's senior secured rating of "Baa2" remains unchanged, and ComEd's rating outlook is stable. A Moody's press release indicated that "the upgrade largely reflects our assessment of the distribution rate case decision" and "also factors in the improved financial flexibility that exists at ComEd as the first mortgage collateral, which had previously secured the company's $1 billion revolving credit facility was released and replaced by a similar sized unsecured revolving credit facility."

ComEd's total retail kWh deliveries decreased by 4.2 percent in 2008 as compared with 2007, with a 9.8 percent decrease in deliveries to the residential customer class, largely due to unfavorable weather. For ComEd, weather had an unfavorable after-tax impact of $17 million on third quarter 2008 earnings relative to 2007 and an unfavorable after-tax impact of $7 million relative to normal weather that was incorporated in earnings guidance. ComEd's third quarter 2008 revenues of $1,729 million declined slightly from $1,758 million in 2007.

Third quarter 2008 revenues were $1,441 million, down slightly from $1,459 million in 2007, primarily due to a 1.7% decrease in total retail kWh deliveries driven by the effects of unfavorable weather compared with 2007 and a reduction in PECO's distribution rates made to refund a 2007 Pennsylvania Public Utility Realty Tax Act tax settlement to customers. For PECO, weather had an unfavorable after-tax impact of $14 million on third quarter 2008 earnings relative to 2007 and an unfavorable after-tax impact of $9 million relative to normal weather that was incorporated in earnings guidance.
The number of electric customers being served in the PECO region increased by 0.9 percent over the third quarter of 2007. Weather-normalized retail kWh deliveries increased by 0.8 percent from the third quarter of 2007, primarily reflecting an increase in residential volume sales.
