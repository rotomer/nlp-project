Exhibit 99.1
 
(January 22, 2009)  Exelon Corporation's (Exelon) fourth quarter 2008 consolidated earnings prepared in accordance with GAAP were $707 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, compared with earnings of $562 million, or $0.84 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2007. Full year 2008 consolidated earnings prepared in accordance with GAAP were $2,737 million, or $4.13 per diluted share, compared with $2,736 million, or $4.05 per diluted share in 2007.
CHICAGO
Exelon's adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2008 were $709 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, compared with $677 million, or $1.02 per diluted share, for the same period in 2007. Full year 2008 adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings were $2,781 million, or $4.20 per diluted share, down slightly from 2007 adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings of $2,923 million, or $4.32 per diluted share.
"Our full year 2008 earnings results were well within our original guidance range of $4.00 to $4.40 per share and the $4.15 to $4.30 per share range that we announced in early September. Despite the impact of the deteriorating economy, we achieved our 2008 goals of operating excellence in generation and delivery, setting the industry standard for our low-carbon platform, and evaluating and pursuing appropriate growth opportunities," said John W. Rowe, Exelon's chairman and CEO. "We expect 2009 to be a year of many challenges, but we will work to mitigate the impact and are reaffirming our operating earnings guidance range of $4.00 to $4.30 per share."
Fourth Quarter Operating Results
The increase in fourth quarter 2008 earnings to $1.07 per share from $1.02 per share in fourth quarter 2007 was primarily due to:
 
 
 
 
 
Higher fourth quarter 2008 earnings were partially offset by:

Fourth Quarter and Recent Highlights
 
On December 18, 2008, Exelon filed an application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for approval of Exelon's proposed acquisition of NRG, as required by
 
Section 203 of the Federal Power Act. On December 29, 2008, the FERC entered an order setting February 17, 2009 as the last date to comment on Exelon's application to acquire NRG. On December 17, 2008, Exelon filed notification with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission of its intention to acquire NRG, in compliance with the pre-merger notification requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. On January 16, 2009, the Antitrust Division of the DOJ issued a request for additional information.
Exelon previously disclosed that a combined Exelon-NRG would need to divest some generating capacity in Texas and PJM East to protect and enhance competitive markets and mitigate any potential market concentration. As part of its FERC filing, Exelon proposed to divest its three facilities in Texas  Mountain Creek, Handley and LaPorte  totaling approximately 2,400 MW of capacity, and to transfer to a third party Exelon's power purchase agreements in Texas totaling approximately 1,200 MW of capacity. In addition, the combined company would divest approximately 1,000 MW of generating capacity in the PJM East market, specifically the Indian River, Vienna and Dover plants currently owned by NRG. The proposed divestitures are contingent on the completion of the proposed acquisition of NRG, and would not take place immediately.
On December 22, 2008, Exelon submitted applications with the states of California and New York for approval of the NRG transaction. On December 26, 2008, the Chief Administrative Law Judge for the California Public Utilities Commission returned the application for procedural reasons only. Exelon will refile the application at the appropriate time.
On January 5, 2009, Exelon filed an application with the Public Utility Commission of Texas. Exelon will submit its filings to the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission and to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission within the next few weeks. Exelon expects to complete the regulatory approval process in 6 to 9 months.
On January 19, 2009, John Rowe and William Von Hoene, executive vice president and general counsel for Exelon, and David Crane, president and CEO for NRG, and Drew Murphy, executive vice president and general counsel for NRG, met in Washington, D.C. During that meeting, Mr. Rowe expressed his view that the exchange ratio initially proposed by Exelon represented a full and fair price for NRG shareholders, with a substantial premium and upside opportunity, and stated that Exelon would not increase its offer without an opportunity to conduct due diligence designed to verify assumed values and identify additional value. Mr. Crane expressed his view that due diligence would not move the price very much and was not willing to allow Exelon to engage in due diligence. Mr. Rowe agreed that a price movement, if any, as a result of due diligence would be small. Mr. Crane said that NRG was focused on "market discovery" regarding options for NRG as a result of interest expressed by other companies. The meeting ended without any agreement or arrangement concerning further discussions, due diligence or other exchange of information. Exelon remains committed to its proposed acquisition of NRG and will continue to pursue its efforts to engage NRG in a constructive dialog.
 
 
2008 and 2007, and the number of outage days totaled 80 and 91, respectively. Higher total nuclear output also was driven by a lower number of non-refueling outage days at the Exelon-operated plants, which totaled 22 days in the fourth quarter of 2008 versus 27 days in the fourth quarter of 2007. Additionally, Salem Unit 1 completed a scheduled refueling in the fourth quarter of 2008, which had a slightly offsetting impact on total output.
For the full year 2008, the Exelon-operated nuclear plants achieved an average capacity factor of 93.9 percent, slightly less than the all-time record 94.5 percent for 2007 due to two additional planned refueling outages in 2008 as compared with 2007. The average annual capacity factor for the Exelon-operated plants during the past five years has been 93.5 percent or more.
 
 
 
 
 
As of January 16, 2009, Exelon had $7.3 billion of aggregate bank commitments with a diverse group of 23 banks. No single bank has more than 10 percent of the aggregate outstanding commitments at Exelon, and these commitments extend largely through 2012. As of January 16, 2009, Exelon had utilized only approximately $400 million of its capacity under its facilities, leaving $6.9 billion of the total $7.3 billion of capacity available to Exelon. In addition, Exelon had a total of $140 million of commercial paper outstanding.
 
On October 21, 2008, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (S&P) lowered its corporate credit rating on Exelon Corp., Generation and PECO to "BBB" from "BBB+". S&P lowered the senior unsecured ratings of Exelon Corp. to "BBB-" from "BBB" and of Generation to "BBB" from "BBB+". The senior secured rating of PECO was lowered to "A-" from "A". In addition, the ratings of Exelon Corp. and all of its subsidiaries, including ComEd, were placed on CreditWatch with negative implications. S&P indicated concerns about Exelon's potential credit position related to the proposed offer to acquire NRG. The short-term commercial paper ratings of Exelon Corp. and all of its subsidiaries were affirmed by S&P.
On October 21, 2008, Fitch Ratings, Ltd. placed Exelon and Generation on Rating Watch Negative following the announcement of the proposed offer for NRG.
On November 12, 2008, Moody's placed the ratings of Exelon, Generation and PECO under review for possible downgrade. In addition, S&P placed the short-term ratings of Exelon, Generation and PECO on CreditWatch with negative implications. These actions were taken after Exelon commenced the exchange offer for NRG's shares.

ComEd's fourth quarter 2008 revenues of $1,542 million rose from $1,436 million in 2007, primarily reflecting the increased distribution rates.
The number of residential customers being served in the ComEd region increased by 0.1 percent over the fourth quarter of 2007.

Retail gas deliveries were up 7 percent from the fourth quarter of 2007. Fourth quarter 2008 revenues were $1,372 million, down from $1,385 million in 2007, primarily due to a 2.4 percent decrease in total retail kWh deliveries driven by the effects of unfavorable weather for cooling in October 2008. For PECO, weather had an unfavorable after-tax impact of $5 million on fourth quarter 2008 earnings relative to 2007 and a favorable after-tax impact of $1 million relative to normal weather that was incorporated in earnings guidance.
The number of residential electric customers being served in the PECO region increased by 0.5 percent over the fourth quarter of 2007.
