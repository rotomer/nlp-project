Item 8.01 Other Events.
Denis P. O'Brien, Executive Vice President of Exelon Corporation (Exelon) and President and CEO of PECO Energy Company, and Ian P. McLean, Executive Vice President, Finance and Markets, of Exelon Corporation, have each established a structured, prearranged stock trading plan to exercise stock options and sell the acquired shares in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Mr. O'Brien's trading plan covers the exercise of two grants of vested stock options for an aggregate of 17,000 shares that were granted to Mr. O'Brien in 2000 and expire in 2010. These options are expected to be exercised between November 2009 and May 2010 if they are not exercised during the term of his current stock trading plan. Mr. McLean's trading plan covers the exercise of vested stock options for 56,000 shares that were granted to him in 2000 and expire in 2010. These options are expected to be exercised between August 2009 and August 2010. The stock trading plans are being established to enable the officers to diversify a portion of their holdings in excess of their stock ownership requirement and to enable them to exercise the options before they expire. The plans will allow them to do so in an orderly manner as part of their estate and tax planning activities.
Exelon's stock ownership guidelines require officers to own the lesser of either a fixed number of shares or share equivalents (excluding stock options) or a variable number of shares based on a multiple of three times their base salary, calculated annually. Mr. O'Brien holds stock and stock equivalents (excluding options) amounting to about 319% of this guideline. Mr. O'Brien owns over 27,000 shares. Mr. O'Brien also owns over 19,800 performance shares and over 8,800 shares or share equivalents deferred until he retires. Mr. O'Brien holds options to acquire 180,000 shares in addition to the options that are included in his stock trading plan. Mr. McLean holds stock and stock equivalents (excluding options) amounting to about 363% of this guideline. Mr. McLean owns over 48,000 shares, including 1,275 shares held by his children living at home. Mr. McLean also owns over 26,500 performance shares and over 5,750 shares or share equivalents deferred until he retires. Mr. McLean holds options to acquire 440,000 shares in addition to the options that are included in his stock trading plan and 10,000 shares of restricted stock
Since February 2005, a dozen of Exelon's senior officers have also entered into one or more similar pre-arranged stock trading plans to sell a limited number of shares of Exelon common stock in order to diversify their assets. Under Exelon's stock ownership guidelines, the chairman, president and chief executive officer should own a fixed number of shares of Exelon stock or stock equivalents (excluding stock options) based on a multiple of five times their base salary, executive vice presidents should own a fixed number of shares of Exelon stock or stock equivalents (excluding stock options) based on a multiple of three times their base salary, and senior vice presidents should own a fixed number of shares based on a multiple of two times their base salary. Each of the senior officers who entered into a stock trading plan held stock and stock equivalents (excluding options) exceeding the applicable stock ownership guideline, and each of those officers will continue to meet the applicable stock ownership guideline after the completion of the sales contemplated by the stock trading plans.
