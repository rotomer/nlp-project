Section 8  Other Events
Item 8.01. Other Events.
On February 20, 2009, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled in Exelon Corporation's (Exelon) favor in a case involving refund claims for Illinois investment tax credits. Consequently, Exelon recorded approximately $42 million (after-tax) of income in results of operations in the first quarter of 2009 to reflect the refund claims for investment tax credits and associated interest for the years 1995  2008. Of the $42 million, $35 million and $8 million were recorded at Commonwealth Edison Company (ComEd) and Exelon Generation Company, LLC (Generation), respectively.
Responding to the Illinois Attorney General's petition for rehearing, on July 15, 2009, the Illinois Supreme Court changed its opinion to indicate that it was to be applied only prospectively, beginning in 2009. As a result, Exelon is no longer entitled to the claimed refunds. Exelon is evaluating its options; however, unless the Supreme Court changes its position again, Exelon, Generation and ComEd will record a charge to third quarter results of operations to reverse the income previously recognized. This charge will be included in operating earnings.
This development does not affect Exelon's 2009 earnings guidance.
