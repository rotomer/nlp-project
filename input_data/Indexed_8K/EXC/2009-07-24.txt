EXHIBIT 99.1
 
(July 24, 2009)  Exelon Corporation (NYSE: EXC) today announced that its second quarter 2009 consolidated earnings prepared in accordance with GAAP were $657 million, or $0.99 per diluted share, compared with earnings of $748 million, or $1.13 per share, in the second quarter of 2008.
CHICAGO
Exelon's adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the second quarter of 2009 were $683 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, compared with $746 million, or $1.13 per diluted share, for the same period in 2008.
"We delivered very good earnings in the second quarter despite the weak economy and lower demand," said John W. Rowe, Exelon's chairman and CEO. "Not only did we continue to operate extremely well, but Exelon again showed its ability to deliver on its commitments by reducing expenses and setting additional cost reduction targets for 2010. Our performance allows me to reaffirm our full year operating earnings guidance range of $4.00 to $4.30 per share."
The decrease in second quarter 2009 adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings to $1.03 per share from $1.13 per share in second quarter 2008 was primarily due to:
 
 
 
 
 
Lower second quarter 2009 earnings were partially offset by:
 
 
 
Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the second quarter of 2009 do not include the following items (after-tax) that were included in reported GAAP earnings:

2009 Earnings Outlook
Exelon reaffirmed its guidance range for 2009 adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings of $4.00 to $4.30 per share. Exelon expects adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the third quarter of 2009 to be in the range of $0.90 to $1.00 per share. Operating earnings guidance is based on the assumption of normal weather for the remainder of the year.
 
The outlook for 2009 adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for Exelon and its subsidiaries excludes the following items:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Second Quarter and Recent Highlights
 
 
Exelon has relied on greening its operations to achieve the bulk of its emissions reductions to date. It also has announced plans to offer substantial new low-carbon electricity in the marketplace by raising the output of Exelon nuclear plants and investing in new renewable energy projects. Going forward, the company will increase its investment in customer initiatives to continue progress toward its 2020 goal. ComEd and PECO will spend more than $350 million through 2011 on energy efficiency and demand response programs that will help residential and business customers reduce their energy consumption by more than 1.6 million megawatt-hours (MWhs) and reduce peak load by 226 megawatts (MWs).
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During 2009 and 2010, PECO will conduct four procurements for the residential class and for full requirements fixed price products and block products for electric generation supply commencing in 2011. During 2009 and 2010, PECO will also conduct three procurements for the small commercial and medium commercial classes for full requirements fixed price products and one procurement for full requirements spot price products. For the large commercial and industrial class, PECO will conduct one procurement for full requirements fixed price products and one procurement for full requirements spot price products.
On June 17, 2009, the PAPUC approved the results of PECO's first competitive procurement RFP. The June 2009 electric generation procurements were for service to the residential class and included full requirements fixed price contracts for 17-month and 29-month periods beginning January 1, 2011, and block contracts to procure electric generation for the 12-month period beginning January 1, 2011. On July 15, 2009, PECO announced the results of the first competitive procurements, which accounted for approximately 21 percent of the electricity needed for PECO's residential customers. The purchases resulted in a price of 10.1 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh), indicating a 9 percent energy price increase for an average residential customer beginning in 2011. PECO's next residential purchase and initial generation supply purchases for the small and medium commercial classes will take place in September 2009.
 
On July 21, 2009, Fitch Ratings, Ltd. removed Exelon Corp. and Generation from Ratings Watch Negative. The ratings for Exelon and Generation were affirmed and each entity was assigned a Stable Ratings Outlook.
On July 22, 2009, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (S&P) affirmed its corporate credit rating on Exelon Corp., Generation and PECO of "BBB" and removed their ratings from CreditWatch with negative implications. In addition, S&P raised the corporate credit rating of ComEd to "BBB" from "BBB-", raised its debt and preferred stock ratings and removed its ratings from CreditWatch with negative implications. An S&P research report cited "improvement in both ComEd's business risk profile and its financial measures". The outlook for ratings of all the Exelon entities is stable.
On July 23, 2009, Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) confirmed the ratings of Exelon Corp. and Generation and assigned a stable outlook. Moody's also confirmed the long-term debt rating of PECO but downgraded its short-term rating to "P-2" from "P-1" and changed the outlook on PECO's long-term debt to negative.

Weather-normalized retail kWh deliveries decreased by 2.6 percent from the second quarter of 2008, primarily reflecting decreased residential and large commercial and industrial deliveries.
