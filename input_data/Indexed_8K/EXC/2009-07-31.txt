Section 2.
The certificates for each class or series of stock shall be numbered and issued in consecutive order and a record shall be kept of the name and address of the person to whom each certificate is issued, the number of shares represented by the certificate and the number and date of the certificate.

Section 3.
For the purpose of determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders, or stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend, or in order to make a determination of stockholders for any other proper purpose, the Board of Directors may fix in advance a date as the record date for any such determination for stockholders, such date in any case to be not more than sixty days and, for a meeting of stockholders, not less than ten days, or in the case of a merger, consolidation, share exchange, dissolution or sale, lease or exchange of assets, not less than twenty days, immediately preceding such meeting.

If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares of stock represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on a matter shall be the act of the stockholders, unless the vote of a greater number or voting by classes is required by law or the articles of incorporation.
Section 4.
At every meeting of the stockholders, each outstanding share of stock shall be entitled to one vote on each matter submitted for a vote. In all elections for Directors, every stockholder shall have the right to vote the number of shares owned by such stockholder for as many persons as there are Directors to be elected, or to cumulate such votes and give one candidate as many votes as shall equal the number of Directors to be elected multiplied by the number of such shares or to distribute such cumulative votes in any proportion among any number of candidates.

A stockholder may appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise act for him or her in any manner authorized by Illinois Business Corporation Act of 1983, as amended from time to time.

Section 3.
Every Director of the Company, or member of any committee designated by the Board of Directors pursuant to authority conferred by these By-Laws, shall, in the performance of his or her duties, be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the records of the Company and upon such information, opinions, reports or statements presented to the Company by any of the Company's officers or employees, or committees of the Board of Directors, or by any other person as to matters the Director or member reasonably believes are within such other person's professional or expert competence and who has been selected with reasonable care by or on behalf of the Company.
Section 4.
A transaction between the Company and one or more of its Directors, or between the Company and an entity in which one or more of its Directors have a material financial interest or of which the Director or Directors are officers, directors or general partners, shall not be invalidated solely for that reason, or solely because the Director or Directors are present at or participate in the meeting of the Board that authorizes the transaction, or solely because his, her or their votes are counted for that purpose, if the transaction is fair to the Company at the time is authorized, approved or ratified and:
Section 5.
(1) the material facts of the transaction and the Director's interest or relationship are disclosed or known to the Board or a committee of the Board and the Board or such committee authorizes, approves or ratifies the transaction by the affirmative votes of a majority of the disinterested Directors, even though the disinterested Directors are less than a quorum; or

Directors to serve on such committees and confer such powers upon such committees and revoke such powers and terminate the existence of such committees, as the Board at its pleasure may determine, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8.40(c) of the Illinois Business Corporation Act of 1983, as amended from time to time.
Meetings of any committee of the Board may be called at any time by the Chairman, by any three Directors or by the chairman of the committee the meeting of which is being called and shall be held at such place as shall be designated in the notice of such meeting.

Such indemnification shall be available to any past, present or future Director or officer of the Company, and any past, present or future director, officer, employee or agent of such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, and shall apply to actions, suits, proceedings or claims arising out of or based upon events occurring prior to, on or after the date of original adoption of this by-law.
Section 4.
The right to indemnification conferred in this Section shall include the right to be paid by the Company the expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (an "advancement of expenses"); provided, however, that, if the Illinois Business Corporation Act of 1983, as amended from time to time, so requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as a director or officer shall be made only upon delivery to the Company of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Section or otherwise. The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in this Section shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee's heirs, executors and administrators. Any repeal, amendment or modification hereof shall be prospective only and shall not affect any rights or obligations then existing. Each person who shall act as an indemnitee of the Company shall be deemed to be doing so in reliance upon the rights provided by this Section.
 
These by-laws may be altered, amended or repealed by the stockholders or the Board of Directors.
