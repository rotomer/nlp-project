Offers to Purchase Notes Due in 2011
On September 16, 2009, Exelon Corporation (Exelon) announced the commencement of a cash tender offer for any and all of its outstanding $500,000,000 6.75% Senior Notes due May 1, 2011. Simultaneously, Exelon Generation Company, LLC (Generation) announced the commencement of a cash tender offer for any and all of its outstanding $699,975,000 6.95% Notes due June 15, 2011.
A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
Sale of Senior Notes
On September 16, 2009, Generation announced that it has agreed to sell $600 million of Senior Notes maturing on October 1, 2019, with a coupon of 5.20% and $900 million of Senior Notes maturing on October 1, 2039, with a coupon of 6.25%. The sale of the Senior Notes is expected to close on September 23, 2009.
A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
Generation intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of its Senior Notes to (1) finance Generation's purchase of its 6.95% Senior Notes due June 15, 2011 tendered pursuant to Generation's cash offer to purchase those notes and (2) for other general corporate purposes, including a distribution of approximately $550 million to Exelon to fund a portion of Exelon's purchase of its 6.75% Senior Notes due May 1, 2011 tendered pursuant to Exelon's cash offer to purchase those notes. The sale of the Senior Notes and the retirement of Exelon and Generation Senior Notes due 2011 are intended to capitalize on favorable financing conditions and mitigate refinancing risk in 2011. As a result of the Exelon and Generation tender offers, Exelon expects to record approximately $75 million after-tax, or $0.11 per diluted share, of non-recurring debt redemption costs in the third quarter of 2009, of which Generation will record a portion of the total charge. The aforementioned costs will be excluded from 2009 adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings.
