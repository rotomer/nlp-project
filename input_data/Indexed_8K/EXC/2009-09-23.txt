On September 23, 2009, Exelon Generation Company, LLC (Generation) issued and sold $1,500,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of senior notes (Senior Notes). See Item 2.03 below for a description of those senior notes and related agreements.
Section 2  Financial Information
 
On September 23, 2009, Generation issued and sold $1,500,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes. The Senior Notes were issued under an indenture, dated as of September 28, 2007 (Indenture), between Generation and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. Reference is made to the terms of the indenture filed as Exhibit 4.3.
The proceeds of the Senior Notes will be used after deducting underwriters' discounts and commissions and other estimated fees and expenses, to (1) finance Generation's purchase of its 6.95% Senior Notes due June 15, 2011 tendered pursuant to Generation's cash offer to purchase those notes and (2) for other general corporate purposes, including a distribution of approximately $550 million to Exelon Corporation (Exelon) to fund a portion of Exelon's purchase of its 6.75% Senior Notes due May 1, 2011 tendered pursuant to Exelon's cash offer to purchase those notes.
The Senior Notes were issued and sold in the following amounts and in the following two series and bear interest at the following interest rates, respectively:
$600,000,000 5.20% Senior Notes due 2019, and
$900,000,000 6.25% Senior Notes due 2039.
Interest will accrue on the Senior Notes from September 23, 2009 or from the most recent interest payment date to which interest has been paid or provided for. Interest is payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1, beginning April 1, 2009.
The Senior Notes are redeemable at any time at Generation's option at a redemption price equal to the greater of:
 
 
plus accrued interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the redemption date.
Redemption of the Senior Notes of one series may be made without the redemption of the Senior Notes of any other series.
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security or securities selected by an Independent Investment Banker (as defined below) as having an actual or interpolated maturity comparable to the remaining term of the series of the Senior Notes being redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the such notes.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption date, (1) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations (as defined below) for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the trustee obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
"Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers (as defined below) appointed by the trustee after consultation with Generation.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of Barclays Capital Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, and two other primary U.S. Government securities dealers in The City of New York (Primary Treasury Dealer) selected by Generation. If any Reference Treasury Dealer shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, Generation will substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer for that dealer.
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 3:30 p.m. New York City time on the third business day preceding such redemption date.
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity or interpolated (on a day count basis) of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date.
Generation will mail notice of any redemption at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each registered holder of Senior Notes to be redeemed.
Unless Generation defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Senior Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.
Covenants
Mergers and Consolidations
For so long as any Senior Notes remain outstanding, Generation may not consolidate with or merge with or into any other person, or sell, convey, transfer or lease our properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any person, and Generation will not permit any person to consolidate with or merge with or into Generation, unless:
 
 
Limitation on Liens
For so long as any Senior Notes remain outstanding, Generation may not issue, assume, guarantee or permit to exist any Indebtedness secured by any lien on any of its property, whether owned on the date that the Senior Notes are issued or thereafter acquired, without in any such case effectively securing the outstanding Senior Notes (together with, if Generation shall so determine, any other Indebtedness of or guaranteed by
Generation ranking equally with the Senior Notes) equally and ratably with such Indebtedness (but only so long as such Indebtedness is so secured); provided that the foregoing restriction shall not apply to the following permitted liens:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Indenture does not limit Generation's Subsidiaries' ability to issue, assume, guarantee or permit to exist any Indebtedness secured by any lien on any of such Subsidiary's property, whether owned on the date the Senior Notes are issued or thereafter acquired, provided that such Indebtedness is limited in recourse only to such Subsidiary.
As used in this report, "Indebtedness" of any person means (1) all indebtedness of such person for borrowed money, (2) all obligations of such person evidenced by senior notes, debentures, notes or other similar instruments, (3) all obligations of such person to pay the deferred purchase price of property or services, (4) all indebtedness created or arising under any conditional sale or other title retention agreement with respect to property acquired by such person (even though the rights and remedies of the seller or lender under such agreement in the event of the default are limited to repossession or sale of such property), (5) all capital lease obligations of such person (excluding leases of property in the ordinary course of business), and (6) all Indebtedness of the type referred to in clauses (1) through (5) above secured by (or for which the holder of such Indebtedness has an existing right, contingent or otherwise, to be secured by) any lien or security interest on property.

Restriction on Sales and Leasebacks
For so long as any Senior Notes remain outstanding, Generation may not enter into any sale and leaseback transaction with any Subsidiary. In addition, Generation may not enter into any sale and leaseback transaction unless it complies with this restrictive covenant. A "sale and leaseback transaction" generally is an arrangement between Generation and a Subsidiary, bank, insurance company or other lender or investor where Generation leases real or personal property which was or will be sold by Generation to that Subsidiary, lender or investor.
Generation can comply with this restrictive covenant if it meets either of the following conditions:

(d) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act (including circumstances when such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, the Company promptly will (1) notify the Representatives of such event, (2) prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the first sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 5, an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance and (3) supply any supplemented Final Prospectus to you in such quantities as you may reasonably request. If, prior to the Closing Date, there occurs an event or development as a result of which the Disclosure Package would include an untrue statement of a material fact or would omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances when the Disclosure Package is delivered to a purchaser, not misleading, the Company promptly will notify the Representatives so that any use of the Disclosure Package may cease until it is amended or supplemented, and will promptly prepare an amendment or supplement that will correct such statement or omission.
 
(e) As soon as practicable, the Company will make generally available to its security holders and to the Representatives an earnings statement or statements of the Company and its subsidiaries which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act and Rule 158 under the Act.
(f) The Company will furnish to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, signed copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and to each other Underwriter a copy of the Registration Statement (without exhibits thereto) and, so long as delivery of a prospectus by an Underwriter or dealer may be required by the Act (including circumstances when such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), as many copies of each Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus and each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and any supplement thereto as the Representatives may reasonably request. The Company will pay the expenses of printing or other production of all documents relating to the offering.
(g) The Company will arrange, if necessary, for the qualification of the Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate, will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities and will pay any fee of FINRA in connection with its review of the offering; provided that in no event shall the Company be obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to service of process in suits, other than those arising out of the offering or sale of the Securities, in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.
(h) The Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Representatives, offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, or otherwise dispose of, or enter into any transaction which is designed to, or might reasonably be expected to, result in the disposition (whether by actual disposition or effective economic disposition due to cash settlement or otherwise) by the Company, directly or indirectly, or announce the offering of, any long-term debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Company or preferred stock (other than the Securities), prior to the Closing Date.
(i) The Company will not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that would constitute or that might reasonably be expected to cause or result in, under the Exchange Act or otherwise, stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the Securities.

preparation, printing, authentication, issuance and delivery of certificates for the Securities, including any stamp or transfer taxes in connection with the original issuance and sale of the Securities; (v) the printing (or reproduction) and delivery of this Agreement, any blue sky memorandum and all other agreements or documents printed (or reproduced) and delivered in connection with the offering of the Securities; (vi) any registration or qualification of the Securities for offer and sale under the securities or blue sky laws of the several states (including filing fees and the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the Underwriters relating to such registration and qualification); (vii) the transportation and other expenses incurred by or on behalf of Company representatives in connection with presentations to prospective purchasers of the Securities; (viii) the fees and expenses of the Company's accountants and counsel (including local and special counsel); (ix) the fees and expenses of any rating agencies rating the Securities and (x) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder.

(i) the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date and the Company has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date;

7. . If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 10 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally upon demand for all out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel reasonably incurred) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities.
Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses
8. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) (i) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or arise out of or are based upon an omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact, in light of the circumstances in which it was made, or an omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or in any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably

incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein.
provided
however
(b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in Section 8(a) above. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that (i) the statement set forth on the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and (ii) under the heading "Underwriting," (A) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances and (B) the paragraph related to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in any Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to
provided
however
 
those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and does not include a statement as to, or admission of, fault, culpability or failure to act on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8 is for any reason held to be unenforceable by an indemnified party or is insufficient to hold harmless a party indemnified under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8, although applicable in accordance with its terms (including the requirements of Section 8(c) above), the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder; , , that each Underwriter's obligation to contribute to Losses hereunder shall be several and not joint. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable

considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
9. . (a) If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities the defaulting Underwriter failed to purchase.
Default by an Underwriter
(b) If the non-defaulting Underwriters are not obligated to and do not purchase all the Securities the defaulting Underwriter failed to purchase, the Company shall be entitled to a period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons reasonably satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase such Securities and if arrangements for the purchase of such Securities by other persons selected by the Company and reasonably satisfactory to the Representative are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company unless the Company elects to reduce the principal amount of the Securities to be offered by the amount of the Securities that the defaulting Underwriter failed to purchase, in which event the non-defaulting Underwriters will have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of such reduced principal amount of Securities. In the event the non-defaulting Underwriters decline to purchase all of such reduced principal amount of Securities, this Agreement will terminate without any liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company
(c) In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
 
10. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if (A) at any time prior to such time (i) trading in the common stock of Exelon Corporation shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange, or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such Exchange, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State authorities, (iii) a major disruption of settlements of securities or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis and (B) the effect of the event as set forth in the foregoing clauses (iii) and (iv), as the case may be, on the financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).
Termination
11. . The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 7 and 8 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.
