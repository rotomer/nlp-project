EXHIBIT 99.1
 
(October 23, 2009)  Exelon Corporation (NYSE: EXC) today announced that its third quarter 2009 consolidated earnings prepared in accordance with GAAP were $757 million, or $1.14 per diluted share, compared with earnings of $700 million, or $1.06 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2008.
CHICAGO
Exelon's adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the third quarter of 2009 were $633 million, or $0.96 per diluted share, compared with $706 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, for the same period in 2008.
"We are achieving our financial commitments despite difficult weather, economic and market conditions," said John W. Rowe, Exelon's chairman and CEO. "We continue to deliver cost savings and solid operations as shown by a 94.7 percent nuclear capacity factor for the third quarter and reliable utility performance through the critical summer months. We remain committed to achieving full year 2009 operating earnings within the guidance range we issued last fall and are narrowing that range to $4.00 to $4.10 per share."
The decrease in third quarter 2009 adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings to $0.96 per share from $1.07 per share in third quarter 2008 was primarily due to:
 
 
 
 
 
Lower third quarter 2009 earnings were partially offset by:
 
 
Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the third quarter of 2009 do not include the following items (after-tax) that were included in reported GAAP earnings:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the third quarter of 2008 did not include the following items (after-tax) that were included in reported GAAP earnings:
 
 
 
 
 
2009 Earnings Outlook
Exelon narrowed its guidance range for 2009 adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings to $4.00 to $4.10 per share from $4.00 to $4.30 per share. Operating earnings guidance is based on the assumption of normal weather for the remainder of the year.
The outlook for 2009 adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for Exelon and its subsidiaries excludes the following items:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Third Quarter and Recent Highlights
 
 
 
 
 
On August 4, 2009, ComEd announced it filed an application with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for $175 million in matching funds made available under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The matching funds would enable an expansion of the company's AMI pilot, from approximately 131,000 customers to 310,000 customers, and additional investments in Smart Grid technologies. The DOE is expected to select projects for funding later this year.
On September 2, 2009, ComEd submitted a petition to the ICC requesting recovery of the remaining costs of the stimulus projects after receiving the matching funds from the DOE.
 
 
 
communication networks over a 15-year period. The first phase of the plan includes the procurement and deployment of automated meter infrastructure and initial deployment of 100,000 smart meters over the next three years.
On August 6, 2009, PECO filed with the DOE its application seeking $200 million in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act grant funds under the Smart Grid Investment Grant Program. PECO's "Smart Future Greater Philadelphia" project will increase the number of smart meters initially installed to 600,000, accelerate universal meter deployment by five years and increase Smart Grid investments up to approximately $100 million over the next three years.
 
The June and September procurements combined accounted for approximately 49 percent of the total full requirements electricity needed for PECO's residential customers beginning in 2011 at an average retail price of 9.41 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh), about a 4 percent increase compared to current prices. The September procurement accounted for approximately 24 percent and 16 percent of the full requirement fixed-price product for PECO's small and medium commercial customers, respectively, at an average blended retail price of 9.79 cents per kWh. PECO's next supply purchases for the residential and the small and medium commercial classes will take place in May 2010.
 
 
 
Notes due May 1, 2011 pursuant to its cash tender offer announced on September 16, 2009, and (3) to fund Generation's repurchase of $307 million of pollution-control bonds in early September. On September 23, 2009, Exelon Corporation and Generation called the remaining bonds that were not tendered pursuant to their tender offers, according to the terms of the respective bond issues. These bonds are obligated to be tendered today under the terms of the bonds and the call notices. Through these debt repurchase and refinancing activities, Exelon was able to capitalize on favorable market conditions, resulting in lower interest expense and an extended debt maturity profile.
 
On July 21, 2009, Fitch Ratings, Ltd. removed Exelon and Generation from Ratings Watch Negative. The ratings for Exelon and Generation were affirmed and each entity was assigned a Stable Ratings Outlook.
On July 22, 2009, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (S&P) affirmed its corporate credit rating on Exelon, Generation and PECO of "BBB" and removed their ratings from CreditWatch Negative. In addition, S&P raised the corporate credit rating of ComEd to "BBB" from "BBB-", raised its debt and preferred stock ratings and removed its ratings from CreditWatch Negative. An S&P research report cited "improvement in both ComEd's business risk profile and its financial measures". The outlook for ratings of all the Exelon entities is stable.
On July 23, 2009, Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) confirmed the ratings of Exelon and Generation and assigned a stable outlook. Moody's also confirmed the long-term debt rating of PECO but downgraded its short-term rating to "P-2" from "P-1" and changed the outlook on PECO's long-term debt to negative.
On August 3, 2009, Moody's changed its credit rating methodology, widening the notching between most senior secured debt ratings and senior unsecured debt ratings of investment grade regulated utilities. As a result, Moody's upgraded ComEd's senior secured debt rating to "Baa1" from "Baa2".
