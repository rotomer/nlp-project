"Company Counsel Opinion" means an opinion of nationally-recognized executive compensation counsel to the effect that the amount of the Capped Amount set forth in the Company Certificate is the amount that a court of competent jurisdiction, based on a final judgment not subject to further appeal, is most likely to decide to have been calculated in accordance with this Article and applicable law, and that there is no substantial authority for the calculation set forth in the Executive's Certificate.

(a) In recognition of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information, and in recognition of the necessity of the limited restrictions imposed by Sections 9.1, 9.2 and 9.3, the parties agree that it would be impossible to measure solely in money the damages which the Company would suffer if Executive were to breach any of his obligations under such Sections. Executive acknowledges that any breach of any provision of such Sections would irreparably injure the Company. Accordingly, Executive agrees that if he breaches any of the provisions of such Sections, the Company shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedies to which the Company may be entitled under this Agreement or otherwise, to an injunction to be issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, to restrain any breach, or threatened breach, of such provisions, and Executive hereby waives any right to assert any claim or defense that the Company has an adequate remedy at law for any such breach.
(b) If a court determines that any of the covenants included in this Article IX is unenforceable in whole or in part because of such covenant's duration or geographical or other scope, such court shall have the power to reduce the duration or scope of such provision, as the case may be, so as to cause such covenant to be thereafter enforceable.
(c) All of the provisions of this Article IX shall survive any Termination of Employment without regard to (i) the reasons for such termination or (ii) the expiration of the Contract Term.
9.6 . During the two-year period commencing on the Termination Date, Executive shall not (a) make any written or oral statement that brings the Company or any of its Affiliates or the employees, officers or agents of the Company or any of its Affiliates into disrepute, or tarnishes any of their images or reputations or (b) publish, comment upon or disseminate any statements suggesting or accusing the Company or any of its Affiliates or any
Non-Disparagement
 
agents, employees or officers of the Company or any of its Affiliates of any misconduct or unlawful behavior. This Section shall not be deemed to be breached by testimony of Executive given in any judicial or governmental proceeding which Executive reasonably believes to be truthful at the time given or by any other action of Executive which he reasonably believes is taken in accordance with the requirements of applicable law or administrative regulation.
10.1 . The Company may deduct or withhold from payments or other benefits otherwise payable to Executive pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement any amounts that are required by applicable law.
Required Withholding
10.2 . In the event of any Termination of Employment or any breach of this Agreement by the Company, Executive's exclusive remedies shall be as specified in Article VII (or Article VIII, if applicable) or to enforce any other undertaking of the Company expressly provided in this Agreement; provided that nothing herein shall guarantee Executive continued employment for any specific period nor deny Executive the right to seek a final judicial determination (or, if Executive reasonably determines, based upon the advice of counsel, that it is more likely than not that each of the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois and the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois will decline to adjudicate the issue, a final decree in an arbitration proceeding conducted in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association, with such arbitration proceeding to be conducted in Chicago, Illinois before a panel of three arbitrators) that any Termination of Employment purportedly made for Cause was, in fact, made not in good faith or was made without adherence to the requirements or procedures set forth in this Agreement. If Executive obtains such a final judicial or arbitral determination, as applicable, the Termination of Employment shall be treated as a Termination Without Cause for all purposes of this Agreement.
Remedies
10.3 . This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Executive and his Beneficiaries and estate and the Company and its successors.
Assignment; Successors
10.4 . If Executive dies prior to receiving all of the amounts payable hereunder pursuant to Article IV, VI (except as may otherwise expressly be provided in such Article or in the plans referenced therein), VII or VIII, such amounts shall be paid in a lump-sum payment to the beneficiary ("Beneficiary") designated by Executive in writing to the Company during his lifetime, which Executive may change from time to time by new designation filed in like manner without the consent of any Beneficiary; or if no such Beneficiary is designated, to his estate.
Beneficiary
10.5 . Benefits payable under this Agreement shall not be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, charge, garnishment, execution or levy of any kind, either voluntary or involuntary, prior to actually being received by Executive, and any such attempt to dispose of any right to benefits payable hereunder shall be void.
Nonalienation of Benefits
 
10.6 . If all or any part of this Agreement is declared by any court or governmental authority to be unlawful or invalid, such unlawfulness or invalidity shall not serve to invalidate any portion of this Agreement not declared to be unlawful or invalid. Any paragraph or part of a paragraph so declared to be unlawful or invalid shall, if possible, be construed in a manner which will give effect to the terms of such paragraph or part of a paragraph to the fullest extent possible while remaining lawful and valid.
Severability
10.7 . This Agreement shall not be amended or modified except by a written agreement between the Company and Executive. A waiver of any term, covenant or condition contained in this Agreement shall not result in a waiver of any other term, covenant or condition, and any waiver of any default shall not result in a waiver of any later default.
Amendment; Waiver
10.8 . All notices hereunder shall be in writing, delivered by hand, nationally-recognized courier service that guarantees overnight delivery or by certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, and addressed as follows:
Notices
 
Either party may from time to time designate a new address in accordance with this Section. Notices shall be effective when received by the addressee.
10.9 . Until this Agreement has been filed as an exhibit to a filing by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission, neither Executive nor the Company shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect to this Agreement, nor disclose the contents hereof to any third party, without obtaining in each case the consent of the other parties hereto, which consent shall not be withheld or delayed where such release, announcement or disclosure shall be required by applicable law or administrative regulation.
Publicity
10.10 . Nothing in this Agreement, including Sections 9.1, 9.6 or 10.9, shall be construed to prohibit Executive from communicating with, including testifying in any administrative proceeding before, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or the United States Department of Labor, or from otherwise addressing issues related to nuclear safety with any party or taking any other action protected under Section 211 of the Energy Reorganization Act.
Communications
 
10.11 . The Company shall pay to Executive all reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by Executive in disputing in good faith any termination of his employment hereunder or in seeking in good faith to obtain or enforce any benefit or right under this Agreement, provided that Executive shall have a reasonable basis for his position.
Legal Expenses
10.12 . Except where otherwise indicated by the context, any reference to an "Article" or "Section" shall be to an Article or Section of this Agreement.
Articles and Sections
10.13 . This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.
Counterparts
10.14 . This Agreement shall be binding immediately upon its execution and shall become effective immediately without further action of the Company or Executive. This Agreement forms the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to its subject matter, and shall supersede all prior agreements, promises and representations of the parties regarding employment or severance, whether in writing or otherwise, including but not limited to the Prior Agreement.
Effectiveness; Entire Agreement
10.15 .
Applicable Law; Avoidance of Section 409A Penalty
(a) This Agreement shall be interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois, without regard to its choice of law principles, and the applicable provisions of the Code.
(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in the event of a payment to be made, or a benefit to be provided, pursuant to this Agreement based upon Executive's "separation from service" (as defined herein) for a reason other than death at a time when the Executive is a Specified Employee and such payment or provision of such benefit is not exempt or otherwise permitted under Section 409A of the Code without the imposition of any Section 409A Penalty, such payment shall not be made, and such benefit shall not be provided, before the earlier of the date which is six (6) months and one day after the Executive's separation from service or 30 days after the Executive's death. All payments or benefits delayed pursuant to this Section shall be aggregated into one lump sum payment to be made as of the Company's first business day following the first day of the seventh month after Executive's separation from service (or if earlier, as of 30 days after Executive's death). For purposes of this Section, "separation from service" shall have the meaning provided under Section 409A of the Code and the related Treasury Regulations.
(c) This Agreement is intended not to result in the imposition of any Section 409A Penalty and shall be administered, interpreted and construed in a manner consistent with such intent.
 
(d) Executive and the Company agree to cooperate to amend the Agreement from time to time as appropriate to avoid the imposition of any Section 409A Penalty.
(e) In no event shall the Company be required to provide a tax gross-up payment to Executive with respect to any Section 409A Penalty.
10.16 . All of Executive's rights hereunder, including his rights to compensation and benefits prior to the Termination Date, his right to severance and other benefits subject to the terms and conditions of Article VII and VIII after the Termination Date, and his obligations under Article IX hereof, shall survive a Termination of Employment and the termination of this Agreement.
