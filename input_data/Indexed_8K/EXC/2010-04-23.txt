EXHIBIT 99.1
 
(April 23, 2010)  Exelon Corporation (Exelon) announced first quarter 2010 consolidated earnings as follows:
CHICAGO
 
"We again delivered on our financial and operating commitments with first quarter earnings topping our guidance range of $0.85 to $0.95 per share," said John W. Rowe, Exelon's chairman and CEO. "We continue to manage the factors in our control, such as our focus on strong operations, which resulted in our Generation company achieving a 92.3% nuclear capacity factor in the first quarter, even with five planned refueling outages, and our utilities ComEd and PECO attaining exceptional performance during adverse winter weather conditions. Expecting to sustain this performance and make further progress on cost management and reflecting market conditions and load slightly favorable to our previous forecast, we are raising the bottom end of our 2010 earnings per share guidance range from $3.60 to $3.70 and keeping the top end at $4.00."
First Quarter Operating Results
The decrease in first quarter 2010 adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings to $1.00 per share from $1.20 per share in first quarter 2009 was primarily due to:

Drexel University and Liberty Property Trust. As a result of SGIG funding, PECO will deploy 600,000 smart meters within three years and accelerate universal deployment of more than 1.6 million smart meters to 10 years from 15 years. The SGIG grant is considered non-taxable based on recent IRS guidance. In total, over the next ten years, PECO is planning to spend up to $650 million on its smart grid and smart meter infrastructure. The $200 million SGIG from the DOE will be used to significantly reduce the impact of those investments on PECO ratepayers.
