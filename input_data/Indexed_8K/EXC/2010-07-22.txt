EXHIBIT 99.1
 
(July 22, 2010)  Exelon Corporation (NYSE: EXC) announced second quarter 2010 consolidated earnings as follows:
CHICAGO
 
Chairman and CEO John W. Rowe said, "All three of our companies delivered sound financial and operating performance. As a result, our second quarter earnings results again exceeded our guidance range of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. Exelon Generation achieved a nuclear capacity factor of nearly 95 percent in the second quarter, and ComEd and PECO delivered strong performance amidst severe storms and record hot weather." Because of favorable first half results, Rowe announced that Exelon has raised its 2010 earnings guidance range from $3.70 to $4.00 per share to $3.80 to $4.10 per share.
Rowe added, "Going forward, we are optimistic about Exelon's prospects as we evaluate the coming effects of EPA regulation, act on our views of the power market recovery and pursue disciplined organic growth across our regulated and unregulated businesses."

As shown in the table above, Exelon's adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings decreased to $0.99 per share in the second quarter of 2010 from $1.03 per share in the second quarter of 2009, primarily due to:

2010 Earnings Outlook
Exelon raised its guidance range for 2010 adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings from $3.70 to $4.00 per share to $3.80 to $4.10 per share. Operating earnings guidance is based on the assumption of normal weather for the balance of the year.
The outlook for 2010 adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for Exelon and its subsidiaries excludes the following items:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Proposed Clean Air Transport Rule
On July 6, 2010, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published the proposed Clean Air Transport Rule (CATR) as the replacement to the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) that had been remanded by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 2008. The proposed CATR is one of a number of significant regulations that the EPA expects to issue that will impose more stringent requirements relating to air, water and waste controls on electric generating units. Due to its low carbon generation portfolio, Exelon will not be as significantly affected by these regulations, which would therefore result in a comparative advantage for Exelon relative to electric generators that are more reliant on fossil-fuel plants. After a period of public comments and hearings, a final CATR is expected by mid-2011. Under the proposal, the first phase of nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide (SO
2
) emissions reductions under the CATR will commence in 2012, with further reductions of SO
2
emissions proposed to become effective in 2014.
