On October 21, 2010, ComEd petitioned the Court for a rehearing of its decision regarding the post-test year depreciation reserve and Rider SMP. Although the timeline is uncertain at this point, ComEd expects the Court to follow its normal process. With respect to the Court's finding on Rider SMP, on October 18, ComEd filed a petition with the ICC to recover the unrecovered portion of certain operating costs associated with the smart meter pilot by transferring these costs into its pending general rate case instead of the rider.
