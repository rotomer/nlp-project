Section 8  Other Events
Item 8.01. Other Events.
The recent Federal tax legislation includes provisions making qualified property placed into service after September 8, 2010 and before January 1, 2012 eligible for 100% bonus depreciation for tax purposes. In addition, qualified property placed into service in 2012 is eligible for 50% bonus depreciation for tax purposes. These provisions of the recent tax legislation will generate approximately $1 billion of cash for Exelon Corporation (Exelon) through accelerated depreciation (approximately $850 million in 2010-2011 and approximately $170 million in 2012). The cash generated is an acceleration of tax benefits that Exelon would have otherwise received over 20 years. Because taxable income is reduced as a result of bonus depreciation taken, there is also a reduction in the manufacturing tax deduction for which Exelon is eligible. Exelon expects that the direct impacts of the tax legislation will reduce Exelon's 2010 earnings by approximately $0.01 per share and 2011 earnings by approximately $0.11 per share.
As a result of these accelerated cash benefits, on December 28, 2010, the Exelon board of directors authorized contributions to the Exelon pension plans in the first quarter of 2011 in the aggregate amount of $2.1 billion, including the contribution of $800 million Exelon was previously expected to make in 2011. Exelon expects to fund the contributions with $500 million from cash from operations, $850 million from the tax benefits associated with bonus depreciation, and $750 million from the tax benefits of making the contributions. Exelon expects that the contributions will increase the plan's funded status from approximately 77% to approximately 89% as of December 31, 2011, subject to actual 2010 and 2011 asset returns and final actuarial valuations. Because the cash tax benefits will be realized over the course of 2011 and Exelon expects to make the pension contributions in the first quarter, Exelon or its subsidiaries may incur debt to fund a portion of the pension contributions pending receipt of the actual cash tax benefit. The proposed pension contribution will reduce Exelon's earnings by approximately $0.04 per share in 2010 as a result of a reduced manufacturing tax deduction; however, the pension contribution will generate approximately $0.08 per share of earnings in 2011 to partially offset the impacts of the reduction in the manufacturing deduction in that year.
The combined effects of the tax legislation and the pension contributions are expected to reduce 2010 earnings by approximately $0.05 per share and reduce 2011 earnings by approximately $0.03 per share.
