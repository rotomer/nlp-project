Exhibit 99.1
 
(April 27, 2011)  Exelon Corporation (NYSE: EXC) announced first quarter 2011 consolidated earnings as follows:
CHICAGO
 
"Our first quarter earnings were above our expectations primarily driven by results at Generation, including the performance of our generating units during a February cold snap in the Dallas area," said John W. Rowe, chairman and chief executive officer. "Our operating and financial performance in the first quarter keeps us comfortably on track to be within our earnings guidance range of $3.90 to $4.20 per share. Our nuclear operations also had a strong quarter, with a 94.8 percent capacity factor. Our fleet remains safe and reliable, and we are working closely with regulators, policymakers and the industry to ensure we stay current with any lessons learned from the Fukushima event."
First Quarter Operating Results
As shown in the table above, Exelon's adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings increased to $1.17 per share in the first quarter of 2011 from $1.00 per share in the first quarter of 2010, primarily due to:
 
 
 
Higher first quarter 2011 earnings were partially offset by:
 
 
 
Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the first quarter of 2011 do not include the following items (after tax) that were included in reported GAAP earnings:
 
Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the first quarter of 2010 did not include the following items (after tax) that were included in reported GAAP earnings:
 
2011 Earnings Outlook
Exelon reaffirmed a guidance range for 2011 adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings of $3.90 to $4.20 per share. Operating earnings guidance is based on the assumption of normal weather for the balance of the year.
 
The outlook for 2011 adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for Exelon and its subsidiaries excludes the following items:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
First Quarter and Recent Highlights
 
On March 28, 2011, the EPA proposed standards to protect fish and other aquatic life under section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act for cooling water systems at large power plants and industrial facilities. The proposed rules address the primary issues in the manner Exelon anticipated; cooling towers are not required as the best technology available for entrainment standards and cost-benefit analysis must be performed. The public comment period lasts 90 days after the rule is published in the Federal Register. A final rule is due by July 2012.
 
Generation's nuclear fleet, including its owned output from the Salem Generating Station, produced 35,192 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in the first quarter of 2011, compared with 34,109 GWh in the first quarter of 2010. The Exelon-operated nuclear plants achieved a 94.8 percent capacity
 
factor for the first quarter of 2011 compared with 92.3 percent for the first quarter of 2010. The Exelon-operated nuclear plants completed one scheduled refueling outage and began two others in the first quarter of 2011, compared with completing three scheduled refueling outages and beginning two others in the first quarter of 2010. Among the planned outages completed in last year's first quarter was the extended refueling outage at Three Mile Island Unit 1, which included the replacement of steam generators. As a result, the number of refueling outage days totaled 44 in the first quarter of 2011 versus 101 days in the first quarter of 2010. The number of non-refueling outage days at the Exelon-operated plants totaled 14 days in the first quarter of 2011 compared with 5 days in the first quarter of 2010.

Generation
First quarter 2011 net income was $495 million compared with $561 million in the first quarter of 2010.

Excluding the effects of these items, Generation's net income in the first quarter of 2011 increased $163 million compared with the same quarter in 2010 primarily due to:
 
The increase in net income was partially offset by:
 
 
 
Generation's average realized margin on all electric sales, including sales to affiliates and excluding trading activity, was $44.30 per MWh in the first quarter of 2011 compared with $37.26 per MWh in the first quarter of 2010.
consists of the electricity transmission and distribution operations in northern Illinois.
ComEd
 
ComEd recorded net income of $69 million in the first quarter of 2011, compared with net income of $116 million in the first quarter of 2010.

Excluding the effects of these items, ComEd's net income in the first quarter of 2011 was down $56 million from the same quarter in 2010 primarily reflecting:
 
 
In the first quarter of 2011, heating degree-days in the ComEd service territory were up 7.1 percent relative to the same period in 2010 and were 3.9 percent above normal. As a result, ComEd's total retail electric deliveries increased 1.2 percent quarter over quarter.
Weather-normalized retail electric deliveries decreased 0.1 percent in the first quarter of 2011, primarily reflecting a decrease in deliveries to residential customers. For ComEd, weather had a favorable after-tax effect of $3 million on first quarter 2011 earnings relative to 2010 and a favorable after-tax effect of $2 million relative to normal weather that is incorporated in Exelon's earnings guidance.

PECO's net income in the first quarter of 2011 was $126 million, up from $101 million in the first quarter of 2010. First quarter net income in 2010 included an after-tax charge of $10 million related to the passage of Federal health care legislation. Excluding the effect of this item, PECO's net income in the first quarter of 2011 was up $15 million from the same quarter in 2010 primarily reflecting:
 
 
The increase in net income was partially offset by the effect of CTC recoveries in 2010, net of amortization expense, associated with PECO's transition period, which ended on December 31, 2010.
In the first quarter of 2011, heating degree-days in the PECO service territory were up 3.9 percent from 2010 and were close to normal. Total retail electric deliveries were down 0.6 percent from last year, primarily reflecting a decrease in deliveries to large commercial and industrial customers. On the retail gas side, deliveries in the first quarter of 2011 were up 4.2 percent from the first quarter of 2010, largely driven by the effects of colder weather conditions compared with last year.
Weather-normalized retail electric deliveries were down 1.1 percent in the first quarter of 2011, primarily reflecting a decline in large commercial and industrial deliveries. Weather-normalized retail gas deliveries were up 0.7 percent in the first quarter of 2011. For PECO, weather had a favorable after-tax effect of $4 million on first quarter 2011 earnings relative to 2010 and an unfavorable after-tax effect of $2 million relative to normal weather that is incorporated in Exelon's earnings guidance.
 
Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings
