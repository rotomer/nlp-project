Section 1  Registrant's Business and Operations
 
On April 28, 2011, Exelon Corporation, a Pennsylvania corporation ("Exelon"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), by and among Exelon, Bolt Acquisition Corporation, a Maryland corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Exelon, ("Merger Sub"), and Constellation Energy Group, Inc., a Maryland corporation ("Constellation"). A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Exhibit 2.1 to this report.
The Merger Agreement provides for the merger of Merger Sub with and into Constellation on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement (the "Merger"), with Constellation continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger. As a result of the Merger, Constellation will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Exelon, and Constellation stockholders will receive shares of Exelon common stock in exchange for their Constellation common stock. At the effective time of the Merger, each share of common stock of Constellation issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive 0.93 shares of common stock of Exelon (the "Exchange Ratio") (other than shares that are owned by Exelon, Merger Sub or Constellation or any wholly-owned subsidiary of Exelon or Constellation). Constellation stock options and other equity awards will generally convert upon completion of the Merger into stock options and equity awards with respect to Exelon common stock, after giving effect to the Exchange Ratio.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, upon consummation of the Merger, Exelon will add to its Board of Directors four current Constellation directors, comprised of three independent directors and Mayo A. Shattuck III, currently Chairman of the Board of Directors, President and Chief Executive Officer of Constellation, who will become Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors of Exelon. By the end of 2012, the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors of Exelon shall be 16, including the four Constellation designees. Christopher M. Crane, currently President and Chief Operating Officer of Exelon, will become the President and Chief Executive Officer of Exelon immediately following the Merger.
Following the Merger, the headquarters of Exelon's wholesale marketing unit, competitive energy and renewable businesses will be in Baltimore, Maryland.
The consummation of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of closing conditions applicable to both Exelon and Constellation, including, among others, the receipt of required regulatory approvals and the approval of the transaction by the stockholders of both Exelon and Constellation.
The Merger Agreement also contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of both Exelon and Constellation. These covenants include, among others, an obligation on behalf of both parties to operate their respective businesses in the ordinary course until the Merger is consummated, limitations on their right to solicit or engage in negotiations regarding alternative business combination transactions or to withdraw their support of the Merger and that the parties use reasonable best efforts to obtain governmental and regulatory approvals. The Merger Agreement also provides for termination rights on behalf of both parties and that under specified circumstances Constellation may be required to pay Exelon a termination fee of $200 million and Exelon may be required to pay Constellation a termination fee of $800 million.
The Merger Agreement has been included as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K to provide you with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about Exelon. The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties that the parties thereto made to each other as of a specific date. The assertions embodied in the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement were made solely for purposes of the Merger Agreement and the transactions and agreements contemplated thereby among the respective parties thereto and may be subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by the parties thereto in connection with negotiating the terms thereof. Moreover, some of those representations and warranties may not be accurate or complete as of any specified date, may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to stockholders or may have been used for the purpose of allocating risk among the parties to the Merger Agreement rather than establishing matters as facts.
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Information
Except for the historical information contained herein, certain of the matters discussed in this communication constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, both as amended by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as "may," "will," "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe," "target," "forecast," and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future plans, actions, or events identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding benefits of the proposed merger, integration plans and expected synergies, the expected timing of completion of the transaction, anticipated future financial and operating performance and results, including estimates for growth. These statements are based on the current expectations of management of Exelon Corporation (Exelon) and Constellation Energy Group, Inc. (Constellation), as applicable. There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements included in this communication. For example, (1) the companies may be unable to obtain shareholder approvals required for the merger; (2) the companies may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals required for the merger, or required regulatory approvals may delay the merger or result in the imposition of conditions that could have a material adverse effect on the combined company or cause the companies to abandon the merger; (3) conditions to the closing of the merger may not be satisfied; (4) an unsolicited offer of another company to acquire assets or capital stock of Exelon or Constellation could interfere with the merger; (5) problems may arise in successfully integrating the businesses of the companies, which may result in the combined company not operating as effectively and efficiently as expected; (6) the combined company may be unable to achieve cost-cutting synergies or it may take longer than expected to achieve those synergies; (7) the merger may involve unexpected costs, unexpected liabilities or unexpected delays, or the effects of purchase accounting may be different from the companies' expectations; (8) the credit ratings of the combined company or its subsidiaries may be different from what the companies expect; (9) the businesses of the companies may suffer as a result of uncertainty surrounding the merger; (10) the companies may not realize the values
expected to be obtained for properties expected or required to be divested; (11) the industry may be subject to future regulatory or legislative actions that could adversely affect the companies; and (12) the companies may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could also have material adverse effects on future results, performance or achievements of the combined company. Discussions of some of these other important factors and assumptions are contained in Exelon's and Constellation's respective filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and available at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov, including: (1) Exelon's 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K in (a) ITEM 1A. Risk Factors, (b) ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and (c) ITEM 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data: Note 18; (2) Exelon's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2011 in (a) Part II, Other Information, ITEM 1A. Risk Factors, (b) Part 1, Financial Information, ITEM 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and (c) Part I, Financial Information, ITEM 1. Financial Statements: Note 12; and (3) Constellation's 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K in (a) ITEM 1A. Risk Factors, (b) ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and (c) ITEM 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data: Note 12. These risks, as well as other risks associated with the proposed merger, will be more fully discussed in the joint proxy statement/prospectus that will be included in the Registration Statement on Form S-4 that Exelon will file with the SEC in connection with the proposed merger. In light of these risks, uncertainties, assumptions and factors, the forward-looking events discussed in this communication may not occur. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this communication. Neither Exelon nor Constellation undertakes any obligation to publicly release any revision to its forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this communication.
