Section 8  Other Events
 
Kenneth W. Cornew, Senior Vice President of Exelon Corporation, has established a structured, prearranged stock trading plan to sell shares in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Mr. Cornew's trading plan covers the sale of 2,500 shares. The stock trading plan is being established to enable Mr. Cornew to diversify a portion of his holdings in excess of his stock ownership requirements.
Exelon's stock ownership guidelines require officers in the position of Senior Vice President to own the lesser of either a fixed number of shares or share equivalents (excluding stock options) or a variable number of shares based on a multiple of two times his base salary, calculated annually. Mr. Cornew holds stock and stock equivalents (excluding options) amounting to about 207% of this guideline. Mr. Cornew owns 16,913 shares and 2,038 performance shares. He also owns 15,000 shares of restricted stock and holds options to acquire 89,676 shares of which 43,501 are vested.
Since February 2005 a dozen of Exelon's senior officers have also entered into one or more similar pre-arranged stock trading plans to sell a limited number of shares of Exelon common stock in order to diversify their assets. Under Exelon's stock ownership guidelines the chairman and chief executive officer should own a fixed number of shares of Exelon stock or stock equivalents (excluding stock options) based on a multiple of five times his base salary, executive vice presidents should own a fixed number of shares of Exelon stock or stock options (excluding stock options) based on a multiple of three times their base salary, and senior vice presidents should own a fixed number of shares based on a multiple of two times their base salary. Each of the senior officers who entered into a stock trading plan held stock and stock equivalents (excluding options) exceeding the applicable stock ownership guideline, and each of those officers will continue to meet the applicable stock ownership guideline after the completion of the sales contemplated by the stock trading plans.
