Section 8  Other Events.
Item 8.01. Other Events.
Exelon Corporation (Exelon) and Constellation Energy Group, Inc. (Constellation) had expected that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) would issue a decision on the proposed merger of Exelon and Constellation by November 16, 2011, within the original 180 day period provided for FERC review. Exelon and Constellation reached a settlement with the PJM Market Monitor (Settlement), which was filed with FERC on October 11, 2011. In an order issued on October 19, 2011, FERC asked for comments on the Settlement and indicated that it considers the Settlement filing as an amendment to the companies' application, which FERC interprets to provide up to 180 additional days to take action. Exelon and Constellation now believe that FERC will take additional time to consider the Settlement and comments recently filed on the Settlement. Exelon and Constellation have, in a letter filed today, requested that the FERC complete its review and issue a decision prior to the January 5, 2012 statutory deadline for the Maryland Public Service Commission's decision on the merger, noting that this would be almost three months after the filing of the Settlement and this should provide the FERC with adequate time to evaluate the Settlement and make its decision.
