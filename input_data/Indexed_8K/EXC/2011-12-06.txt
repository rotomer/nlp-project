Exhibit 99.1
(December 5, 2011)  Exelon Corporation (NYSE:EXC) and Constellation Energy Group (NYSE:CEG) today filed a brief with the Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC) that increases the companies' commitments related to the proposed merger, which is currently under review by the PSC, and offers an enhanced package of benefits, totaling a more than $445 million investment in Maryland, projected to create more than 2,400 jobs in the state.
CHICAGO AND BALTIMORE
"We listened carefully to questions posed by the Commissioners and input from interested parties, and we responded by enhancing the already robust package of benefits that the merger will provide to Maryland," said Exelon President and COO Christopher M. Crane. "We think we have brought forth a good package that will benefit BGE customers, result in a stronger, better-protected BGE, and provide an infusion of thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars into the Maryland economy."
In today's filing, Exelon and Constellation committed to:
 
 
 
 
 
The investment of more than $445 million in Maryland as a result of the merger also consists of the previously announced $112 million from a $100 one-time rate credit for BGE residential customers; $15 million for the Maryland PSC to use directly for the benefit of BGE customers; and $4 million to support the EmPower Maryland Energy Efficiency Act.
In addition, the companies have committed to maintain charitable giving at an average level of $7 million per year for at least 10 years, for a total of $70 million.
In addition to the companies' merger filing with the PSC, Exelon and Constellation made other regulatory filings in support of their proposed merger. On Aug. 3, the Public Utility Commission of Texas approved the merger. Other regulatory approvals required include the Federal Energy
