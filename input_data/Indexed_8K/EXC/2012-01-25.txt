Fourth Quarter and Recent Highlights
 
The merger has been approved by the New York Public Service Commission, the Public Utility Commission of Texas and shareholders of Exelon and Constellation. It also requires regulatory approvals by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Maryland Public Service Commission. In a merger settlement with the State of Maryland, the Maryland Energy Administration (MEA), the City of Baltimore and the Baltimore Building and Construction Trades Council announced December 15, 2011, Exelon, Constellation and Baltimore Gas and Electric Company agreed to provide a package of benefits totaling more than $1 billion and expected to create more than 6,000 jobs in Maryland. Exelon and Constellation continue to expect that the merger will be finalized in early 2012.
 
 
For the full year 2011, the Exelon-operated nuclear plants achieved an average capacity factor of 93.3 percent, as compared with 93.9 percent for 2010. The average annual capacity factor for the Exelon-operated nuclear fleet has exceeded 93 percent for nine consecutive years.

On December 8, 2011, ComEd made a filing under EIMA to request ICC approval of its proposed multi-year performance metrics plan. The metrics are designed to achieve improvement over baseline values in several performance categories over a 10-year period. The final ICC order must be issued by April 6, 2012.
 
Table of Contents
On November 8, 2011, ComEd submitted its first filing with the ICC under EIMA for a performance-based formula rate tariff, which initiated a process to establish the model to govern delivery service rate-setting and to set new rates. The initial rate, which is expected to be lower than current rates but will be subject to reconciliation, will take effect within 30 days after the ICC order, which must be issued by May 31, 2012. The filing does not include costs relating to ComEd's abovementioned Infrastructure Investment Plan. ComEd will file a distribution formula rate plan and updated costs with the ICC each year. ComEd will make its initial reconciliation filing in May 2012, and the adjusted rates will take effect on January 1, 2013 after the ICC's review. As of December 31, 2011, ComEd recorded its estimated reconciliation for 2011.

Fourth quarter 2011 net income was $446 million compared with $424 million in the fourth quarter of 2010.

Weather-normalized retail electric deliveries were down 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011 relative to 2010, reflecting a decline in large C&I deliveries that was partially offset by increased deliveries to residential and small C&I customers. Weather-normalized retail gas deliveries were up 1.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011. For PECO, weather had an unfavorable after-tax effect of $25 million on fourth quarter 2011 earnings relative to 2010 and an unfavorable after-tax effect of $22 million relative to normal weather that is incorporated in Exelon's earnings guidance.
Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings
