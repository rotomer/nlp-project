Exhibit 99.1
 
News Release
 
(May 4, 2012)  Exelon Corporation (NYSE: EXC) announced first quarter 2012 consolidated earnings as follows:
CHICAGO
 
"As expected, our lower operating earnings for first quarter 2012 reflected unfavorable market factors and mild weather," said Christopher M. Crane, Exelon's president and CEO. "However, I am pleased with our continued strong operational performance, such as the 93.6 percent capacity factor achieved by our nuclear operations. In the quarter's most significant news, we successfully closed our merger with Constellation Energy on March 12 after securing all required regulatory approvals, less than one year after we first announced the transaction, and integration activities are progressing extremely well."
First Quarter Operating Results
First quarter 2012 earnings include financial results for Constellation Energy (Constellation) and Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (BGE) beginning on March 12, 2012, the date the merger was completed. Therefore, the composition of results of operations from 2012 and 2011 are not comparable for Exelon Generation Company, LLC (Generation), BGE and Exelon.
As shown in the table above, Exelon's adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings declined to $0.85 per share in the first quarter of 2012 from $1.17 per share in the first quarter of 2011. Earnings in 2012 primarily reflected the following negative factors:
 
 
 
 
 
These factors were partially offset by:
 
 
 
Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the first quarter of 2012 do not include the following items (after tax) that were included in reported GAAP earnings:
 
Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the first quarter of 2011 did not include the following items (after tax) that were included in reported GAAP earnings:

First quarter 2012 net income was $168 million compared with $495 million in the first quarter of 2011. First quarter 2012 net income included (all after tax) mark-to-market gains of $36 million from economic hedging activities, unrealized gains of $36 million related to NDT fund investments, net costs of $4 million associated with the retirement of certain fossil generating units, certain costs incurred of $45 million associated with the merger and integration initiatives, costs of $22 million incurred as part of the Maryland commitments in connection with the merger, amortization of commodity contract intangibles of $78 million, FERC settlement costs of $172 million, benefit of $13 million for the reassessment of state deferred income taxes, net expenses of $2 million for plant divestitures and certain other acquisition costs of $3 million.

Excluding the effects of these items, Generation's net income in the first quarter of 2012 decreased $188 million compared with the same quarter in 2011. This decrease primarily reflected:
 
 
 
These items were partially offset by realized gains in NDT funds related to changes to the investment strategy and favorable market conditions in 2012.
Generation's average realized margin on all electric sales, including sales to affiliates and excluding trading activity, was $32.57 per megawatt-hour (MWh) in the first quarter of 2012 compared with $44.30 per MWh in the first quarter of 2011.

Weather-normalized retail electric deliveries increased 0.5 percent in the first quarter of 2012 relative to 2011, reflecting increases in deliveries to both small and large commercial and industrial (C&I) customers that were partially offset by a decrease in deliveries to residential customers. For ComEd, weather had an unfavorable after-tax effect of $11 million on first quarter 2012 earnings relative to 2011 and an unfavorable after-tax effect of $9 million relative to normal weather.

Excluding the effect of this item, PECO's net income in the first quarter of 2012 was down $25 million from the same quarter in 2011, primarily reflecting the effect of unfavorable weather in PECO's service territory.
In the first quarter of 2012, heating degree-days in the PECO service territory were down 23.6 percent from 2011 and were 22.7 percent below normal. Total retail electric deliveries were down 7.0 percent from last year. On the retail gas side, deliveries in the first quarter of 2012 were down 21.9 percent from the first quarter of 2011.
Weather-normalized retail electric deliveries were down 2.7 percent in the first quarter of 2012 relative to 2011, reflecting declines in deliveries to all customer classes.

For PECO, weather had an unfavorable after-tax effect of $29 million on first quarter 2012 earnings relative to 2011 and an unfavorable after-tax effect of $30 million relative to normal weather.
