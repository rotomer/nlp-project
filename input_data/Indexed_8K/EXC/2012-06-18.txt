The Senior Notes were issued under an indenture, dated as of September 28, 2007 (Indenture), between Generation and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee.

The proceeds of the Senior Notes will be used after deducting underwriters' discounts and commissions and other estimated fees and expenses for general corporate purposes.

Interest will accrue on the Senior Notes from June 18, 2012 or from the most recent interest payment date to which interest has been paid or provided for. Interest is payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15, beginning December 15, 2012.
Redemption at Generation's Option
At any time prior to March 15, 2022 (in the case of the 2022 Senior Notes) or December 15, 2041 (in the case of the 2042 Senior Notes), Generation may redeem each series of Senior Notes in whole or in part, at its option at any time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of:
(1) 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes of the series being redeemed; or
(2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate (as defined below) plus, as applicable, 40 basis points (in the case of the 2022 Senior Notes) and 45 basis points (in the case of the 2042 Senior Notes),
plus accrued interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the redemption date.
At any time on or after March 15, 2022 (in the case of the 2022 Senior Notes) or December 15, 2041 (in the case of the 2042 Senior Notes), Generation may redeem each series of Senior Notes in whole or in part at 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes of the series being redeemed, plus accrued interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the redemption date.
Redemption of the Senior Notes of one series may be made without the redemption of the Senior Notes of the other series.
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security or securities selected by an Independent Investment Banker (as defined below) as having an actual or interpolated maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Senior Notes being redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Senior Notes.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption date, (1) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations (as defined below) for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the trustee obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
"Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers (as defined below) appointed by the trustee after consultation with us.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of Barclays Capital Inc., RBS Securities Inc., Scotia Capital (USA) Inc. and UBS Securities LLC their respective successors, and two other primary U.S. Government securities dealers in The City of New York (Primary Treasury Dealer) selected by us. If any Reference Treasury Dealer shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, Generation will substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer for that dealer.
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 3:30 p.m. New York City time on the third business day preceding such redemption date.
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity or interpolated (on a day count basis) of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date.
Generation will mail notice of any redemption at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each registered holder of Senior Notes to be redeemed.
Unless Generation defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Senior Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.
Negative Covenants
Mergers and Consolidations
For so long as any Senior Notes remain outstanding, Generation may not consolidate with or merge with or into any other person, or sell, convey, transfer or lease Generation's properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any person, and Generation will not permit any person to consolidate with or merge with or into Generation, unless:
 
Limitation on Liens
For so long as any Senior Notes remain outstanding, Generation may not issue, assume, guarantee or permit to exist any Indebtedness secured by any lien on any of its property, whether owned on the date that the Senior Notes are issued or thereafter acquired, without in any such case effectively securing the outstanding Senior Notes (together with, if Generation shall so determine, any other Indebtedness of or guaranteed by Generation ranking equally with the Senior Notes) equally and ratably with such Indebtedness (but only so long as such Indebtedness is so secured); provided that the foregoing restriction shall not apply to the following permitted liens:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Indenture does not limit Generation's Subsidiaries' ability to issue, assume, guarantee or permit to exist any Indebtedness secured by any lien on any of such Subsidiary's property, whether owned on the date the Senior Notes are issued or thereafter acquired, provided that such Indebtedness is limited in recourse only to such Subsidiary.
As used in this report, "Indebtedness" of any person means (1) all indebtedness of such person for borrowed money, (2) all obligations of such person evidenced by senior notes, debentures, notes or other similar instruments, (3) all obligations of such person to pay the deferred purchase price of property or services, (4) all indebtedness created or arising under any conditional sale or other title retention agreement with respect to property acquired by such person (even though the rights and remedies of the seller or lender under such agreement in the event of the default are limited to repossession or sale of such property), (5) all capital lease obligations of such person (excluding leases of property in the ordinary course of business), and (6) all Indebtedness of the type referred to in clauses (1) through (5) above secured by (or for which the holder of such Indebtedness has an existing right, contingent or otherwise, to be secured by) any lien or security interest on property.
As used in this report, "Subsidiary" means any corporation or other entity of which sufficient voting stock or other ownership or economic interests having ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the board of directors (or equivalent body) are at the time directly or indirectly held by Generation.
Restriction on Sales and Leasebacks
For so long as any Senior Notes remain outstanding, Generation may not enter into any sale and leaseback transaction with any Subsidiary. In addition, Generation may not enter into any sale and leaseback transaction unless it complies with this restrictive covenant. A "sale and leaseback transaction" generally is an arrangement between Generation and a Subsidiary, bank, insurance company or other lender or investor where Generation leases real or personal property which was or will be sold by Generation to that Subsidiary, lender or investor.
Generation can comply with this restrictive covenant if it meets either of the following conditions:
 
 
Additional Events of Default
In addition to the events of default described in the Indenture, an event of default under the Senior Notes will include:
 
 
Registration Rights
In connection with the issuance and sale of the Senior Notes, Generation has agreed to enter into a Registration Rights Agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement") with the representatives of the initial purchasers of the Senior Notes and other parties named therein. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, Generation will be obligated to file a registration statement with respect to an offer to exchange the Senior Notes for substantially similar notes of Generation that are registered under the Securities Act or, in certain circumstances, register the resale of the Senior Notes. The registered exchange notes, if and when issued, will have terms identical in all material respects to the Senior Notes, except that their issuance will have been registered under the Securities Act.
Generation will generally be required to file the registration statement no later than 120 days after the final settlement date relating to its recently announced exchange offer that commenced on June 13, 2012 or, if the exchange offer is not consummated, no later than 120 days after the original issuance date of the Senior Notes (the "Registration Rights Issue Date") and to cause such registration statement to become effective no later than 180 days after the Registration Rights Issue date (unless the registration statement is reviewed by the SEC, in which case no later than 240 days after the Registration Rights Issue Date). If it fails to satisfy these and other obligations contained in the Registration Rights Agreement, Generation will be obligated to make additional payments of interest to the holders of the Senior Notes as described in the Registration Rights Agreement.
A copy of the Registration Rights Agreement, dated June 18, 2012, among Generation, Barclays Capital Inc., RBS Securities Inc., Scotia Capital (USA) Inc. and UBS Securities LLC as representatives of the several initial purchasers named therein, is filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this report.
Reference is made to each form of Senior Notes attached as Exhibit 4.1 and 4.2 for additional covenants, events of default and other terms and conditions of each of the series of Senior Notes.

"Underwriter"
"Section 4 Persons"
 
The Company will be entitled to participate at its own expense in the defense, or, if it so elects, to assume the defense of any suit brought to enforce any such liability, but, if the Company elects to assume the defense, such defense shall be conducted by counsel chosen by it; provided, however, that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to such Section 4 Persons. In the event that the Company elects to assume the defense of any such suit and retains such counsel, each Section 4 Person may retain additional counsel but shall bear the fees and expenses of such counsel unless (i) the Company shall have specifically authorized the retaining of such counsel or (ii) the parties to such suit include the Section 4 Person and the Section 4 Persons and the Company have been advised by such counsel that one or more legal defenses may be available to it or them which may not be available to the Company, in which case the Company shall not be entitled to assume the defense of such suit on behalf of such Section 4 Person, notwithstanding its obligation to bear the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel, it being understood, however, that the Company shall not, in connection with any one such suit or proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related actions or proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (and not more than one local counsel) at any time for all such Section 4 Persons, which firm shall be designated in writing by the Initial Purchasers and Dealer Managers. The Company shall not be liable to indemnify any Person for any settlement of any such claim effected without the Company's prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of the Section 4 Person, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any Section 4 Person is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder by such Section 4 Person, unless such settlement, compromise or consent (x) includes an unconditional release of such Section 4 Person from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and (y) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any Section 4 Person. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability, which the Company might otherwise have.
(B) Each Section 4 Person agrees severally and not jointly to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of the Company's directors, each of the Company's officers who have signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (including the reasonable cost of investigating and defending against any claims therefor and counsel fees incurred in connection therewith as such expenses are incurred), joint or several, which may be based upon the 1933 Act, or any other statute or at common law, on the ground or alleged ground that any Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) pursuant to which Exchange Securities or Registrable Securities were registered under the 1933 Act or any Prospectus included therein (or any amendment or supplement thereto) includes or allegedly includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to
 
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, but only insofar as any such statement or omission was made in reliance upon, and in conformity with, written information furnished to the Company by such Section 4 Person specifically for use in the preparation thereof; provided that in no case is such Section 4 Person to be liable with respect to any claims made against the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person unless the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person shall have notified such Section 4 Person in writing within a reasonable time after the summons or other first legal process giving information of the nature of the claim shall have been served upon the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person, but failure to notify such Section 4 Person of any such claim (i) shall not relieve such Section 4 Person from liability under this paragraph unless and to the extent such Section 4 Person did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by such Section 4 Person of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) shall not relieve such Section 4 Person from any liability which it may have to the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person otherwise than on account of the indemnity agreement contained in this paragraph.
Such Section 4 Person will be entitled to participate at its own expense in the defense, or, if it so elects, to assume the defense of any suit brought to enforce any such liability, but, if such Section 4 Person elects to assume the defense, such defense shall be conducted by counsel chosen by it. In the event that such Section 4 Person elects to assume the defense of any such suit and retain such counsel, the Company or such director, officer or controlling person, defendant or defendants in the suit, may retain additional counsel but shall bear the fees and expenses of such counsel unless (i) such Section 4 Person shall have specifically authorized the retaining of such counsel or (ii) the parties to such suit include the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person and such Section 4 Person and the Company or such director, officer or controlling person have been advised by such counsel that one or more legal defenses may be available to it or them which may not be available to such Section 4 Person, in which case such Section 4 Person shall not be entitled to assume the defense of such suit on behalf of the Company or such director, officer or controlling person, notwithstanding its obligation to bear the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel, it being understood, however, that such Section 4 Person shall not, in connection with any one such suit or proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related actions or proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one a separate firm of attorneys (and not more than one local counsel) at any time for all of the Company and any such director, officer or controlling person, which firm shall be designated in writing by the Company. Such Section 4 Person shall not be liable to indemnify any person for any settlement of any such claim effected without such Section 4 Person's prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which such Section 4 Person might otherwise have.
 
(C) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 4 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsections (A) or (B) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (A) or (B) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Section 4 Persons on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Section 4 Person on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to the relative benefits received by the Company from the initial offering and sale of the Securities, on the one hand, and by a holder from receiving Registrable Securities or Exchange Securities registered under the Securities Act, on the other. The relative fault of the parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Section 4 Persons and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (C) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (C).
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 4(C), no Section 4 Person shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the dollar amount of the proceeds received by such Section 4 Person from the sale of any Registrable Securities (after deducting any fees, discounts and commissions applicable thereto) exceeds the amount of any damages which such Section 4 Person has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission, and no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Registrable Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1993 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Section 4 Persons' obligations in this subsection (C) to contribute are several in proportion to the principal amount of Registrable Securities registered or underwritten, as the case may be, by them and not joint.

such information as is necessary to permit sales pursuant to Rule 144 under the 1933 Act, (B) deliver such information to a prospective purchaser as is necessary to permit sales pursuant to Rule 144A under the 1933 Act and (C) take such further action that is reasonable in the circumstances, in each case, to the extent required from time to time to enable such Holder to sell its Registrable Securities without registration under the 1933 Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by (i) Rule 144 under the 1933 Act, as such Rule may be amended from time to time, (ii) Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, as such Rule may be amended from time to time or (iii) any similar rules or regulations hereafter adopted by the SEC.

No Inconsistent Agreements
5.3. . The provisions of this Agreement, including the provisions of this sentence, may not be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given unless the Company has obtained the written consent of Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Registrable Securities; provided that in the event the Company increases the aggregate principal amount of, and issues additional 2022 Notes or 2042 Notes, such additional Securities issued shall be deemed to be included in the definition of Securities hereunder, and any initial purchasers named in any purchase agreement executed in connection with such additional Securities issued shall be deemed to be included in the definition of Initial Purchasers hereunder, and provided further that the Company may amend, modify or supplement the provisions hereof to reflect the increase in the aggregate principal amount of the Securities, including any modification of the Initial Purchasers and any other changes deemed by the Company to be necessary, advisable or appropriate to reflect such increase, without the written consent of the Holders to the extent such amendment, modification or supplement does not have a material adverse effect on the Holders. Without the consent of the Holder of each Security however, no modification may change the provisions relating to the payment of Additional Interest.
Amendments and Waivers
5.4. . All notices and other communications provided for or permitted hereunder shall be made in writing by hand delivery, registered first-class mail, telex, telecopier, or any courier guaranteeing overnight delivery (a) if to a Holder, at the most current address given by such Holder to the Company by means of a notice given in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.4, which address initially is the address set forth in the Purchase Agreement with respect to the Initial Purchasers and the Dealer Manager Agreement with respect to the Dealer Managers; and (b) if to the Company, initially at the Company's address set forth in the Purchase Agreement, and thereafter at such other address of which notice is given in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.4.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF the Issuer has caused this instrument to be duly executed.
