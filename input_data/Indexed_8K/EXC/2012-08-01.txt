Exhibit 99.1
 
News Release
 
 Exelon Corporation (NYSE: EXC) announced second quarter 2012 consolidated earnings as follows:
CHICAGO (Aug. 1, 2012)
 
"We have delivered on our financial and operating commitments with solid second quarter earnings, and are reaffirming our full-year operating earnings guidance of $2.55 to $2.85 per share." said Christopher M. Crane, Exelon's president and CEO. "Our businesses are performing well. Exelon Generation's nuclear fleet achieved a capacity factor of 93.4 percent, and our delivery companies  BGE, ComEd and PECO  provided strong operational and financial performance for the quarter. We are also pleased with the results of our merger integration efforts to date and are confident of realizing the value investors expect from the Exelon-Constellation merger."
Second Quarter Operating Results
Second quarter 2012 earnings include financial results for Constellation Energy (Constellation) and Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (BGE). Therefore, the composition of results of operations from 2012 and 2011 are not comparable for Exelon Generation Company, LLC (Generation), BGE and Exelon.
 
As shown in the table above, Exelon's adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings declined to $0.61 per share in the second quarter of 2012 from $1.05 per share in the second quarter of 2011. Earnings in second quarter 2012 primarily reflected the following negative factors:
 
 
 
 
These factors were partially offset by:
 
 
Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the second quarter of 2012 do not include the following items (after tax) that were included in reported GAAP earnings:
 
 
Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the second quarter of 2011 do not include the following items (after tax) that were included in reported GAAP earnings:
 
Second Quarter and Recent Highlights
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to an exchange offer completed on July 12, 2012, Generation purchased $442 million of the outstanding Old Notes in exchange for issuing $535 million of new notes, including a cash payment of $60 million. Generation incurred gains associated with the early retirement of debt of approximately $13 million as a result of paying a price less than book value of the Old Notes. The gain was recorded as an increase to Long-term Debt within Generation's Consolidated Balance Sheets and will be amortized to income over the life of the debt as a reduction in interest expense.
 
Operating Company Results
consists of owned and contracted electric generating facilities and wholesale and retail customer supply of electric and natural gas products and services, including renewable energy products, risk management services and natural gas exploration and production activities.
Generation
Second quarter 2012 net income was $166 million compared with $443 million in the second quarter of 2011. Second quarter 2012 net income included (all after tax) mark-to-market gains of $120 million from economic hedging activities, unrealized losses of $19 million related to Nuclear Decommissioning Trust (NDT) fund investments, a net impact of $1 million for plant retirements and divestitures, certain costs of $57 million associated with the merger and integration initiatives, amortization of commodity contract intangibles of $281 million and $3 million of amortization of the fair value of certain debt expected to be retired in 2013. Second quarter 2011 net income included (all after tax) mark-to-market losses of $75 million from economic hedging activities, net costs of $10 million associated with the planned retirement of certain fossil generating units, unrealized gains of $6 million related to NDT fund investments and certain costs of $1 million associated with the proposed merger with Constellation.
Excluding the effects of these items, Generation's net income in the second quarter of 2012 decreased $124 million compared with the same quarter in 2011. This decrease primarily reflected:
 
 
 
These items were partially offset by increased nuclear volumes, lower nuclear refueling outage costs and the contribution to Generation's energy margins from Constellation.
 
Generation's average realized margin on all electric sales, including sales to affiliates and excluding trading activity, was $26.15 per megawatt-hour (MWh) in the second quarter of 2012 compared with $41.59 per MWh in the second quarter of 2011.
consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations in northern Illinois.
ComEd
ComEd recorded net income of $42 million in the second quarter of 2012, compared with net income of $114 million in the second quarter of 2011. Second quarter net income in 2011 included an after-tax non-cash credit of $17 million for the recovery of previously incurred costs pursuant to the 2011 distribution rate case order. Excluding the effects of this item, ComEd's net income in the second quarter of 2012 was down $55 million from the same quarter in 2011, primarily due to decreased distribution revenues as a result of a final order issued by the ICC on the 2011 performance based formula rate proceeding under the EIMA, higher operating and maintenance expenses reflecting increased labor and contracting costs driven, in part by EIMA initiatives and one-time benefits recorded in the second quarter of 2011 related to the 2011 ComEd electric distribution rate case.
These unfavorable items were partially offset by the effect of favorable weather in ComEd's service territory and lower interest expense.
In the second quarter of 2012, heating degree-days in the ComEd service territory were down 33.9 percent relative to the same period in 2011 and were 28.9 percent below normal. For the second quarter of 2012, cooling degree-days in the ComEd service territory were up 78.5 percent relative to the same period in 2011 and were 94.0 percent above normal. Total retail electric deliveries increased 3.2 percent quarter over quarter.
Weather-normalized retail electric deliveries decreased 1.3 percent in the second quarter of 2012 relative to 2011, reflecting decreases in deliveries to both residential and small commercial and industrial (C&I) customers that were partially offset by an increase in deliveries to large C&I customers. For ComEd, weather had a favorable after-tax effect of $11 million on second quarter 2012 earnings relative to 2011 and a favorable after-tax effect of $12 million relative to normal weather.
consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations and retail natural gas distribution operations in southeastern Pennsylvania.
PECO
PECO's net income in the second quarter of 2012 was $79 million, compared with $82 million in the second quarter of 2011. Second quarter net income in 2012 included certain after-tax costs of $2 million associated with the merger and integration initiatives. Excluding the effect of this item, PECO's net income in the second quarter of 2012 was down $1 million from the same quarter in 2011, primarily reflecting the effect of unfavorable weather in PECO's service territory and lower load.
These unfavorable items were partially offset by lower operating and maintenance expenses reflecting decreased labor and contracting costs.
In the second quarter of 2012, heating degree-days in the PECO service territory were up 1.8 percent from 2011 and were 27.2 percent below normal. Total retail electric deliveries were down 4.5 percent quarter over quarter. On the retail gas side, deliveries in the second quarter of 2012 were down 6.0 percent from the second quarter of 2011.
 
Weather-normalized retail electric deliveries were down 2.7 percent in the second quarter of 2012 relative to 2011, reflecting declines in deliveries to all customer classes. Weather-normalized retail gas deliveries were down 3.7 percent in the second quarter of 2012. For PECO, weather had an unfavorable after-tax effect of $8 million on second quarter 2012 earnings relative to 2011 and a favorable after-tax effect of $1 million relative to normal weather.
consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations and retail natural gas distribution operations in central Maryland.
BGE
BGE's net income in the second quarter of 2012 was $13 million. The net income included after-tax costs of $1 million associated with the merger and integration initiatives. Excluding the effects of these items, BGE's net income in the second quarter of 2012 was $14 million.
Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings
Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings, which generally exclude significant one-time charges or credits that are not normally associated with ongoing operations, mark-to-market adjustments from economic hedging activities and unrealized gains and losses from NDT fund investments, are provided as a supplement to results reported in accordance with GAAP. Management uses such adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings measures internally to evaluate the company's performance and manage its operations. Reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for historical periods is attached. Additional earnings release attachments, which include the reconciliation on pages 7 and 8, are posted on Exelon's Web site: and have been furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 8-K on August 1, 2012.
