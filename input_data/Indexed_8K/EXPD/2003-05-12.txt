EXPEDITORS ANNOUNCES EARNINGS PER SHARE INCREASE OF 15%
 
SEATTLE, WASHINGTON  May 7, 2003, Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPD) today announced net earnings of $25,119,000 for the first quarter of 2003, compared with $22,230,000 for the same quarter of 2002, an increase of 13%.  Net revenues for the first quarter increased 16% to $170,026,000 as compared with $146,706,000 reported for the first quarter of 2002.  Total revenues and operating income were $556,346,000 and $37,529,000 for the first quarter of 2003 compared with $449,540,000 and $32,646,000 for the same quarter of 2002, increases of 24% and 15%, respectively.   Diluted net earnings per share for the first quarter was $.23 as compared with $.20 for the same quarter in 2002, an increase of 15%.  The company also reported that same store net revenues and operating income increased 16% and 15%, respectively during the first quarter of 2003 as compared with the same period in 2002.
 
"In light of everything that has transpired since our last earnings release, we believe that these results are more than respectable," said Peter J. Rose, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  "In fact, we think they are nothing short of amazing.  The world situation provided plenty of challenges during the first quarter, but our employees, particularly those in the Far and Middle East, were equal to the task.  As always, these results are really about their extraordinary efforts to serve our customers," Rose continued.
 
"This first quarter of 2003 saw strong year over year growth in each month.  However, the end of quarter rush that we usually expect in late March did not materialize in 2003.  Much as we may all wish for an easy life, it seems very likely that business uncertainty is the order of the day.  That having been said, we accept that good companies are strengthened by meeting and defeating strong challenges.  We haven't shrunk from a challenge yet and we don't intend to start now," Rose concluded.
