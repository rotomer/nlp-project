"The story this quarter was really pre-announced back in the middle of September," said Peter J. Rose, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  "We're not big on making predications, but our August results made it clear that we needed to comment on the financial implications of emerging trends.  We went on to have a fundamentally sound September and we continue to work to catch up with the carrier rate increases. Margins did improve somewhat as the third quarter concluded, but growth in airfreight tonnage was not sufficient to make up for the August shortfall.  All things considered, this quarter illustrates the benefits of having a well-balanced logistics service offering as our ocean and brokerage services were strong and this strength more than kept us moving forward," Rose added.
 
"We are grateful to our employees, who have proven over the long run to be more than capable of overcoming any short-term challenge we may have faced," Rose stated.  "At the same time, we have to be grateful for the fact that we were able to report record third quarter results without having to take drastic cost-cutting steps that could have affected future initiatives," Rose concluded.
