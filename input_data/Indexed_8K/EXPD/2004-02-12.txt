EXPEDITORS ANNOUNCES QUARTERLY EARNINGS OF $.33 PER SHARE
 
SEATTLE, WASHINGTON  February 10, 2004, Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPD) today announced quarterly net earnings of $36,365,000 for the fourth quarter of 2003, compared with $35,996,000 for the same quarter of 2002, an increase of 1%.  Net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2003 increased 2% to $205,374,000 as compared with $201,602,000 reported for the fourth quarter of 2002.  Total revenues and operating income were $731,413,000 and $58,548,000 in 2003 compared with $691,213,000 and $54,957,000 for the same quarter of 2002, increases of 6% and 7%, respectively.   Diluted net earnings per share for both the fourth quarter 2003 and 2002 were $.33. The company also reported that same store net revenues were flat and operating income increased 5% for the fourth quarter of 2003 when compared with 2002.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2003, net earnings rose to $121,952,000 from $112,529,000 in 2002, an increase of 8%.  Net revenues for the year increased to $750,510,000 from $682,213,000 for 2002, up 10%. Total revenues and operating income for the year were $2,624,941,000 and $186,762,000 in 2003 compared with $2,296,903,000 and $171,009,000 for the same period in 2002, increases of 14% and 9%, respectively.  Diluted net earnings per share for the year 2003 were $1.12 as compared with $1.03 for the same period of 2002, an increase of 9%. Same store net revenues and operating income increased 10% and 9%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2003, when compared with the same period of 2002.
 
The fourth quarter 2003 results include a $.03 per share increase in operating income as a result of the elimination of accruals for inter-company differences made unnecessary by enhancements in the company's inter-company automated clearinghouse technology implemented in the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2003.  In addition, the results also include a net $.02 per share increase in additional tax expense ($9.5 million) as a result of the company's decision to provide full U.S. taxation on all un-remitted foreign earnings and to eliminate certain tax expense ($8.0 million) which the company has analyzed and determined will not ultimately be paid out.
 
"The saying that this year's victory is next year's hurdle' could have been coined in anticipation of the kind of situation we faced during the fourth quarter of 2003. The fact that the fourth quarter one year earlier benefited from the west coast port disruption was no doubt understood by everyone.  We just had a problem quantifying how much of what happened in 2002 was sustainable and how much was attributable to short-term market forces.  What we said was that it would be realistic to expect the fourth quarter to be similar to the third quarter of 2003 and in that context, we are certainly satisfied with these results," said Peter J. Rose, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
 
"During this quarter, we modified our joint venture in the People's Republic of China and we now own 75% of that entity.  With the prospects of future growth, we took advantage of an opportunity to increase our commitment to this important market.  We are very grateful for our sponsor/partner in the People's Republic of China - they have been, and will remain, an integral part of our success in this market.   Finally, as we begin our 25 year, it is perhaps an appropriate time to consider how far we have come in a relatively short period of time and we have to once again acknowledge the contributions of all of our employees. Whenever we are asked what makes us different, the answer always starts with our people," Rose concluded.
