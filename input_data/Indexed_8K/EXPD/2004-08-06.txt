"In reviewing the second quarter, the first word that comes to mind is WOW'," commented Peter J. Rose, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  "The more we analyzed these results, the more we realized that we would not have dared dreamt it any better than it actually was.  We were particularly pleased with the balanced performance.  On a quarter-over-quarter basis, comparing operating income in the second quarter of 2004 with 2003, Europe was up 60%, the Far East was up 54%, and the Americas, which includes the corporate office, was up 33% before accounting for a $2,000,000 impairment write-off related to an equity investment in a privately-held technology company," Rose went on to say.
 
"During the last year, we focused on improving customer service and strengthening our district sales programs.  We think that these efforts, aided by what is generally perceived to be a strengthening economy, really paid off this past quarter. Once again we must give all the credit for our results where credit is truly dueto our employees and to our customers.    We're grateful to both, and, obviously, their continued support is what makes all the difference at Expeditors," Rose concluded.
