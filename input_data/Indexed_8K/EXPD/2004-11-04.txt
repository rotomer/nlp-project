The company also reported that same store net revenues and operating income increased 21% and 36%, respectively, for the third quarter of 2004 when compared with 2003.
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2004, net earnings rose to $112,563,000 from $85,587,000 in 2003, an increase of 32%.  Net revenues for the nine months increased to $665,077,000 from $545,136,000 for 2003, up 22%.

"There isn't a lot we can add to this story as these numbers pretty much speak for themselves.  We continued to experience significant volume increases during the third quarter as our airfreight tonnage was up over 27% while the ocean NVOCC container count increased over 24%.  With increased volumes came margin pressures in both the air and ocean products.  Fortunately, the increases in cargo volume allowed us to compensate for the higher carrier costs, particularly in ocean freight," said Peter J. Rose, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
 
"Again, all the credit belongs to our employees as their hard work made these results possible," Rose stated.  "The fourth quarter is shaping up to be a challenge.  In response to ever rising fuel costs, the asset-based carriers are raising surcharges so rapidly that it is a real chore to smoothly communicate market conditions to our customers," Rose concluded.
