EXPEDITORS' NET EARNINGS INCREASE 19%
 
SEATTLE, WASHINGTON  May 4, 2005, Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPD)  today announced net earnings of $37,744,000 for the first quarter of 2005, compared with $31,844,000 for the same quarter of 2004, an increase of 19%.  Net revenues for the first quarter increased 14% to $230,683,000 as compared with $202,496,000 reported for the first quarter of 2004.  Total revenues and operating income were $825,164,000 and $57,557,000 in 2005 compared with $686,850,000 and $48,808,000 for the same quarter of 2004, an increase of 20% and 18%, respectively.  Diluted net earnings per share for the first quarter was $.34 as compared with $.29 for the same quarter in 2004, an increase of 17%.  The company also reported that same store net revenues and operating income increased 13% and 18%, respectively, during the first quarter of 2005 as compared with the same period in 2004.
 
"We are certainly satisfied with what we accomplished for the first quarter of 2005," said Peter J. Rose, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  "Given that we are completing our 25 full year, we are perhaps a little more reflective than usual, but it may be time to put these results into some historical perspective.  It wasn't too long ago, 1997 in fact, when we only did slightly more business for an entire year than we just did in what historically has been our weakest quarter of the year.  We think this is indicative of what will happen when you recruit, train and mentor the right people, maintain a clear and consistent focus on customer service, and never stop trying to develop and deploy strong technological solutions to meet the unique needs of each customer," Rose went on to say.

"This quarter's net revenue growth, measured year-over-year, was pretty much uniform across all our products. We also managed to expand our operating margin by a few basis points.  That was no small feat, particularly given that the first quarter of 2004 was an exceptionally strong quarter," Rose continued.  "We opened several new offices during the first quarter and have continued to strengthen our position in the People's Republic of China, something we think bodes well for the future.  We look forward to the challenges that the next three quarters will bring," Rose concluded.
