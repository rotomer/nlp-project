Exhibit 99.1
 
 
SEATTLE, WASHINGTON  August 2, 2005, Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPD) today announced net earnings of $44,644,000 for the second quarter of 2005, compared with $37,612,000 for the same quarter of 2004, an increase of 19%.  Net revenues for the second quarter of 2005 increased 13% to $250,660,000 as compared with $222,223,000 reported for the second quarter of 2004.  Total revenues and operating income were $927,999,000 and $68,305,000 in 2005 compared with $798,666,000 and $58,246,000 for the same quarter of 2004, increases of 16% and 17%, respectively.  Diluted net earnings per share for the second quarter were $.40 as compared with $.34 for the same quarter in 2004, an increase of 18%.  The company also reported that same store net revenues and operating income increased 12% and 17%, respectively, for the second quarter of 2005 when compared with 2004.
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2005, net earnings rose to $82,388,000 from $69,456,000 in 2004, an increase of 19%. Net revenues for the six months increased to $481,343,000 from $424,719,000 for 2004, up 13%. Total revenues and operating income for the six months were $1,753,163,000 and $125,862,000 in 2005 compared with $1,485,516,000 and $107,054,000 for the same period in 2004, increases of 18%, respectively.  Diluted net earnings per share for the first two quarters of 2005 were $.74 as compared with $.63 for the same period of 2004, an increase of 17%. Same store net revenues and operating income increased 13% and 17%, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2005 when compared with same period of 2004.
 
"These are solid results, particularly in light of the fact that this increase comes off of a very strong historical base.  This quarter was interesting because it started slowly and yet business accelerated throughout the quarter to the point where June 2005 was a record month.  In fact, operating income was nearly 20% higher than our previous best.  This strong finish appears to have been driven by customers in the retail area rushing imports of several commodities from the People's Republic of China for which safeguards would be closing imminently," commented Peter J. Rose, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
 
"It is noteworthy that despite the challenges that occurred with the surge in business late in the quarter, our customer-service and supplier management programs appear to have paid off in the right way.  Once again, our employees have demonstrated the ability to keep freight rolling and our customer's supply chains untangled.  It is their hard work and dedication that provides the best customer service in the industry. Without their efforts and commitment to constantly push the limits of excellence, Expeditors would not enjoy the kind of organic growth and financial success that has created and sustained shareholder value for the last quarter of a century," Rose concluded.
