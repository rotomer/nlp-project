"Execution and efficiency were the tale of this record quarter," said Peter J. Rose, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "While we continued to experience significant volume increases in air and ocean freight during the third quarter of 2005, our real profitability increases came from our ongoing efforts to increase productivity in the delivery of our services," Rose continued.
 
"This has not been a one year story.  If you go back to the third quarter of 2001, you would see that Expeditors has basically doubled in size in the last four years.  That is a real accomplishment, particularly when you look at the magnitude of the numbers.  And, we didn't really purchase this growthwe did it ourselves, organically.  A stable environment fosters consistent, reliable and focused customer service by eliminating the distractions that employees in merged companies feel.  As always, we'd like to formally acknowledge the contribution of each employee to these third quarter results.  Once again, you really made it happen," Rose concluded.
