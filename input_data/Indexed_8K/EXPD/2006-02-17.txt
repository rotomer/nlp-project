EXPEDITORS ANNOUNCES 39% OPERATING INCOME INCREASE
SEATTLE, WASHINGTON  February 14, 2006, Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPD) today announced quarterly net earnings of $80,477,000 for the fourth quarter of 2005, compared with $43,563,000 for the same quarter of 2004, an increase of 85%.  Net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2005 increased 23% to $296,341,000 as compared with $241,160,000 reported for the fourth quarter of 2004.  Total revenues and operating income were $1,102,176,000 and $92,848,000 in 2005 compared with $934,795,000 and $66,571,000 for the same quarter of 2004, increases of 18% and 39%, respectively.  Diluted net earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $.72 as compared with $.39 for the same quarter in 2004, an increase of 85%.  The company also reported that same store net revenues and operating income increased 22% and 39%, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2005 when compared with 2004.  As previously discussed in an 8-K dated January 31, 2006, the fourth quarter and full year results for 2005 include a $21,680,000 tax benefit ($.19 per share) as a result of a one-time election under section 965 of the Internal Revenue Code.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2005, net earnings rose to $218,634,000 from $156,126,000 in 2004, an increase of 40%. Net revenues for the year increased to $1,059,609,000 from $906,237,000 for 2004, up 17%. Total revenues and operating income for the year were $3,901,781,000 and $304,510,000 in 2005 compared with $3,317,499,000 and $241,045,000 for the same period in 2004, increases of 18% and 26%, respectively.  Diluted net earnings per share for the year 2005 were $1.96 as compared with $1.41 for the same period of 2004, an increase of 39%. Same store net revenues and operating income increased 16% and 26%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2005, when compared with the same period of 2004.
 
"This quarter has to be viewed as a fitting end to what was an outstanding year," said Peter J. Rose, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Our operating income was 27.6% of net revenue during the fourth quarter of 2004, but this expanded to an amazing 31.3% in 2005 as we were able to handle a significant increase in freight without having to add a commensurate amount of expense.  This positive leverage was a result of our ongoing process and productivity initiatives.  By every measure, our people did a superb job executing in what was really a very difficult environment: simply put, there was just a bunch of freight out there," continued Rose.
 
"Air freight volumes were strong during the fourth quarter and ocean freight, which was a little subdued in November 2005 compared with October, came through very strong in December," Rose said.  "We think that a 39% operating income increase off of our already sizeable base is extremely indicative of just how well we executed during the busiest time of the year. We just finished recording our second straight one billion dollar quarter and this put us over the top to enjoy our first year with over one billion dollars in net revenue.  More than empty talk, these are real measures of progress," Rose concluded.
