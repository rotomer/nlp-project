"You take results like these any time you can get them." commented Peter J. Rose, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.   "The second quarter of 2006 was strong across the board.  We remain encouraged by the degree that our operational productivity and efficiency initiatives continue to allow us to increase business volumes without a commensurate increase in operating costs.  We were also pleased to see our fee-based ocean productsorder management and ocean forwarding, - making year over year gains  this is something that we haven't seen in quite some time."
"Our culture makes customer service and profitability management the focus of each and every employee.  Placing this responsibility beyond the purview of a small group empowers those who are most able to execute and deliver." Rose continued.  "The combined efforts of every individual from the most senior District Manager to the newest runner determines how we deliver customer service and how well we generate profits.  Our results reflect the fact that our employees understand the culture, live it and improve upon it, each and every day.  To paraphrase Robert Frost, that makes all the difference" Rose concluded.
Expeditors is a global logistics company.  Headquartered in Seattle, Washington, the company employs trained professionals in 167 offices and 56 international service centers located on six continents linked into a seamless worldwide network through an integrated information management system.  Services include air and ocean freight forwarding, vendor consolidation, customs clearance, marine insurance, distribution and other value added international logistics services.
In accordance with the provisions of FAS 123R, the Company has elected to apply the modified retrospective method to prior year's reported numbers.  The Modified Retrospective Method calls for prior reported numbers to be adjusted to reflect the expensing of stock options, as has been required for disclosure in the company's 10-K reports since 1996 and in the Company's 10-Q reports since 2002.  Accordingly certain 2005 numbers which have been adjusted retrospectively to show the effect of stock compensation expense, will not agree with the figures reported in the 2005 second quarter press release dated August 2, 2005.  Diluted weighted shares outstanding for 2005 are also reported consistent with the requirements of FAS 123R.  Accordingly, the 2005 diluted weighted shares outstanding amounts shown in this press release will not agree with the amounts reported in above-referenced 2005 second quarter press release.
