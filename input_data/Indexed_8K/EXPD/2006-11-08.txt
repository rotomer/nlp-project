"We continued to benefit from market share expansion and productivity gains during the 3
rd
"We have been impressed with both the magnitude and the balance of organic growth we continue to experience. We believe in our model.  In what is an increasingly competitive market, we continue to focus on providing superior customer service.  Our market share expansion would indicate that we continue to be successful in that undertaking. The efficiency gains we continue to achieve have been key in improving our operating margins, which we believe validates the financial strength of our model.  As always, we hasten to point out one other core belief we have at Expeditors: That people and culture do make a difference. All facets of our success can be traced back to these two elements.  It is the efforts of our people, who embody and perpetuate that unique Expeditors' culture, which creates results like these.  " Rose concluded.

(1) In accordance with the provisions of FAS 123R, the Company has elected to apply the modified retrospective method to prior year's reported numbers.  The Modified Retrospective Method calls for prior reported numbers to be adjusted to reflect the expensing of stock options, as has been required for disclosure in the company's 10-K reports since 1996 and in the Company's 10-Q reports since 2002.  Accordingly certain 2005 numbers which have been adjusted retrospectively to show the effect of stock compensation expense, will not agree with the figures reported in the 2005 second quarter press release dated August 2, 2005.  Diluted weighted shares outstanding for 2005 are also reported consistent with the requirements of FAS 123R.  Accordingly, the 2005 diluted weighted shares outstanding amounts shown in this press release will not agree with the amounts reported in above-referenced 2005 second quarter press release.
