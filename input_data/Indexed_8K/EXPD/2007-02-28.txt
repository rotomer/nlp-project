that its 2006 year-to-date diluted earnings per share (EPS) amount of $1.07, previously reported in their press release on February 13, 2007, has been corrected to $1.06.  As corrected, the fourth sentence in the second paragraph of the earlier release should have read:
On February 26, 2007, Expeditors International of Washington, Inc., a Washington corporation, issued a press release announcing
 per share for 2005, an increase of 23%."
"Diluted net earnings per share for the year 2006 were $1.06 as compared with $.86

The $.01 difference in the year-to-date EPS amount was due to a correction to the calculation of diluted weighted average shares outstanding.  No other amounts in the previous release were affected other than year-to-date EPS and diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the three months and year ended December 31, 2006.  A corrected copy of the Financial Highlights and the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the three months and the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, accompanies this release.
The correction to the calculation of diluted weighted average shares outstanding was made when the Company identified that a default setting in the parameter screen of the program, used to assist in this calculation, was set incorrectly in the original calculations.  The Company has modified its procedures over the review and verification of parameter settings and program output.
A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.

 quarter of 2005.  Ocean freight volumes were very strong throughout the entire quarter and our brokerage product just continues to reliably roll along, taking market share as it goes.  Our ability to provide alternatives in both the air and ocean transportation markets, with consistent global service, quality and visibility standards coupled with a seamless brokerage product is providing some definite advantages." Rose remarked.
"We'll take these fourth quarter results, particularly given the rather stiff comparisons we were up against," said Peter J. Rose, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Growth in airfreight was good, particularly viewed in context of the blowout 4

"We continue to do all the right things right. We move forward by enhancing our systems, improving our productivity and developing our people," Rose went on to say.  "Our unrelenting focus on customer service brought in nearly $725 million more business in 2006 than in 2005. From a historical perspective, we grew nearly as much in 2006 as we did in those first 15 years-from 1981 until 1996.  Despite the rigors of Sarbanes-Oxley, stock option expensing, natural disasters or whatever other obstacles present themselves, our employees are prepared to execute and get the job doneand they've done just that. We're grateful to every last one of them." Rose added. "Looking forward to 2007, there is no time to rest on past success. We cannot lose touch with what's most important-our people and our customers. And we cannot forget from whence we've come'." Rose concluded.

All share and per share amounts have been adjusted for the 2-for-1 stock split effective June 2006
 
In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R, the Company has elected to apply the modified retrospective method to prior year's reported numbers.  The Modified Retrospective Method calls for prior reported numbers to be adjusted to reflect the expensing of stock options, as has been required for disclosure in the company's 10-K reports since 1996 and in the Company's 10-Q reports since 2002.  Accordingly certain 2005 numbers which have been adjusted retrospectively to show the effect of stock compensation expense, will not agree with the figures reported in the 2005 fourth quarter press release dated February 14, 2006.  Diluted weighted shares outstanding for 2005 are also reported consistent with the requirements of SFAS 123R.  Accordingly, the 2005 diluted weighted shares outstanding amounts shown in this press release will not agree with the amounts reported in above-referenced 2005 fourth quarter press release.
