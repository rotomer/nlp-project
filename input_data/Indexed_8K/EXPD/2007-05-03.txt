Exhibit 99.1
 
SEATTLE, WASHINGTON  May 2, 2007, Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (NASDAQ: EXPD) today announced net earnings of $59,288,000 for the first quarter of 2007, compared with $52,352,000
for the same quarter of 2006, an increase of 13%.  Net revenues for the first quarter increased 12% to $334,136,000 as compared with $298,142,000 reported for the first quarter of 2006.  Total revenues and operating income were $1,118,946,000 and $94,525,000 in 2007, compared with $1,026,537,000 and $85,401,000 for the same quarter of 2006, increases of 9% and 11%, respectively.  Diluted net earnings per share for the first quarter were $.27 as compared with $.24 for the same quarter in 2006, an increase of 13%.  The company also reported that same store net revenues and operating income increased 12% and 11% respectively, during the first quarter of 2007 as compared with the same period in 2006.
"We were quite gratified to report double-digit growth in the first quarter of 2007." said Peter J. Rose, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  "We've known this was going to be a difficult quarter since we reported last year's first quarter results---we were up 70% over 2005.  For us, that old adage about last year's victory being this year's hurdle has never been more true. These were the toughest year-over-year comps that we've ever faced and thanks to the consistent efforts of our employees, we think we've come through just fine. " Rose continued.
"This first quarter of 2007 was actually quite challenging, aggressive comparables aside.  As expected, March was the strongest month of the quarterand was a record March.  Ocean volumes were good, despite a softer pricing environment as compared with the first quarter of 2006.  Our air product did just fine, from both an increased tonnage and yield management perspective and the brokerage group, as they typically do, made steady progress.  All this in what could have been regarded as a somewhat tougher general environment than we saw during last year's first quarter." Rose explained. "However, we do measure our internal progress by how well we do at achieving our own expectations.  Regardless of what might, or might not, be going on in the global economy, we always expect to do a little better this year than we did last year.  Our first quarter results, on a net earnings basis, were very close to what was reflected in our 2007 budget.  Taken in a net earnings context, we've nearly doubled our first quarter profitability since 2005 and we think that we've managed that growth pretty well.  Finally, we'd be remiss in closing without publicly thanking our employees for their outstanding efforts and our customers, our vendor/partners, and our shareholders for their support.  Thank you one and all!" Rose concluded.
