"This quarter's results once again illustrate that steady growth is reliant upon both consistent and fundamental execution. We experienced good solid growth in all of our major geographic areas." commented Peter J. Rose, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  "When Yogi Berra said, It ain't like football. You can't make up no trick plays' he was speaking of baseball, but he might just as well have been talking about the global logistics business.  Indeed, there are no trick plays' or short cuts that can bail you out in this game.  When the final box scores are published in this business, those who have attempted to rely on either, have typically found themselves thrown out at home.  While the spectacular, but intermittent long-ball game may garner the headlines, it's the more tedious but consistent short-ball game that takes home the trophies." Rose said.
"One achievement that has served us well at Expeditors has been the development of service offerings which have complementary strengths and compensatory balance, both geographically and across product lines.  We benefited this quarter by capabilities that allowed us to take advantage of shifts in global growth.  As fortunes and events in the global economy create favorable conditions in any one area, we're increasingly positioned to take advantage of these opportunities.  The good thing about a global business model, such as ours, is that opportunities which develop in one area typically create some kind of associated benefit in another.  At the end of the day it is our employeesexperienced, knowledgeable and well-trained professionalswho make this happen...and they are the ones who deserve the credit.  We believe it is their continued commitment to execute a little bit better today than yesterday, day in and day out, that makes the difference in delivering the kind of customer service that sets us apart." Rose concluded.
Expeditors is a global logistics company.   Headquartered in Seattle, Washington, the company employs trained professionals in 172 full-service offices, 61 satellite locations and 5 international service centers located on six continents linked into a seamless worldwide network through an integrated information management system.
