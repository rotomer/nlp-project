"We are very encouraged by these record quarterly results, particularly in light of what we hear bantered about in the media regarding the strength of the global economy" said Peter J. Rose, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We believe these results illustrate what we are able to accomplish when we are united in our efforts to grow our business through a continued and consistent focus on providing quality customer service. We are best served by focusing on our opportunities and ignoring the pundits and prognosticators who choose to spend their time analyzing only the challenges, which will always exist in some form or fashion.  At Expeditors we think the glass should always be half full, and it's up to us, not external factors, to keep it that way." Rose continued.

"Fundamentally, this quarter was very sound.  Our people have worked smarter as they have continued to work harder. Those efficiency gains showed up this quarter as we were successful in bringing labor costs as a percentage of net revenue back into proven historical ranges.  We also experienced a net revenue growth rate that exceeded the growth rate in operating overhead expenses.  The upshot of all this was a record high operating income margin of 31% of net revenuesomething we regard as truly significant.  We never tire of giving the real credit to those to whom it rightfully belongs.  We have the best people, and we're grateful to them for their professionalism and for their dedication. They're the ones, quarter after quarter, who really make it happen." Rose said.  "Finally, we're sure that everyone is expecting us to say something about the investigation of the international airfreight forwarding industry being conducted by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the subpoena we received in October. Rest assured that we are taking this whole issue very seriously.  We have retained the services of a noted law firm with a stellar reputation in these matters to help us comply with the DOJ's subpoena. They are also assisting us in conducting a very rigorous self-review.  As part of this process, we have met with and continue to co-operate with the DOJ. 
 There has been no determination made at this stage that any anti-competitive behavior occurred
.  We are doing our utmost to conduct "business as usual."    It is our intention not to disrupt our employees' routine or their ability to meet the needs of our customers. Thank you for your understanding and for your continued support." Rose concluded.
