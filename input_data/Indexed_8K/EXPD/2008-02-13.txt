SEATTLE, WASHINGTON  February 12, 2008, Expeditors International of Washington, Inc.

"We had a very solid 2007 and can look back with satisfaction at what we have accomplished this year." said Peter J. Rose, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We also think we did just fine in the fourth quarter considering some of the unanticipated costs we had to absorb relative to the Department of Justice's (DOJ) ongoing investigation of the major players in our industry.  Legal fees and record keeping requirements associated with complying with the DOJ's subpoena cost us nearly $4 million this quarter.  We're not making excuses, we're just explaining," Rose commented.
 
"Looking forward to 2008, as we witness the political and economic media pundit doing his or her best to talk us all into participating in some kind of a celebratory recession, we'll continue to do what we do best. We will focus on improving customer service and gaining market share.  If we'd listened to these people back in 1981, we would have never started this Company in the first place.  As is our practice whenever the economic doom and gloomsayers' show up, we've officially banned the use of the R' word here at Expeditors.  When others perceive things are slowing in the short term, we see opportunity for the long term," Rose concluded.
