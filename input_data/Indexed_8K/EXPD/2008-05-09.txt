EXPEDITORS ANNOUNCES NET EARNINGS INCREASE OF 12%
 
SEATTLE, WASHINGTON  May 7, 2008, Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (NASDAQ: EXPD) today announced net earnings of $66,472,000 for the first quarter of 2008, as compared with $59,288,000
for the same quarter of 2007, an increase of 12%.  Net revenues for the first quarter increased 12% to $374,328,000 as compared with $334,136,000 reported for the first quarter of 2007.  Total revenues and operating income were $1,307,321,000 and $105,564,000 in 2008, as compared with $1,118,946,000 and $94,525,000 for the same quarter of 2007, increases of 17% and 12%, respectively.  Diluted net earnings per share for the first quarter were $.30 as compared with $.27 for the same quarter in 2007, an increase of 11%.  The Company also reported that same store net revenues and operating income both increased 12%, respectively, during the first quarter of 2008, as compared with the same period in 2007.
 
"We feel very good about these first quarter 2008 results. They are balanced from a global contribution perspective and they reinforce our long-held premise that Expeditors' core growth potential comes from taking market share" said Peter J. Rose, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Despite having spent a good part of each day side stepping chicken little' and the associated pieces of falling sky' that follow him about, our employees actively sought out new business opportunities this quarter.  This allowed us to expand market share by fulfilling our customer's increasingly complex supply-chain requirements." Rose explained.
 
"Typically every year this business presents some kind of unique challenge. Apart from the ongoing Department of Justice investigation of our industry (which cost us over $1.6 million in legal fees alone during the first quarter), in 2008 we've had to endure the non-stop' 24-hour media sound bite harangue about the economy.  We understand that while the general public's perception of the state of the economy can't be totally ignored, neither can it be accepted as a justification for lowering our standards or diminishing our intensity." Rose continued.  "So much of this is about maintaining confidence through keeping things in proper perspective. For instance, one needs to remember that even by the reckoning of the most pessimistic pundits, the economy in 2008 is pretty much the same size as it was last year in 2007.  Given that we all felt pretty good about prospects last year, we don't believe there is any good reason why we can't generate market share gains in 2008. We're grateful that our customers, our employees and our key service providers all share this same visionone that has been a cornerstone of our philosophy since our inception" Rose concluded.
