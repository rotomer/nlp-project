Diluted net earnings per share for the second quarter were $.32, as compared with $.30 for the same quarter in 2007, an increase of 7%. The Company also reported that same store net revenues and operating income increased 12% and 11%, respectively, for the second quarter of 2008 when compared with 2007.
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2008, net earnings rose to $137,721,000 from $124,777,000 in 2007, an increase of 10%. Net revenues for the six months increased to $771,653,000 from $688,710,000 for 2007, up 12%. Total revenues and operating income for the six months were $2,761,576,000 and $218,535,000 in 2008, as compared with $2,377,564,000 and $196,263,000 for the same period in 2007, increases of 16% and 11%, respectively.

Same store net revenues and operating income increased 12% and 11%, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2008 when compared with same period of 2007.
 
"This was fundamentally a very strong and a very sound quarter."
commented Peter J. Rose, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We had good solid revenue and net revenue growth of 16% and 12%, respectively, and we did an excellent job of managing those costs over which we had control. Despite absorbing over $5.3 million of non-routine legal and related expenses related to the ongoing Department of Justice investigation, we still managed to post double digit operating income growth of 11%. Without the effect of these non-routine expenses, our operating income would have been up 16%(1) over operating income reported for the second quarter of 2007. To us, those are numbers to be proud of, particularly in light of the stories that seem to be omni-present in the media these days." Rose said.
Economic Armageddon
du jour
 
"We understand that there are struggles going on out there in pockets of the economy, but we're also fortunate enough, with our broad customer base, to see things that are going extremely well for some companies. Accordingly, we continue to ban the use of the "R" word here and direct our focus on expanding our market share and increasing our customer service capabilities. As always, we'd be remiss not to credit the success we have to the dedication and commitment of our employees. They have always executed well, in good times or in times that many have regarded as difficult. We at Expeditors think it would be a big mistake for anyone to count us out' early.  That isn't in our culture." Rose concluded.

(1) Second Quarter 2008 Operating Income of $112,971,000, with $5,322,000 of non-routine legal and related expenses added back would have been $118,293,000.  This would have been a 16% increase over the $101,738,000 Operating Income amount reported in the Second Quarter 2007 results.
