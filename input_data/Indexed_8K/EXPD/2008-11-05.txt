"These record quarterly results make a very significant statement. They show what can be accomplished when a company's culture rewards its employees based upon real world' profitability measurements that reinforce responsible risk and return decisions. Our profitability measurements are grounded in the kinds of economic reality that requires a long-term commitment to both generating and sustaining profitability through providing quality customer service. There are no short-term, financially-engineered' profitability gimmicks in these numbers that will unravel over time because they lack economic substance," said Peter J. Rose, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "These results also show that we are capable of executing effectively in the face of some rather challenging circumstances. Particularly noteworthy of our continued commitment to productivity improvement is the quarter's record-high 31.6% operating margin (operating income divided by net revenue). As always, it is the efforts of our people and their cultural buy-in that made these achievements possible. We've always said that we have the best people in the industryand they continue to prove that." Rose continued.
"The irony of reporting record quarterly profits in such tumultuous economic times is certainly not lost on us. We have great sympathy for those who have been victimized by the greed, avarice and deliberate desertion of time-proven principles of sound financial management that caused this mess in the first place. If a silver lining is to come out of all this turmoil, hopefully it will be a return to the realms of financial sanity where companies that manage prudently are differentiated from those that don't. Fortunately for our employees, our customers and our shareholders, it is our unique culture that has always differentiated us and it continues to do so now, at a time when such differentiation is critically needed. Here at Expeditors, we don't need to go back to basics', because we've never left them." Rose concluded.
