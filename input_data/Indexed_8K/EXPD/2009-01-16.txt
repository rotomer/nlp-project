Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year
On January 15, 2009, the Board of Directors of Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (the "Company") amended Article II and Article IV of the Company Bylaws.
The amendments to Article II specify the procedures by which a shareholder may submit nominees for director or submit business for consideration at a shareholder meeting, including the notice provisions and required disclosures that a shareholder must provide when submitting a director nomination or other business proposal.
The amendments to Article IV change the vote standards for contested and non-contested director elections. In an uncontested election, a director must receive a majority of the votes cast in order to be elected. The vote standard in a contested election remains a plurality. In addition, the amendments (i) establish a maximum 90-day hold-over term of office for an incumbent director who fails to receive a majority vote in an uncontested election, and (ii) clarify that a director's resignation may take effect prior to the appointment of a successor.
A copy of the Bylaws as amended is attached to this Form 8-K as Exhibit 3.2. The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to Exhibit 3.2.

: The registered office of the corporation shall be located in the State of Washington at such place as may be fixed from time to time by the Board of Directors upon filing of such notices as may be required by law, and the registered agent shall have a business office identical with such registered office.
Article II
 
Shareholders Meetings
(1)       
Meeting Place
: All meetings of the shareholders shall be held at the principal place of business of the corporation, or at such other place as shall be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors, and the place at which any such meeting shall be held shall be stated in the notice of the meeting.
(2)       
Annual Meeting Time
: The annual meeting of the shareholders for the election of directors and for the transaction of such other business as may properly come before the meeting, shall be held each year on the second Wednesday of May at the hour of ten oclock a.m. if not a legal holiday, and if a legal holiday, then on the day following, at the same hour. The time and place of holding any annual meeting may be changed by resolution of the Board of Directors, provided that notification of such change shall meet the notice requirements pursuant to Article II(6) hereunder.
(3)       
Business at Annual and Special Meetings
. No business may be transacted at an annual or special meeting of shareholders other than business that is
(a)       specified in a notice of meeting given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or an authorized committee thereof and in the form provided by Article II(6),
(b)       otherwise brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or an authorized committee thereof, or
(c)        otherwise brought before an annual meeting or special meeting:
 
Clause (c) of this Article II(3) shall be the exclusive means for Noticing Shareholders to make director nominations or submit other business before an annual or special meeting of shareholders (other than proposals brought under Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act) and included in the corporations notice of meeting, which proposals are not governed by these Bylaws).
(4)       
Annual Meeting - Order of Business
: At the annual meeting of shareholders, the order of business shall be as follows:
(5)       
Special Meetings
: Special meetings of the shareholders for any purpose may be called at any time by the President or Board of Directors, or the holders of not less than one-tenth of all shares entitled to vote at the meeting.
(6)       
Notice
: Notice of the place, if any, date and time of any shareholders meeting shall be given to each shareholder entitled to vote. Notice of a special meeting shall also state the purpose or purposes for which the meeting has been called. Unless otherwise provided in the Washington Business Corporation Act, notice shall be given at least 10 days but not more than 60 days before the date of the meeting.
(a)       Notice Provided in a Tangible Medium: Notice to any shareholder may be provided in a tangible medium and may be transmitted by mail, private carrier, personal delivery,
 
-2-
 
 
telegraph, teletype, telephone or wire or wireless equipment which transmits a facsimile of the notice.
(b)       Notice Provided in an Electronic Transmission: Notice to any shareholder may be provided in an electronic transmission and be electronically transmitted. Notice to shareholders in an electronic transmission is effective only with respect to shareholders that have consented, in the form of a record, to receive electronically transmitted notices and designated in the consent the address, location or system to which these notices may be electronically transmitted. Notice provided in an electronic transmission includes material required or permitted to accompany the notice by the Washington Business Corporation Act or other applicable statute or regulation. A shareholder that has consented to receipt of electronically transmitted notices may revoke such consent by delivering a revocation to the corporation in the form of a record. The consent of a shareholder to receive notice by electronic transmission is revoked if the corporation is unable to electronically transmit two consecutive notices given by the corporation in accordance with the consent, and this inability becomes known to the Secretary of the corporation, the transfer agent or any other person responsible for giving the notice. The inadvertent failure by the corporation to treat this inability as a revocation does not invalidate any meeting or other action.
(c)       Posting Notice on an Electronic Network: Notice to shareholders that have consented to receipt of electronically transmitted notices may be provided by posting the notice on an electronic network and delivering to the shareholder a separate record of the posting, together with comprehensible instructions regarding how to obtain access to the posting on the electronic network.
(d)       Effectiveness of Notice: If mailed, notice shall be deemed effective when mailed with first-class postage prepaid and correctly addressed to the shareholders address shown in the corporations current record of shareholders. If transmitted by any other permissible tangible means, notice shall be effective at such time specified in the Washington Business Corporation Act. An affidavit of the corporations secretary, an assistant secretary or an agent of the corporation that notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated in the affidavit. Notice provided in an electronic transmission, if in comprehensible form, is effective when it (i) is electronically transmitted to an address, location or system designated by the recipient for that purpose, or (ii) has been posted on an electronic network and a separate record of the posting has been delivered to the recipient together with comprehensible instructions regarding how to obtain access to the posting on the electronic network.
(7)       
Voting Record
: At least ten days before each meeting of shareholders, a complete record of the shareholders entitled to vote at such meeting, or any adjournment thereof, shall be made, arranged in alphabetical order, with the address of and number of shares held by each, which record shall be kept on file at the registered office of the corporation for a period of ten days prior to such meeting.

(b)       If a quorum is present, action on a matter, other than the election of Directors, shall be approved by a voting group if the votes cast within the voting group in favor of the action exceed the votes cast within the voting group against such action, unless the Articles of Incorporation or the Washington Business Corporation Act requires a greater number of affirmative votes.
(9)       
Voting of Shares
: Except as otherwise provided in these Bylaws or to the extent that voting rights of the shares of any class or classes are limited or denied by the Articles of Incorporation, each shareholder, on each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of shareholders, shall have one vote for each share of stock registered in his name on the books of the corporation.
(10)

In lieu of closing the stock transfer books, the Board of Directors may fix in advance a record date for any such determination of shareholders, such date to be not more than sixty days and, in case of a meeting of shareholders, not less than ten days prior to the date on which the particular action requiring such determination of shareholders is to be taken.
(11)     
Proxies
: A shareholder may vote either in person or by proxy executed in writing by the shareholder or his duly authorized attorney-in-fact. No proxy shall be valid after eleven months from the date of its execution, unless otherwise provided in the proxy.
(12)     
Action by Shareholders without a Meeting
: Any action required or which may be taken at a meeting of shareholders of the corporation may be taken without a meeting if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by all of the shareholders entitled to vote with respect to the subject matter thereof. Such consent shall have the same force and effect as a unanimous vote of shareholders.
(13)     
Waiver of Notice
: A shareholder may waive any notice required by these Bylaws, the Articles of Incorporation or the Washington Business Corporation Act, before or after the date and time of the meeting that is the subject of such notice or, in the case of notice required to be given to nonconsenting or nonvoting shareholders in connection with action taken by less than unanimous consent of the shareholders, before or after the action to be taken by executed consent is effective. The waiver must be (i) delivered by the shareholder entitled to notice to the corporation for inclusion in the minutes or filing with the corporate records, and (ii) set forth either in an executed and dated written record or, if the corporation has designated an address, location or system to which the waiver may be electronically transmitted and the waiver is electronically transmitted to the designated address, location or system, in an executed and dated electronically transmitted record.

(14)     
Action of Shareholders by Communications Equipment
: Shareholders may participate in a meeting of shareholders by means of a conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other at the same time, and participation by such means shall constitute presence in person at a meeting.

: In order for a Noticing Shareholder to properly bring any item of business before an annual meeting or special meeting of shareholders, the Noticing Shareholder must give timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the corporation in compliance with the requirements of this Article II(15). Subject to compliance with the requirements of this Article II(15) and clause (c) of Article II(3), a Noticing Shareholder may nominate a director at an annual meeting of the shareholders, or any special meeting of the shareholders called for the purpose of electing directors. This Article II(15) shall constitute an advance notice provision for annual meetings for purposes of Rule 14a-4(c)(1) under the Exchange Act.

(c)       Notwithstanding anything in Article II(15)(a) to the contrary, if the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors is increased and there is no public announcement by the corporation naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors at least 100 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting, a shareholders notice required by these Bylaws shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which the public announcement naming all nominees or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors is first made by the corporation.
(d)       For purposes of these Bylaws, public announcement shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by a national news service or in a document publicly filed by the corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14, or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.
(e)       Only those persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in these Bylaws shall be eligible to serve as directors. Only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of shareholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in these Bylaws. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Articles of Incorporation, or these Bylaws, the Chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in compliance with the procedures set forth in these Bylaws and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with these Bylaws, to declare that such proposal or nomination shall be disregarded.
(f)        Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of these Bylaws, a Noticing Shareholder also shall comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in these Bylaws; provided, however, that any references in these Bylaws to the Exchange Act or the rules thereunder are not intended to and shall not limit the requirements applicable to nominations or proposals as to any other business to be considered pursuant to Article II(3) or Article II(15).

Article III
 
Stock
(1)       
Certificated Shares
: Shares may but need not be represented by certificates. Unless otherwise provided by law, rights and obligations of shareholders are identical whether or not their shares are represented by certificates. If shares are represented by certificates, certificates of stock shall be issued in numerical order, and each shareholder shall be entitled to a certificate signed by the President, or a Vice President, and the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, or by such other two officers as designated by the Board of Directors, and may be sealed with the seal of the corporation or a facsimile thereof. The signatures of such officers may be facsimiles if the certificate is manually signed on behalf of a transfer agent, or registered by a registrar, other than the corporation itself or an employee of the corporation. If an officer who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon such certificate ceases to be an officer before the certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if the person were such officer on the date of issue. At a minimum, each certificate of stock shall state:
 
-10-
 
 
(a)       Unless the Articles of Incorporation provide otherwise, the Board of Directors may authorize the issue of any of the corporations classes or series of shares without certificates. The authorization does not affect shares already represented by certificates until they are surrendered to the corporation.
(b)       Within a reasonable time after the issue of shares without certificates, the corporation shall send the shareholder a complete written statement of the information required on certificates as provided in Article III(1) herein.
(a)       Transfers of stock shall be made only upon the stock transfer books of the corporation, kept at the registered office of the corporation or at its principal place of business, or at the office of its transfer agent or registrar. The Board of Directors may, by resolution, open a share register in any state of the United States, and may employ an agent or agents to keep such register, and to record transfers of shares therein.
(b)       Shares of certificated stock shall be transferred by delivery of the certificates therefor, accompanied either by an assignment in writing on the back of the certificate or an assignment separate from certificate, or by a written power of attorney to sell, assign and transfer the same, signed by the holder of said certificate. No shares of certificated stock shall be transferred on the books of the corporation until the outstanding certificates therefor have been surrendered to the corporation.
 
-11-
 
 
(c)       Shares of uncertificated stock shall be transferred upon receipt by the corporation of a written request for transfer signed by the shareholder. Within a reasonable time after the transfer, the corporation will acknowledge to such shareholder that said shares have been transferred on the books of the corporation.
(4)       
Registered Owner
: Registered shareholders shall be treated by the corporation as the holders in fact of the stock standing in their respective names and the corporation shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in any share on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as expressly provided below or by the laws of the State of Washington. The Board of Directors may adopt by resolution a procedure whereby a shareholder of the corporation may certify in writing to the corporation that all or a portion of the shares registered in the name of such shareholder are held for the account of a specified person or persons. The resolution shall set forth:
(a)       issue fractions of a share which shall entitle the holder to exercise voting rights, to receive dividends thereon, and to participate in any of the assets of the corporation in the event of liquidation;
(b)       arrange for the disposition of fractional interests by those entitled thereto;
(c)       pay in cash the fair value of fractions of a share as of the time when those entitled to receive such shares are determined; or if certificates are being used to represent shares of such class or series,
(d)       issue scrip in registered or bearer form which shall entitle the holder to receive a certificate for a full share upon the surrender of such scrip aggregating a full share.
(6)

-12-
 
 
Article IV
 
Board of Directors
(1)       
Number and Powers
: The management of all the affairs, property and interest of the corporation shall be vested in a Board of Directors. The Board of Directors shall consist of from six (6) to nine (9) persons, who shall be elected for a term of one year and shall hold office until the next annual meeting of the shareholders and the election and qualification of his or her successor or until the directors earlier death, resignation, removal or termination of term. Directors need not be shareholders or residents of the State of Washington. In addition to the powers and authorities by these Bylaws and the Articles of Incorporation expressly conferred upon it, the Board of Directors may exercise all such powers of the corporation and do all such lawful acts as are not by statute or by the Articles of Incorporation or by these Bylaws directed or required to be exercised or done by the shareholders.
(2)       
Election of Directors
: At each annual shareholders' meeting the shareholders shall elect the directors to hold office until the next annual meeting of the shareholders and until their respective successors are elected and qualified. If, for any reason, the directors shall not have been elected at any annual meeting, they may be elected at a special meeting of shareholders called for that purpose in the manner provided by these Bylaws.
Except as provided in Article IV (4) and this Article IV(2), each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast. A majority of votes cast means that the number of shares cast for a directors election exceeds the number of votes cast against that director. The following shall not be votes cast: (a) a share whose ballot is marked as withheld; (b) a share otherwise present at the meeting but for which there is an abstention or whose ballot is marked as abstain; and (c) a share otherwise present at the meeting as to which a shareholder gives no authority or direction. In a contested election, the directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast. A contested election is one in which (a) on last day for delivery of a notice under Article II(15)(a), a Noticing Shareholder has complied with the requirements of Article II(15) with respect to one or more nominees; and (b) prior to the date that notice of the meeting is given, the Board of Directors has not made a determination that none of the candidacies of the Noticing Shareholders nominees creates a bona fide election contest. For purposes of these Bylaws, it is assumed that on the last day for delivery of a notice under Article II(15)(a), there is a candidate nominated by the Board of Directors for each of the director positions to be voted on at the meeting.
The following procedures apply in a non-contested election. A nominee who does not receive a majority vote shall not be elected. Except as otherwise provided in this Article IV(2), an incumbent director who is not elected because he or she does not receive a majority vote shall continue to serve as a holdover director until the earliest of (a) 90 days after the date on which an inspector determines the voting results as to that director pursuant to RCW 23B.07.035; (b) the date on which the Board of Directors appoints an individual to fill the office held by such director, which appointment shall constitute the filling of a vacancy by the Board of Directors pursuant to Article IV(4); or (c) the date of the directors resignation. Any vacancy resulting from the non-election of a director under this Article IV(2) may be filled by the Board of Directors as provided in Article IV(4). The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
 
-13-
 
 
will consider promptly whether to fill the office of a nominee failing to receive a majority vote and make a recommendation to the Board of Directors about filling the office. The Board of Directors will act on the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees recommendation and within ninety (90) days after the certification of the shareholder vote will disclose publicly its decision. Except as provided in the next sentence, no director who failed to receive a majority vote for election will participate in the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee recommendation or Board of Directors decision about filling his or her office. If no director receives a majority vote in an uncontested election, then the incumbent directors (a) will nominate a slate of directors and hold a special meeting for the purpose of electing those nominees as soon as practicable, and (b) may in the interim fill one or more offices with the same director(s) who will continue in office until their successors are elected.
(3)       
Change of Number
: The number of directors may at any time be increased or decreased by the shareholders or directors at any annual or special meeting provided that no decrease shall have the effect of shortening the term of any incumbent director except as provided in Article IV(4) and Article IV(5) hereunder.
(4)       
Vacancies
: All vacancies in the Board of Directors, whether caused by resignation, death or otherwise, may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors. A director elected to fill any vacancy shall hold office for the unexpired term of his predecessor. Any directorship to be filled by reason of an increase in the number of directors may be filled by the Board of Directors for a term of office continuing only until the next election of directors by the shareholders.
(5)       
Removal of Directors
: At a meeting of shareholders called expressly for that purpose, the entire Board of Directors, or any member thereof, may be removed by a vote of the holders of a majority of shares then entitled to vote at an election of such directors.
(6)       
Regular Meetings
: Regular meetings of the Board of Directors or any committee may be held without notice at the principal place of business of the corporation or at such other place or places, either within or without the State of Washington, as the Board of Directors or such committee, as the case may be, may from time to time designate. The annual meeting of the Board of Directors shall be held without notice immediately after the adjournment of the annual meeting of shareholders.
(7)       
Special Meetings
: Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called at any time by the President or by any director, to be held at the principal place of business of the corporation or at such other place or places as the Board of Directors or the person or persons calling such meeting may from time to time designate. Notice of all special meetings of the Board of Directors shall be given to each director by at least one (1) day in advance of the meeting. Such notice need not specify the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, the meeting.
(8)       
Notice
: Notice of a special Board or committee meeting stating the place, day and hour of the meeting shall be provided to each director in the form of a record or orally, as provided below.
 
-14-
 
 
(a)       Oral Notice: Oral notice may be communicated in person, by telephone, wire or wireless equipment which does not transmit a facsimile of the notice, or by any electronic means that does not create a record.
(b)       Notice Provided in a Tangible Medium: Notice may be provided in a tangible medium and may be transmitted by mail, private carrier, personal delivery, telegraph, teletype, telephone or wire or wireless equipment that transmits a facsimile of the notice.
(c)       Notice Provided in an Electronic Transmission: Notice may be provided in an electronic transmission and be electronically transmitted. Notice to directors in an electronic transmission and be electronically transmitted. Notice to shareholders in an electronic transmission is effective only with respect to directors that have consented, in the form of a record, to receive electronically transmitted notices and designated in the consent the address, location or system to which these notices may be electronically transmitted. Notice provided in an electronic transmission includes material required or permitted to accompany the notice by the Washington Business Corporation Act or other applicable statute or regulation. A director who has consented to receipt of electronically transmitted notices may revoke such consent by delivering a revocation to the corporation in the form of a record. The consent of a director to receive notice by electronic transmission is revoked if the corporation is unable to electronically transmit two consecutive notices given by the corporation in accordance with the consent, and this inability becomes known to the Secretary of the corporation or any other person responsible for giving the notice. The inadvertent failure by the corporation to treat this inability as a revocation does not invalidate any meeting or other action.
(d)       Posting Notice on an Electronic Network: Notice to directors who have consented to receipt of electronically transmitted notices may be provided by posting the notice on an electronic network and delivering to the director a separate record of the posting, together with comprehensible instructions regarding how to obtain access to the posting on the electronic network.
(e)       Effectiveness of Notice: Oral notice is effective when received by the director. Notice given by wire or wireless equipment that does not transmit a facsimile of the notice or by any electronic means that does not create a record is effective when communicated to the director. Notice given by mail is effective five days after its deposit in the United States mail, as evidenced by the postmark, if mailed with first-class postage prepaid and correctly addressed to the director at his or her address shown of the records of the corporation. Notice is effective on the date shown on the return receipt, if sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, and the receipt is signed by or on behalf of the addressee. Notice sent to the directors address, telephone number or other number appearing on the records of the corporation is effective when dispatched by telegraph, teletype or wire or wireless equipment which transmits a facsimile of the notice. Notice given by private carrier is effective when received by the director. Notice given by personal delivery is effective when received by the director. Notice provided by electronic transmission, if in comprehensible form, is effective when it (i) is electronically transmitted to an address, location or system designated by the recipient for that purpose, or (ii) has been posted on an electronic network and a separate record of the posting has been delivered to the recipient together with comprehensible instructions regarding how to obtain access to the posting on the electronic network.

(9)       
Quorum
: A majority of the number of persons then serving as members of the Board of Directors shall be necessary at all meetings of the Board of Directors to constitute a meeting for the transaction of business, and the votes of a majority of those directors present at any properly called meeting at which such a quorum is present shall be sufficient to transact business.
(10)     
Waiver of Notice
: Attendance of a director at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where a director attends for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. A director may waive any notice required to be given to any director under the provisions of these Bylaws, the Articles of Incorporation or the Washington Business Corporation Act, before or after the date and time stated in the notice and such waiver shall be equivalent to the giving of such notice. The wavier must be delivered by the director entitled to the notice to the corporation for inclusion in the minutes or filing with the corporate records.

Article IX
 
Indemnification
(1)       
Right to Indemnification
: Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved (including, without limitation, as a witness) in any actual or threatened action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the corporation or, being or having been such a director or officer, he or she is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the corporation to the full extent permitted by applicable law as then in effect, against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts to be paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that no indemnification shall be provided to any such person if the corporation is prohibited by the nonexclusive provisions of the Washington Business Corporation Act or other applicable law as then in effect from paying such indemnification; and provided, further, that except as provided in Article IX(2) with respect to proceedings seeking to enforce rights to indemnification, the corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the corporation. The right to indemnification conferred in this Section shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that the payment of such expenses in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding shall be made only upon delivery to the corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such director of officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article or otherwise.
(2)       
Right of Claimant to Bring Suit
: If a claim under Section 1 of this Article is not paid in full by the corporation within sixty days after a written claim has been received by the corporation, except in the case of a claim for expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition, in which case the applicable period shall be twenty days, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, to the extent successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. The claimant shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification under this Article upon submission of a written claim (and, in an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition, where the required undertaking has been tendered to the corporation) and thereafter the corporation shall have the burden of proof to overcome the presumption that the claimant is not so entitled. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its shareholders) to have made a determination prior to
 
-21-
 
 
the commencement of such action that indemnification of or reimbursement or advancement of expenses to the claimant is proper in the circumstances nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its shareholders) that the claimant is not entitled to indemnification or to the reimbursement or advancement of expenses shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant is not so entitled.
(3)       
Nonexclusivity of Rights
: The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this Articles shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

The corporation may, without further shareholder action, enter into contracts with any director or officer of the corporation in furtherance of the provisions of this Article and may create a trust fund, grant a security interest or use other means (including, without limitation, a letter of credit) to ensure the payment of such amounts as may be necessary to effect indemnification as provided in this Article.
(5)       
Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the Corporation
: The corporation may, by action of its Board of Directors from time to time, provide indemnification and pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding to employees and agents of the corporation with the same scope and effect as the provisions of this Article with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the corporation or pursuant to rights granted pursuant to, or provided by, the Washington Business Corporation Act or otherwise.
