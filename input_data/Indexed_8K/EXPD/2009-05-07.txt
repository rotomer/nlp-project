Diluted net earnings attributable to shareholders per share for the first quarter were $.27 as compared with $.30 for the same quarter in 2008, a decrease of 10%. The Company also reported that same store net revenues and operating income decreased 10% and 13%, respectively, during the first quarter of 2009, as compared with the same period in 2008.
"While this quarter was unusual, our people did an outstanding job capitalizing on spot market buying opportunities, particularly the airfreight group. The March quarter end rush did not materialize to the extent that we've experienced it in the past," commented Peter J. Rose, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We obviously would liked to have reported higher quarterly earnings. However, we saw no long-term benefit in resorting to short term measures, like employee layoffs or other actions which could severely damage the value of our network by compromising our customer service capability, just to pick up a couple of cents per share. We have not forgotten that ours is a service business. Our people are our most valuable assets. It is they who have worked diligently year-in-and-year-out to deliver the kind of customer service and operating efficiencies that created that value in the first place. There are many things that we could say about these results, but ours is not a culture of excuses and looking backwards. It is a culture of taking responsibility and moving forward. We've never lived for the quarter,' and we certainly aren't going to start doing so now. Quarters come and quarters go, but long term stability at Expeditors comes from staying true to the established and proven tenets of Expeditors' culture," Rose said.
"Like most businesses, we've been faced with difficult options these past several months. Fortunately our culture has always proven to be our most effective compass. The value of our most vital assets, our people, is not shown on our balance sheet. The value they create in servicing our customers, however, manifests itself daily. It would be inconsistent with our culture that those who create and sustain value bear the brunt of these times. We've always run lean, so our people remain busy and engaged. We continue to take market share and operate profitably. We have record cash balances, strong cash flow, and robust operating margins," Rose continued. "One of our District Managers recently asked if I thought 2009 was going to be a scary' year. The response was easy. No, 1981, when we first began operations, was a year. It was in the middle of a very severe recession. We had no customers, we had no money, we had no global network and there were only 20 of us. By contrast, 2009 has tremendous opportunities. We have some 10,000 customers, we have nearly $900 million in cash, we have a global network of 250 offices and there are over 12,000 of us. Now is not a time to be scared, it's time to go sell some more business'.and that is just what we intend to do," concluded Rose.
