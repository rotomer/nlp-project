"While our pre-announcement took away the apprehension traditionally associated with a quarterly earnings release, once the final numbers were in, we still have a pretty good story to tell," said Peter J. Rose, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "There aren't many companies in today's environment that can say they have record cash balances ($916 million), have recorded a 136% increase in cash flow provided by operations (compared with the second quarter of 2008), have had no layoffs and remain debt-free. We continue to be well positioned to maintain the value of our people, our culture and our customer relationships. These assets are critical differentiators for us," Rose continued.
"We are aware of Wall Street's expectations for the remainder of 2009. We would reiterate that Expeditors' strategy has never been driven by Wall Street's expectations. We will continue to invest in our people, in our systems and in our customer service capabilities. Continued focus on these factors is what grows market share and allows us to maintain our long-term positioning in today's environment." Rose went on to say. "You can't go around some challenges; you just have to go through them, and we're doing that. Expeditors didn't progress from having 20 employees in 1981 to become a Fortune 500 company in 2007 through the efforts of employees living in constant fear of being laid off. It is our people who are responsible for those accomplishments. We need them all, and the leadership culture that permeates this company, at all levels, now more than ever. Despite published statistics showing record declines in year over year shipping volumes, we continue to attract new customers. As the economy improves, and we believe it will, shippers will ship more. When they do, we expect to reap the benefits of these new relationships," Rose concluded.
Expeditors is a global logistics company headquartered in Seattle, Washington. The company employs trained professionals in 183 full-service offices, 66 satellite locations and 4 international service centers located on six continents linked into a seamless worldwide network through an integrated information management system.
