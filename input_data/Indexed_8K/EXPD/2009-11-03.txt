"There certainly were significant challenges during the latter part of this quarter as both air and ocean carriers imposed capacity reductions in order to implement very aggressive price increases. While we wouldn't call it The Perfect Freight Storm,' the rapidity of these carrier moves created a pricing environment that resulted in our experiencing single digit airfreight yields out of Asia during the first several weeks of September. Ocean yields were also significantly impacted. Market conditions required that we absorb these increases for several weeks as we worked with customers to raise rates in a commercially acceptable manner," said Peter J. Rose, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "On a more positive note, however, year-over-year declines in freight volumes for the month of September (as compared to September 2008), were at the lowest levels we've experienced all year. Airfreight tonnage was down 6% while ocean freight container counts were down 17%. Lower yields aside, it was somewhat reassuring to experience freight volumes that, while albeit still negative, seemed to be moving in the right direction," Rose went on to say.
"While we'll be the first to acknowledge 2009 has been a tough year, we remain very positive on how we're positioned for the future, particularly as the global economy gradually strengthens. A strong balance sheet with nearly $1 billion in cash is very stabilizing. With 252 locations throughout the world we're able to grow market share everywhere we have a network presence. Having not resorted to layoffs, while challenging in the short-term, has allowed our people to maintain that Expeditors' that we rely on to service our customers and to grow our business over the long-term," Rose commented. "Sticking to our core values and walking the walk' when times are tough provides a tremendously stable springboard from which to expand our customer base, provide technological solutions to our customers and provide opportunities to our people as the business climate improves," Rose concluded.
