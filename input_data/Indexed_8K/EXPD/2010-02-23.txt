"In a year that began amidst fears of a global financial Armageddon, these fourth quarter results were somewhat better than anticipated and we're very encouraged by them. Against all stated odds, we actually ended up having a fourth quarter peak season in 2009," said Peter J. Rose, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Despite the capacity challenges in the airfreight markets, which resulted in rapid rate increases and associated yield declines, it was reassuring to once again experience airfreight tonnages greater than those handled during the same period the year beforeup 16% for the fourth quarter and 36% for the month of December. Fourth quarter ocean freight container counts were 5% lower than 2008 levels, but that was the smallest quarterly lower' that we've seen all year and December was actually up 4% on a year-over-year basiswhich was a first this year. In short, we were plenty busy and, as expected, our people came through with flying colors. For a while there during the fourth quarter it almost seemed like old times'," Rose went on to say.
"This fourth quarter was both a vindication and an affirmation of the correctness of strategic decisions we made nearly eighteen months ago. We started with a no layoffs' strategy to protect our most important assetsour people. Despite being chided by some, that move has been applauded by those who matter mostour employees, our customers and our shareholders. We could not have managed this recent peak season if we had over-reacted and executed whole-scale layoffs last spring and summer," Rose commented. "Instead, we used available resources to vigorously pursue a strategy of customer retention and aggressive market share expansion. When the markets turned up during peak season, we saw just how effective those strategies were. We also reaffirmed our strong commitment to cost management. A rigid focus on all of these strategies paid off. We're still here and we're still standing...all of us, battered and bruised a bit, but better for the struggle. Having proven our in 2009, we're excited about 2010," concluded Rose.
