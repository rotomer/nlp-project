FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
SEATTLE, WASHINGTON  August 2, 2010, Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPD) today announced record net earnings attributable to shareholders of $90,318,000 for the second quarter of 2010, as compared with $54,070,000 for the same quarter of 2009, an increase of 67%. Net revenues for the second quarter of 2010 increased 27% to $418,858,000 as compared with $330,047,000 reported for the second quarter of 2009. Total revenues and operating income were $1,516,770,000 and $138,496,000 in 2010, as compared with $895,360,000 and $86,927,000 for the same quarter of 2009, increases of 69% and 59%, respectively. Diluted net earnings attributable to shareholders per share for the second quarter were $.42, as compared with $.25 for the same quarter in 2009, an increase of 68%.
For the six months ended June 30, 2010, net earnings attributable to shareholders was $151,565,000, as compared with $113,330,000 in 2009, an increase of 34%. Net revenues for the six months increased to $780,681,000 from $666,562,000 for 2009, up 17%. Total revenues and operating income for the six months were $2,717,879,000 and $239,037,000 in 2010, as compared with $1,808,045,000 and $178,401,000 for the same period in 2009, increases of 50% and 34%, respectively. Diluted net earnings attributable to shareholders per share for the first two quarters of 2010 were $.70, as compared with $.52 for the same period of 2009, an increase of 35%.
"The ultimate testament to the strength of this quarter might be that when the numbers were finalized, we'd actually managed to surprise ourselves by a couple of cents," said Peter J. Rose, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Having the opportunity to add value to the supply-chains of successful companies is what adds value to Expeditors. We were somewhat awed by the strength that we saw in our customers' supply chains this quarter and we're obviously very grateful they chose to work with us. It was impressive that airfreight tonnage and ocean freight container count this quarter were up 54% and 26%, respectively, compared with the second quarter of 2009. The fact that this quarter's net revenue was actually 5% higher than second quarter 2008 levels was particularly reassuring. While it's much too soon to extrapolate this quarter's results over the remainder of 2010, we think operating above second quarter 2008 levels is a positive development," Rose went on to say.
"Our philosophy these last several years has been to try to not do anything stupid. We simply did what we've always done; focusing on improving customer service; taking market share by adding new customers; taking care of our people by not doing lay-offs; and making ourselves more productive through continued process improvement efforts. Boring consistency is what we do best," Rose continued. "Some may point to lower yields,' or the $.01 to $.02 per share

benefit coming from foreign exchange gains and a somewhat lower tax rate, but those factors aren't the main thrust of what happened during the second quarter of 2010. The main story this quarter was the outstanding job, from both a productivity and customer service perspective, that our people did navigating the myriad market challenges required to manage those incredibly large freight volumes our customers entrusted to us. We're grateful to our employees for their unfailing efforts, and to our customers for the confidence they've shown by trusting us with their business," Rose concluded.
