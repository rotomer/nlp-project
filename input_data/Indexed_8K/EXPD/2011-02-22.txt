"What a difference a year makes! Last year we closed our 2009 fourth quarter earnings release by saying Having proven our in 2009, we're excited about 2010.' How prophetic those words turned out to be," said Peter J. Rose, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Our 2010 was absolutely outstanding by any measure and this fourth quarter was, simply put, a great ending to an incredible year. The fourth quarter was also remarkable in that, despite handling the large year-over-year increases in shipment and clearance activity, none of the anomalies that can occur in theses kinds of environments reared their ugly heads. The competitive market mechanisms worked as close to perfect as we can remember experiencing them. Our people successfully handled some amazing volumes. Because of our no-layoff policy in 2009, we had the capacity and the experience to absorb anything 2010 threw at us," Rose went on to say.

"The fourth quarter, just like all of 2010, was a classic case study of what happens when you don't panic, when you trust in your people and your culture and when you rely on your proven business model. If we had lost our confidence and succumbed to the myriad of pressures we encountered in 2009, we might well have joined the lemming layoff brigade.' Had we done that, we would not have had the staying power to see our way through the volume challenges, and the corresponding opportunities, that presented themselves in 2010. Experience and tenure is what really pays off in these situations, particularly if you have the confidence to leadwhich fortunately, our people did. This wasn't our first recession, it was merely our worst. We learned from experience that a recession is the least costly time to make investments. We have always thought that recessionary investments, particularly those in technology, productivity and process improvement, have higher rates of return, as the economy turns... .and indeed they did. Finally, we were grateful for the opportunity to show how much we truly appreciate and value our greatest assets, our peopleand that is why they're still here servicing more customers and creating value for our shareholders! And yes, we're excited for whatever challenges and opportunities will come our way in 2011," concluded Rose.
