We knew that the 2011 second quarter would be challenging, at least from a 'last year's triumph is this year's hurdle' perspective. Despite this 'hurdle', our 2011 second quarter operating income growth shows that we executed well, particularly given all the factors currently in play, said Peter J. Rose, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. We didn't have some of the non-operating windfalls that benefited the 2010 second quarter, but these sound operating results reflect the solid execution in very dynamic ocean and airfreight markets and even in the more staid customs brokerage arena that has become our hallmark. Significantly, operating income as a percentage of net revenue remained above 32% for the fifth consecutive quarter. We may not be able to control the direction of the wind in the overall market, but we think we've demonstrated over time that our ability to safely navigate the churning oceans is all in how we set our sails, Rose went on to say.
  
Even with the global economic and political storms swirling around us, we must ultimately accept that we are 'the captains of our own destiny.' Being
Resolute
is one of our key cultural attributes and it has served us well in the past 30 years as we've endured a myriad of challenges. Being
Resolute
means we choose the path that adds long-term value to Expeditors, in tough times or in good times," Rose continued. "We will focus on attracting and retaining the best and brightest people, without whose dedicated efforts we wouldn't be where we are. We're grateful for their contributions and express that gratitude by investing in them and in their careers. The efficiencies gained from investments in our information technology systems and productivity initiatives continues to pay off for us, and we'll continue those as well. Putting our people and their productivity first allows us to better serve our customers' needs. The exciting thing about our business model is that we can't add value to Expeditors without adding value to our customers' supply chain. That's the way we create satisfied customers and that's the way we grow market share, Rose concluded.
