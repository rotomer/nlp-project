It is reassuring to again report
record
net revenue, operating income and net earnings results, particularly amid the economic challenges some would have us believe define our potential, said Peter J. Rose, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Providing exceptional customer service and market competitive rates to our customers and buying strategically from our quality service providers allows our people to utilize their intellectual capital to optimize efficiency and financial results. This is the reason why we have consistently been able to grow net revenue even when gross revenue doesnt show the same commensurate levels of growth. Maximizing gross revenues to the potential detriment of operating income has never been whats motivated us. With all the dynamic factors such as fuel prices and capacity that impact rates, net revenue growth is a much more indicative measurement of operational effectiveness than mindlessly chasing growth in gross revenues. Rates and foreign currencies go up and down, but it is attention to growing net revenue and operating income that are responsible for our long-term success. These are important nuances in this businessand many fail to absorb them, Rose continued.
The current economic conjecture regarding last quarter 2011 and 2012 conditions seem to validate the concerns we wrote about in our first quarter 2011 earnings release, Rose went on to say. As we look forward, we do so with the complete confidence we gained through our experiences in 2009. We emerged stronger and in a better position strategically. We did so by making decisions that maximized the return on our knowledge-based assetsour employees. The value of our company is a direct function of the value we add to our customers supply chains. We can not meet our customers needs before we create value in the people we recruit, train and retain to meet those needs. Regardless of what the rest of 2011 and 2012 looks like, we know the key to success with our customers will be to continue to invest in our most critical assets, our people. Theyve never let us down and were looking forward to the challenge
, Rose concluded.
