From a strategic perspective, our 2011 fourth quarter financial results showed all the things we think are important, said Peter J. Rose, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Operating income as a percentage of net revenue, at 32.6%, remained well above 30% for the seventh straight quarter while salaries as a percentage of net revenue were very much in line with our historical expectations. All in all, we think the things we can control most, we controlled best. From a tactical perspective, however, we would like to have seen stronger freight volumes as the customary real peak season surge never materialized. The lack of a peak season created irregular demand throughout the quarter. While this resulted in some intermittent spot buying opportunities in both the air and ocean freight markets, ultimately they were not sufficient to compensate for relatively weaker freight demand. Despite this quarters unpredictable shipping patterns, we still managed to grow both net revenue and operating income 5% and 4% respectively. That's something we take great comfort in. For the year ended 2011, net revenue and operating income increased 12% and 13% respectively. That is the kind of annual performance we don't feel particularly compelled to apologize forparticularly in these times, Rose continued.
"Our third quarter 2011 earnings release highlighted our concerns about global trends for the remainder for 2011 and 2012. While 2011 was a record year, and we are generally optimistic about 2012, the underlying flow of goods both in the global economy and throughout our network in January still give us some cause to reiterate those concerns in the near term. That said, given the outstanding talents and abilities of our people and the support of both our customers and service providers, we remain very confident that we have the wherewithal to successfully address any near term challenges that may occur by staying true to our proven, long-term values and objectives," concluded Rose.
