EXPEDITORS ISSUES EARNINGS GUIDANCE
    
SEATTLE, WASHINGTON - April 19, 2012, Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPD) announced today that preliminary results indicate its first quarter 2012 net earnings attributable to shareholders are expected to fall in the range of $.35 - $.37 per share.

The Company has been very cautionary in its past two earnings releases about the fragility of the global economy and its potential impacts on future results, said Peter J. Rose, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. We've been saying for over six months now that things in the global economy just didn't seem to us to be as encouraging as a lot of the pundits were projecting. Our preliminary data seems to reveal a trend where existing customers, particularly airfreight customers, are shipping at lower volumes than we experienced during the 2011 first quarter. From our own perspective, as we proceed forward in 2012, we need to be even more aggressive in cost containment and more focused on both expanding our customer base and further extending our business reach with existing customers, Rose concluded.
Expeditors is a global logistics company headquartered in Seattle, Washington. The company employs trained professionals in 186 full-service offices and 63 satellite locations located on six continents linked into a seamless worldwide network through an integrated information management system. Services include air and ocean freight forwarding, vendor consolidation, customs clearance, marine insurance, distribution and other value added international logistics services.
Expeditors is scheduled to release its first quarter 2012 results on May 2, 2012, after the market opens.
