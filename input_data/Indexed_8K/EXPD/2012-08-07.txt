The same market trends we experienced during our 2012 first quarter, as we suggested at the time, continued into the second quarter. That said, we saw volume growth in all areas of our business with the exception of airfreight, despite navigating in what people are finally acknowledging is a very challenging and uncertain global economy, said Peter J. Rose, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Ocean freight yields dipped, sequentially, as is typical of the second quarter, due to the time lag between when carrier rate increases during annual May contract negotiations are commercially implemented and on a year-over-year basis, reflecting the magnitude of this years' buy rate increases, as carriers moved aggressively to stabilize their precarious financial situation. This was mitigated somewhat by 7% net revenue growth in our direct ocean forwarding product. In spite of flat shipment counts, we continued to experience similar year-over-year trends with respect to airfreight tonnage (smaller shipments, diminished global airfreight demand, lower levels of customer specific infrastructure and projects) that we highlighted in our 2012 first quarter release. Customs brokerage and other services, posted positive growth in net revenue, primarily due to the contributions from our continued international roll out of our domestic time definite product, Transcon services, Rose continued.
We remain focused on controlling the parts of our business which have the greatest immediate impact to our stakeholders: our customers; our shareholders; and ultimately our people. That includes focusing on customer retention and profitable market share expansion. While our operating margin (29.2% based on net revenue) hovers below the mark we've enjoyed the last two years (average of 32%), it still remains very healthy from both a competitive and a historical perspective, Rose went on to say. Very importantly, our cash position and strong operating cash flow have allowed us to continue to pursue our strategic investments, particularly in customer service proficiency and in productivity enhancements via both information system and process engineering solutions. We also bought back just over 2 million shares of stock during the quarter. Expeditors was founded in tough times and we've been through plenty of them since our founding. Being able to get through tough times without letting tough times get through us is deeply embedded in our DNA. Until there is more certainty in the global economy, these trends could continue for the short to medium term. Regardless of what happens, it won't change who we are and what we do for our stakeholders. We continue to be grateful for the resilience of our people, their dedication to our customers and our culture which recognizes, reinforces and rewards the key to our long-term success being tied to servicing our customers. These tough times too will pass and it should go without saying, at the end of the day, we'd rather be us, than anyone else inside or outside this industry, Rose concluded.
