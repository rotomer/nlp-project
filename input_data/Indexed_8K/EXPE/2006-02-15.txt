Item 2.02.     Results of Operations and Financial Condition
          On February 15, 2006, Expedia, Inc., a Delaware corporation, issued a press release announcing its financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2005.  The full text of this press release, appearing in Exhibit 99.1 hereto, is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 9.01.     Financial Statements and Exhibits
(d) Exhibits
          Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
          BELLEVUE, Wash., Feb. 15 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Expedia, Inc. (Nasdaq: EXPE) today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2005.
          "Despite a fiercely competitive environment, headwinds in the hotel and airline industries and a mid-year spin-off, Expedia, Inc. delivered meaningful bookings, earnings and free cash flow for its stockholders in 2005," said Expedia, Inc. Chairman and Senior Executive Barry Diller. "The Company approaches its second decade of operations with a solid foundation-a complementary portfolio of industry-leading brands, a broad and growing geographic footprint and an experienced, energized and focused management team."
          "While the fourth quarter wasn't as strong as we hoped it would be, The Expedia(R) Promise, Best Price Guarantee and Expedia(R) Trip Guides are fitting additions to what was a solid operational and financial year," said Dara Khosrowshahi, Expedia, Inc.'s CEO and President. "These innovations are just the latest signposts marking Expedia's multi-year evolution from efficient transaction engine to world class retailer of travel products and services. We are investing to transform the way travelers plan, purchase and enjoy their trips -- again."
          Discussion of Results - Fourth Quarter 2005
          Gross Bookings & Revenue           Gross bookings increased 17% for the fourth quarter 2005 compared with fourth quarter 2004. Domestic gross bookings increased 14% and international gross bookings increased 31%, or 38% excluding the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange.
          Revenue increased 13% during the quarter, primarily driven by increased worldwide merchant hotel revenue, acquisitions and growth in our car rental business. Fourth quarter domestic revenue increased 8% and international revenue grew 30%, a reduced rate of growth compared with the first three quarters of 2005, reflecting continued challenges in the travel and competitive environments in Europe, particularly in the U.K., and the impact of foreign exchange.
          Worldwide merchant hotel revenue, which accounts for over 90% of worldwide hotel revenue, increased 9% for the fourth quarter, driven by 12% growth in room nights stayed, including rooms delivered as a component of vacation packages. Revenue per room night decreased 2%, resulting from a contraction in hotel raw margins (defined as hotel net revenue as a percentage of hotel gross bookings), partially offset by a 4% increase in average daily rates ("ADRs").
          Worldwide air revenues decreased 4% during the quarter, due to an 11% decrease in revenue per air ticket, partially offset by an 8% increase in air tickets sold. The revenue per ticket decrease was more pronounced in the merchant air business, reflecting less inventory allocation and lower discounting of merchant air tickets, as the industry hit record load factors during the quarter.
          Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings ("revenue margin") was 14.6% for the fourth quarter, down 59 basis points compared with fourth quarter 2004 and similar to the 58 basis point year-over-year decline experienced in the third quarter of 2005. Domestic revenue margin was down 72 basis points, while international was down 13 basis points. The fourth quarter decline in worldwide revenue margin was due primarily to lower domestic hotel margin and lower domestic air revenue per ticket, partially offset by higher revenue margins associated with our destination services businesses. In addition, average airfares increased 7% year-over-year, which has the effect of increasing gross bookings without a corresponding increase in per ticket air revenues as our remuneration generally does not vary with the cost of the ticket.
          Profitability           Gross profit for the fourth quarter was $385 million, up $42 million, or 12% from fourth quarter 2004. Gross margin was down 33 basis points to 77.7%, driven by the inclusion of lower gross margin revenue from an acquired destination services company, which records its event ticketing revenue on a gross basis. Excluding this acquisition, gross margin would have increased 45 basis points.
          Operating Income Before Amortization ("OIBA") decreased 7% to $133 million, driven by the Company's more even distribution of selling and marketing expense throughout the year versus the prior year, hiring in our market management teams, increased general and administrative expenses to support the Company's spin-off as an independent public company and increased hiring in our technology teams. OIBA as a percentage of revenue was down 577 basis points to 26.9% reflecting higher growth in operating expenses as compared to revenue growth during the quarter, and lower gross margin.
          Operating income grew 22% during the quarter to $86 million. Operating income growth was greater than OIBA growth due to a $25 million reduction in stock-based compensation expense and relatively flat amortization of intangibles expense.
          Adjusted net income and net income for the fourth quarter both decreased by $19 million compared to the same period in 2004. Adjusted net income declined due to lower operating income before amortization, lower interest income and a higher effective tax rate. Net income declined due to an $18 million unrealized loss on derivative liabilities, lower interest income and a higher effective tax rate, partially offset by higher operating income. Adjusted EPS was $0.20 for the fourth quarter, and diluted EPS was $0.07.
          Cash Flows & Working Capital           For the three months ended December 31, 2005, net cash used in operating activities was $94 million. Free cash flow was negative $105 million. Both net cash used in operating activities and free cash flow for the quarter were negatively impacted by the timing of processing supplier payments.
          Discussion of Results - Full Year 2005
          Gross Bookings & Revenue           Gross bookings for 2005 increased 22% compared with 2004. Domestic gross bookings increased 15% and international gross bookings increased 50%, or 48% excluding the impact of year-over-year movements in foreign exchange. Revenue increased 15%, with domestic revenue increasing 8% and international revenue increasing 48%.
          Worldwide merchant hotel revenue for 2005 increased 10%, driven by a 9% increase in room nights and a 1% increase in revenue per room night. The increase in revenue per room night was fueled by a 7% increase in ADRs, offset by a contraction in hotel raw margin.
          Worldwide air revenue increased 5% in 2005, driven by a 17% increase in air tickets sold, offset by an 11% decline in air revenue per ticket. As in the fourth quarter, the decline in revenue per ticket was more pronounced in the merchant air business.
          Revenue margin for the year decreased 80 basis points from 14.4% to 13.6%, due largely to the decreases in hotel raw margin and air revenue per ticket. As in the fourth quarter, the revenue margin decline was more pronounced in Expedia's domestic operations, with revenue margin down 90 basis points, compared with a 21 basis point decline internationally.
          Profitability           Gross profit increased 13% to $1.65 billion, while gross margin was 77.8%, a decrease of 103 basis points compared with 78.8% in 2004, again due primarily to inclusion of the destination services company revenues on a gross basis.
          OIBA increased 13% to $627 million, while OIBA margin was down 44 basis points to 29.6% due to the decrease in gross margin, partially offset by a decrease in selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue due to offline marketing efficiency at Expedia.com(R) and Hotwire(R).
          Operating income increased 65% to $397 million, due to an $80 million decrease in stock-based compensation, increased revenue, relatively flat amortization of non-cash marketing and amortization expenses and a decrease in other operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. 
          Adjusted net income and net income increased by $49 million and $65 million respectively, both due primarily to increases in operating income, partially offset by lower interest income and correspondingly higher taxes. Adjusted EPS was $1.18 for full-year 2005, and diluted EPS was $0.65.
          For additional information on income statement items for both the three and twelve month periods ended December 31, 2005, please see the "Income Statement Notes" elsewhere in this release.
          Cash Flows & Working Capital           For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was $850 million. Free cash flow was $798 million. Both net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow for 2005 include inflows of $339 million from the increases in accounts payable, accrued liabilities and deferred merchant bookings.
          Highlights
          Income Statement Notes
          Notes & Definitions:           Gross Bookings -- Total retail value of transactions booked for both agency and merchant transactions, recorded at the time of booking. Bookings include the total price due for travel by travelers, including taxes, fees and other charges, and are not reduced for some cancellations and traveler refunds.
          Number of Transactions -- Quantity of purchases reported as booked, net of cancellations. Packages purchased using our packages wizard, which by definition include a merchant hotel, are recorded as a single transaction.
          Merchant Hotel Room Nights -- Worldwide merchant hotel nights, net of cancellations. With the exception of Hotwire, which records room nights upon booking, nights are reported as stayed. This metric includes nights stayed on both a package and stand-alone basis.
          Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures           Expedia, Inc. reports Operating Income Before Amortization, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS and Free Cash Flow, all of which are supplemental measures to GAAP, and are defined by the SEC as non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are among the primary metrics by which management evaluates the performance of the business, on which internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated.  Management believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools that management uses to analyze our results. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP.  We endeavor to compensate for the limitation of the non-GAAP measures presented by also providing comparable GAAP measures, GAAP financial statements, and descriptions of the reconciling items and adjustments, to derive the non-GAAP measures.
          Operating Income Before Amortization is defined as operating income plus: (1) amortization of non-cash distribution and marketing expense, (2) stock-based compensation expense, (3) amortization of intangible assets and goodwill impairment, if applicable and (4) certain one-time items, if applicable. Management believes this measure is useful to investors because it represents the combined operating results of Expedia, Inc.'s businesses, taking into account depreciation, which we believe is an ongoing cost of doing business, but excluding the effects of other non-cash expenses that may not be indicative of our core business operations. Operating Income Before Amortization has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to Expedia, Inc.'s statements of income of certain expenses, including non-cash compensation, non-cash payments to partners, and acquisition-related accounting. Due to the high variability and difficulty in predicting certain items that affect net income, such as interest rates and tax rates, Expedia, Inc. is unable to provide reconciliation to net income on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable efforts.
          Adjusted Net Income generally captures all items on the statements of income that have been, or ultimately will be, settled in cash and is defined as net income available to stockholders plus (1) amortization of non-cash distribution and marketing expense, (2) stock-based compensation expense, (3) amortization of intangible assets and goodwill impairment, if applicable, (4) one-time items, net of related tax, and minority interest, (5) mark to market gains and losses on derivative liabilities and (6) discontinued operations, net of tax. We believe Adjusted Net Income is useful to investors because it represents Expedia, Inc.'s combined results, taking into account depreciation, which management believes is an ongoing cost of doing business, but excluding the impact of other non-cash expenses and items not directly tied to the recurring core operations of our businesses.
          Adjusted EPS is defined as Adjusted Net Income divided by weighted fully diluted shares outstanding for Adjusted EPS purposes. We include dilution from options and warrants per the treasury stock method and include all shares relating to restricted stock units ("RSU") in shares outstanding for Adjusted EPS. This differs from the GAAP method for including RSUs, which treats them on a treasury method basis. Shares outstanding for Adjusted EPS purposes are therefore higher than shares outstanding for GAAP EPS purposes. We believe Adjusted EPS is useful to investors because it represents, on a per share basis, Expedia's consolidated results, taking into account depreciation, which we believe is an ongoing cost of doing business, as well as other charges which are not allocated to the operating businesses such as interest expense, taxes  and minority interest, but excluding the effects of other non-cash expenses not directly tied to the core operations of our businesses. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS have the same limitations as Operating Income Before Amortization. In addition, Adjusted Net Income does not include all items that affect our net income and net income per share for the period. Therefore, we think it is important to evaluate these measures along with our consolidated statements of income.
          Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Management believes Free Cash Flow is useful to investors because it represents the operating cash flow that our operating businesses generate, less capital expenditures but before taking into account other cash movements that are not directly tied to the core operations of our businesses, such as financing activities or certain investing activities. Free Cash Flow has certain limitations in that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period, nor does it represent the residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures. Therefore, it is important to evaluate Free Cash Flow along with the consolidated statements of cash flows.

          Safe Harbor Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995           This press release contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  These statements are not guarantees of future performance.  These forward-looking statements are based on management's expectations as of February 15, 2006, and assumptions which are inherently subject to uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict.

However, these words are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements. In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements and may include statements relating to future revenues, expenses, margins, profitability, net income, earnings per share and other measures of results of operation and the prospects for future growth of Expedia, Inc.'s business.
          Actual results and the timing and outcome of events may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements for a variety of reasons, including, among others: Expedia, Inc.'s ability to effectively update, automate and integrate disparate financial and accounting systems and approaches among its brands and businesses; the accuracy, integrity, security and redundancy of systems, including financial and accounting systems, and networks of Expedia, Inc.; reliance on newly implemented systems supporting our financial planning and projections; adverse changes in senior management; the rate of growth of the Internet and online travel; changes in global economic conditions; consumer spending, the competitive environment; the e-commerce industry and broadband access; world events (including adverse weather, health risks and terrorism); the rate of online migration in the various geographies and markets in which Expedia, Inc. operates, including Asia; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; the health of the travel industry, including consumer and business spending on travel; Expedia, Inc.'s ability to expand successfully in international markets; possible one-time charges resulting from, among other events, integration and process review activities, platform migration and shared services efforts; failure to realize cost efficiencies; the successful completion of pending corporate transactions and the integration of current and acquired businesses; and other risks detailed in Expedia, Inc.'s public filings with the SEC, including Expedia, Inc.'s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2005.
          Except as required by law, Expedia, Inc. undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking or other statements in this press release, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
          Basis of Presentation           On August 9, 2005, IAC separated into two independent companies. As a result, Expedia, Inc. became an independent public company (the "Spin-Off"). These financial statements present results of operations, financial position and cash flows on a combined basis until the Spin-Off and on a consolidated basis thereafter. The unaudited financial statements relating to periods prior to August 9, 2005 were prepared on a combined basis because there was no direct ownership relationship among any or all of the businesses that comprised Expedia, Inc. upon Spin-Off.
