The terms of the Separation Agreement provide that Mr. Conder will refrain from engaging in certain competitive activity for a specified period following his employment with the Company. In addition, Mr. Conder has agreed during such period to refrain from certain hiring, recruiting or soliciting activities related to the Company and its employees and officers.

The Company will also pay for certain relocation expenses. In addition, the agreement provides that the vesting of 9,352 restricted stock units held by Mr. Conder that would have vested in the one-year period following his date of termination of employment will be accelerated and be fully vested as of the later of July 31, 2006 or the expiration of a seven-day revocation period following Mr. Condor's execution of the agreement.
