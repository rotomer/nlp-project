Item 7.01
Regulation FD Disclosure
On June 22, 2007, Expedia, Inc. Chairman and Senior Executive Barry Diller circulated the following email to Expedia, Inc. employees:
I have seen recent reports from securities analysts and others regarding my plans for Expedia. I want to say clearly that I have no intention to transfer control of Expedia to Liberty Media Corporation under any circumstances. I don't want any of you to wonder or worry that the Company is being tossed around between me and Liberty as a pawn on a chessboard. It is not. I would prefer that there be no speculation, but since I can't prevent Liberty from doing so in numerous conferences and meetings, I'd rather be on the record, with clarity.
