EXHIBIT 99.1
BELLEVUE, Wash.November 7, 2007Expedia, Inc. (NASDAQ: EXPE) today announced financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2007.
"Expedia succeeded on almost every financial metric during the third quarter," said Barry Diller, Expedia, Inc.'s Chairman and Senior Executive. "These are good results, and our ability to keep them coming depends on the right balance of investment and profitable growthand I think we've shown our ability to be in proper cadence with those levers throughout this year."
"Thanks to the continued hard work of our employees around the globe, Expedia's brand portfolio delivered record revenue and OIBA in the third quarter," said Dara Khosrowshahi, Expedia Inc.'s CEO and President. "While we're particularly encouraged by 16% worldwide transaction growth and 47% European bookings growth, we are by no means satisfied with our progress, and believe there remain significant investment and growth opportunities ahead for Expedia."

Discussion of Results
Gross Bookings & Revenue
Gross bookings increased 21% for the third quarter of 2007 compared with the third quarter of 2006. North America bookings increased 13%, Europe bookings increased 47% (39% excluding the impact of foreign exchange) and Other bookings (primarily Expedia Corporate Travel and our Asia Pacific operations) increased 27%.
Revenue increased 24% for the third quarter, primarily driven by increased worldwide merchant hotel revenue and advertising and media revenue. North America revenue increased 19%, Europe revenue increased 37% (30% excluding foreign exchange) and Other revenue increased 41%.
Worldwide merchant hotel revenue increased 22% for the third quarter due to a 16% increase in room nights stayed, including rooms delivered as a component of vacation packages, and a 5% increase in revenue per room night. Revenue per room night increased due to a 5% increase in worldwide average daily rates ("ADRs"), partially offset by a 37 basis point decline in hotel raw margin.
Worldwide air revenue increased 9% for the third quarter due to a 15% increase in air tickets sold, partially offset by a 5% decrease in revenue per air ticket. The decrease in revenue per air ticket primarily reflects reduced air service fees, and to a lesser extent, decreased compensation from air carriers and global distribution system ("GDS") providers versus the prior year period.
Worldwide revenue from products and services other than merchant hotel and air (including advertising and media, car rentals, destination services and cruises), increased 40% for the third quarter due primarily to increased advertising and media revenues and car rental revenues.
Package revenue increased 12% compared with the prior year period primarily due to higher European package bookings and increased revenue margin on North American package bookings compared with the prior year period in which we pursued aggressive package discounting.
Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings ("revenue margin") was 14.76% for the third quarter, an increase of 35 basis points. North America revenue margin increased 68 basis points to 15.19%, Europe revenue margin decreased 116 basis points to 15.73%, and Other revenue margin increased 90 basis points to 9.08%. The third quarter increase in worldwide and North America revenue margin was primarily due to an increased mix of advertising and media revenues as compared to third quarter 2006. Europe revenue margin decreased primarily due to lower revenue from more competitive hotel pricing and lower air booking fees.
Profitability
Gross profit for the third quarter of 2007 was $609 million, an increase of 27% compared with the third quarter of 2006 primarily due to increased revenue and a 179 basis point improvement in gross margin to 80.11%. The gross margin increase was due to cost reductions from our various efficiency initiatives and an increased mix of advertising and media revenue.
OIBA for the third quarter increased 18% to $213 million, driven primarily by higher revenue. OIBA as a percentage of revenue decreased 131 basis points to 28.02%, primarily reflecting a higher growth in sales and marketing expenses excluding stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue, partially offset by a higher gross margin. Operating income increased 101% to $180 million primarily due to an intangible asset impairment in the prior year period, the same factors driving OIBA growth, and lower intangible amortization.
Adjusted net income for the third quarter increased $6 million due to higher OIBA, partially offset by net losses from foreign currency and higher net interest expense. Net income increased $41 million reflecting higher operating income, partially offset by a higher tax provision, an increase in net losses from foreign currency and higher net interest expense compared with the prior period. Third quarter adjusted EPS and diluted EPS were $0.39 and $0.32, respectively. These measures increased 15% and 88% due to the same factors impacting adjusted net income and net income, as well as lower net share counts from share repurchase activity since the prior year period.
 
Cash Flows & Working Capital
For the nine months ended September 30, 2007, net cash provided by operating activities was $965 million and free cash flow was $908 million. Both measures include $597 million of benefit from net changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily driven by seasonal receipt of cash related to our merchant hotel business. Free cash flow for the third quarter increased $43 million primarily due to higher OIBA, greater benefit from net changes in operating assets and liabilities and lower capital expenditures.

Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures
Expedia, Inc. reports Operating Income Before Amortization, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS, Free Cash Flow and non-GAAP operating expense (non-GAAP selling and marketing, non-GAAP general and administrative and non-GAAP technology and content), all of which are supplemental measures to GAAP and are defined by the SEC as non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are among the primary metrics by which management evaluates the performance of the business, on which internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated. Management believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools that management uses to analyze our results. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP. We endeavor to compensate for the limitation of the non-GAAP measures presented by also providing the most directly comparable GAAP measures and descriptions of the reconciling items and adjustments to derive the non-GAAP measures.
is defined as operating income plus: (1) amortization of non-cash distribution and marketing expense, (2) stock-based compensation expense, (3) amortization of intangible assets and goodwill and/or intangible asset impairment, if applicable and (4) certain one-time items, if applicable. OIBA represents the combined operating results of Expedia, Inc.'s businesses, taking into account depreciation, which we believe is an ongoing cost of doing business, but excluding the effects of other non-cash expenses that may not be indicative of our core business operations. Management believes this measure is useful to investors because it corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our core operations by excluding significant non-cash operating expenses such as stock-based compensation, and because it provides greater insight into management decision making at Expedia, Inc. as OIBA is our primary internal metric for evaluating the performance of our businesses. OIBA has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact of certain expenses to Expedia, Inc.'s statements of income, including stock-based compensation, non-cash payments to partners, acquisition-related accounting and certain one-time items, if applicable. Due to the high variability and difficulty in predicting certain items that affect net income, such as tax rates, stock price and interest rates, Expedia, Inc. is unable to provide a reconciliation to net income on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable efforts.
Operating Income Before Amortization ("OIBA")
generally captures all items on the statements of income that have been, or ultimately will be, settled in cash and is defined as net income available to stockholders plus net of tax (1) amortization of non-cash distribution and marketing expense, (2) stock-based compensation expense, (3) amortization of intangible assets, including as part of equity-method investments, and goodwill and/or intangible impairment, if applicable, (4) one-time items, (5) mark to market gains and losses on derivative liabilities, (6) discontinued operations and (7) the minority interest impact of the aforementioned adjustment items. We believe Adjusted Net Income is useful to investors because it represents Expedia, Inc.'s combined results, taking into account depreciation, which management believes is an ongoing cost of doing business, but excluding the impact of other non-cash expenses and items not directly tied to the core operations of our businesses.
Adjusted Net Income
 
is defined as Adjusted Net Income divided by weighted fully diluted shares outstanding for Adjusted EPS purposes. We include dilution from options and warrants per the treasury stock method and include all shares relating to RSUs in shares outstanding for Adjusted EPS. This differs from the GAAP method for including RSUs, which treats them on a treasury method basis. Shares outstanding for Adjusted EPS purposes are therefore higher than shares outstanding for GAAP EPS purposes. We believe Adjusted EPS is useful to investors because it represents, on a per share basis, Expedia's consolidated results, taking into account depreciation, which we believe is an ongoing cost of doing business, as well as other charges which are not allocated to the operating businesses such as interest expense, taxes and minority interest, but excluding the effects of non-cash expenses not directly tied to the core operations of our businesses. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS have similar limitations as OIBA. In addition, Adjusted Net Income does not include all items that affect our net income and net income per share for the period. Therefore, we think it is important to evaluate these measures along with our consolidated statements of income.
Adjusted EPS
is defined as net cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Management believes Free Cash Flow is useful to investors because it represents the operating cash flow that our operating businesses generate, less capital expenditures but before taking into account other cash movements that are not directly tied to the core operations of our businesses, such as financing activities, foreign exchange or certain investing activities. Free Cash Flow has certain limitations in that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period, nor does it represent the residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures. Therefore, it is important to evaluate Free Cash Flow along with the consolidated statements of cash flows.
Free Cash Flow
exclude stock-based compensation related to expenses for stock options, restricted stock units and other equity compensation under FAS 123(R). Expedia, Inc. excludes stock-based compensation expenses from these measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses that we do not believe are necessarily reflective of our ongoing cash operating expenses and cash operating income. These expenses are also likely to decline in the near future as we no longer award options as our primary form of equity compensation. In addition, due to historical accounting charges and credits related to our spin-off from IAC, changes in forfeiture estimates and other events, stock-based compensation has been highly variable in some historical quarters, impairing year-on-year and quarter-to-quarter comparability. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use when adopting FAS 123(R), management believes that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between our recurring core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing management with an important tool for financial operational decision making and for evaluating our own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time. There are certain limitations in using financial measures that do not take into account stock-based compensation, including the fact that stock-based compensation is a recurring expense and a valued part of employees' compensation. Therefore it is important to evaluate both our GAAP and non-GAAP measures. See the Note to the Consolidated Statements of Income for stock-based compensation by line item.
