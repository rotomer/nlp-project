Exhibit 99.1
BELLEVUE, Wash.July 31, 2008Expedia, Inc. (NASDAQ: EXPE) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2008.
"Expedia extended its global leadership position in travel with its sixth consecutive quarter of double digit revenue growth," said Barry Diller, Expedia, Inc.'s Chairman and Senior Executive. "Despite an uncertain economic environment we intend to aggressively expand our worldwide reach, as evidenced by our acquisition of Virtual Tourist, a leading community of user-generated travel content, and our intended acquisition of Venere, a European agency lodging site."
"Against a backdrop of unprecedented oil prices and airline industry capacity reductions, Expedia employees continued to execute in the second quarter, delivering solid growth in bookings, revenue and OIBA," said Dara Khosrowshahi, Expedia, Inc.'s CEO and President. "With our advertising and media businesses and international sites now delivering over 40 percent of revenue, Expedia has meaningfully diversified its growth drivers, and established a strong foundation for long-term growth in free cash flow and shareholder value."

Discussion of Results
Gross Bookings & Revenue
Gross bookings increased 16% for the second quarter of 2008 compared with the second quarter of 2007. North America bookings increased 10%, Europe bookings increased 30% (19% excluding the net benefit from foreign exchange) and Other bookings (primarily Egencia and our Asia Pacific operations) increased 31%.
Revenue increased 15% for the second quarter, primarily driven by increased worldwide merchant hotel revenue and advertising and media revenue. North America revenue increased 10%, Europe revenue increased 28% (17% excluding foreign exchange) and Other revenue increased 36%.
Worldwide merchant hotel revenue increased 10% for the second quarter due to a 13% increase in room nights stayed, including rooms delivered as a component of packages, partially offset by a 2% decrease in revenue per room night. Revenue per night decreased due to a decline in hotel margins, partially offset by a 1% increase in average daily rates.
Worldwide air revenue increased 14% for the second quarter due to a 9% increase in revenue per air ticket and a 4% increase in air tickets sold.
Worldwide revenue from products and services other than merchant hotel and air (including advertising and media, car rentals, destination services, agency hotel and cruises) increased 31% for the second quarter due primarily to increased revenue from advertising and media and car rentals. Package revenue increased 4% from growth in international package gross bookings.
Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings ("revenue margin") was 13.40% for the second quarter, a decrease of 5 basis points. North America revenue margin decreased 2 basis points to 13.55%, Europe revenue margin decreased 26 basis points to 15.23%, and Other revenue margin increased 31 basis points to 8.70%. The second quarter decrease in European revenue margins was primarily due to lower revenue from more competitive hotel pricing. Worldwide and North America revenue margins were relatively flat as an increased mix of advertising and media revenue largely offset the impact of more competitive hotel pricing.
Second quarter revenue growth and revenue margins were negatively impacted by higher revenues from the Easter holiday falling in the first quarter in 2008 compared with the second quarter in 2007.
Profitability
Gross profit for the second quarter of 2008 was $626 million, an increase of 15% compared with the second quarter of 2007 due to increased revenue.
OIBA for the second quarter increased 9% to $204 million, driven primarily by higher revenue. OIBA as a percentage of revenue decreased 145 basis points to 25.67%, primarily reflecting higher growth in technology and content and sales and marketing expenses excluding stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue. Operating income increased 11% to $171 million primarily due to the same factors driving OIBA growth, as well as lower amortization and stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue.
Adjusted net income for the second quarter increased $6 million compared to the prior year period driven by higher OIBA, partially offset by higher net interest expense. Net income was flat due to an increase in operating income being offset by a gain related to federal excise tax refunds in the prior year period and higher net interest expense. Second quarter adjusted EPS and diluted EPS were $0.40 and $0.33, respectively. These measures increased 14% and 10% respectively primarily due to lower average share counts primarily resulting from shares repurchased in August 2007.
Cash Flows & Working Capital
For the six months ended June 30, 2008, net cash provided by operating activities was $871 million and free cash flow was $800 million. Both measures include $630 million from net changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily driven by our merchant hotel business. Free cash flow for the period decreased $83 million from the prior year period primarily due to decreased net changes in operating assets and liabilities (including faster invoice and payment processing for hotel suppliers), higher cash taxes and increased capital expenditures, offsetting increased OIBA.

Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures
Expedia, Inc. reports Operating Income Before Amortization, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS, Free Cash Flow and non-GAAP operating expense (non-GAAP selling and marketing, non-GAAP general and administrative and non-GAAP technology and content), all of which are supplemental measures to GAAP and are defined by the SEC as non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are among the primary metrics by which management evaluates the performance of the business, on which internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated. Management believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools that management uses to analyze our results. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP. We endeavor to compensate for the limitation of the non-GAAP measures presented by also providing the most directly comparable GAAP measures and descriptions of the reconciling items and adjustments to derive the non-GAAP measures.
is defined as operating income plus: (1) stock-based compensation expense, (2) amortization of intangible assets and goodwill and/or intangible asset impairment, if applicable and (3) certain one-time items, if applicable. OIBA represents the combined operating results of Expedia, Inc.'s businesses, taking into account depreciation (including internal-use software and website development), which we believe is an ongoing cost of doing business, but excluding the effects of other non-cash expenses that may not be indicative of our core business operations. Management believes this performance measure is useful to investors because it corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our core operations by excluding significant non-cash operating expenses such as stock-based compensation, and because it provides greater insight into management decision making at Expedia, Inc. as OIBA is our primary internal metric for evaluating the performance of our businesses. OIBA has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact of certain expenses to Expedia, Inc.'s statements of income, including stock-based compensation, acquisition-related accounting and certain one-time items, if applicable. Due to the high variability and difficulty in predicting certain items that affect net income, such as tax rates, stock price and interest rates, Expedia, Inc. is unable to provide a reconciliation to net income on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable efforts.
Operating Income Before Amortization ("OIBA")
generally captures all items on the statements of income that have been, or ultimately will be, settled in cash and is defined as net income available to stockholders plus net of tax (1) stock-based compensation expense, (2) amortization of intangible assets, including as part of equity-method investments, and goodwill and/or intangible impairment, if applicable, (3) one-time items, (4) mark to market gains and losses on derivative liabilities, (5) currency gains or losses on U.S. dollar denominated cash equivalents held by eLong, (6) discontinued operations and (7) the minority interest impact of the aforementioned adjustment items. We believe Adjusted Net Income is useful to investors because it represents Expedia, Inc.'s combined results, taking into account depreciation, which management believes is an ongoing cost of doing business, but excluding the impact of other non-cash expenses and items not directly tied to the core operations of our businesses.
Adjusted Net Income
 
is defined as Adjusted Net Income divided by weighted fully diluted shares outstanding for Adjusted EPS purposes. We include dilution from options and warrants per the treasury stock method and include all shares relating to RSUs in shares outstanding for Adjusted EPS. This differs from the GAAP method for including RSUs, which treats them on a treasury method basis. Shares outstanding for Adjusted EPS purposes are therefore higher than shares outstanding for GAAP EPS purposes. We believe Adjusted EPS is useful to investors because it represents, on a per share basis, Expedia's consolidated results, taking into account depreciation, which we believe is an ongoing cost of doing business, as well as other items which are not allocated to the operating businesses such as interest expense, taxes, foreign exchange gains or losses, and minority interest, but excluding the effects of non-cash expenses not directly tied to the core operations of our businesses. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS have similar limitations as OIBA. In addition, Adjusted Net Income does not include all items that affect our net income and net income per share for the period. Therefore, we think it is important to evaluate these measures along with our consolidated statements of income.
Adjusted EPS
is defined as net cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Management believes Free Cash Flow is useful to investors because it represents the operating cash flow that our operating businesses generate, less capital expenditures but before taking into account other cash movements that are not directly tied to the core operations of our businesses, such as financing activities, foreign exchange or certain investing activities. Free Cash Flow has certain limitations in that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period, nor does it represent the residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures. Therefore, it is important to evaluate Free Cash Flow along with the consolidated statements of cash flows.
Free Cash Flow
exclude stock-based compensation related to expenses for stock options, restricted stock units and other equity compensation under FAS 123(R). Expedia, Inc. excludes stock-based compensation expenses from these measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses that we do not believe are necessarily reflective of our ongoing cash operating expenses and cash operating income. In addition, due to historical accounting charges and credits related to our spin-off from IAC, changes in forfeiture estimates and other events, stock-based compensation has been highly variable in some historical quarters, impairing year-on-year and quarter-to-quarter comparability. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use when adopting FAS 123(R), management believes that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between our recurring core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing management with an important tool for financial operational decision making and for evaluating our own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time. There are certain limitations in using financial measures that do not take into account stock-based compensation, including the fact that stock-based compensation is a recurring expense and a valued part of employees' compensation. Therefore it is important to evaluate both our GAAP and non-GAAP measures. See the Note to the Consolidated Statements of Income for stock-based compensation by line item.
