None of the Agents, the Lenders, the Issuing Banks or any of their Related Parties shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the applicable Issuing Bank; that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse an Issuing Bank from liability to a Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by each Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by such Borrower that are caused by such Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of an Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the

contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.
          (g) The applicable Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The applicable Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the applicable Borrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether such Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the applicable Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.
Disbursement Procedures.
provided
          (h) If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the applicable Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the applicable Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, (i) in the case of any LC Disbursement denominated in US Dollars, and at all times following the conversion to US Dollars of an LC Disbursement made in an Alternative Currency pursuant to paragraph (e) or (1) of this Section, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans, and (ii) if such LC Disbursement is made in an Alternative Currency, at all times prior to its conversion to US Dollars pursuant to paragraph (e) or (1) of this Section, at a rate equal to the rate reasonably determined by the applicable Issuing Bank to be the cost to such Issuing Bank of funding such LC Disbursement plus the Applicable Margin applicable to Eurocurrency Revolving Loans at such time; that, if the applicable Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.13(c) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.
Interim Interest.
provided
          (i) An Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Company, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of an Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Company and the Borrowers shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.12(b). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to
Replacement of an Issuing Bank.
 
such replacement (including the right to receive fees under Section 2.12(b)), but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.
          (j) If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Company receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, each Borrower shall deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, an amount in cash equal to the LC Exposure attributable to Letters of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; that (i) amounts payable in respect of any Letter of Credit or LC Disbursement shall be payable in the currency of such Letter of Credit or LC Disbursement, except that LC Disbursements in an Alternative Currency in respect of which the applicable Borrower's reimbursement obligations have been converted to obligations in US Dollars as provided in paragraph (e) above and interest accrued thereon shall be payable in US Dollars and (ii) the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Company or any Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of Article VII. Such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the applicable Borrower under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be in Permitted Investments and shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the applicable Borrower's risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Banks for LC Disbursements for which they have not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the applicable Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Company and the Borrowers under this Agreement. If a Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to such Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived.
Cash Collateralization.

amendment, renewal or extension (and whether the amount thereof shall have changed), it being understood that such Issuing Bank shall not effect any issuance, renewal, extension or amendment resulting in an increase in the amount of any Letter of Credit without first obtaining written confirmation from the Administrative Agent that such increase is then permitted under this Agreement, (ii) on each Business Day on which such Issuing Bank makes any LC Disbursement, the date, currency and amount of such LC Disbursement, (iii) on any Business Day on which a Borrower fails to reimburse an LC Disbursement required to be reimbursed to such Issuing Bank on such day, the date of such failure and the currency and amount of such LC Disbursement and (iv) on any other Business Day, such other information as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request as to the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank.
          (1) In the event that the Loans become immediately due and payable on any date pursuant to Article VII, all amounts (i) that the Borrowers are at the time or become thereafter required to reimburse or otherwise pay to the Applicable Agent in respect of LC Disbursements made under any Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency (other than amounts in respect of which the Borrowers have deposited cash collateral, if such cash collateral was deposited in the applicable currency), (ii) that the Lenders are at the time or become thereafter required to pay to the Applicable Agent (and the Administrative Agent is at the time or becomes thereafter required to distribute to the applicable Issuing Bank) pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section in respect of unreimbursed LC Disbursements made under any Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency and (iii) of each Lender's participation in any Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency under which an LC Disbursement has been made shall, automatically and with no further action required, be converted into the US Dollar Equivalent, calculated using the LC Exchange Rates on such date (or in the case of any LC Disbursement made after such date, on the date such LC Disbursement is made), of such amounts. On and after such conversion, all amounts accruing and owed to the Applicable Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in respect of the obligations described in this paragraph shall accrue and be payable in US Dollars at the rates otherwise applicable hereunder.
Conversion.
          SECTION 2.07. (a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds in the applicable currency by 12:00 noon, Local Time, to the account of the Applicable Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders; that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.05. The Applicable Agent will make such Loans available to the applicable Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of such Borrower maintained with the Applicable Agent and designated by such Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request; that ABR Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.06(e) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank.
Funding of Borrowings.
provided
provided
          (b) Unless the Applicable Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Applicable Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Applicable Agent may
 
assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Applicable Agent, then the applicable Lender and the applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to the Applicable Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to such Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Applicable Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, (A) if denominated in US Dollars, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Applicable Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (B) if denominated in an Alternative Currency, a rate determined by the Applicable Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, or (ii) in the case of such Borrower, if denominated in US Dollars, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans and (B) if denominated in an Alternative Currency, the interest rate applicable to the subject Loan. If such Lender pays such amount to the Applicable Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing.
          SECTION 2.08. (a) Each Revolving Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the applicable Borrower may elect to convert any Borrowing denominated in US Dollars to a different Type or to continue any Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The applicable Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued.
Interest Elections.
          (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the applicable Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if such Borrower were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by such Borrower. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, no Borrower shall be permitted to change the currency of any Borrowing or to convert any Borrowing to a Type not available under the Class of Commitments pursuant to which such Borrowing Drawing was made.
          (c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
 
     (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);
     (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
     (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing, a Eurocurrency Borrowing; and
     (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period".
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.
          (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.
          (e) If a Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then such Borrowing shall be repaid as provided herein at the end of such Interest Period, unless such Borrowing is denominated in US Dollars, in which case (unless it is so repaid) it shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of such Interest Period. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the applicable Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) in the case of Borrowings denominated in US Dollars, (A) no outstanding Revolving Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing and (B) unless repaid, each Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, and (ii) in the case of Borrowings denominated in Alternative Currencies, unless repaid, each Eurocurrency Borrowing shall be continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing with an Interest Period of one month's duration.
          SECTION 2.09. (a) Unless previously terminated, the Commitments and each LC Commitment shall terminate on the Maturity Date.
Termination and Reduction of Commitments; Increase of Commitments.
          (b) The Company may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitments; that (i) each reduction of the Commitments under any Tranche shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of the Borrowing Multiple for US Dollar denominated Loans and not less than the Borrowing Minimum for US Dollar

          (c) The Company shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Company pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; that a notice of termination of the Commitments of any Tranche delivered by the Company may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Company (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments under any Tranche shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments under such Tranche.
provided
          (d) The Company may from time to time increase the aggregate amount of Commitments under either Tranche pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph.
     (i) The Company may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent (who shall promptly forward such notice to each Lender under the applicable Tranche), request (A) that the total Commitments under either Tranche be increased (a "") by an amount for each increased Tranche of not less than US$25,000,000, and (B) at the election of the Company, that simultaneous decreases (each a "") be made to the Commitments under the other Tranche; that at no time shall the aggregate amount of Commitment Increases effected pursuant to this paragraph, when taken together with the aggregate amount of new Commitments established under Section 9.02(c), exceed the aggregate amount of Commitment Decreases effected pursuant to this paragraph by more than US$250,000,000. Each such notice shall set forth the amount of the requested Commitment Increase (and Commitment Decrease, as applicable) in each Tranche, and the date on which such adjustment is requested to become effective (which shall be not less than 10 Business Days or more than 30 days after the date of such notice), and shall offer each Lender holding a Commitment under any increasing Tranche the opportunity to increase its Commitment in such Tranche by its Tranche Percentage of the proposed increased amount. Each such Lender shall, by notice to the Company and the Administrative Agent given not more than five Business Days after the date of the Company's notice, either agree to increase its applicable Commitment by all or a portion of the offered amount (each Lender so agreeing being an "" with respect to such Tranche) or decline to increase its applicable Commitment (and any Lender that does not deliver such a notice within such period of five Business Days shall be deemed to have declined to increase its Commitment) (each Lender so declining or deemed to have declined

Any Commitment Increase under any Tranche may be made in an amount less than the Commitment Increase requested by the Company if the Company is unable to arrange for, or chooses not to arrange for, Augmenting Lenders. Not less than three Business Days prior to the effective date (the "") of any Commitment Increase under any Tranche pursuant to this Section 2.09(d), the Company shall by written notice to the Administrative Agent confirm the Commitment Decreases, if any, to be made to the Commitments under the other Tranches specified in the original notice given in respect of the proposed adjustments or shall specify the Commitment Decreases, if any, to be made in lieu thereof.

In such event, each Borrower under such Class shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).

If the Borrowers have provided cash collateral to secure the reimbursement obligations of the Borrowers in respect of Letters of Credit, then, so long as no Event of Default shall exist, such cash collateral shall be released to the Borrowers if so requested by the Company at any time if and to the extent that, after giving effect to such release, the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Exposures under the applicable Tranche would not exceed the aggregate amount of the Commitments under such Tranche.

Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Revolving Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Revolving Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Revolving Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02.

For purposes of computing commitment fees, a Commitment of a Lender under any Tranche shall be deemed to be used to the extent of the outstanding Loans and LC Exposure of such Lender under such Tranche (and the Swingline Exposure of such Lender shall be disregarded for such purpose prior to the acquisition by such Lender of a participation therein pursuant to Section 2.05(c)).
          (b) The Company and the Borrowers agree to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a participation fee with respect to its participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the average daily amount of such Lender's LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on which the last of such Lender's Commitments terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure, and (ii) to each Issuing Bank a fronting fee, which shall accrue at the rate or rates per annum separately agreed upon between the Company and such Issuing Bank during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date the LC Commitment of such Issuing Bank is reduced to zero and the date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure, as well as such Issuing Bank's standard fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees accrued through and including the last day of March, June, September and December of each year shall be payable on the third Business Day following such last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date; that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which the Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. Any other fees payable to any Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within 10 days after demand. All participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).
provided
          (c) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to the Issuing Banks, in the case of fees payable to them) for distribution, in the case of commitment fees and participation fees, to the Lenders entitled thereto. Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances.
          SECTION 2.13. (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing (including each Swingline Loan) shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate.
Interest.
          (b) The Loans comprising each Eurocurrency Borrowing shall bear interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate.
 
          (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Company or any Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section.
2%
          (d) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and, in the case of Revolving Loans, upon termination of the Commitments; that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurocurrency Revolving Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion. All interest shall be payable in the currency in which the applicable Loan is denominated.
provided
          (e) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that (i) interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate and (ii) interest on Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Sterling shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate or Adjusted LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
          SECTION 2.14. If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Borrowing:
Alternate Rate of Interest.
     (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period; or
     (b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the majority in interest of the Lenders under the affected Tranche that the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Company and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Company and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Revolving Borrowing to, or continuation of any Revolving
 
Borrowing as, a Eurocurrency Borrowing shall be ineffective, and unless repaid such Borrowing shall, if denominated in US Dollars, be made as an ABR Borrowing, or if denominated in an Alternative Currency, bear interest at such rate as the Administrative Agent shall determine adequately and fairly reflects the cost to the affected Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate, and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, such Borrowing shall, if denominated in US Dollars, be made as an ABR Borrowing, or if denominated in an Alternative Currency, bear interest at such rate as the Administrative Agent shall determine adequately and fairly reflects the cost to the affected Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate; that if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect only one Type of Borrowings, then the other Type of Borrowings shall be permitted.
provided
          SECTION 2.15. (a) If any Change in Law shall:
Increased Costs.
     (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or any Issuing Bank; or
     (ii) impose on any Lender or any Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or such Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or such Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Company and the Borrowers will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
          (b) If any Lender or any Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Company and the Borrowers will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such
 
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
          (c) A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, as the case may be, setting forth in reasonable detail the manner in which such amount or amounts have been determined, shall be delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Company and the Borrowers shall pay such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 Business Days after receipt thereof.
          (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation; that the Company and the Borrowers shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Company of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's intention to claim compensation therefor; that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

          (e) If an Agent, a Lender or an Issuing Bank determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any amount as to which it has been indemnified by the Company or a Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.15, it shall pay over such refund to the Company or such Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made by the Company or such Borrower under this Section 2.15 with respect to the events giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of such Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); , that the Company and the Borrowers, upon the request of such Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, agree to repay the amount paid over to the Company or a Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event such Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be construed to require any Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank to make available its accounting records (or any other information which it deems confidential) to the Company or a Borrower or any other Person.

In the case of a Eurocurrency Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for deposits in the applicable currency of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurocurrency market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Company and the Borrowers shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 20 days after receipt thereof.
          SECTION 2.17. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Company and the Borrowers hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; that if the Company or any Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Applicable Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Company or the applicable Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Company or the applicable Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

A certificate as to the amount of such payment or
 
liability delivered to the Company by a Lender or an Issuing Bank, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or an Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
          (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Company or a Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Company or such Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
          (e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Company or a Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Company or such Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company or such Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate.
          (f) If an Agent, a Lender or an Issuing Bank determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Company or a Borrower or with respect to which the Company or a Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.17, it shall pay over such refund to the Company or such Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Company or such Borrower under this Section 2.17 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of such Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); that the Company and the Borrowers, upon the request of such Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, agree to repay the amount paid over to the Company or a Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to such Agent or such Lender in the event such Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.

Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the

discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Applicable Agent to the applicable account specified by it for the account of the Lenders or, in any such case, to such other account as the Applicable Agent shall from time to time specify in a notice delivered to the Company, except payments to be made directly to an Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto and payments pursuant to other Loan Documents shall be made to the Persons specified therein. The Applicable Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment under any Loan Document shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. Except as otherwise provided herein, (i) all payments of principal, interest or reimbursement obligations in respect of any Loan or Letter of Credit shall be made in the currency of such Loan or Letter of Credit and (ii) all other payments under each Loan Document (including all fees) shall be made in US Dollars.
          (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Applicable Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
          (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans under any Tranche resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender under such Tranche, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders in such Tranche to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Company or any Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any
provided
 
assignee or participant, other than to the Company, a Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Company and each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Company and each Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Company or such Borrower, as the case may be, in the amount of such participation.
          (d) Unless the Applicable Agent shall have received notice from the Company prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or an Issuing Bank hereunder that the Company and the Borrowers will not make such payment, the Applicable Agent may assume that the Company or a Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Company or a Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Applicable Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Applicable Agent, at (A) if such amount is denominated in US Dollars, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Applicable Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, and (B) if such amount is denominated in an Alternative Currency, a rate determined by the Applicable Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
          (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(c), 2.06(d) or (e), 2.07(b) or 2.18(d), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by either Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
          SECTION 2.19. (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Company or any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Company and the Borrowers hereby agree to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
 
          (b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Company or any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (i) the Company shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Swingline Lender, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Company or a Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

Any amendment or modification effected in accordance with this paragraph will be binding on each Borrowing Subsidiary whether or not such Borrowing Subsidiary shall have consented thereto.
          (c) Notwithstanding anything in paragraph (b) of this Section to the contrary, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents may be amended at any time and from time to time to add a currency or pricing option under any Tranche or to establish one or more additional Tranches of revolving credit commitments to be made available to one or more Borrowers by an agreement in writing entered into by the Company, such Borrower or Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and each person (including any Lender) that shall agree to provide such currency, pricing option or commitment (but without the consent of any other Lender), and each such person that shall not already be a Lender shall, at the time such agreement becomes effective, become a Lender with the same effect as if it had originally been a Lender under this Agreement with the commitment set forth in such agreement; , that: (i) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the new commitments of all such Tranches established pursuant to this paragraph shall, when taken together with the net amount (if positive) of Commitment Increases over Commitment Decreases under (and as defined in) Section 2.09(d), at no time, without the consent of the Required Lenders, exceed US$250,000,000 and (ii) the terms applicable to any additional revolving credit commitments of a Tranche and the Loans and Letters of Credit thereunder shall be the same as those applicable to the existing Commitments of such Tranche and the Loans and Letters of Credit thereunder (after giving effect to any amendment in connection with the establishment of such additional revolving credit commitments). Any such agreement establishing a new Tranche shall amend the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to set forth the terms of each Tranche established thereby (including the amount and final maturity thereof (which shall not be earlier than the Maturity Date), the interest to accrue and be payable thereon and any fees to be payable in respect thereof) and to effect such other changes (including changes to the provisions of this Section, Section 2.18 and the definition of "Required Lenders") as the Company and the Administrative Agent shall deem necessary or advisable in connection with the establishment of any such Tranche; , that no such agreement shall: (i) effect any change described in any of clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (vi) of paragraph (b) of this Section without the consent of each person required to consent to such change under such clause (it being agreed, however, that any establishment of any Tranche of revolving credit commitments will not, of itself, be

The loans, commitments and borrowings of any Tranche established pursuant to this paragraph shall constitute Loans, Commitments and Borrowings under, and shall be entitled to all the benefits afforded by, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and shall, without limiting the foregoing, benefit equally and ratably from the Guarantees created by the Guarantee Agreement. The Company and the Borrowers shall take any actions reasonably required by the Administrative Agent to ensure and/or demonstrate that the Guarantee Requirement continues to be satisfied after the establishment of any such Tranche of new commitments.

Guarantee.
          (b) Each of the Guarantors further agrees that the due and punctual payment of the Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon its guarantee notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any Obligation.

          (b) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party or the unenforceability of the Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party, other than the payment in full in cash of all the Obligations guaranteed hereunder by such Guarantor.

          SECTION 5. Each of the Guarantors agrees that its guarantee hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Obligation guaranteed hereunder by such Guarantor is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Agent or Lender upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower, any other Loan Party or otherwise.
Reinstatement.
          SECTION 6. In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which any Agent or Lender may have at law or in equity against any Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of any of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party to pay any Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, each Guarantor that guarantees such Obligation hereby promises to and will, upon receipt of written demand by any Agent or Lender, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Applicable Agent or Lender in cash the amount equal to the unpaid principal amount of such Obligations then due, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Each Guarantor further agrees that if payment in respect of any Obligation guaranteed hereunder by such Guarantor shall be due in a currency other than US Dollars and/or at a place of payment other than New York and if, by reason of any Change in Law, disruption of currency or foreign exchange markets, war or civil disturbance or other event, payment of such Obligation in such currency or at such place of payment shall be impossible or, in the reasonable judgment of any Agent or Lender, not consistent with the protection of its rights or interests, then, at the election of the Administrative Agent, such Guarantor shall make payment of such Obligation in US

Dollars (based upon the applicable Exchange Rate in effect on the date of payment) and/or in New York, and shall indemnify each Agent and Lender against any losses or reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that it shall sustain as a result of such alternative payment.

          Subject to the subordination provisions contained in the preceding paragraph of this Section 6, (i) each of the Borrowers agrees to indemnify any Guarantor making any payment in respect of any Obligations of such Borrower as required under this Section 6 for the full amount of such payment and, until such indemnification obligation shall have been satisfied, such Guarantor shall be subrogated to the rights of the person to whom such payment shall have been made to the extent of such payment, and (ii) each Guarantor (a "") agrees that, in the event a payment shall be made by any other Guarantor under this Agreement, and such other Guarantor (the "") shall not have been fully indemnified by the Borrowers as provided for in clause (i), the Contributing Guarantor shall, to the extent the Claiming Guarantor shall not have been so indemnified by the Borrowers, indemnify the Claiming Guarantor in an amount equal to the amount of such payment, multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the net worth of the Contributing Guarantor on the date hereof (or, in the case of any Guarantor becoming a party hereto pursuant to Section 21, the date of the Supplement hereto executed and delivered by such Guarantor) and the denominator shall be the aggregate net worth of all the Guarantors on the date hereof (or, in the case of any Guarantor becoming a party hereto pursuant to Section 21, the date of the Supplement hereto executed and delivered by such Guarantor).

Disclosed Matters
     Set forth below are the Legal Proceedings identified in the Form S-4 filed with the SEC by IAC/InterActive Corp and Expedia, Inc. in June 2005. As of July 8, 2005, the Company does not believe that the Disclosed Matters, individually or in the aggregate, will result in a Material Adverse Effect.
     All of the litigation matters described below, which were commenced prior to the formation of Expedia, involve the activities of and/or information concerning one or more of Expedia's businesses. In certain of these litigation matters, IAC and/or its current and certain former directors and officers have been named as defendants, which litigation matters are referred to herein as the IAC/Expedia Litigation Matters. In connection with the spin-off, as noted in the IAC Agreements, Expedia and IAC have agreed to certain indemnification arrangements relating to the IAC/Expedia Litigation Matters.
     For purposes of the litigation-related disclosure set forth immediately below, the term Expedia refers to Expedia, Inc., the Washington corporation, through which Expedia.com has historically been, and is currently, operated and managed.
     Securities Class Action Litigation against IAC. On September 20, 2004, a purported shareholder class action, Steven Malasky, on Behalf of Himself and All Others Similarly Situated v. IAC/InterActiveCorp et al., No. 04 Civ. 7447, was commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against IAC, certain of its officers, and one outside director, alleging violations of the federal securities laws. Thereafter, eleven other such lawsuits containing substantially similar allegations were filed in the same court. The complaints in these cases generally allege that the value of IAC common stock was artificially inflated by statements about its financial results and forecasts, made prior to its August 4, 2004 announcement of its earnings for the second quarter of 2004, that were false and misleading due to the defendants' alleged failure to disclose various problems faced by travel businesses.
IAC's
     In rulings on December 20, 2004 and March 7, 2005, the district court consolidated the twelve lawsuits into a single action captioned appointed co-lead plaintiffs, and designated co-lead counsel. On May 20, 2005, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint naming as defendants IAC, three of its officers, one former officer, six directors, three former directors, and one former officer of Expedia. The amended complaint contains factual allegations substantially similar to the allegations in the initial complaints, purports to assert claims under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, and seeks damages in an unspecified amount. The plaintiffs seek to represent a class of shareholders who purchased shares of IAC common stock between March 31, 2003 and August 3, 2004. IAC intends to defend vigorously against this lawsuit.
In re IAC/InterActiveCorp Securities Litigation,
     On October 18, 2004, a related shareholder derivative action, , No. 04-603416, was commenced in the Supreme Court of the State of New York (New York County) against IAC's directors and certain officers. IAC is a nominal defendant. This action is based on similar factual allegations as the federal securities class action described above. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the director defendants breached their fiduciary duties by failing to exercise their oversight responsibilities to ensure the integrity of IAC's business practices, financial reporting, and public statements. The complaint also purports to assert claims for misappropriation of confidential

information for personal profit, contribution and indemnification. The complaint seeks damages in an unspecified amount and restitution of all remuneration paid by IAC to the individual defendants during the period of the alleged breach of duty.
     On November 15, 2004, a second related shareholder derivative action, , No. 04 Civ. 9067, was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against IAC's current directors and certain former directors of IAC. IAC is a nominal defendant. The action is based on similar factual allegations as the federal securities class action and the other shareholder derivative suit described above. The complaint purports to assert claims for violation of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets, and unjust enrichment. The complaint seeks an order voiding the election of IAC's current Board of Directors, as well as damages in an unspecified amount, various forms of equitable relief, restitution, and disgorgement of remuneration received by the individual defendants from IAC.

     On January 24, 2005, the federal district court consolidated the shareholder derivative suit with the consolidated securities class action for pre-trial purposes only. On February 2, 2005, the defendants in the shareholder derivative suit removed the case from New York state court to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. On April 11, 2005, the district court consolidated the derivative suit with the securities class action for pre-trial purposes only. On June 3, 2005, the district court designated co-lead plaintiffs' counsel in the derivative cases and directed that a consolidated amended derivative complaint be filed by July 6, 2005.

     On April 10, 2003, the day of the announcement of the IAC/Hotels.com merger agreement, a purported class action on behalf of Hotels.com shareholders was filed in the Delaware Chancery Court against Hotels.com, IAC, and members of the board of directors of Hotels.com. , No. 20248-NC (New Castle County). Also on April 10, 2003, the plaintiff in a purported shareholder derivative action on behalf of Hotels.com against certain officers and directors of Hotels.com, which was pending in Texas state court prior to the announcement of the merger transaction and had originally asserted derivative claims relating to Hotels.com's pre-merger earnings guidance (which claims are described more fully in a separate section below), filed an amended complaint to include class allegations regarding the merger transaction. No. 03-02663 (District Court, 160 Judicial District, Dallas County). In addition, on April 17, 2003, the plaintiffs in a consolidated action pending in the Delaware Chancery Court, which had consolidated a number of purported class actions filed against Hotels.com, IAC, and members of the board of directors of Hotels.com as a result of IAC's announcement in June 2002 of its intention to enter into a Hotels.com acquisition transaction, filed a consolidated and amended class-action complaint. No. 16662-NC (New Castle County). Pursuant to an agreement among the parties, the defendants' time to respond to this complaint and to the complaint in the case has been adjourned indefinitely.

     The complaints in the two Delaware actions and the class allegations in the complaint in the Texas action allege, in essence, that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties to Hotels.com's public shareholders by entering into and/or approving the merger agreement, which allegedly does not reflect the true value of Hotels.com. The complaints sought to enjoin consummation of
 
the transaction or, in the alternative, to rescind the transaction, as well as damages in an unspecified amount.
     On April 18, 2003, the Texas action was removed to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. On May 2, 2003, the plaintiff in this action filed a motion to remand the case to state court. On June 3, 2003, the plaintiff withdrew his motion to remand the case to state court and filed a motion in federal court for expedited discovery in anticipation of filing a motion for a preliminary injunction against consummation of the IAC/Hotels.com merger. The defendants opposed the motion. On June 16, 2003, the district court denied the plaintiff's motion for expedited discovery. On June 23, 2003, the IAC/Hotels.com merger transaction closed.

     Expedia believes that the allegations in these lawsuits are without merit and will continue to defend vigorously against them.
Litigation Relating to Hotels.com's Guidance for the Fourth Quarter of 2002.
     . On January 10, 2003, a securities class action, No. 3:03-CV-0069-N, was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, arising out of Hotels.com's downward revision of its guidance for the fourth quarter of 2002. This lawsuit alleges that the defendants, Hotels.com and three of its former executives, violated the federal securities laws during the period from October 23, 2002 to January 6, 2003 (the "Class Period"). The defendants are alleged to have knowingly (i) made certain materially false and misleading public statements with respect to the anticipated performance of Hotels.com during the fourth quarter of 2002, and (ii) concealed from the investing public certain material events and developments that were likely to render that anticipated performance unattainable. The individual defendants are further alleged to have profited from the rise in Hotels.com's share price caused by their public statements through sales of Hotels.com stock during the Class Period. The lawsuit further alleges that as a result of Hotels.com's announcement, on January 6, 2003, of a downward revision of its guidance for the fourth quarter of 2002, its share price declined by 25%. The lawsuit seeks certification of a class of all non-defendant purchasers of Hotels.com stock during the Class Period and seeks damages in an unspecified amount. Three other substantially similar securities class actions were filed in the same court shortly thereafter and were later consolidated with the case.

     On August 18, 2003, the lead plaintiffs in this action filed a consolidated class-action complaint. On October 31, 2003, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint. The plaintiffs opposed the motion. On September 27, 2004, the district court issued an order granting the defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint. The court's ruling was based upon a number of grounds, including that certain of the statements complained of were forward-looking statements accompanied by appropriate cautionary language and thereby protected by the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, and that certain of the statements and omissions complained of were, as a matter of law, not material and therefore not actionable. The court dismissed all of the plaintiffs' claims with prejudice (i.e., without leave to replead them), with the exception of two claims involving statements by analysts. The plaintiffs have advised that they do not intend to attempt to replead those claims. On March 4, 2005, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the district court's ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.
 
     . Two shareholder derivative actions, No. 3:03-CV-0501-K, and No. 3:03-CV-0812-K, arising out of the same events as the consolidated securities class action, were removed to the same Texas federal district court after having been filed in Texas state court on January 14, 2003 and March 14, 2003, respectively. The defendants in these shareholder derivative actions are Hotels.com (as a nominal defendant only) and a number of current or former directors of Hotels.com. These lawsuits allege that the individual defendants who, during the period from October 25, 2002 to December 3, 2002, sold Hotels.com stock breached their fiduciary duty to Hotels.com by misappropriating, and trading and profiting on the basis of, proprietary, material non-public information concerning the financial condition and growth prospects of Hotels.com. The lawsuits also allege that all of the individual defendants aided and abetted the selling defendants' breaches of fiduciary duty by concealing from the market the information on the basis of which the selling defendants allegedly traded and profited. The lawsuits seek imposition of a constructive trust in favor of Hotels.com on the profits obtained by the selling defendants on their sales of Hotels.com stock during the period referred to above, as well as unspecified damages resulting from the individual defendants' alleged breaches of fiduciary duty.
Shareholder Derivative Suit
Anita Pomilo Wilson, Derivatively on Behalf of Nominal Defendant Hotels.com v. Elan J. Blutinger et al.,
Alex Solodovnikov, Derivatively on Behalf of Hotels.com v. Robert Diener et al.,
     On December 16, 2003, the two shareholder derivative actions were consolidated under the caption, No. 3:03-CV-501-K (N.D. Tex.). On April 26, 2004, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended complaint. The amended complaint, which asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets, and unjust enrichment against sixteen current or former directors of Hotels.com, seeks damages, restitution, and disgorgement of profits in an unspecified amount, together with the imposition of a constructive trust on those profits. The amended complaint reiterates the allegations of the two shareholder derivative actions described above and further alleges that certain of the individual defendants caused Hotels.com to enter into the IAC/Hotels.com merger transaction in order, among other self-interested reasons, to procure the dismissal of the previously filed derivative actions. In this respect, the amended complaint seeks a judicial declaration, on behalf of all pre-merger public shareholders of Hotels.com stock, that the IAC/Hotels.com merger agreement, which resulted in the IAC/Hotels.com merger transaction that closed on June 23, 2003, is unlawful and unenforceable.
In re Hotels.com Derivative Litigation,
     On June 28, 2004, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint. The plaintiff opposed the motion.
     On October 18, 2004, the district court directed the parties to engage in mediation. On December 20, 2004, the parties engaged in mediation before a retired federal district judge. The mediation did not result in a resolution of this matter. On January 10, 2005, the parties, with the concurrence of the mediator, filed a joint motion requesting the district court to stay the shareholder derivative action pending resolution of the plaintiffs' contemplated appeal from the district court's dismissal of the related securities class action.
     On February 23, 2005, the district court issued an order denying the defendants' motion to dismiss as well as the parties' joint motion for a stay. On March 7, 2005, the district court issued orders vacating its denial of the parties' stay motion, staying the case until further notice and directing that the case be administratively closed pending a decision in the appeal of the related securities class action.
 
     Expedia believes that both the securities class action and the shareholder derivative action lack merit and will continue to defend vigorously against them.
     
Litigation Relating to Hotel Occupancy Taxes.
      On June 20, 2003, a purported class action was filed in Texas state court against Hotels.com. No. DC-03-259 (District Court, 229 Judicial District, Duval County). The complaint alleges that Hotels.com collects "excess" hotel occupancy taxes from consumers (i.e., allegedly charges consumers more for occupancy taxes than it pays to the hotels for their use in satisfying their obligations to the taxing authorities). The complaint sought certification of a nationwide class of all persons who have purchased hotel accommodations from Hotels.com since June 20, 1999, as well as restitution of, disgorgement of, and the imposition of a constructive trust upon all "excess" occupancy taxes allegedly collected by Hotels.com. On July 14, 2003, Hotels.com filed a responsive pleading that denied the material allegations of the complaint and asserted a number of defenses, including that the allegations in the complaint are subject to mandatory arbitration.

     On August 12, 2003, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint containing substantially the same factual allegations and requests for relief, but naming as defendants Hotels.com, L.P., Hotels.com (the parent company of the Hotels.com, L.P. operating business), and IAC. On September 8, 2003, the defendants filed responsive pleadings that denied the material allegations of the amended complaint and asserted a number of defenses, including that the allegations in the amended complaint are subject to mandatory arbitration and, in case, that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over IAC.

     On January 24, 2004, the Hotels.com defendants filed a motion to stay the class-action litigation pending the outcome of an arbitration proceeding (described below) that had been commenced by the plaintiff. On January 30, 2004, the plaintiff opposed that motion and also filed a second amended complaint containing substantially the same factual allegations and requests for relief as her prior pleadings, but slightly modifying the class allegations to take account of the class period alleged in the arbitration proceeding.
     On February 4, 2004, Hotels.com, L.P. filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, based upon the named plaintiff's not being in fact a member of the class that she purports to represent. That motion, together with the Hotels.com defendants' motion to stay the lawsuit, was denied by the court on May 20, 2004.

     On May 6, 2004, the plaintiff in the lawsuit filed a third amended complaint containing substantially the same factual allegations and requests for relief as her prior pleadings, but with additional allegations in support of her position that the court has personal jurisdiction over IAC.

     On December 29, 2004, following the scheduling of a class certification hearing in the lawsuit (as described below), the plaintiff in the lawsuit filed a motion for class certification. On February 16, 2005, the plaintiff in the lawsuit withdrew her request for class certification.

     As noted above, on September 25, 2003, the plaintiff in the litigation filed with the American Arbitration Association in Dallas, Texas, a demand for arbitration against Hotels.com,
Olvera
 
L.P. The arbitration claim contained substantially the same factual allegations as in the lawsuit. The arbitration was purportedly brought on behalf of a class comprised of all persons who have purchased hotel accommodations from Hotels.com since October 31, 2001. The claimant sought a determination that the arbitration is properly maintainable as a class proceeding and an order requiring disgorgement and restitution to the class members of excess profits allegedly derived from "assessing" hotel occupancy taxes that were neither owed nor paid to any taxing authority. On October 27, 2003, Hotels.com, L.P. filed a responsive pleading that denied the material allegations of the arbitration claim and asserted a number of defenses.
Olvera
     On May 6, 2004, Hotels.com, L.P. filed a motion to dismiss the arbitration claim for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, on the grounds that under Texas law the tax-based nature of the claim requires that it be adjudicated in a state administrative proceeding, not a private-party proceeding such as an arbitration. A hearing on that motion, as well as on the issue whether the governing arbitration clause permits the arbitration to be maintained as a class proceeding, was held on July 9, 2004.

     On September 2, 2004, the arbitrator, accepting Hotels.com, L.P.'s position that the exclusive remedy for this type of tax-related claim is a state administrative proceeding, issued a final award dismissing the arbitration claim.

     On March 26, 2004, the plaintiff in a separate class action pending in Texas state court, No. DC-03-162 (District Court, 229 Judicial District, Duval County), filed a second amended complaint containing allegations that are substantially similar to allegations made in the lawsuit. On May 13, 2004, the plaintiff in the lawsuit filed a third amended complaint alleging in essence (i) that Hotels.com charges customers "taxes" that exceed the amount required by or paid to the applicable taxing authorities, and (ii) that Hotels.com charges customers "fees" that do not correspond to any specific services provided. The amended pleading continues to seek nationwide class certification, asserts a claim only for breach of contract, and seeks damages in as unspecified amount.

     On July 9, 2004, the plaintiffs in the lawsuit filed a petition in intervention in the lawsuit and a motion to stay the proceedings in that lawsuit or, alternatively, for a continuance of the hearing on the class-certification motion. The gravamen of the plaintiffs' intervention and motion is that the plaintiff has transformed her lawsuit into a "copycat" of the lawsuit, to the potential detriment of the plaintiffs. On July 13, 2004, the plaintiff filed a motion to strike the plaintiffs' intervention and motion. On August 2, 2004, the court heard argument on the two motions. On August 3, 2004, the court adjourned the hearing on the class-certification motion. On September 1, 2004, the court denied the plaintiffs motion to strike the plaintiffs' intervention and motion.

      On December 30, 2004, the city of Los Angeles filed a purported class action in California state court against a number of Internet travel companies, including Hotels.com, Expedia, and Hotwire. No. BC326693 (Superior Court, Los Angeles County). The gravamen of this lawsuit, as in the Hotels.com consumer class action litigation described above, is that the defendants are improperly charging and/or failing to pay hotel occupancy taxes. The complaint seeks certification of a statewide class of all California cities and counties that have enacted uniform transient occupancy-tax ordinances effective on or after December 30, 1990. The complaint alleges violation of those ordinances, violation of section 17200 of the California Business and Professions Code, and common-law conversion. The complaint seeks imposition of a constructive trust on all monies owed by the defendants to the government, as well as disgorgement, restitution, interest, and penalties.
