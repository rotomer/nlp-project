The Revolving Credit Facility includes restrictive covenants, which include, among other covenants, maintenance of leverage and interest expense coverage ratios. The maintenance of leverage and interest expense coverage ratios under the Revolving Credit Facility remain the same as the corresponding covenants under our prior revolving credit facility.

receipt, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that such Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt; that, if such LC Disbursement is denominated in US Dollars and is not less than the Borrowing Minimum for US Dollar denominated Loans, the applicable Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 or 2.05 that such payment be financed with an ABR Revolving Borrowing or a Swingline Loan in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, such Borrower's obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan. If the applicable Borrower fails to make any such reimbursement payment when due, (A) if such payment relates to a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency, automatically and with no further action required, the obligation of such Borrower to reimburse the applicable LC Disbursement shall be permanently converted into an obligation to reimburse the US Dollar Equivalent, calculated using the LC Exchange Rate on the applicable LC Participation Calculation Date, of such LC Disbursement and (B) in the case of each LC Disbursement, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the amount of the payment then due from such Borrower in respect thereof and such Lender's Combined Tranche Percentage thereof, and each Lender shall pay in US Dollars to the Administrative Agent on the date such notice is received its Combined Tranche Percentage of the payment then due from such Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.07 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.07 shall apply, , to the payment obligations of the Lenders pursuant to this paragraph), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from a Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the applicable Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and such Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse an Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Revolving Loans or a Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the applicable Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement. If the applicable Borrower's reimbursement of, or obligation to reimburse, any amounts in any Alternative Currency would subject the Administrative Agent, the applicable Issuing Bank or any Lender to any stamp duty, ad valorem charge or similar tax that would not be payable if such reimbursement were made or required to be made in US Dollars, such Borrower shall pay the amount of any such tax requested by the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Lender.

None of the Agents, the Lenders, the Issuing Banks or any of their Related Parties shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any other act, failure to act or other event or circumstance; that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse any Issuing Bank from liability to a Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by each Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by such Borrower that are caused by such Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or wilful misconduct on the part of an Issuing Bank (as finally determined in a nonappealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction), such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.

ABR Revolving Loans and (ii) if such LC Disbursement is made in an Alternative Currency, at all times prior to its conversion to US Dollars pursuant to paragraph (e) or (l) of this Section, at a rate equal to the rate reasonably determined by the applicable Issuing Bank to be the cost to such Issuing Bank of funding such LC Disbursement plus the Applicable Rate applicable to Eurocurrency Revolving Loans at such time; that, if the applicable Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.13(c) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be paid to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment, and shall be payable on demand or, if no demand has been made, on the date on which the applicable Borrower reimburses the applicable LC Disbursement in full.

(i) An Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Company, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of an Issuing Bank.

After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement (including the right to receive fees under Section 2.12(b)), but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.
Replacement of an Issuing Bank.
(j) If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Company receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposure representing more than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, each Borrower shall deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, an amount in cash equal to the LC Exposure attributable to Letters of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; that (i) amounts payable in respect of any Letter of Credit or LC Disbursement shall be payable in the currency of such Letter of Credit or LC Disbursement, except that LC Disbursements in an Alternative Currency in respect of which the applicable Borrower's reimbursement obligations have been converted to obligations in US Dollars as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section and interest accrued thereon shall be payable in US Dollars and (ii) the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective

The Borrowers shall also deposit cash collateral in accordance with this paragraph as and to the extent required by Section 2.20. Such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the applicable Borrower under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be in Permitted Investments and shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the applicable Borrower's risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Banks for LC Disbursements for which they have not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the applicable Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders with LC Exposure representing more than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement. If a Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to such Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived.

In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Applicable Agent, then the applicable Lender and the applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to the Applicable Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to such Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Applicable Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, (A) if denominated in US Dollars, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Applicable Agent in accordance with banking industry rules

If such Lender pays such amount to the Applicable Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing.
SECTION 2.08. (a) Each Revolving Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the applicable Borrower may elect to convert any Revolving Borrowing denominated in US Dollars to a different Type or to continue any Revolving Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The applicable Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Revolving Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Revolving Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Swingline Loans, which may not be converted or continued.

(b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the applicable Borrower shall notify the Applicable Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if such Borrower were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or facsimile to the Applicable Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Applicable Agent and signed by such Borrower. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, no Borrower shall be permitted to change the currency of any Borrowing or to convert any Borrowing to a Type not available under the Class of Commitments pursuant to which such Borrowing was made.
(c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
(i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);
(ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
(iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurocurrency Borrowing; and
 
(iv) if the resulting Borrowing is to be a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period".
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.
(d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.
(e) If a Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then such Borrowing shall be repaid as provided herein at the end of such Interest Period, unless such Borrowing is denominated in US Dollars, in which case (unless it is so repaid) it shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of such Interest Period. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the applicable Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) in the case of Borrowings denominated in US Dollars, (A) no outstanding Revolving Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing and (B) unless repaid, each Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, and (ii) in the case of Borrowings denominated in Alternative Currencies, unless repaid, each Eurocurrency Borrowing shall be continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing with an Interest Period of one month's duration.
SECTION 2.09. (a) Unless previously terminated, the Commitments shall terminate on the Maturity Date.
Termination and Reduction of Commitments; Increase of Commitments.
(b) The Company may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitments; that (i) each reduction of the Commitments under any Tranche shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of the Borrowing Multiple for US Dollar denominated Loans and not less than the Borrowing Minimum for US Dollar denominated Loans and (ii) the Company shall not terminate or reduce the Commitments under any Tranche if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Loans in accordance with Section 2.11, the US Tranche Revolving Exposure would exceed the total US Tranche Commitments or the European Tranche Revolving Exposure would exceed the total European Tranche Commitments.
provided
(c) The Company shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each
 
notice delivered by the Company pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; that a notice of termination or reduction of the Commitments under any Tranche delivered by the Company may state that such notice is conditioned upon the occurrence of one or more events specified therein, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Company (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments under any Tranche shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments under such Tranche.
provided
(d) The Company may from time to time request increases in the aggregate amount of Commitments under either Tranche pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph.
(i) The Company may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly forward such notice to each Lender under the applicable Tranche), request (A) that the total Commitments under either Tranche be increased (a "") by an amount for each increased Tranche of not less than US$25,000,000 and (B) at the election of the Company, that simultaneous decreases (each, a "") be made to the Commitments under the other Tranche; that at no time shall the aggregate amount of Commitment Increases effected pursuant to this paragraph, when taken together with the aggregate amount of new Commitments established under Section 9.02(c), exceed the aggregate amount of Commitment Decreases effected pursuant to this paragraph by more than US$250,000,000. Each such notice shall set forth the amount of the requested Commitment Increase (and Commitment Decrease, as applicable) in each Tranche, and the date on which such adjustment is requested to become effective (which shall be not less than 10 Business Days or more than 30 days after the date of such notice). The Company may arrange for one or more banks or other entities (any such bank or other entity being called an "" with respect to such Tranche), which may include any Lender under either Tranche (each Lender so agreeing being an "" with respect to such Tranche, and each Lender so declining being a "" with respect to such Tranche), to extend Commitments or, in the case of any Lender, increase its Commitment in an aggregate amount equal to the amount of the requested Commitment Increase; that each Augmenting Lender shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent and each Issuing Bank (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) and the Borrowers and each Augmenting Lender shall execute all such documentation as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably specify to evidence the Commitment of such Augmenting Lender and/or its status as a Lender hereunder. Any Commitment Increase under any Tranche may be made in an amount less than the Commitment Increase requested by the Company if the Company is unable to arrange for, or chooses not to arrange for, Augmenting Lenders and Increasing Lenders. Not less than three Business Days prior to the effective date (the "") of any Commitment Increase under any Tranche pursuant to this Section 2.09(d), the Company shall

(ii) On the Increase Effective Date, (A) the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Loans outstanding under each Tranche under which a Commitment Increase will become effective (the "" under such Tranche) immediately prior to giving effect to the applicable Commitment Increase on the Increase Effective Date shall be deemed to be repaid, (B) after the effectiveness of the Commitment Increase, the Borrowers holding Commitments under such Tranche shall be deemed to have made new Borrowings (the "") in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Initial Loans under such Tranche and of the Types and for the Interest Periods specified in a Borrowing Request delivered to the Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 2.03, (C) each Lender under such Tranche shall pay to the Administrative Agent in same day funds an amount equal to the difference, if positive, between (1) such Lender's applicable Tranche Percentage (calculated after giving effect to the Commitment Increase) of the Subsequent Borrowings and (2) such Lender's applicable Tranche Percentage (calculated without giving effect to the Commitment Increase) of the Initial Loans, (D) after the Administrative Agent receives the funds specified in clause (C) above, the Administrative Agent shall pay to each Lender under such Tranche the portion of such funds that is equal to the difference, if positive, between (1) such Lender's applicable Tranche Percentage (calculated without giving effect to the Commitment Increase) of the Initial Loans and (2) such Lender's applicable Tranche Percentage (calculated after giving effect to the Commitment Increase) of the amount of the Subsequent Borrowings, (E) each Non-Increasing Lender, each Increasing Lender and each Augmenting Lender shall be deemed to hold its applicable Tranche Percentage of each Subsequent Borrowing (each calculated after giving effect to the Commitment Increase) and (F) each applicable Borrower shall pay each Increasing Lender and each Non-Increasing Lender any and all accrued but unpaid interest on the Initial Loans. The deemed payments made pursuant to clause (A) above in respect of each Eurocurrency Loan shall be subject to indemnification by the Borrowers pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.16 if the Increase Effective Date occurs other than on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto and breakage costs result.

(iii) On the Increase Effective Date, each Commitment Decrease specified in the notice by the Company pursuant to paragraph (d)(i) above (as adjusted pursuant to the last sentence of such paragraph) shall be made ratably among the Lenders holding Commitments under the decreasing Tranche in accordance with their respective Commitments under such Tranche.
(iv) Commitment Increases, Commitment Decreases and new Commitments created pursuant to this Section 2.09(d) shall become effective on the date specified in the original notice delivered by the Company pursuant to the first sentence of paragraph (d)(i) above.
 
(v) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no increase in the Commitments under any Tranche (or in any Commitment of any Lender) or addition of an Augmenting Lender shall become effective under this Section unless (A) on the date of such increase, the conditions set forth in Section 4.02(a) and Section 4.02(b) shall be satisfied (without giving effect to the parenthetical in Section 4.02(a)) and the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate to that effect dated such date and executed by a Financial Officer and (B) the Administrative Agent shall have received (with sufficient copies for each of the Lenders) documents consistent with those delivered pursuant to Section 4.03(c) in connection with the designation of a new Borrowing Subsidiary as to the corporate power and authority of the applicable Borrowers to borrow hereunder after giving effect to such increase.
SECTION 2.10. (a) Each Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Applicable Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan of such Lender outstanding to it on the Maturity Date, and (ii) to the Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan on the earlier of the Maturity Date and the first date after such Swingline Loan is made that is the 15th or last day of a calendar month and is at least two Business Days after such Swingline Loan is made; that on each date that a Revolving Borrowing denominated in US Dollars is made, each Borrower shall repay all Swingline Loans then outstanding to it, if any, and may use all or a portion of the proceeds of such Revolving Borrowing to fund such repayment. The Borrowers will repay the principal amount of each Loan and the accrued interest thereon in the currency in which such Loan is denominated.
Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.

(b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of each Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.
(c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.
(d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the applicable Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
prima

provided
 
(e) Any Lender may request that Loans of any Class made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, each applicable Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).
SECTION 2.11. (a) The Borrowers shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part, without any premium or penalty (but including amounts owed under Section 2.16) subject to prior notice in accordance with paragraph (b) of this Section.
Prepayment of Loans.
(b) In the event and on each occasion that the Revolving Credit Exposure under any Tranche exceeds the sum of the Commitments under such Tranche, the Borrowers shall not later than the next Business Day prepay Revolving Borrowings of the applicable Tranche in an aggregate amount equal to such excess, and in the event that after such prepayment of Borrowings any such excess shall remain, the Borrowers shall deposit cash in an amount equal to such excess as collateral for the reimbursement obligations of the Borrowers in respect of Letters of Credit under such Tranche; that if such excess results from a change in currency exchange rates, such prepayment and deposit shall be required to be made not later than the fifth Business Day after the day on which the Administrative Agent shall have given the Company notice of such excess. Any cash so deposited (and any cash previously deposited pursuant to this paragraph) with the Administrative Agent shall be held in an account over which the Administrative Agent shall have sole dominion and control, including exclusive rights of withdrawal. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investment shall be in Permitted Investments and shall be made in the discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Borrowers' risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse each Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements under such Tranche for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrowers for the LC Exposure under such Tranche at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders holding more than 50% of the LC Exposures), be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement. If the Borrowers have provided cash collateral to secure the reimbursement obligations of the Borrowers in respect of Letters of Credit, then, so long as no Event of Default shall exist, such cash collateral shall be released to the Borrowers if so requested by the Company at any time if and to the extent that, after giving effect to such release, the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Exposures under the applicable Tranche would not exceed the aggregate amount of the Commitments under such Tranche. Prepayments made under this paragraph shall be without any premium or penalty (but shall include amounts owed under Section 2.16).

(c) The applicable Borrower shall notify the Applicable Agent (and, in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender) by telephone (confirmed by facsimile) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., Local Time, four Business Days before the date of prepayment, (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR Revolving Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, one Business Day before the date of prepayment or (iii) in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date of prepayment; that in the case of any prepayment required to be made within one Business Day under paragraph (b) of this Section the applicable Borrower will give such notice as soon as practicable. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid; that, if a notice of prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination or reduction of the Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.09, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.09. Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Revolving Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Revolving Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Revolving Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02. Each prepayment of a Revolving Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.13.

SECTION 2.12. (a) The Borrowers agree to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a commitment fee, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the daily unused amount of the Commitments of such Lender during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the date on which the last of such Commitments terminates. Accrued commitment fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year and on the date on which the Commitments of any Class terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof. All commitment fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). For purposes of computing commitment fees, a Commitment of a Lender under any Tranche shall be deemed to be used to the extent of the outstanding Loans and LC Exposure of such Lender under such Tranche (and the Swingline Exposure of such Lender shall be disregarded for such purpose prior to the acquisition by such Lender of a participation therein pursuant to Section 2.05(c)).
Fees.
(b) The Borrowers agree to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a participation fee with respect to its participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate used to determine the interest rate applicable to Eurocurrency Loans on the average daily amount of such Lender's LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on which such Lender's Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure, and (ii) to each Issuing Bank a fronting fee, which shall
 
accrue at the rate or rates per annum separately agreed upon between the Company and such Issuing Bank on the daily LC Exposure attributable to Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date the LC Commitment of such Issuing Bank is reduced to zero and the date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure attributable to Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, as well as such Issuing Bank's standard fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees accrued through and including the last day of March, June, September and December of each year shall be payable on the third Business Day following such last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date; that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which the Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. Any other fees payable to any Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within 10 days after demand. All participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).
provided
(c) The Company agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between the Company and the Administrative Agent.
(d) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to the Issuing Banks, in the case of fees payable to them) for distribution, in the case of commitment fees and participation fees, to the Lenders entitled thereto. Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances.
SECTION 2.13. (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing (including each Swingline Loan) shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate.
Interest.
(b) The Loans comprising each Eurocurrency Borrowing shall bear interest (i) in the case of any such Borrowing denominated in US Dollars or Sterling, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate and (ii) in the case of any such Borrowing denominated in Euro, at the Adjusted EURIBO Rate, in each case for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing, plus, in each case, the Applicable Rate.
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by any Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section.
 
(d) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and, in the case of Loans of any Class, upon termination of the Commitments of such Class; that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurocurrency Revolving Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion. All interest shall be payable in the currency in which the applicable Loan is denominated.
provided
(e) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that (i) interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate and (ii) interest on Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Sterling shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate, Adjusted LIBO Rate or Adjusted EURIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
SECTION 2.14. If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Borrowing:
Alternate Rate of Interest.
(a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or Adjusted EURIBO Rate for such Interest Period; or
(b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the majority in interest of the Lenders under the affected Tranche that the Adjusted LIBO Rate or Adjusted EURIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Company and the Lenders by telephone or facsimile as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Company and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Revolving Borrowing to, or continuation of any Revolving Borrowing as, a Eurocurrency Borrowing shall be ineffective, and, unless repaid, such Borrowing shall, if denominated in US Dollars, be made as an ABR Borrowing or, if denominated in an Alternative Currency, bear interest at such rate as the Administrative Agent shall determine adequately and fairly reflects the cost to the affected Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate, and (ii) if any Borrowing Request
 
requests a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, such Borrowing shall, if denominated in US Dollars, be made as an ABR Borrowing or, if denominated in an Alternative Currency, bear interest at such rate as the Administrative Agent shall determine adequately and fairly reflects the cost to the affected Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate; that if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect only one Type of Borrowings, then the other Type of Borrowings shall be permitted.
provided
SECTION 2.15. (a) If any Change in Law shall:
Increased Costs.
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate or Adjusted EURIBO Rate) or any Issuing Bank; or
(ii) impose on any Lender or any Issuing Bank or the London interbank market or European interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or such Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or such Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrowers will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b) If any Lender or any Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrowers will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
 
(c) A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, as the case may be, setting forth in reasonable detail the manner in which such amount or amounts have been determined, shall be delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrowers shall pay such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 Business Days after receipt thereof.
(d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation; that the Borrowers shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Company of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's intention to claim compensation therefor; that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

(e) If an Agent, a Lender or an Issuing Bank determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any amount as to which it has been indemnified by any Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.15, it shall pay over such refund to such Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made by such Borrower under this Section 2.15 with respect to the events giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of such Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); that each Borrower, upon the request of such Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event such Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be construed to require any Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank to make available its accounting records (or any other information which it deems confidential) to any Borrower or any other Person.

SECTION 2.16. In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurocurrency Loan on the date

In the case of a Eurocurrency Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate or Adjusted EURIBO Rate, as the case may be, that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan) over (ii) the amount of interest that would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for deposits in the applicable currency of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurocurrency market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrowers shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 20 days after receipt thereof.
SECTION 2.17. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrowers hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; that if any Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Applicable Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the applicable Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the applicable Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
Taxes.

(b) In addition, the Borrowers shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(c) The Borrowers shall indemnify each Agent, Lender and Issuing Bank, within 20 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by such Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of any Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Company by a Lender or an Issuing Bank, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or an Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
(d) Each Lender and Issuing Bank severally agrees to indemnify each Agent, within 20 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender or Issuing Bank that are paid or payable by such Agent in connection with any Loan Documents and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto (other than any amounts for which such Agent has been reimbursed by the Borrowers), whether or not such Excluded Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the applicable Lender or Issuing Bank by an Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Nothing herein shall prevent any Lender or Issuing Bank from contesting the applicability of any Excluded Taxes that it believes to have been incorrectly or illegally imposed or asserted by any Governmental Authority; that no such contest shall suspend the obligation of any Lender or Issuing Bank to pay amounts due to the Agents as provided in the first sentence of this paragraph.
provided
(e) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by any Borrower to a Governmental Authority, such Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(f) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which any Borrower is located, or under any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Company (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate.
(g) If an Agent, a Lender or an Issuing Bank determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Borrower or with respect to which any Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.17, it shall pay over such refund to such Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Borrower under this Section 2.17 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of such Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); that such Borrower, upon the request of such Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to such Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank in the event such Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be construed to require any Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Company or a Borrower or any other Person.

SECTION 2.18. (a) The Borrowers shall make each payment required to be made by them hereunder or under any other Loan Document (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) prior to the time expressly required hereunder or under such other Loan Document for such payment (or, if no such time is expressly required, prior to 12:00 noon, Local Time), on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Applicable Agent to the applicable account specified by it from time to time to the Company for such purpose, except payments to be made directly to an Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein shall be so made and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto and payments pursuant to other Loan Documents shall be made to the Persons specified therein. The Applicable Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment under any Loan Document shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. Except as otherwise provided herein, (i) all payments of principal, interest or reimbursement obligations in respect of any Loan or Letter of Credit shall be made in the currency of such Loan or Letter of Credit and (ii) all other payments under each Loan Document (including all fees) shall be made in US Dollars.
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs.
(b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Applicable Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
(c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans under any Tranche resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender under such Tranche, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and participations
 
in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders under such Tranche to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans under such Tranche; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by any Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans to any assignee or Participant, other than to the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against each Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower, as the case may be, in the amount of such participation.
provided
(d) Unless the Applicable Agent shall have received notice from the Company prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Applicable Agent for the account of the Lenders or an Issuing Bank hereunder that any Borrower will not make such payment, the Applicable Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Applicable Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Applicable Agent, at (A) if such amount is denominated in US Dollars, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Applicable Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, and (B) if such amount is denominated in an Alternative Currency, a rate determined by the Applicable Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
(e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(c), 2.06(d), 2.06(e), 2.07(b) or 2.18(d), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by either Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
SECTION 2.19. (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
 
designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign and delegate its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrowers hereby agree to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment and delegation.
(b) If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, (ii) any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, (iii) any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender or (iv) any Lender has failed to consent to a proposed waiver, amendment or other modification that under Section 9.02 requires the consent of all the Lenders (or all the affected Lenders or all the Lenders of the affected Class) and with respect to which the Required Lenders (or, where applicable, a majority in interest of the Lenders of the affected Class) shall have granted their consent, then the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (i) the Company shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Swingline Lender, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or a Borrower (in the case of all other amounts), (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments and (iv) in the case of any such assignment resulting from the failure to provide a consent, the assignee shall have given such consent and, as a result of such assignment and any contemporaneous assignments and consents, the applicable waiver, amendment or other modification can be effected. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. Each party hereto agrees that an assignment required pursuant to this paragraph may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed by the Company, the Administrative Agent and the assignee and that the Lender required to make such assignment need not be a party thereto.
provided
SECTION 2.20. (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if one or more Lenders become Defaulting Lenders, then, upon notice to such effect by the Administrative Agent (which notice shall be given promptly after the Administrative Agent becomes aware that any Lender shall have
Defaulting Lenders.

(E) if any Reallocated Letter of Credit shall have been cash collateralized by the Borrowers pursuant to clause (D) above, then the Borrowers shall not be required to pay any letter of credit participation fees to the Defaulting Lenders pursuant to Section 2.12(b) with respect to the portion of such Reallocated Letter of Credit that is so cash collateralized;
(F) if an adjustment shall have been made pursuant to clause (B) above to the participations of the Non-Defaulting Lenders in Reallocated Letters of Credit, then the letter of credit participation fees that would
 
otherwise have been payable to the Defaulting Lenders pursuant to Section 2.12(b) with respect to the portion of such Reallocated Letters of Credit equal to the Incremental LC Participations therein shall instead accrue for the accounts of, and be payable to, the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their Adjusted Combined Tranche Percentages;
(G) if the Defaulting Lender LC Exposure at any time shall exceed the sum of the Incremental LC Participations at such time and the portion of the Reallocated Letters of Credit cash collateralized at such time pursuant to clause (D) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of any Issuing Bank or any Non-Defaulting Lender hereunder, all letter of credit participation fees payable to the Defaulting Lenders under Section 2.12(b) with respect to the portion of the Defaulting Lender LC Exposure equal to such excess shall instead ratably accrue for the accounts of, and be payable to, the Issuing Banks that shall have issued Reallocated Letters of Credit; and

provided
however
(v) any amount payable to or for the account of any Defaulting Lender in its capacity as a Lender hereunder (whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, and including any amounts payable to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.11, but excluding any amounts payable to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17, 2.19(b) and 9.04) shall, in lieu of being distributed to such Defaulting Lender, be retained by the Applicable Agent in a segregated account and, subject to any applicable requirements of law, (A) be

(b) In the event the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender, each Issuing Bank and the Company shall have agreed that a Lender that is a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to become a Defaulting Lender, then (i) such Lender shall cease to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes hereof, (ii) the obligations of the Lenders to purchase participations in Swingline Loans under Section 2.05(c) and the participations of the Lenders in Letters of Credit under Section 2.06(d) shall be readjusted to be determined on the basis of the Lenders' Combined Tranche Percentages and (iii) such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Revolving Loans of the other Lenders as the Administrative Agent shall determine to be necessary in order for the Revolving Loans to be held by the Lenders in accordance with their Combined Tranche Percentages.
(c) No Commitment of any Lender shall be increased or otherwise affected and, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section, performance by the Borrowers of their obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents shall not be excused or otherwise modified, as a result of the operation of this Section.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether either Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any provision of this Agreement may be amended by an agreement in writing entered into by the Company, the Administrative Agent (and, if their rights or obligations are affected thereby, the Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender) and the Lenders that will remain parties hereto after giving effect to such amendment if (x) by the terms of such agreement the Commitment of each Lender not consenting to the amendment provided for therein shall terminate upon the effectiveness of such amendment, (y) at the time such amendment becomes effective, each Lender not consenting thereto receives payment in full of the principal of and interest accrued on each Loan made by it and all other amounts owing to it or accrued for its account under this Agreement and (z) after giving effect to such amendment and all contemporaneous repayments of Loans and reductions of Commitments, the sum of the total Revolving Credit Exposures under each Tranche shall not exceed the total Commitments under such Tranche.

Any such agreement establishing a new Tranche shall amend the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to set forth the terms of each Tranche established thereby (including the amount and final stated maturity thereof (which shall not be earlier than the Maturity Date), the interest to accrue and be payable thereon and any fees to be payable in respect thereof) and to effect such other changes (including changes to the provisions of this Section, Section 2.18 and the definition of "Required Lenders") as the Company and the Administrative Agent shall deem necessary or advisable in connection with the establishment of any such Tranche; that no such agreement shall: (A) effect any change described in any of clauses (A), (B), (C), (F) and (G) of paragraph (b) of this Section without the consent of each Person required to consent to such change under such clause (it being agreed, however, that any establishment of any Tranche will not, of itself, be deemed to effect a change described in clause (G) of such paragraph (b)); or (B) amend Article V, VI or VII to establish any affirmative or negative covenant, Event of Default or remedy that by its terms benefits one or more Tranches, but not all Tranches, of Loans or Borrowings, or provide for any guarantee or security that benefits one or more Tranches, but not all Tranches, of Loans or Borrowings, without the prior written consent of Lenders holding a majority in interest of the Revolving Credit Exposures and unused Commitments of each Tranche not so benefited. The loans, commitments and borrowings under any Tranche established pursuant to this paragraph shall constitute Loans, Commitments and Borrowings under, and shall be entitled to all the benefits afforded by, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and shall, without limiting the foregoing, benefit equally and ratably from the Guarantees created by the Guarantee Agreement. The Borrowers shall take any actions reasonably required by the Administrative Agent to ensure and/or demonstrate that the Guarantee Requirement continues to be satisfied after the establishment of any such Tranche of new commitments.

A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.17 unless the Company is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrowers, to comply with Section 2.17(f) as though it were a Lender.

This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof, including the commitments of the Lenders and, if applicable, their Affiliates under the Commitment Letter and any commitment advices submitted by them (but do not supersede any other provisions of the Commitment Letter or any fee letter referred to therein (or any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent or any Issuing Bank) that do not by the terms of such documents terminate upon the effectiveness of this Agreement). Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or other electronic transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. Each financial institution that shall be party to an Issuing Bank Agreement executed by the Company and the Administrative Agent shall be a party to and an Issuing Bank under this Agreement, and shall have all the rights and duties of an Issuing Bank hereunder and under its Issuing Bank Agreement. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to enter into Issuing Bank Agreements.
Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness; Issuing Banks.
SECTION 9.07. Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof, and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction. The parties hereto shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision.
Severability.
SECTION 9.08.

SECTION 2. (a) Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, jointly with the other Guarantors and severally, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, the payment when and as due of all the Obligations.
Guarantee.
(b) Each of the Guarantors further agrees that the due and punctual payment of the Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon its guarantee notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any Obligation. Without prejudice to the Borrowers' rights to receive demands for payment in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement and to the fullest extent permitted by law, each of the Guarantors waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to any Borrower or any other Loan Party of any of the Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of its guarantee and notice of protest for nonpayment.
SECTION 3. Each of the Guarantors further agrees that its guarantee hereunder constitutes a guarantee of payment when due (whether or not any bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall have stayed the accrual or collection of any of the Obligations or operated as a discharge thereof) and not merely of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Agent, Issuing Bank or Lender to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of any Agent, Issuing Bank or Lender in favor of any Borrower or any other Person.
Guarantee of Payment.
 
SECTION 4. (a) Except for termination of a Guarantor's obligations hereunder as expressly provided in Section 20, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any of the Obligations, any impossibility in the performance of any of the Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected by: (i) the failure of any Agent, Issuing Bank or Lender to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against any Loan Party under the provisions of any Loan Document or otherwise; (ii) any extension or renewal of any of the Obligations; (iii) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or any release from any of the terms or provisions of, any Loan Document or any other agreement, including with respect to any other Guarantor under this Agreement; (iv) any default, failure or delay, wilful or otherwise, in the performance of the Obligations; or (v) any other act, omission or delay to do any other act that may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Guarantor or otherwise operate as a discharge of any Guarantor as a matter of law or equity (other than the payment in full in cash of all the Obligations guaranteed hereunder by such Guarantor) or which would impair or limit the right of any Guarantor to subrogation.
No Limitations, Etc.
(b) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party or the unenforceability of the Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party, other than the payment in full in cash of all the Obligations guaranteed hereunder by such Guarantor. The Agents, Issuing Banks and the Lenders may, at their election, compromise or adjust any part of the Obligations, make any other accommodation with any of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party or exercise any other right or remedy available to them against any of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Guarantor hereunder except to the extent the Obligations guaranteed hereunder by such Guarantor have been paid in full in cash. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any such election even though such election operates, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or to extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Guarantor against any of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party, as the case may be.
SECTION 5. Each of the Guarantors agrees that its guarantee hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Obligation guaranteed hereunder by such Guarantor is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Agent, Issuing Bank or Lender upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower, any other Loan Party or otherwise.

Each Guarantor further agrees that if payment in respect of any Obligation guaranteed hereunder by such Guarantor shall be due in a currency other than US Dollars and/or at a place of payment other than New York and if, by reason of any Change in Law, disruption of currency or foreign exchange markets, war or civil disturbance or other event, payment of such Obligation in such currency or at such place of payment shall be impossible or, in the reasonable judgment of any Agent, Issuing Bank or Lender, not consistent with the protection of its rights or interests, then, at the election of the Administrative Agent, such Guarantor shall make payment of such Obligation in US Dollars (based upon the applicable Exchange Rate in effect on the date of payment) and/or in New York, and shall indemnify each Agent, Issuing Bank and Lender against any losses or reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that it shall sustain as a result of such alternative payment. Upon payment by any Guarantor of any sums as provided in this Section 6, all rights of such Guarantor against any of the Borrowers or any other Guarantor arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of all the Obligations owed by such Borrower or Guarantor to the Agents, Issuing Banks and Lenders.

(b) Subject to the subordination provisions contained in paragraph (a) of this Section 6, (i) each of the Borrowers agrees to indemnify any Guarantor making any payment in respect of any Obligations of such Borrower as required under this Section 6 for the full amount of such payment and, until such indemnification obligation shall have been satisfied, such Guarantor shall be subrogated to the rights of the person to whom such payment shall have been made to the extent of such payment, and (ii) each Guarantor (a "") agrees that, in the event a payment shall be made by any other Guarantor under this Agreement, and such other Guarantor (the "") shall not have been fully indemnified by the Borrowers as provided for in clause (i), the Contributing Guarantor shall, to the extent the Claiming Guarantor shall not have been so indemnified by the Borrowers, indemnify the Claiming Guarantor in an amount equal to the amount of such payment, multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the net worth of the Contributing Guarantor on the date hereof (or, in the case of any Guarantor becoming a party hereto pursuant to Section 21, the date of the Supplement hereto executed and delivered by such Guarantor) and the denominator shall be the aggregate net worth of all the Guarantors on the date hereof (or, in the case of any Guarantor becoming a party hereto pursuant to Section 21, the date of the Supplement hereto executed and delivered by such Guarantor). Any Contributing Guarantor making any payment to a Claiming Guarantor pursuant to this Section 6 shall be subrogated to the rights of such Claiming Guarantor under clause (i) to the extent of such payment.

Securities Class Action Litigation against IAC
Beginning on September 20, 2004, twelve purported shareholder class actions were commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against IAC/InterActiveCorp ("IAC") and certain of its officers and directors, alleging violations of the federal securities laws. These cases arose out of IAC's August 4, 2004 announcement of its earnings for the second quarter of 2004 and generally alleged that the value of IAC's stock was artificially inflated by pre-announcement statements about its financial results and forecasts that were false and misleading due to the defendants' alleged failure to disclose various problems faced by IAC's travel businesses. On December 20, 2004, the district court consolidated the twelve lawsuits, appointed co-lead plaintiffs, and designated co-lead plaintiffs' counsel. See In re IAC/InterActiveCorp Securities Litigation, No. 04-CV-7447 (S.D.N.Y.). The Company is not a party to this litigation, however, under the terms of its Separation Agreement with IAC, Expedia has generally agreed to bear a portion of the costs and liabilities, if any, associated with any securities law litigation relating to conduct prior to the spin-off of the Company from IAC (the "Spin-Off") of the businesses or entities that comprise the Company following the Spin-Off.
On October 18, 2004, a related shareholder derivative action, Stuart Garber, Derivatively on Behalf of IAC/InterActiveCorp v. Barry Diller et al., No. 04-603416, was commenced in the Supreme Court of the State of New York (New York County) against certain of IAC's officers and directors. On November 15, 2004, another related shareholder derivative action, Lisa Butler, Derivatively on Behalf of IAC/InterActiveCorp v. Barry Diller et al., No. 04-CV-9067, was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against certain of IAC's current and former directors. On January 24, 2005, the federal district court consolidated the Butler case with the securities class action for pre-trial purposes only. On April 11, 2005, the district court issued a similar consolidation order in respect of the Garber case.
On July 5, 2005, the plaintiffs in the related shareholder suits filed a consolidated shareholder derivative complaint against IAC (as a nominal defendant) and sixteen current or former officers or directors of IAC or its former travel business. The complaint, which is based upon factual allegations similar to those in the securities class action, purports to assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets, unjust enrichment, violation of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and contribution and indemnification. The complaint sought an order voiding the election of IAC's then Board of Directors, as well as damages in an unspecified amount, various forms of equitable relief, restitution, and disgorgement of remuneration received by the individual defendants from IAC.
On September 15, 2005, IAC and the other defendants filed motions to dismiss both the securities class action and the shareholder derivative suits. On November 30, 2005, the plaintiffs filed their opposition to the motions. On January 6, 2006, the defendants filed reply papers in further support of the motions. The court issued an opinion and order (i) granting the defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint in the securities class action, with leave to replead, and (ii) granting the defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint in the shareholder derivative suits, with prejudice.
On April 23, 2007, the plaintiffs in the shareholder derivative suits filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit from the District Court's order of dismissal. On June 14, 2007, on consent of the parties, the appeal was withdrawn from active consideration by the Court of Appeals, subject to reinstatement by no later than March 31, 2008.
On May 15, 2007, the plaintiffs in the securities class action filed a second amended complaint. The new pleading continues to allege that the defendants failed to disclose material information concerning problems at the Company's then-travel businesses and to assert the same legal claims as its predecessor claim. On August 15, 2007, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint. A hearing on the motion has not been scheduled.
The Company believes that the claims in the class action and derivative suits lack merit and will continue to vigorously defend against them.
hotels.com. On May 6, 2003, a purported class action was filed in Texas state court against hotels.com, L.P. ("hotels.com"), Mary Canales, Individually and on Behalf of All Others Similarly Situated v. hotels.com, L.P., No. DC-03-162 (District Court, 229th Judicial District, Duval County). The complaint, as amended, alleges that hotels.com breached its contract with its customers by charging customers "taxes" that exceed the amount required by or paid to the applicable taxing authorities and by charging customers "fees" that do not correspond to any specific services provided. On April 29, 2005, the court issued an order granting the plaintiff's motion for class certification.

Discussion of ResultsFourth Quarter 2009
Gross Bookings, Revenue & Revenue Margins
Gross bookings increased 26% (22% excluding the estimated impact from foreign exchange) for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with the fourth quarter of 2008, driven primarily by 23% growth in transactions. Domestic bookings increased 19% and international bookings increased 38% (27% excluding foreign exchange).
Revenue increased 12% (5% excluding foreign exchange) for the fourth quarter, primarily driven by an increase in hotel and advertising and media revenues. Domestic revenue increased 1% while international revenue increased 33% (14% excluding foreign exchange). International revenue grew faster than domestic primarily driven by an increase in international revenue per room night combined with a slightly higher hotel room night growth rate, as well as higher air ticket growth with a smaller decrease in revenue per ticket. International advertising and media revenue also grew faster than domestic revenue.
Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings ("revenue margin") was 13.8% for the fourth quarter, a decrease of 163 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, primarily due to a reduction in traveler fees, partially offset by a favorable foreign currency impact. The year-over-year decrease in revenue margin in the fourth quarter was steeper than the decrease reported in the third quarter of 2009, primarily due to a lower decrease in average airfares, which affect gross bookings to a greater extent than revenue.
Products & Services Detail
Worldwide hotel revenue increased 16% for the fourth quarter primarily due to a 23% increase in room nights stayed, including rooms delivered as a component of packages and room nights booked through Venere (which we acquired in September 2008), partially offset by a 6% decrease in revenue per room night. Revenue per room night declined largely due to a 9% decrease in average daily rates ("ADRs"), including a reduction in traveler fees, partially offset by a favorable impact from foreign exchange.
Worldwide air revenue decreased 2% for the fourth quarter, primarily due to a 26% decrease in revenue per air ticket, substantially offset by a 32% increase in ticket volumes. Expedia.com eliminated consumer booking fees on online air tickets beginning in March 2009, with certain other points of sale following at various dates into the third quarter of 2009, which primarily drove the decline in revenue per ticket. This elimination of fees on Expedia.com and other points of sale, combined with lower average ticket prices, contributed to the lift in our air ticketing volumes.
Advertising and media revenue (including net revenue from TripAdvisor Media Network) increased 18% for the fourth quarter, driven by a 22% increase in third-party revenue for the TripAdvisor Media Network and an 11% increase in advertising revenue generated by our transaction sites. Advertising and media revenue accounted for 11% of our worldwide revenues in the fourth quarter. Other revenue (primarily car rentals and destination services) increased 7% for the fourth quarter, and accounted for 14% of worldwide revenues for the quarter.
Profitability
OIBA for the fourth quarter increased 19% to $163 million and increased 127 basis points as a percentage of revenue to 23.4%, as selling & marketing expense and cost of revenue increased at a slower rate than revenue, partially offset by growth in technology & content and general & administrative expenses at rates in excess of revenue growth. Operating income increased $3.0 billion primarily due to a $3.0 billion impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in the fourth quarter of 2008.
Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter increased $24 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher OIBA. Net income increased primarily due to the impairment of goodwill and intangibles in the prior year period. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS and diluted EPS were $0.30 and $0.35, respectively. Adjusted EPS increased 36% primarily due to higher adjusted net income.
 
Discussion of ResultsFull Year 2009
Gross Bookings, Revenue & Revenue Margins
Gross bookings increased 3% (5% excluding the estimated impact from foreign exchange) in 2009 compared with 2008, driven primarily by 18% growth in transactions, substantially offset by lower prices for airline tickets and hotel room nights. Domestic bookings increased 1% and international bookings increased 5% (11% excluding foreign exchange).
Revenue increased 1% (2% excluding foreign exchange) for the year, primarily driven by an increase in hotel, advertising and media, and car rental revenues, partially offset by a reduction in air revenues. Domestic revenue decreased 4% while international revenue increased 9% (11% excluding foreign exchange). Domestic revenue growth trailed international growth primarily due to slower room night and air ticket growth, combined with a larger decrease in per unit revenues due to our various fee actions. International advertising and media revenue also grew faster than domestic revenue.
Revenue margin was 13.6% in 2009, a decrease of 26 basis points, primarily due to the reduction in traveler fees, the impact from loyalty programs and a greater mix of lower margin hotels, partially offset by lower air ticket prices and a reduction in the mix of lower margin air product.
Products & Services Detail
Worldwide hotel revenue increased 2% in 2009 primarily due to a 23% increase in room nights stayed, partially offset by a 17% decline in revenue per room night. Revenue per room night declined largely due to a 15% decrease in ADRs, including a reduction in traveler fees. Excluding room nights stayed through Venere, room nights grew 20% for the year.
Worldwide air revenue decreased 13% in 2009, primarily due to a 24% decrease in revenue per air ticket, partially offset by a 15% increase in ticket volumes. Ticket volume growth benefited from the elimination of booking fees on Expedia.com and other worldwide points of sale.
Advertising and media revenue (including net revenue from our TripAdvisor Media Network) increased 10% in 2009, driven by a 21% increase in advertising revenue generated by our transaction sites and a 6% increase in third-party revenue for the TripAdvisor Media Network. Advertising and media revenue accounted for 11% of our worldwide revenues in 2009. Other revenue (primarily car rentals and destination services) increased 2% in 2009 and accounted for 14% of worldwide revenues.
Profitability
OIBA increased 9% to $762 million and increased 201 basis points as a percentage of revenue to 25.8%, as selling & marketing expense and cost of revenue decreased compared to the increase in revenue, partially offset by growth in technology & content and general & administrative expenses at rates in excess of revenue growth. Operating income increased primarily due the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in the fourth quarter of 2008.
Adjusted net income increased $36 million primarily due to higher OIBA and lower foreign exchange losses, partially offset by lower interest income and higher interest expense. Net income increased primarily due to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in the prior year period and the same factors impacting adjusted net income, partially offset by occupancy tax assessments and legal reserves, restructuring charges and a higher income tax provision. Full year adjusted EPS and diluted EPS were $1.38 and $1.03, respectively. Adjusted EPS increased 10% primarily due to higher adjusted net income.
Cash Flows
Net cash provided by operating activities in 2009 was $676 million and free cash flow was $584 million. Both measures include $207 million from net changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily driven by an improvement in our merchant hotel bookings in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to 2008. Free cash flow increased $223 million in 2009 primarily due to growth in our merchant hotel business, lower capital expenditures and higher OIBA, partially offset by occupancy tax assessments and an increase in cash paid for interest and income taxes.

Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures
Expedia, Inc. reports Operating Income Before Amortization, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS, Free Cash Flow and non-GAAP operating expense (non-GAAP cost of revenue, non-GAAP selling and marketing, non-GAAP technology and content and non-GAAP general and administrative), all of which are supplemental measures to GAAP and are defined by the SEC as non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are among the primary metrics by which management evaluates the performance of the business, on which internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated. Management believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools that management uses to analyze our results. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP. We endeavor to compensate for the limitation of the non-GAAP measures presented by also providing the most directly comparable GAAP measures and descriptions of the reconciling items and adjustments to derive the non-GAAP measures. The definitions of Operating Income Before Amortization and Adjusted Net Income were revised in the first quarter of 2009 to better reflect our current operations and take into consideration the impact of new accounting literature.
is defined as operating income plus: (1) stock-based compensation expense, including compensation expense related to certain subsidiary equity plans; (2) acquisition-related impacts, including (i) amortization of intangible assets and goodwill and intangible asset impairment, and (ii) gains (losses) recognized on changes in the value of contingent consideration arrangements; (3) certain infrequently occurring items, including restructuring; (4) charges incurred for monies that may be required to be paid in advance of litigation in certain occupancy tax proceedings; and (5) gains (losses) realized on revenue hedging activities that are included in other, net.
Operating Income Before Amortization ("OIBA")
For the second quarter of 2009, infrequently occurring items excluded from OIBA also included a $19 million reserve relating to a settlement agreement for the settlement of all claims alleged in a consumer class action lawsuit.
We exclude the items listed above from OIBA because doing so provides investors greater insight into management decision making at Expedia. We believe OIBA is useful to investors because it is our primary internal metric by which management evaluates the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments, on which internal budgets are based, and by which management, including our Chief Executive Officer, is compensated. In addition, we believe that by excluding certain items, such as stock-based compensation and acquisition-related impacts, OIBA corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business and allows investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting the ongoing cash earnings capabilities of our business, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. Although depreciation is also a non-cash expense, it is included in OIBA because it is driven directly by the capital expenditure decisions made by management. OIBA has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact of certain expenses to our consolidated statements of operations. We endeavor to compensate for the limitation of the non-GAAP measure presented by also providing the comparable GAAP measure, GAAP financial statements, and descriptions of the reconciling items and adjustments, to derive the non-GAAP measure. However, OIBA should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP measures. Due to the high variability and difficulty in predicting certain items that affect net income / (loss), such as tax rates, stock price, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, Expedia, Inc. is unable to provide a reconciliation to net income / (loss) on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable efforts. We present a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to GAAP below.
 
generally captures all items on the statements of operations that occur in normal course operations and have been, or ultimately will be, settled in cash and is defined as net income/(loss) attributable to Expedia, Inc. plus net of tax: (1) stock-based compensation expense, including compensation expense related to certain subsidiary equity plans; (2) acquisition-related impacts, including (i) amortization of intangible assets, including as part of equity-method investments, and goodwill and intangible asset impairment, (ii) gains (losses) recognized on changes in the value of contingent consideration arrangements, and (iii) gains (losses) recognized on noncontrolling investment basis adjustments when we acquire controlling interests; (3) mark to market gains and losses on derivative instruments assumed at Spin-off; (4) currency gains or losses on U.S. dollar denominated cash or short-term investments held by eLong; (5) certain other infrequently occurring items, including restructuring (6) charges incurred for monies that may be required to be paid in advance of litigation in certain occupancy tax proceedings; (7) discontinued operations; and (8) the noncontrolling interest impact of the aforementioned adjustment items. We believe Adjusted Net Income is useful to investors because it represents Expedia, Inc.'s combined results, taking into account depreciation, which management believes is an ongoing cost of doing business, but excluding the impact of other non-cash expenses, infrequently occurring items and items not directly tied to the core operations of our businesses.
Adjusted Net Income
is defined as Adjusted Net Income divided by adjusted weighted average shares outstanding, which include dilution from options and warrants per the treasury stock method and include all shares relating to RSUs in shares outstanding for Adjusted EPS. This differs from the GAAP method for including RSUs, which treats them on a treasury method basis. Shares outstanding for Adjusted EPS purposes are therefore higher than shares outstanding for GAAP EPS purposes. We believe Adjusted EPS is useful to investors because it represents, on a per share basis, Expedia's consolidated results, taking into account depreciation, which we believe is an ongoing cost of doing business, as well as other items which are not allocated to the operating businesses such as interest expense, taxes, foreign exchange gains or losses, and minority interest, but excluding the effects of non-cash expenses not directly tied to the core operations of our businesses. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS have similar limitations as OIBA. In addition, Adjusted Net Income does not include all items that affect our net income / (loss) and net income / (loss) per share for the period. Therefore, we think it is important to evaluate these measures along with our consolidated statements of operations.
Adjusted EPS
is defined as net cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Management believes Free Cash Flow is useful to investors because it represents the operating cash flow that our operating businesses generate, less capital expenditures but before taking into account other cash movements that are not directly tied to the core operations of our businesses, such as financing activities, foreign exchange or certain investing activities. Free Cash Flow has certain limitations in that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period, nor does it represent the residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures. Therefore, it is important to evaluate Free Cash Flow along with the consolidated statements of cash flows.
Free Cash Flow
exclude stock-based compensation related to expenses for stock options, restricted stock units and other equity compensation under applicable stock-based compensation accounting standards. Expedia, Inc. excludes stock-based compensation expenses from these measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses that we do not believe are necessarily reflective of our ongoing cash operating expenses and cash operating income. In addition, due to historical accounting charges and credits related to our spin-off from IAC, changes in forfeiture estimates and other events, stock-based compensation has been highly variable in some historical quarters, impairing year-on-year and quarter-to-quarter comparability. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use when adopting applicable stock-based compensation accounting standards, management believes that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between our recurring core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing management with an important tool for financial operational decision making and for evaluating our own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time. There are certain limitations in using financial measures that do not take into account stock-based compensation, including the fact that stock-based compensation is a recurring expense and a valued part of employees' compensation. Therefore it is important to evaluate both our GAAP and non-GAAP measures. See the Note to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for stock-based compensation by line item.

Rating Agency Snapshot
S&P (Analyst: Andy Liu)
Rating Raised To BBB-' From BB'; Outlook Stable Oct 14, 2009 Note:
"The ratings upgrade is based on Expedia's revised financial policy, solid operating performance, and strong financial measures." "BBB- rating reflects the company's leading market share, strong brands, good discretionary cash flow, and solid credit measures. These positive factors offset the intense competitiveness of the online travel agency market, Expedia's concentration of earnings from this market, varying supplier dynamics, and some cyclicality."
Moody's (Analyst: Stephen Sohn)
Rating Raised from Ba2 to Ba1 / Stable / SGL-1 Oct 30, 2009 Credit Opinion:
"The upgrade is based on Expedia's solid operating performance amidst the global recession and management's commitment to more conservative financial policies." "Management has publicly committed to financial policies commensurate with an investment grade rated company, specifically 2 to 3 times (gross debt to EBITDA)." "We anticipate that modest acquisition and share buyback activity will be funded through the company's free cash flow generation and that balance sheet liquidity will remain robust through 2010. In addition, we expect leverageto remain consistent with management targets."
Solid execution & adequate liquidity in a challenging environment
