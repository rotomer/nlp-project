Discussion of Results
Gross Bookings, Revenue & Revenue Margins
Gross bookings increased 19% (19% excluding the estimated benefit from year on year changes in foreign exchange rates) for the second quarter of 2010 compared with the second quarter of 2009, driven primarily by 10% growth in transactions and a 17% increase in average airfares. Domestic bookings increased 15% and international bookings increased 28% (29% excluding foreign exchange).
Revenue increased 8% (11% excluding foreign exchange) for the second quarter, primarily driven by an increase in advertising & media revenues and hotel revenues. Domestic revenue increased 9% while international revenue increased 8% (16% excluding foreign exchange).
Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings ("revenue margin") was 12.5% for the second quarter, a decrease of 121 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2009, due primarily to a higher mix of air bookings, which have a lower revenue margin than our other products and services. The higher mix of air bookings is due in part to an increase in air ticket prices.
Products & Services Detail
Worldwide hotel revenue increased 4% for the second quarter primarily due to a 12% increase in room nights stayed, including rooms delivered as a component of packages, partially offset by a 7% decline in revenue per room night. Revenue per room night declined due in part to the impact from foreign exchange, customer refunds issued as a result of the Icelandic volcano in second quarter 2010 and lower hotel service fees compared with the prior year period.
Worldwide air revenue increased 13% for the second quarter, primarily due to a 6% increase in air tickets sold and a 7% increase in revenue per ticket. Revenue per ticket increased primarily as a result of higher average airfares.
Advertising and media revenue (including net revenue from TripAdvisor) increased 39% for the second quarter, driven by a 55% increase in third-party revenue for TripAdvisor. All other revenue (primarily car rentals and destination services) was relatively consistent with the second quarter of the prior year.
As a percentage of worldwide revenues in the second quarter of 2010, hotel accounted for 63%, advertising & media accounted for 13%, while air and all other revenues each accounted for 12%.
Profitability
OIBA for the second quarter increased 3% to $219 million primarily due to increased revenues, substantially offset by increased costs and expenses. OIBA decreased 128 basis points as a percentage of revenue to 26.3% due to growth in costs and expenses in excess of revenue growth. Operating income increased 69% due to the same factors impacting OIBA. In addition, operating income for the second quarter of 2009 included $74 million of occupancy tax assessments and legal reserves and $6 million of restructuring charges.
Adjusted net income for the second quarter increased $16 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to a foreign exchange gain compared with a prior year loss, higher OIBA and a lower effective tax rate. Net income increased $73 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher operating income and the same factors impacting adjusted net income. Adjusted EPS increased 16% to $0.44 and diluted EPS increased 186% to $0.40.
Cash Flows
For the six months ended June 30, 2010, net cash provided by operating activities was $933 million and free cash flow was $860 million. Both measures include $592 million from net changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily driven by a seasonal working capital benefit from our merchant hotel business. Free cash flow increased $58 million compared to the first six months of the prior year primarily due to lower cash tax payments, higher relative growth in our merchant hotel business, and higher OIBA, partially offset by higher capital expenditures. Cash and cash equivalents excluding amounts related to non-wholly owned subsidiaries was $684 million as of June 30, 2010.

Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures
Expedia, Inc. reports Operating Income Before Amortization, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS, Free Cash Flow and non-GAAP operating expenses (non-GAAP cost of revenue, non-GAAP selling and marketing, non-GAAP technology and content and non-GAAP general and administrative), all of which are supplemental measures to GAAP and are defined by the SEC as non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are among the primary metrics by which management evaluates the performance of the business, on which internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated. Management believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools that management uses to analyze our results. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP. We endeavor to compensate for the limitation of the non-GAAP measures presented by also providing the most directly comparable GAAP measures and descriptions of the reconciling items and adjustments to derive the non-GAAP measures. The definitions of Operating Income Before Amortization and Adjusted Net Income were revised in the first quarter of 2009 to better reflect our current operations and take into consideration the impact of new accounting literature.
is defined as operating income plus: (1) stock-based compensation expense, including compensation expense related to certain subsidiary equity plans; (2) acquisition-related impacts, including (i) amortization of intangible assets and goodwill and intangible asset impairment, and (ii) gains (losses) recognized on changes in the value of contingent consideration arrangements; (3) certain infrequently occurring items, including restructuring; (4) charges incurred, if any, for monies that may be required to be paid in advance of litigation in certain occupancy tax proceedings; and (5) gains (losses) realized on revenue hedging activities that are included in other, net.
Operating Income Before Amortization ("OIBA")
We exclude the items listed above from OIBA because doing so provides investors greater insight into management decision making at Expedia. We believe OIBA is useful to investors because it is our primary internal metric by which management evaluates the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments, on which internal budgets are based, and by which management, including our Chief Executive Officer, is compensated. In addition, we believe that by excluding certain items, such as stock-based compensation and acquisition-related impacts, OIBA corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business and allows investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting the ongoing cash earnings capabilities of our business, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. Although depreciation is also a non-cash expense, it is included in OIBA because it is driven directly by the capital expenditure decisions made by management. OIBA has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact of certain expenses to our consolidated statements of operations. We endeavor to compensate for the limitation of the non-GAAP measure presented by also providing the comparable GAAP measure, GAAP financial statements, and descriptions of the reconciling items and adjustments, to derive the non-GAAP measure. However, OIBA should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP measures. Due to the high variability and difficulty in predicting certain items that affect net income / (loss), such as tax rates, stock price, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, Expedia, Inc. is unable to provide a reconciliation to net income / (loss) on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable efforts. We present a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to GAAP below.
generally captures all items on the statements of operations that occur in normal course operations and have been, or ultimately will be, settled in cash and is defined as net income/(loss) attributable to Expedia, Inc. plus
Adjusted Net Income
 
net of tax: (1) stock-based compensation expense, including compensation expense related to certain subsidiary equity plans; (2) acquisition-related impacts, including (i) amortization of intangible assets, including as part of equity-method investments, and goodwill and intangible asset impairment, (ii) gains (losses) recognized on changes in the value of contingent consideration arrangements, and (iii) gains (losses) recognized on noncontrolling investment basis adjustments when we acquire controlling interests; (3) mark to market gains and losses on derivative instruments assumed at Spin-off; (4) currency gains or losses on U.S. dollar denominated cash or investments held by eLong; (5) certain other infrequently occurring items, including restructuring charges; (6) charges incurred, if any, for monies that may be required to be paid in advance of litigation in certain occupancy tax proceedings; (7) discontinued operations; and (8) the noncontrolling interest impact of the aforementioned adjustment items. We believe Adjusted Net Income is useful to investors because it represents Expedia, Inc.'s combined results, taking into account depreciation, which management believes is an ongoing cost of doing business, but excluding the impact of other non-cash expenses, infrequently occurring items and items not directly tied to the core operations of our businesses.
is defined as Adjusted Net Income divided by adjusted weighted average shares outstanding, which include dilution from options and warrants per the treasury stock method and include all shares relating to RSUs in shares outstanding for Adjusted EPS. This differs from the GAAP method for including RSUs, which treats them on a treasury method basis. Shares outstanding for Adjusted EPS purposes are therefore higher than shares outstanding for GAAP EPS purposes. We believe Adjusted EPS is useful to investors because it represents, on a per share basis, Expedia's consolidated results, taking into account depreciation, which we believe is an ongoing cost of doing business, as well as other items which are not allocated to the operating businesses such as interest expense, taxes, foreign exchange gains or losses, and minority interest, but excluding the effects of non-cash expenses not directly tied to the core operations of our businesses. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS have similar limitations as OIBA. In addition, Adjusted Net Income does not include all items that affect our net income / (loss) and net income / (loss) per share for the period. Therefore, we think it is important to evaluate these measures along with our consolidated statements of operations.
Adjusted EPS
is defined as net cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Management believes Free Cash Flow is useful to investors because it represents the operating cash flow that our operating businesses generate, less capital expenditures but before taking into account other cash movements that are not directly tied to the core operations of our businesses, such as financing activities, foreign exchange or certain investing activities. Free Cash Flow has certain limitations in that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period, nor does it represent the residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures. Therefore, it is important to evaluate Free Cash Flow along with the consolidated statements of cash flows.
Free Cash Flow
exclude stock-based compensation related to expenses for stock options, restricted stock units and other equity compensation under applicable stock-based compensation accounting standards. Expedia, Inc. excludes stock-based compensation expenses from these measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses that we do not believe are necessarily reflective of our ongoing cash operating expenses and cash operating income. In addition, due to historical accounting charges and credits related to our spin-off from IAC, changes in forfeiture estimates and other events, stock-based compensation has been highly variable in some historical quarters, impairing year-on-year and quarter-to-quarter comparability. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use when adopting applicable stock-based compensation accounting standards, management believes that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between our recurring core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing management with an important tool for financial operational decision making and for evaluating our own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time. There are certain limitations in using financial measures that do not take into account stock-based compensation, including the fact that stock-based compensation is a recurring expense and a valued part of employees' compensation. Therefore it is important to evaluate both our GAAP and non-GAAP measures. See the Note to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for stock-based compensation by line item.
