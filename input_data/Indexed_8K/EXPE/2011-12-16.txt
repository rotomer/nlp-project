Item 5.04 Temporary Suspension of Trading Under Registrant's Employee Benefit Plans
On November 18, 2011, Expedia, Inc. sent a notice to its directors and executive officers informing them of a temporary suspension of transactions by directors and executive officers involving Expedia equity securities during a blackout period under the Expedia Retirement Savings Plan (the "Plan") as a result of Expedia's expected reverse stock split and spin-off transaction (the "Spin-Off"). The notice stated that the blackout period was expected to begin during the calendar week of December 11, 2011 and end during the calendar week of December 18, 2011. Due to a revision in the expected timing of the Spin-Off, on December 15 and 16, 2011, pursuant to Section 306 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Section 104 of Regulation BTR, Expedia sent a revised notice to its directors and executive officers, informing them that the blackout period is now expected to begin during the calendar week of December 18, 2011 and end prior to or during the calendar week of December 25, 2011.
A copy of the December 14, 2011 blackout notice to Expedia's directors and executive officers is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
EXHIBIT INDEX
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
This is an update to the notice provided to you on November 18, 2011 regarding an expected temporary suspension of trading in Expedia, Inc. equity securities during a short "blackout period" that is expected to be imposed under the Expedia Retirement Savings Plan in connection with the anticipated one-for-two reverse stock split and spin-off of TripAdvisor, Inc. During the expected blackout period, participants in Expedia's Retirement Savings Plan will be temporarily unable to effect certain transactions involving the Expedia Stock Fund within such Plan, including making investment exchanges into or out of, or taking distributions or loans of money invested in, Expedia common stock in the Expedia Stock Fund.
The blackout period for Expedia's Retirement Savings Plan initially was expected to begin during the calendar week of December 11, 2011 and end during the calendar week of December 18, 2011; however, due to a revision in the expected timing of the spin-off, the blackout period is now expected to begin during the calendar week of December 18, 2011 and end prior to or during the calendar week of December 25, 2011. Other than the change in the timing of the expected blackout period, the information provided to you in the November 18, 2011 notice has not changed.
Keep in mind that we expect that the blackout period will occur during a closed window under the Expedia Securities Trading Policy. Accordingly, you are prohibited from trading in Expedia securities under Company policy in addition to the restrictions described above.
As stated in the November 18, 2011 notice, the rules relating to the blackout period and trading suspension are complex and the criminal and civil penalties that could be imposed upon directors and executive officers who violate them could be severe.
