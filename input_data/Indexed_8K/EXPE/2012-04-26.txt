Discussion of Results
The information presented within treats the domestic and international operations previously associated with Expedia's TripAdvisor Media Group as discontinued operations and accounts for the reverse stock split that occurred on December 20, 2011. The results include Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Hotwire.com; Expedia Affiliate Network, Classic Vacations, Expedia Local Expert, Expedia CruiseShipCenters, Egencia, eLong, and Venere Net SpA; in addition to the related international points of sale.
The operating results for the first quarter of 2012 exclude the Expedia websites contributed to the joint venture between Expedia and AirAsia, which is 50% owned by Expedia.
The results for the first quarter of 2012 include Traveldoo and Travelforce, which were acquired during the fourth quarter and second quarter of 2011, respectively. The collective impact of acquisitions on first quarter 2012 results was not meaningful.
Gross Bookings, Revenue & Revenue Margins
Gross bookings increased 15% (16% excluding foreign exchange) for the first quarter of 2012 compared with the first quarter of 2011, primarily driven by a 24% increase in hotel room nights through accelerated growth at all leisure brands except Expedia. For the first quarter of 2012, average daily room rates were flat, and average airfares grew 7% year-over-year. Air tickets sold grew by 5% year-over-year primarily due to availability of American Airlines tickets that were not available to leisure consumers for the duration of first quarter 2011. Domestic bookings increased 16% and international bookings increased 14% (16% excluding foreign exchange) for the first quarter of 2012. International bookings totaled $3.3 billion for the first quarter of 2012, accounting for 39% of worldwide bookings consistent with the prior year.
Revenue increased 12% (13% excluding foreign exchange) for the first quarter of 2012, primarily driven by an increase in hotel room nights stayed partially offset by a decrease in revenue per room night and revenue per ticket. Domestic revenue increased 11% and international revenue increased 14% (17% excluding foreign exchange) for the quarter. International revenue equaled $325 million for the first quarter of 2012, representing 40% of worldwide revenue compared to 39% in the prior year.
Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings ("revenue margin") was 9.7% for the first quarter, a decrease of 28 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2011. The primary drivers included lower net air supplier economics, rising average air ticket prices (as our remuneration generally does not vary with the price of the ticket) and changes in our hotel product mix partially offset by growth in our higher margin hotel business.
Product & Services Detail
As a percentage of total worldwide revenue in the first quarter of 2012, hotel accounted for 70%, air accounted for 11% and all other revenue sources accounted for the remaining 19%.
Worldwide hotel revenue increased 18% for the first quarter driven by a 24% increase in room nights stayed partially offset by a 6% decrease in revenue per room night. Revenue per room night decreased primarily due to changes in our hotel product mix, discounting at the Hotwire brand, accruals for loyalty programs at Expedia and Hotels.com and impacts of foreign currency.
Worldwide air revenue decreased 17% for the first quarter due primarily to a 20% decrease in revenue per ticket partially offset by a 5% increase in air tickets sold. The increase in ticket volume was due to availability of American Airlines content for the duration of first quarter 2012 and was partially offset by a 7% increase in average air ticket prices. Revenue per ticket declined due to lower net supplier economics partially offset by certain regional and interline consumer booking fees.
All other revenue (excluding hotel and air) increased 15% for the first quarter through strong growth in car rentals, advertising revenue and corporate travel fees.
 
Costs and Expenses
(Stock-based compensation expenses of $17 million for first quarter 2012 and $15 million for first quarter 2011 have been excluded from all calculations and discussions below; some numbers may not add due to rounding.)
 
Cost of revenue (non-GAAP)
 
Selling and Marketing (non-GAAP)
 
 
Technology and Content (non-GAAP)
 
General and Administrative (non-GAAP)
 
Interest and Other
For the first quarter of 2012, interest income grew $2.4 million year-over-year primarily due to higher rates of return and average balances. Interest expense remained relatively consistent year-over-year. During the first quarter of 2012, in conjunction with the TripAdvisor spin-off, we redeemed $400 million 8.5% 2016 notes. The $38 million loss ($24 million net of tax) associated with the early extinguishment of debt is included within discontinued operations for the first quarter of 2012 since the notes were fully redeemed on January 19, 2012.
For the first quarter of 2012, other, net was a loss of $6 million versus a loss of $7 million in the first quarter of 2011. Losses for the first quarter of 2012 were comprised of foreign exchange losses as well as equity method operating losses. Losses for the first quarter of 2011 were primarily comprised of foreign exchange losses. Foreign currency rate fluctuations negatively impacted our first quarter revenue growth rates primarily due to depreciation in the Euro and Pound versus first quarter 2011. Our revenue hedging program is designed to offset the book-to-stay impact on merchant hotel revenue. We include any realized gains or losses from our revenue hedging program in our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA.
 
Income Taxes
The effective tax rates on GAAP pre-tax income were 19.5% for the first quarter of 2012 compared with 32.8% in the prior year period. The effective tax rate on pre-tax adjusted net income ("ANI") was 22.5% for the first quarter of 2012 compared with 29.2% in the prior year period. The lower rates in the first quarter of 2012 were primarily driven by an increase in earnings in jurisdictions outside the United States as well as a release of reserves related to uncertain tax positions. The ANI rate was higher than the GAAP rate primarily as a result of higher pre-tax income on an adjusted basis.
Balance Sheet, Cash Flows and Capitalization
Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments totaled $2.0 billion at March 31, 2012. Of this amount, $313 million is held by our majority-owned subsidiaries, which is included in our consolidated financial statements but not considered available for our working capital purposes.
Outstanding letters of credit totaling $22 million were applied to our $750 million unsecured revolving credit facility leaving a total available balance of $728 million at March 31, 2012. Long-term debt totaled $1.25 billion at March 31, 2012 consisting of $749 million in 5.95% senior notes due 2020, net of discount, and $500 million in 7.456% senior notes due 2018.
For the quarter ended March 31, 2012, net cash provided by operating activities was $848 million and free cash flow was $797 million. Both measures include $776 million from net changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily driven by a working capital benefit from our merchant hotel business. Free cash flow increased $150 million compared to the prior year primarily due to our working capital benefit.
At March 31, 2012, we had stock-based awards outstanding representing approximately 20 million shares of our common stock, consisting of stock options to purchase 18 million common shares with a $22.46 weighted average exercise price and weighted average remaining life of 5 years, and 2 million restricted stock units (RSUs).
As of March 31, 2012, there were 30 million privately held warrants outstanding, which, if exercised in full, would entitle holders to acquire 7 million common shares of Expedia, Inc. for an aggregate purchase price of $179 million (an average of $24.16 per Expedia, Inc. common share). All of these warrants expire in May 2012.
During the quarter, we repurchased 5.8 million common shares for an aggregate purchase price of $192 million excluding transaction costs (an average of $33.39 per share). Subsequent to quarter end, we repurchased 3.0 million common shares for an aggregate purchase price of $99 million excluding transaction costs (an average of $32.95 per share) exhausting our October 2010 repurchase authorization. On April 25, 2012, the Executive Committee, acting on behalf of the Board of Directors, authorized an additional repurchase of up to 20 million shares of common stock.
On March 30, 2012 we paid a quarterly dividend of $12 million ($0.09 per common share). In addition, the Executive Committee of Expedia's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.09 per share of outstanding common stock to be paid to stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 30, 2012, with a payment date of June 19, 2012. Based on our current shares outstanding we estimate the total payment for this quarterly dividend will be approximately $12 million. Future declaration of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of Expedia's Board of Directors.

Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures
Expedia, Inc. reports Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS, Free Cash Flow and non-GAAP operating expenses (non-GAAP cost of revenue, non-GAAP selling and marketing, non-GAAP technology and content and non-GAAP general and administrative), all of which are supplemental measures to GAAP and are defined by the SEC as non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are among the primary metrics by which management evaluates the performance of the business and on which internal budgets are based. Management believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools that management uses to analyze our results. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS have certain limitations in that they do not take into account the impact of certain expenses to our consolidated statements of operations. We endeavor to compensate for the limitation of the non-GAAP measures presented by also providing the most directly comparable GAAP measures and descriptions of the reconciling items and adjustments to derive the non-GAAP measures. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS also exclude certain items related to occupancy tax matters, which may ultimately be settled in cash, and we urge investors to review the detailed disclosure regarding these matters in the Management Discussion and Analysis, Legal Proceedings sections, as well as the notes to the financial statements, included in the Company's annual and quarterly reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. The definition of Adjusted Net Income was revised in fourth quarter of 2010 and fourth quarter of 2011.
is defined as operating income plus: (1) stock-based compensation expense, including compensation expense related to certain subsidiary equity plans; (2) acquisition-related impacts, including (i) amortization of intangible assets and goodwill and intangible asset impairment, and (ii) gains (losses) recognized on changes in the value of contingent consideration arrangements; (3) certain infrequently occurring items, including restructuring; (4) items included in Legal reserves, occupancy tax and other, which includes reserves for potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy taxes, related court decisions and final settlements, and charges incurred, if any, for monies that may be required to be paid in advance of litigation in certain occupancy tax proceedings; (5) gains (losses) realized on revenue hedging activities that are included in other, net; and (6) depreciation.
Adjusted EBITDA
The above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are noncash in nature, or because the amount and timing of these items is unpredictable, not driven by core operating results and renders comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure for analysts and investors to evaluate our future on-going performance as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison of our performance and projected cash earnings with our historical results from prior periods and to the results of our competitors. Moreover, our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments. In addition, we believe that by excluding certain items, such as stock-based compensation and acquisition-related impacts, Adjusted EBITDA corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business and allows investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting the ongoing cash earnings capabilities of our business, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced.
 
generally captures all items on the statements of operations that occur in normal course operations and have been, or ultimately will be, settled in cash and is defined as net income/(loss) attributable to Expedia, Inc. plus net of tax: (1) stock-based compensation expense, including compensation expense related to certain subsidiary equity plans; (2) acquisition-related impacts, including (i) amortization of intangible assets, including as part of equity-method investments, and goodwill and intangible asset impairment, (ii) gains (losses) recognized on changes in the value of contingent consideration arrangements, and (iii) gains (losses) recognized on noncontrolling investment basis adjustments when we acquire controlling interests; (3) mark to market gains and losses on derivative instruments assumed at Spin-off; (4) currency gains or losses on U.S. dollar denominated cash or investments held by eLong; (5) certain other infrequently occurring items, including restructuring charges; (6) items included in Legal reserves, occupancy tax and other, which includes reserves for potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy taxes, related court decisions and final settlements, and charges incurred, if any, for monies that may be required to be paid in advance of litigation in certain occupancy tax proceedings; (7) discontinued operations; (8) the noncontrolling interest impact of the aforementioned adjustment items and (9) unrealized gains (losses) on revenue hedging activities that are included in other, net. We believe Adjusted Net Income is useful to investors because it represents Expedia, Inc.'s combined results, taking into account depreciation, which management believes is an ongoing cost of doing business, but excluding the impact of certain expenses, infrequently occurring items and items not directly tied to the core operations of our businesses.
Adjusted Net Income
is defined as Adjusted Net Income divided by adjusted weighted average shares outstanding, which include dilution from options and warrants per the treasury stock method and include all shares relating to RSUs in shares outstanding for Adjusted EPS. This differs from the GAAP method for including RSUs, which treats them on a treasury method basis. Shares outstanding for Adjusted EPS purposes are therefore higher than shares outstanding for GAAP EPS purposes. We believe Adjusted EPS is useful to investors because it represents, on a per share basis, Expedia's consolidated results, taking into account depreciation, which we believe is an ongoing cost of doing business, as well as other items which are not allocated to the operating businesses such as interest expense, taxes, foreign exchange gains or losses, and minority interest, but excluding the effects of certain expenses not directly tied to the core operations of our businesses. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS have similar limitations as Adjusted EBITDA. In addition, Adjusted Net Income does not include all items that affect our net income / (loss) and net income / (loss) per share for the period. Therefore, we think it is important to evaluate these measures along with our consolidated statements of operations.
Adjusted EPS
is defined as net cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Management believes Free Cash Flow is useful to investors because it represents the operating cash flow that our operating businesses generate, less capital expenditures but before taking into account other cash movements that are not directly tied to the core operations of our businesses, such as financing activities, foreign exchange or certain investing activities. Free Cash Flow has certain limitations in that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period, nor does it represent the residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures. Therefore, it is important to evaluate Free Cash Flow along with the consolidated statements of cash flows.
Free Cash Flow
exclude stock-based compensation related to expenses for stock options, restricted stock units and other equity compensation under applicable stock-based compensation accounting standards. Expedia, Inc. excludes stock-based compensation expenses from these measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses that we do not believe are necessarily reflective of our ongoing cash operating expenses and cash operating income. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use when adopting applicable stock-based compensation accounting standards, management believes that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between our recurring core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing management with an important tool for financial operational decision making and for evaluating our own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time. There are certain limitations in using financial measures that do not take into account stock-based compensation, including the fact that stock-based compensation is a recurring expense and a valued part of employees' compensation. Therefore it is important to evaluate both our GAAP and non-GAAP measures. See the Note to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for stock-based compensation by line item.
