Discussion of Results
The information presented within treats the domestic and international operations previously associated with Expedia's TripAdvisor Media Group as discontinued operations and accounts for the reverse stock split that occurred on December 20, 2011. The results include Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Hotwire.com; Expedia Affiliate Network, Classic Vacations, Expedia Local Expert, Expedia CruiseShipCenters, Egencia, eLong, and Venere Net SpA; in addition to the related international points of sale.
The results for the third quarter of 2012 exclude the Brand Expedia websites contributed to the joint venture between Expedia and AirAsia formed on July 1, 2011, which is 50% owned by Expedia.
The results for the third quarter of 2012 include VIA Travel and Traveldoo, which were acquired during the second quarter of 2012 and fourth quarter of 2011, respectively. The impact of the Traveldoo acquisition on third quarter 2012 results was not meaningful, and the impact from the VIA Travel acquisition is discussed in more detail below. Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons below are versus the third quarter of 2011.
Gross Bookings, Revenue & Revenue Margins
Gross bookings increased 19% (22% excluding foreign exchange) for the third quarter of 2012, primarily driven by a 27% increase in hotel room nights and an 11% increase in air tickets. The VIA Travel acquisition added approximately 3% to year-over-year gross bookings growth for the third quarter of 2012.
For the third quarter of 2012, average daily room rates declined 3%, and average airfares grew 1% year-over-year. Air tickets sold grew by 11% year-over-year primarily due to the VIA Travel acquisition. Domestic bookings increased 13% and international bookings increased 27% (34% excluding foreign exchange) for the third quarter of 2012. International bookings totaled $3.8 billion for the third quarter of 2012, accounting for 42% of worldwide bookings versus 40% in the prior year.
Revenue increased 17% (21% excluding foreign exchange) for the third quarter of 2012, primarily driven by an increase in hotel room nights stayed partially offset by a decrease in revenue per room night and revenue per ticket. The VIA Travel acquisition added approximately 3% to year-over-year revenue growth for the third quarter of 2012. Domestic revenue increased 14% and international revenue increased 22% (29% excluding foreign exchange) for the third quarter of 2012. International revenue equaled $545 million for the third quarter of 2012, representing 45% of worldwide revenue versus 44% in the prior year.
Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings ("revenue margin") was 13.2% for the third quarter of 2012, a decrease of 15 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2011. The decrease primarily relates to hotel product mix, lower net air supplier economics combined with higher air ticket prices and book-to-stay timing partially offset by a favorable mix shift to our higher margin product.
Product & Services Detail
As a percentage of total worldwide revenue in the third quarter of 2012, hotel accounted for 77%, air accounted for 7% and all other revenue sources accounted for the remaining 16%.
Worldwide hotel revenue increased 20% for the third quarter of 2012 driven by a 27% increase in room nights stayed partially offset by a 6% decrease in revenue per room night. Revenue per room night decreased primarily due to changes in our hotel product mix, of which mix shift to regions with lower hotel economics is becoming a significant component, as well as impacts from foreign currency and accruals for loyalty programs.
Worldwide air revenue decreased 10% for the third quarter of 2012 due primarily to a 19% decrease in revenue per ticket partially offset by an 11% increase in air tickets sold. The increase in ticket volume primarily relates to the VIA Travel acquisition. Revenue per ticket declined due to lower net supplier economics and fewer consumer and interline booking fees as well as impacts from foreign exchange.
All other revenue (excluding hotel and air) increased 23% for the third quarter of 2012 through strong growth in corporate travel fees and advertising revenue.
 
Costs and Expenses
(Stock-based compensation expenses of $15 million for third quarter 2012 and $13 million for third quarter 2011 have been excluded from all calculations and discussions below; some numbers may not add due to rounding.)
 
Cost of revenue (non-GAAP)
 
Selling and Marketing (non-GAAP)
 
 
Technology and Content (non-GAAP)
 
General and Administrative (non-GAAP)
 
Interest and Other
For the third quarter of 2012, interest income grew $2 million year-over-year primarily due to higher average cash balances. Interest expense remained relatively consistent year-over-year.
For the third quarter of 2012, other, net was a loss of $8 million compared to a gain of $11 million in third quarter 2011. Losses for the third quarter of 2012 and gains for the third quarter of 2011 were primarily related to foreign exchange. Foreign currency rate fluctuations negatively impacted our third quarter revenue growth rates primarily due to depreciation in the Euro versus third quarter 2011. Our revenue hedging program is designed to offset the book-to-stay impact on merchant hotel revenue. We include any realized gains or losses from our revenue hedging program in our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA.
Income Taxes
The effective tax rates on GAAP pre-tax income were 17.7% for the third quarter of 2012 compared with 15.1% in the prior year period. The effective tax rate on pre-tax adjusted net income ("ANI") was 20.3% for the third quarter of 2012 compared with 19.0% in the prior year period. The higher rates in the third quarter of 2012 were primarily driven by a decrease in estimated earnings as a percentage of total earnings in jurisdictions outside the United States, reserves for uncertain tax positions, and other nondeductible expenses and income inclusions, offset by the release of a valuation allowance on foreign deferred tax assets. The ANI rate was higher than the GAAP rate primarily as a result of higher pre-tax income on an adjusted basis.
 
Balance Sheet, Cash Flows and Capitalization
Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments totaled $2.4 billion at September 30, 2012. Of this amount, $310 million is held by our majority-owned subsidiaries and is included in our consolidated financial statements, however, it is not considered available for our working capital purposes.
Outstanding letters of credit totaling $22 million were applied to our $750 million unsecured revolving credit facility leaving a total available balance of $728 million at September 30, 2012. Long-term debt totaled $1.25 billion at September 30, 2012 consisting of $749 million in 5.95% senior notes due 2020, net of discount, and $500 million in 7.456% senior notes due 2018.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, net cash provided by operating activities was $1.5 billion and free cash flow was $1.3 billion. Both measures include $947 million from net changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily driven by a working capital benefit from our merchant hotel business. Free cash flow increased $416 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, compared to the prior year primarily due to our working capital benefit.
At September 30, 2012, we had stock-based awards outstanding representing approximately 18 million shares of our common stock, consisting of stock options to purchase 16 million common shares with a $24.42 weighted average exercise price and weighted average remaining life of 5 years, and 2 million restricted stock units (RSUs). Assuming, among other things, no meaningful modifications of existing awards, incremental grants or adjustments to forfeiture estimates, we expect annual stock-based compensation expense will be approximately $63 million in 2012.
During the third quarter 2012, we repurchased 1.1 million common shares for an aggregate purchase price of $60 million excluding transaction costs (an average of $54.44 per share). Subsequent to quarter end, we repurchased 840,000 shares for an aggregate purchase price of $46 million excluding transaction costs (an average of $55.36 per share). Approximately 18 million shares of common stock are available for repurchase under the April 25, 2012 authorization.
On September 18, 2012, we paid a quarterly dividend of $18 million ($0.13 per common share). In addition, the Executive Committee of Expedia's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.13 per share of outstanding common stock to be paid to stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 16, 2012, with a payment date of December 7, 2012. Based on our current shares outstanding, we estimate the total payment for this quarterly dividend will be approximately $18 million. Future declaration of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of Expedia's Board of Directors.

Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures
Expedia, Inc. reports Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS, Free Cash Flow and non-GAAP operating expenses (non-GAAP cost of revenue, non-GAAP selling and marketing, non-GAAP technology and content and non-GAAP general and administrative), all of which are supplemental measures to GAAP and are defined by the SEC as non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are among the primary metrics by which management evaluates the performance of the business and on which internal budgets are based. Management believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools that management uses to analyze our results. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS have certain limitations in that they do not take into account the impact of certain expenses to our consolidated statements of operations. We endeavor to compensate for the limitation of the non-GAAP measures presented by also providing the most directly comparable GAAP measures and descriptions of the reconciling items and adjustments to derive the non-GAAP measures. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS also exclude certain items related to occupancy tax matters, which may ultimately be settled in cash, and we urge investors to review the detailed disclosure regarding these matters in the Management Discussion and Analysis, Legal Proceedings sections, as well as the notes to the financial statements, included in the Company's annual and quarterly reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. The definition of Adjusted Net Income was revised in fourth quarter of 2010 and fourth quarter of 2011.
is defined as operating income plus: (1) stock-based compensation expense, including compensation expense related to certain subsidiary equity plans; (2) acquisition-related impacts, including (i) amortization of intangible assets and goodwill and intangible asset impairment, and (ii) gains (losses) recognized on changes in the value of contingent consideration arrangements; (3) certain infrequently occurring items, including restructuring; (4) items included in Legal reserves, occupancy tax and other, which includes reserves for potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy taxes, related court decisions and final settlements, and charges incurred, if any, for monies that may be required to be paid in advance of litigation in certain occupancy tax proceedings; (5) gains (losses) realized on revenue hedging activities that are included in other, net; and (6) depreciation.
Adjusted EBITDA
The above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are noncash in nature, or because the amount and timing of these items is unpredictable, not driven by core operating results and renders comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure for analysts and investors to evaluate our future on-going performance as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison of our performance and projected cash earnings with our historical results from prior periods and to the results of our competitors. Moreover, our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments. In addition, we believe that by excluding certain items, such as stock-based compensation and acquisition-related impacts, Adjusted EBITDA corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business and allows investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting the ongoing cash earnings capabilities of our business, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced.
generally captures all items on the statements of operations that occur in normal course operations and have been, or ultimately will be, settled in cash and is defined as net income/(loss) attributable to Expedia, Inc. plus net of tax: (1) stock-based compensation expense, including compensation expense related to certain subsidiary equity plans; (2) acquisition-related impacts, including (i) amortization of intangible assets, including as part of equity-method
Adjusted Net Income
 
investments, and goodwill and intangible asset impairment, (ii) gains (losses) recognized on changes in the value of contingent consideration arrangements, and (iii) gains (losses) recognized on noncontrolling investment basis adjustments when we acquire controlling interests; (3) mark to market gains and losses on derivative instruments assumed at Spin-off; (4) currency gains or losses on U.S. dollar denominated cash or investments held by eLong; (5) certain other infrequently occurring items, including restructuring charges; (6) items included in Legal reserves, occupancy tax and other, which includes reserves for potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy taxes, related court decisions and final settlements, and charges incurred, if any, for monies that may be required to be paid in advance of litigation in certain occupancy tax proceedings; (7) discontinued operations; (8) the noncontrolling interest impact of the aforementioned adjustment items and (9) unrealized gains (losses) on revenue hedging activities that are included in other, net. We believe Adjusted Net Income is useful to investors because it represents Expedia, Inc.'s combined results, taking into account depreciation, which management believes is an ongoing cost of doing business, but excluding the impact of certain expenses, infrequently occurring items and items not directly tied to the core operations of our businesses.
is defined as Adjusted Net Income divided by adjusted weighted average shares outstanding, which include dilution from options and warrants per the treasury stock method and include all shares relating to RSUs in shares outstanding for Adjusted EPS. This differs from the GAAP method for including RSUs, which treats them on a treasury method basis. Shares outstanding for Adjusted EPS purposes are therefore higher than shares outstanding for GAAP EPS purposes. We believe Adjusted EPS is useful to investors because it represents, on a per share basis, Expedia's consolidated results, taking into account depreciation, which we believe is an ongoing cost of doing business, as well as other items which are not allocated to the operating businesses such as interest expense, taxes, foreign exchange gains or losses, and minority interest, but excluding the effects of certain expenses not directly tied to the core operations of our businesses. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS have similar limitations as Adjusted EBITDA. In addition, Adjusted Net Income does not include all items that affect our net income / (loss) and net income / (loss) per share for the period. Therefore, we think it is important to evaluate these measures along with our consolidated statements of operations.
Adjusted EPS
is defined as net cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Management believes Free Cash Flow is useful to investors because it represents the operating cash flow that our operating businesses generate, less capital expenditures but before taking into account other cash movements that are not directly tied to the core operations of our businesses, such as financing activities, foreign exchange or certain investing activities. Free Cash Flow has certain limitations in that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period, nor does it represent the residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures. Therefore, it is important to evaluate Free Cash Flow along with the consolidated statements of cash flows.
Free Cash Flow
exclude stock-based compensation related to expenses for stock options, restricted stock units and other equity compensation under applicable stock-based compensation accounting standards. Expedia, Inc. excludes stock-based compensation expenses from these measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses that we do not believe are necessarily reflective of our ongoing cash operating expenses and cash operating income. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use when adopting applicable stock-based compensation accounting standards, management believes that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between our recurring core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing management with an important tool for financial operational decision making and for evaluating our own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time. There are certain limitations in using financial measures that do not take into account stock-based compensation, including the fact that stock-based compensation is a recurring expense and a valued part of employees' compensation. Therefore it is important to evaluate both our GAAP and non-GAAP measures. See the Note to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for stock-based compensation by line item.
