"We beat analyst estimates in the first and second quarters and we will do it again in the third quarter," said Bill Ford, Chairman and CEO. "On an operating basis, we expect to report a small profit for the third quarter." The current First Call consensus estimate for Ford's third quarter is a 10-cent loss, excluding unusual items. "This demonstrates our success in capitalizing on larger-than-expected industry volumes," added Mr. Ford. "At the same time, we are making steady progress on our Revitalization Plan." The company re-affirmed its intention to report a modest profit for the full year. # # #
