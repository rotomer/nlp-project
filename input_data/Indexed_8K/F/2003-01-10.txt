DEARBORN, Mich., Jan. 10, 2003 - Twelve months into its five-year Revitalization Plan, Ford Motor Company [NYSE: F] is on target to achieve its bottom-line goal: a $7 billion annual pre-tax profit by mid-decade. The company provided a Revitalization Plan update and released its 2003 financial milestones today in Dearborn during a meeting with securities analysts. "We made a great deal of progress in 2002 toward a long-term Revitalization Plan that we fully believe is the right strategy for getting the company back on track," said Chairman and CEO Bill Ford. "This is our Centennial year, and while we certainly will be celebrating our past, we will be focused on the future. Meeting our 2003 financial goals will be the first step."

Assuming achievement of these milestones, the company expects to have fully diluted earnings per share of 70 cents in 2003.

For 2003, the pension fund long-term annual return assumption has been reduced to 8.75 percent from 9.5 percent for the U.S., Canada and Britain, and, in the U.S., the discount rate has been reduced to 6.75 percent at year-end 2002 from 7.25 percent at year-end 2001.
