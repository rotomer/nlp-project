Exhibit 20
N
EWS
 
Revenue for 2002 was $162.6 billion, up more than 1 percent from $160.8 billion a year ago. Vehicle unit sales were 6,980,000, down slightly from 7,008,000 in 2001.
"In the first year of our turnaround, Ford improved its operating results by about $1.7 billion," said Chairman and CEO Bill Ford. "Our earnings performance demonstrates that we are making solid progress toward the goals outlined in our Revitalization Plan. In 2002, we exceeded nearly all our commitments and are on track to reach our mid-decade target of an annual $7 billion pre-tax operating profit."
Ford realized success in a number of areas throughout 2002:
"Now, as we move into 2003, we are accelerating our efforts. As we just demonstrated at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, we have a lot of exciting new products coming and we are well on our way to the product-led recovery we've been talking about for the last 12 months," said Mr. Ford.
 
Ford Motor Company, in its centennial year, will introduce an all-new F-150 pickup truck with five differentiated series that will span the full range of consumer wants and needs. In addition, Ford Motor Company will introduce new minivans for the Ford and Mercury brands in North America, the Ford Transit Connect (commercial vehicle) and the Ford StreetKa (Ford's first European two-seat roadster) in Europe, and an all-new Jaguar XJ sedan. The first units of the Ford GT high-performance sports car also will be produced this summer.
FOURTH QUARTER
Ford reported a net loss of $130 million, or 7 cents per share, for the fourth quarter of 2002. This is an improvement from 2001 of $4.9 billion ($2.74 per share). Excluding charges for restructuring actions and other unusual items, Ford earned $150 million, or 8 cents per share. This is an improvement from 2001 of $1 billion (56 cents per share).
The non-recurring restructuring actions include primarily:
Total revenue in the fourth quarter was $41.6 billion, up $869 million from a year ago, despite a decline in the number of units sold. Worldwide vehicle unit sales fell slightly in the fourth quarter to 1,791,000 from 1,813,000 a year ago.
The following discussion of fourth-quarter and full-year results excludes unusual items and includes results from discontinued operations in both years. The discontinued operations resulted from holding certain non-core businesses for sale. These include primarily Ford's automotive recycling business in the U.S., the TH!NK electric vehicle business and the all-makes fleet leasing business in Europe, Australia and New Zealand.
 
AUTOMOTIVE OPERATIONS
Ford's worldwide automotive operations posted a loss of $539 million, compared with a loss of $1.96 billion in 2001. Worldwide automotive revenue was $134.4 billion, an increase of nearly three percent versus a year ago.
In the fourth quarter, Ford's worldwide automotive operations incurred a loss of $191 million on revenue of $34.7 billion, compared with a loss of $803 million on revenue of $33.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2001.
Automotive gross cash at Dec. 31, 2002 totaled $25.3 billion, including $2.7 billion of pre-funding for employee benefit expenses through a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trust. Gross cash exceeded automotive debt by $11.1 billion at year-end, $7.2 billion better than at Dec. 31, 2001. The company's full-year automotive operating cash flow, excluding tax refunds, was positive.
The loss in 2002 for Ford's automotive operations in North America was $559 million on revenue of $94.1 billion. In 2001, those operations had a loss of $2.15 billion on revenue of $90.8 billion. The full-year improvement was primarily a result of the non-recurrence of costs associated with the customer safety initiative to replace Firestone tires and the re-stocking of dealer inventories, which were well below an optimal level at the end of 2001.
North America:
In the fourth quarter, Ford's North America automotive operations posted a loss of $124 million, compared with a loss of $916 million a year ago. The improvement reflected better cost performance, net revenue and mix, offset partially by lower volume. Revenue was $23.3 billion, compared with $23.2 billion in 2001.
In Europe, Ford's automotive operations earned $12 million during the full year in 2002, compared with a profit of $266 million in 2001. Revenue was $32.1 billion, an increase from $31.9 billion a year ago.
Europe:
 
Automotive operations in Europe incurred a loss of $139 million on revenue of $9.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2002. This compares with a fourth quarter 2001 profit of $61 million on revenue of $8.5 billion. The decline in earnings for both the fourth quarter and full year reflected a leaner product mix and lower dealer stocks, offset partially by higher market share.
Ford automotive operations in South America incurred a loss of $296 million during full-year 2002, compared with the full-year loss of $225 million in 2001, more than explained by the effects of currency devaluation. Revenue was $1.6 billion, down from $2.2 billion in 2001.
South America:
Fourth quarter 2002 losses were $11 million on revenue of $354 million. This compares with a fourth quarter 2001 loss of $46 million on revenue of $466 million.
Ford's automotive operations in the rest of the world earned a full-year profit in 2002 of $304 million, compared with $156 million in 2001. The improvement reflected better performance at Mazda and Ford's Asia-Pacific operations. Revenue in 2002 was $6.6 billion, up $700 million from 2001.
Rest-of-world:
In the fourth quarter of 2002, profits were $83 million, down from earnings of $98 million in 2001. Revenue was $1.8 billion compared to $1.5 billion during the same time period in 2001.
FORD CREDIT
Ford Motor Credit Company reported earnings of $1.38 billion in 2002, up $175 million from a profit of $1.2 billion a year ago. Return on equity was 9 percent in 2002, compared with 7 percent in 2001. The increase in earnings reflected primarily a lower provision for credit losses, offset partially by the net unfavorable impact of receivables sales and lower net financing margins. The provision for credit losses in 2002 was $3 billion, compared with $3.4 billion in 2001. At year end, the allowance for credit losses was $3.2 billion  2.47 percent of end-of-period receivables.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2002, Ford Credit earned $382 million, up $376 million from the same period a year earlier. The improvement reflected a lower provision for credit losses and the net favorable impact of receivables sales, offset partially by lower net financing margins.
Ford Credit paid a dividend to Ford Motor Company of $700 million in December. For the full year, Ford Credit's dividends, net of a January 2002 capital contribution, were $450 million.
HERTZ
Hertz reported full-year 2002 earnings of $127 million, up from $23 million in 2001. Hertz earned $16 million in the fourth quarter, compared to a loss of $58 million in the fourth quarter of 2001. The full-year and fourth-quarter improvements when compared to 2001 reflected increases in pricing and cost reductions.
OUTLOOK
"Although the outlook for the U.S. economy continues to be uncertain, we are looking for 2003 to be another good year for car and truck sales," said Allan Gilmour, Ford vice chairman and chief financial officer. "Throughout this year, Ford Motor Company will remain focused on improving total cost and will accelerate its implementation of the key Revitalization Plan elements. I am pleased with the significant progress we made in 2002, and I am confident that our progress will continue into 2003 and beyond."
Ford is estimating that industry demand will be about 16.5 million vehicles in the U.S. Its North American production plans call for producing 1,035,000 cars and trucks in the first quarter  up 25,000 units from production plans released earlier this month.
Investors can hear a review of fourth quarter and full-year 2002 results by Bill Ford, Allan Gilmour and President and Chief Operating Officer Nick Scheele on the Internet at or . The presentation will begin at 9 a.m. EST, Jan. 21.
