DEARBORN, Mich., March 13 - Ford Motor Company announced today it plans to produce 980,000 vehicles at North American assembly plants in the second quarter 2003. In the second quarter 2002, the company produced 1.176 million vehicles. Almost half of the year-to-year reduction in second quarter production reflects non-recurrence of last year's planned growth in inventories. The remainder of the decline reflects capacity and product actions related to the company's Revitalization Plan, and reduced F-Series production during the launch of the all-new F-150 truck. The company reaffirmed its first quarter production plan of 1.035 million vehicles.
