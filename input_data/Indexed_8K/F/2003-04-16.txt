     Exhibits 99.8 and 99.9 to this report contain certain "non-GAAP financial measures" as defined in Item 10 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The non-GAAP financial measures cover cost performance, net pricing, operating cash flows, and managed leverage at our Ford Motor Credit Company ("Ford Credit") subsidiary. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures is discussed below, including the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States ("GAAP") and the reasons why we believe the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to our investors.
     Slides 1, 4 and 18 of Exhibit 99.8 and slide 3 of Exhibit 99.9 indicate that we have achieved $638 million in cost performance improvement for the first quarter of 2003. Slide 18 of Exhibit 99.8 and slide 3 of Exhibit 99.9 indicate that we have a milestone to improve automotive cost performance by at least $500 million in 2003 over 2002. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP to this cost performance measure is Cost of Sales and Selling, Administrative and Other Expense. Appendix 1 (page 6 of 10) to Exhibit 99.8 contains a reconciliation of our non-GAAP cost performance financial measure to changes in Cost of Sales and Selling, Administrative and Other Expense. Cost of Sales and Selling, Administrative and Other Expense increased by $1.2 billion in the first quarter of 2003, compared with the first quarter of 2002. We believe that the use of the non-GAAP cost performance measure is useful to investors because it shows changes in our costs excluding the effects of changes that we do not directly control, such as our production volume, mix of products produced or foreign currency exchange rates. On this basis, we and our investors are able to determine whether or not our underlying cost structure is improving.
Cost Performance.
     Slide 18 of Exhibit 99.8 and slide 3 of Exhibit 99.9 state that our milestones are based, in part, on net pricing planning assumptions for 2003 of zero in the United States (for Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brand vehicles) and 1% in Europe (for Ford brand vehicles), in each case at constant volume, mix and exchange, compared to 2002. These slides further indicate changes in net pricing of 0.2% and negative 1.4% in the United States and Europe, respectively, in the first quarter of 2003. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP to this net pricing measure is the period-over-period change in Automotive Sales. The period-over-period change in Automotive Sales is affected by changes in unit sales volume, product mix, foreign currency exchange rates, wholesale prices for vehicles sold and marketing incentives. The net pricing measure (which measures the combined effect of changes in wholesale prices and marketing incentives, while excluding the effects of changes in unit sales volumes, product mix, and foreign currency exchange rates) is useful to investors because it provides an indication of the underlying direction of changes in revenue in one performance measure. The change in Automotive Sales in the first quarter of 2003 compared with the first quarter of 2002 was 4.2% for the United States and 3.5% for Europe. Appendix 1 (page 4 of 10) to Exhibit 99.8 contains a reconciliation of the change in net pricing in the first quarter of 2003 compared with the first quarter of 2002 to the change in Automotive Sales for the same periods.
Net Pricing.
     Slides 2, 17 and 18 of Exhibit 99.8 and slide 3 of Exhibit 99.9 discuss our operating cash flows for the first quarter 2003 and our milestone for operating cash flow for 2003. Slides 2 and 18 of Exhibit 99.8 and slide 3 of Exhibit 99.9 indicate that we had positive operating cash flow of $0.6 billion (excluding tax refunds) for the first quarter 2003. Slide 17 of Exhibit 99.8 indicates that
Operating Cash Flows.
Table of Contents
we had positive operating cash flow of $1.5 billion (including tax refunds) for the first quarter 2003. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP to this cash flow measure is Cash Flows from Operating Activities Before Securities Trading. Appendix 1 (pages 9 and 10 of 10) to Exhibit 99.8 contains a reconciliation of our non-GAAP operating cash flow measure to Cash Flows from Operating Activities Before Securities Trading. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Before Securities Trading for the first quarter of 2003 were $3 billion, $0.6 billion better than the first quarter of 2002. Slide 18 of Exhibit 99.8 and slide 3 of Exhibit 99.9 indicate that we have a milestone related to operating cash flow of breakeven in 2003. We believe the non-GAAP operating cash flow measure is useful to investors because it includes cash flow elements not included in Cash Flows from Operating Activities Before Securities Trading that we consider to be related to our operating activities (for example, capital spending). As a result, our operating cash flow measure provides investors with a more relevant measure of the net cash generated by our operations.
     Slides 16 and 18 of Exhibit 99.8 and slides 3, 4 and 14 of Exhibit 99.9 discuss Ford Credit's leverage (i.e., debt-to-equity ratio) on both a financial statement and managed basis. Financial statement leverage is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP to our non-GAAP managed leverage financial measure. Appendix 1 (pages 7 and 8 of 10) to Exhibit 99.8 contains a reconciliation of Ford Credit's non-GAAP managed leverage measure to its financial statement leverage. Slide 16 of Exhibit 99.8 and slides 4 and 14 of Exhibit 99.9 indicate that Ford Credit's financial statement and managed leverage for the first quarter of 2003 were 10.4 and 12.8 to 1, respectively. Slide 18 of Exhibit 99.8 and slide 3 of Exhibit 99.9 indicate that Ford Credit has a milestone to maintain managed leverage in the low end of 13-14 to 1 range and managed leverage for the first quarter of 2003 of 12.8 to 1. We believe that the use of the non-GAAP managed leverage measure, which is the result of several adjustments to Ford Credit's financial statement leverage, is useful to our investors because it reflects the way Ford Credit manages its business. Ford Credit retains interests in receivables sold in securitization transactions, and, with respect to subordinated retained interests, has credit risk. Accordingly, it considers securitization as an alternative source of funding and evaluates credit losses, receivables and leverage on a managed as well as a financial statement basis. As a result, the managed leverage measure provides our investors with meaningful information regarding management's decision-making processes.
Managed Leverage.
     In calculating its managed leverage ratio, Ford Credit adds the total amount of receivables sold in securitizations, net of retained interests, to its debt. It also deducts cash and cash equivalents because these generally correspond to excess debt beyond the amount required to support Ford Credit's financing operations. It adds its minority interests to equity because all of the debt of such consolidated entities is included in total debt. It excludes the impact of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 in both the numerator and the denominator in order to exclude the interim effects in changes in market rates because Ford Credit generally repays its debt funding obligations as they mature.

IMMEDIATE RELEASE
FORD BEATS 1ST QUARTER ESTIMATES WITH NET PROFIT OF $896 MILLION
DEARBORN, Mich., April 16  Ford Motor Company [NYSE: F] today reported net income of $896 million, or 45 cents a share, for the first quarter of 2003.
This compares with a net loss of $1.1 billion, or 61 cents a share, in the first quarter of 2002. The loss from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2002 was $80 million, or 5 cents a share.
Ford Motor Company's income before taxes was $1.3 billion during the first quarter of 2003, compared with a $27 million loss in the first quarter of 2002.
 
Ford's first quarter revenue rose to $40.9 billion, from $39.5 billion during last year's first quarter. Worldwide vehicle unit sales in the 2003 first quarter were 1,726,000, up 3 percent from 1,675,000 a year ago.
"Our first quarter performance demonstrates that the acceleration of our cost-cutting actions and the management team's focus on improving our core business are making a difference," said Bill Ford, chairman and CEO. "Our overall financial results continue to improve, our first quarter U.S. market share is up from last year, and we are gaining momentum on most other fronts. In addition, we launched the new Jaguar XJ and are in the process of launching several other exciting new products, such as the all-new Ford Focus C-MAX in Europe and the highly anticipated Ford F-150 pickup truck in the U.S."
During the first quarter, Ford's corporate U.S. market share was 21.2 percent. Ford's corporate U.S. market share has improved since the first quarter of 2002, when it was 20.7 percent.
As disclosed in the company's 2002 10-K report, beginning with the 2003 first quarter, Ford is expanding the number of operating segments by reporting two segments within its Automotive sector  North America and International.
New Segment Reporting
The North America Automotive segment includes the sale of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury cars and trucks in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, and the associated costs to design, develop, manufacture and service these vehicles. The International Automotive segment includes the sale of Ford brand vehicles outside of North America and the sale of Premier Automotive Group brand vehicles (i.e., Aston Martin, Jaguar, Land Rover and Volvo) throughout the world (including North America), together with the associated costs to design, develop, manufacture and service these vehicles. Ford is providing separate results for the business units within the International Automotive segment (i.e., Ford-brand Europe, Ford-brand South America, Ford-brand Asia Pacific and the Premier Automotive Group).
 
Previously, the company reported Automotive financial results on a geographic/legal entity basis. The new segment reporting will be on a business-unit basis consistent with the way these two segments are managed. Costs for each segment and business unit within each segment will reflect absolute corporate costs, eliminating the effect of transfer prices for vehicles, components and product development that were previously reflected in geographic results. Net interest expense and results of other non-core Automotive businesses will be reported centrally; these were previously included in geographic results.
These changes are being made to reflect organizational changes resulting from the appointment of executive vice presidents to lead North American and International Automotive Operations.
AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR
On a pre-tax basis, Ford's automotive sector earned $659 million during the first quarter of 2003, compared with a loss of $370 million a year ago.
Worldwide automotive revenue improved by $2 billion from $32.2 billion during the first quarter of 2002 to $34.2 billion in the first quarter of 2003.
Automotive cash, marketable securities and Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association (VEBA) assets at March 31 rose to $26.6 billion, up from $25.3 billion at the end of 2002, more than accounted for by positive operating cash flow and the effect of tax refunds.
NORTH AMERICA AUTOMOTIVE
North America Automotive earned $1.2 billion on a pre-tax basis, compared with a pre-tax profit of $465 million in the first quarter of 2002. The improvement reflected strong cost performance, favorable mix and higher market share, offset partially by lower industry volume.
North America Automotive revenue in the first quarter of 2003 rose to $22.2 billion, compared with $21.5 billion in the first quarter of 2002.
 
INTERNATIONAL AUTOMOTIVE
The 2003 first-quarter pre-tax loss for International Automotive narrowed to $353 million, from a loss of $469 million during the first quarter of 2002.
First-quarter 2003 revenue for International Automotive increased to $12.0 billion, compared with $10.4 billion during the first quarter last year.
Ford-brand Europe incurred a pre-tax loss of $249 million in the first quarter of 2003, compared with a pre-tax loss of $268 million during the same period a year ago. The improvement is explained by better cost performance, offset largely by lower net pricing. Ford-brand Europe's revenue in the first quarter rose to $5.0 billion, compared with $4.1 billion during the first quarter of 2002.
Ford-brand Europe:
The pre-tax loss for Ford-brand South America narrowed to $31 million during the first quarter, from a loss of $85 million during the first quarter a year ago. The improvement reflected higher market share, continued cost reductions and higher net pricing, partially offset by lower industry volume. Revenue in South America was $330 million in the first quarter, compared with $396 million in the first quarter of 2002. The impact of a weaker Brazilian Real more than offset improved unit volume, resulting in the decline in revenue.
Ford-brand South America:
During the first quarter of 2003, Ford-brand Asia-Pacific incurred a pre-tax loss of $26 million, compared with a loss of $39 million in the 2002 first quarter. The improvement reflected higher volume from the introduction of new products, primarily the all-new Falcon in Australia. Revenue improved to $1.3 billion, compared with $1.0 billion during the first quarter of 2002.
Ford-brand Asia-Pacific:
 
PAG reported a pre-tax loss of $88 million in the first quarter of 2003, compared with a pre-tax loss of $70 million during the first quarter of 2002. The decline primarily reflected lower net pricing, as well as lower volume associated with the production ramp-up of the all-new Jaguar XJ, largely offset by improved mix resulting from the all-new XC90 at Volvo and Range Rover at Land Rover. First-quarter revenue for PAG rose to $5.4 billion, from $4.9 billion a year ago.
Premier Automotive Group (PAG):
FORD CREDIT
Ford Motor Credit Company reported net income of $442 million in the first quarter of 2003, up $186 million from earnings of $256 million in the same period a year ago. The increase primarily reflected a lower provision for credit losses and the net favorable impact of receivables sales, offset partially by the unfavorable impact of a lower level of managed receivables.
On a pre-tax basis, Ford Credit earned $727 million in the first quarter, compared with $396 million in the first quarter of 2002.
HERTZ
Hertz reported a pre-tax loss of $59 million in the first quarter, the same as the pre-tax loss a year ago.
OUTLOOK
"The U.S. economy is certainly continuing to feel the effects of the geopolitical uncertainty we have faced over the last several months," said Allan Gilmour, vice chairman and chief financial officer. "Despite consumer confidence being down so significantly, Ford Motor Company has earned a profit in the automotive sector, improved revenue, accelerated cost reductions and generated positive operating cash flow, showing that we are staying clearly focused on our goals. Our task is to continue to deliver on our objectives throughout the remainder of 2003 and beyond."
 
Ford expects to earn about 10 cents a share in the second quarter of 2003, which would result in first-half 2003 earnings of about 55 cents a share.
