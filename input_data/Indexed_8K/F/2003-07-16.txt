     Exhibits 99.1, 99.8 and 99.9 to this report contain certain "non-GAAP financial measures" as defined in Item 10 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The non-GAAP financial measures cover cost performance, net pricing, operating cash flows, and managed leverage and credit loss ratios at our Ford Motor Credit Company ("Ford Credit") subsidiary. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures is discussed below, including the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States ("GAAP") and the reasons why we believe the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to our investors.
      Slides 1 and 4 of Exhibit 99.8 indicate that we have achieved $1.3 billion in cost performance improvement for the second quarter of 2003. Exhibit 99.1, slides 15 and 16 of Exhibit 99.8 and slide 2 of Exhibit 99.9 indicate that we have achieved $1.9 billion in cost performance improvement for the first half of 2003. Slides 15 through 17 of Exhibit 99.8 indicate that we expect to achieve $2.5 billion in cost performance improvement for the full year 2003. Slide 15 of Exhibit 99.8 and slide 2 of Exhibit 99.9 indicate that we have a milestone to improve automotive cost performance by at least $500 million in 2003 over 2002. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP to this cost performance measure is Cost of Sales and Selling, Administrative and Other Expense. The appendix (page 7 of 12) to Exhibit 99.8 contains a reconciliation of our non-GAAP cost performance financial measure to changes in Cost of Sales and Selling, Administrative and Other Expense. Cost of Sales and Selling, Administrative and Other Expense decreased by $0.4 billion in the second quarter of 2003, compared with the first quarter of 2002 and increased $0.8 billion in the first half of 2003, compared with the first half of 2002. We believe that the use of the non-GAAP cost performance measure is useful to investors because it shows changes in our costs excluding the effects of changes that we do not directly control, such as our production volume, mix of products produced or foreign currency exchange rates. On this basis, we and our investors are able to determine whether or not our underlying cost structure is improving.
Cost Performance.
      Slide 15 of Exhibit 99.8 and slide 2 of Exhibit 99.9 state that our milestones are based, in part, on net pricing planning assumptions for 2003 of zero (base) and less than zero (full year outlook) in the United States (for Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brand vehicles) and 1% (base) and less than zero (full year outlook) in Europe (for Ford brand vehicles), in each case at constant volume, mix and foreign currency exchange rates, compared to 2002. These slides further indicate changes in net pricing of negative 1.2% and negative 2.0% in the United States and Europe, respectively, in the first half of 2003. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP to this net pricing measure is the period-over-period change in Automotive Sales. The period-over-period change in Automotive Sales is affected by changes in unit sales volume, product mix, foreign currency exchange rates, wholesale prices
Net Pricing.

for vehicles sold and marketing incentives. The net pricing measure (which measures the combined effect of changes in wholesale prices and marketing incentives, while excluding the effects of changes in unit sales volumes, product mix, and foreign currency exchange rates) is useful to investors because it provides an indication of the underlying direction of changes in revenue in one performance measure. The change in Automotive Sales on a per unit basis in the first half of 2003 compared with the first half of 2002 was an increase of 3.3% for the United States and an increase of 7.5% for Europe. The appendix (page 5 of 12) to Exhibit 99.8 contains a reconciliation of the change in net pricing in the first half of 2003 compared with the first half of 2002 to the change in Automotive Sales for the same periods.
      Slides 2 and 14 of Exhibit 99.8 discuss our operating-related cash flows for the second quarter and first half of 2003, and slide 15 of Exhibit 99.8 and slide 2 of Exhibit 99.9 discuss our milestone for operating-related cash flow for 2003. Slides 2 and 14 of Exhibit 99.8 indicate that we had positive operating cash flow of $1.6 billion for the second quarter 2003. Slides 2, 14 and 15 of Exhibit 99.8 and slide 2 of Exhibit 99.9 indicate that we had positive operating cash flow of $2.2 billion ($3.1 billion including tax refunds) for the first half of 2003. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP to this cash flow measure is Cash Flows from Operating Activities Before Securities Trading. The appendix (page 12 of 12) to Exhibit 99.8 contains a reconciliation of our non-GAAP operating cash flow measure and Cash Flows from Operating Activities Before Securities Trading. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Before Securities Trading was $2.7 billion for second quarter 2003 and $5.7 billion for the first half of 2003. We believe the non-GAAP operating cash flow measure is useful to investors because it includes cash flow elements not included in Cash Flows from Operating Activities Before Securities Trading that we consider to be related to our operating activities (for example, capital spending). As a result, our operating cash flow measure provides investors with a more relevant measure of the net cash generated by our operations.
Operating Cash Flows.
      Slides 13 and 15 of Exhibit 99.8 and slides 2, 4 and 14 of Exhibit 99.9 discuss Ford Credit's leverage (i.e., debt-to-equity ratio) on both a financial statement and managed basis. Financial statement leverage is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP to our non-GAAP managed leverage financial measure. The appendix (pages 8 through 10 of 12) to Exhibit 99.8 contains a reconciliation of Ford Credit's non-GAAP managed leverage measure to its financial statement leverage. These slides indicate that Ford Credit's financial statement and managed leverage at June 30, 2003 were 11.3 and 12.9 to 1, respectively. Slide 15 of Exhibit 99.8 and slide 2 of Exhibit 99.9 indicate that Ford Credit has a milestone to maintain managed leverage in the low end of 13-14 to 1 range. We believe that the use of the non-GAAP managed leverage measure, which is the result of several adjustments to Ford Credit's financial statement leverage, is useful to our investors because it reflects the way Ford Credit manages its business. Ford Credit retains interests in receivables sold in securitization transactions, and, with respect to subordinated retained interests, has credit risk. Accordingly, it considers securitization as an alternative source of funding and evaluates credit losses, receivables and leverage on a managed as well as a financial statement basis. As a result, the managed leverage measure provides our investors with meaningful information regarding management's decision-making processes.
Managed Leverage.
Table of Contents
     In calculating its managed leverage ratio, Ford Credit adds the total amount of receivables sold in securitizations, net of retained interests, to its debt. It also deducts cash and cash equivalents because these generally correspond to excess debt beyond the amount required to support Ford Credit's financing operations. It adds minority interests to equity because all of the debt of such consolidated entities is included in total debt. It excludes the impact of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 in both the numerator and the denominator in order to exclude the interim effects in changes in market rates because Ford Credit generally repays its debt funding obligations as they mature.
      Slide 13 of Exhibit 99.8 and slides 4 and 5 of Exhibit 99.9 discuss Ford Credit's loss to receivables ratios on an "on-balance sheet" and a managed basis. Slide 13 of Exhibit 99.8 and slides 4 and 5 of Exhibit 99.9 indicate that Ford Credit's total on-balance sheet credit loss ratio was 1.50% (including credit losses on reacquired receivables) and was 1.44% (excluding credit losses on reacquired receivables) for the second quarter 2003. Slide 5 of Exhibit 99.9 indicates that Ford Credit's on-balance sheet credit loss ratio for its U.S. retail and lease segment was 1.82% (including credit losses on reacquired receivables) and was 1.70% (excluding credit losses on reacquired receivables) for the same period. A loss-to-receivables ratio equals net credit losses divided by the average amount of net receivables outstanding for the period. The receivables that were reacquired in the second quarter of 2003 are those of FCAR Owner Trust ("FCAR"), an entity integral to a Ford Credit asset-backed commercial paper program. FCAR was consolidated for financial statement purposes with Ford Credit in the second quarter of 2003. The financial measure that is most directly comparable to these loss-to-receivables ratios and that is calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is the on-balance sheet credit loss ratio excluding losses on the reacquired FCAR receivables, which GAAP-based ratio is disclosed in a footnote to the slides referred to above. We believe that the use of the non-GAAP on-balance sheet credit loss ratio is useful to our investors because it provides a more complete representation of our actual on-balance sheet loss performance.
Loss-to-Receivables Ratio.

IMMEDIATE RELEASE
DEARBORN, Mich., July 16  Ford Motor Company [NYSE: F] today reported net income of $417 million, or 22 cents a share, for the second quarter of 2003.
This compares with net income of $570 million, or 29 cents a share, in the second quarter of 2002.
Ford had pre-tax profits of $718 million during the second quarter of 2003, compared with pre-tax profits of $1 billion in the second quarter of 2002.
During the first half of 2003, Ford had pre-tax profits of $2.1 billion, compared with pre-tax profits of $1 billion during the same period a year ago.
 
Second quarter 2003 revenue declined to $40.7 billion from $42.2 billion in the second quarter of 2002. Worldwide vehicle unit sales in the 2003 second quarter were 1,717,000, down about 7 percent from 1,854,000 a year ago.
"Our second quarter financial performance and our achievements in the past 18 months since we announced our Revitalization Plan demonstrate that we are delivering the results that are needed to keep the company solidly on track," said Bill Ford, chairman and CEO. "We remain committed to our product-led Revitalization Plan, and we are moving ahead as promised with an exciting lineup of new vehicles coming to market  the first of which is the new Ford F-150 pickup, arriving in dealerships very soon."
AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR
On a pre-tax basis, Ford's worldwide automotive sector reported a profit of $3 million during the second quarter of 2003, compared with earnings of $403 million a year ago.
Worldwide automotive revenue declined by $1 billion from $35.2 billion during the second quarter of 2002 to $34.2 billion in the second quarter of 2003.
Automotive cash, marketable securities, loaned securities and Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association (VEBA) assets at June 30 rose to $28.7 billion, up from $26.6 billion at the end of the first quarter, and up from $25.3 billion at the end of 2002.
NORTH AMERICA AUTOMOTIVE
North America Automotive reported a profit of $445 million on a pre-tax basis, compared with a pre-tax profit of $921 million in the second quarter of 2002. The decline reflected lower production volume and lower net pricing, offset partially by strong cost performance.
North America Automotive revenue in the second quarter of 2003 was $20.7 billion, down about 10 percent from $23.1 billion in the second quarter of 2002. North America vehicle unit sales were down 12.5 percent in the second quarter of 2003 when compared with the second quarter of 2002.
 
INTERNATIONAL AUTOMOTIVE
The 2003 second-quarter pre-tax loss for International Automotive was $411 million, compared with a loss of $371 million during the second quarter of 2002.
Second-quarter 2003 revenue for International Automotive increased to $13.5 billion, compared with $11.8 billion during the second quarter last year.
Ford Europe incurred a pre-tax loss of $525 million in the second quarter of 2003, compared with a pre-tax loss of $18 million during the same period a year ago. The decline in earnings is primarily explained by lower net pricing, unfavorable mix, lower industry volume and dealer stock reductions, offset partially by improved cost performance and market share. Ford Europe's revenue in the second quarter rose 6 percent to $5.2 billion, compared with $4.9 billion during the second quarter of 2002.
Ford Europe:
The pre-tax loss for Ford South America narrowed to $69 million during the second quarter from a loss of $198 million during the second quarter a year ago, primarily reflecting favorable exchange (largely the non-recurrence of currency devaluation a year ago), improved net pricing and market share. Revenue in South America was $435 million in the second quarter, compared with $426 million in the second quarter of 2002.
Ford South America:
During the second quarter of 2003, Ford Asia-Pacific incurred a pre-tax loss of $28 million, compared with a pre-tax loss of $53 million in the 2002 second quarter. The improvement reflected favorable net pricing and the successful launch of the new Australian Falcon. Revenue rose to $1.4 billion, compared with $1.0 billion during the second quarter of 2002.
Ford Asia-Pacific:
PAG reported pre-tax earnings of $166 million in the second quarter of 2003, compared with a pre-tax loss of $122 million during the second quarter of 2002. PAG benefited from both cost and revenue improvements, with growing market acceptance of the Volvo XC90 and the recently introduced Jaguar XJ. Second-quarter revenue for PAG was $6.4 billion, up from $5.5 billion a year ago.
Premier Automotive Group (PAG):
 
FORD CREDIT
Ford Motor Credit Company reported net income of $401 million in the second quarter of 2003, up $71 million from earnings of $330 million in the same period a year earlier. On a pre-tax basis, Ford Credit earned $661 million in the second quarter of 2003 compared with $519 million in the second quarter of 2002. The increase in earnings primarily reflects higher income related to securitizations and a lower provision for credit losses, offset partially by the impact of lower receivables.
HERTZ
Hertz reported pre-tax earnings of $57 million in the second quarter, compared with $72 million during the same period a year ago. Strong cost performance was more than offset by unfavorable pricing and lower volume.
OUTLOOK
"Once again, we have proven that we are committed to our financial milestones," said Allan Gilmour, vice chairman. "We continue to surpass our cost performance targets, and we continue to strengthen the balance sheet. We are focused on achieving our goals and are working through the significant challenges we face during the second half of the year and 2004."
Ford expects a loss of about 15 cents a share in the third quarter of 2003. This expectation reflects lower planned production volumes in the third quarter. The company remains committed to its full year earnings guidance of 70 cents a share. These guidance figures do not include adverse effects that are likely to occur from the adoption in the third quarter of a new accounting standard (Financial Interpretation 46), which requires consolidation of certain entities that were previously unconsolidated.
