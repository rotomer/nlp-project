     Exhibits 99.1, 99.8 and 99.9 to this report contain certain "non-GAAP financial measures" as defined in Item 10 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The non-GAAP financial measures cover net pricing and operating cash flows in respect of our Automotive sector, and managed leverage and credit loss ratios in respect of our subsidiary, Ford Motor Credit Company ("Ford Credit"). Each of these non-GAAP financial measures is discussed below, including the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States ("GAAP") and the reasons why we believe the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to our investors.
     Slide 18 of Exhibit 99.8 and slide 2 of Exhibit 99.9 state that our milestones are based, in part, on net pricing planning assumptions for 2003 of zero (base) and less than zero (full year outlook) in the United States (for Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brand vehicles) and 1% (base) and negative 1 to 2% (full year outlook) in Europe (for Ford brand vehicles), in each case at constant volume, mix and exchange rates, compared to 2002. These slides further indicate changes in net pricing of negative 0.9% and negative 1.9% in the United States and Europe, respectively, in the third quarter of 2003. Slide 6 of Exhibit 99.8 indicates that net pricing was negative $100 million in the third quarter of 2003. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP to this net pricing measure is the period-over-period change in Automotive Sales. The period-over-period change in Automotive Sales is affected by changes in unit sales volume, product mix, foreign currency exchange rates, wholesale prices for vehicles sold and marketing incentives. The net pricing measure (which measures the combined effect of changes in wholesale prices and marketing incentives, while excluding the effects of changes in unit sales volumes, product mix, and foreign currency exchange rates) is useful to investors because it provides an indication of the underlying direction of changes in revenue in one performance measure. The change in Automotive Sales on a per unit basis in the third quarter of 2003 compared with the third quarter of 2002 was an increase of 7.1% for North America and an increase of 16.2% for Europe. The appendix (page 6 of 14) to Exhibit 99.8 contains a reconciliation of the change in net pricing in the third quarter of 2003 compared with the third quarter of 2002 to the change in Automotive Sales for the same periods.
Net Pricing.
     Slides 2 and 17 of Exhibit 99.8 and slide 1 of Exhibit 99.9 discuss our operating-related cash flows for the third quarter of 2003, and slide 18 of Exhibit 99.8 and slide 2 of Exhibit 99.9 discuss our milestone for operating-related cash flow for 2003. Slides 2 and 17 of Exhibit 99.8 and slide 1 of Exhibit 99.9 indicate that we had negative operating cash flow of $2.4 billion for the third quarter 2003. Slides 2, 17 and 18 of Exhibit 99.8 and slides 1 and 2 of Exhibit 99.9 indicate that we had negative operating cash flow of $100 million for the first three quarters of 2003. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP to this cash flow measure is Cash Flows from Operating Activities Before Securities Trading. The appendix (pages 13 and 14 of 14) to
Operating Cash Flows.
Table of Contents
Exhibit 99.8 contains a reconciliation of our non-GAAP operating cash flow measure and Cash Flows from Operating Activities Before Securities Trading. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Before Securities Trading was negative $900 million for third quarter 2003 and $4.9 billion for the first three quarters of 2003. We believe the non-GAAP operating cash flow measure is useful to investors because it includes cash flow elements not included in Cash Flows from Operating Activities Before Securities Trading that we consider to be related to our operating activities (for example, capital spending). As a result, our operating cash flow measure provides investors with a more relevant measure of the cash generated by our operations.
     Slide 18 and pages 9 through 12 of the appendix to Exhibit 99.8 and slides 2, 3 and 13 of Exhibit 99.9 discuss Ford Credit's leverage (i.e., debt-to-equity ratio) on both a financial statement and managed basis. Financial statement leverage is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP to our non-GAAP managed leverage financial measure. The appendix (pages 9 through 12 of 14) to Exhibit 99.8 also contains a reconciliation of Ford Credit's non-GAAP managed leverage measure to its financial statement leverage. These slides indicate that Ford Credit's financial statement and managed leverage at September 30, 2003 were 12.0 and 12.7 to 1, respectively. Slide 18 of Exhibit 99.8 and slide 2 of Exhibit 99.9 indicate that Ford Credit has a milestone to maintain managed leverage in the low end of 13-14 to 1 range. We believe that the use of the non-GAAP managed leverage measure, which is the result of several adjustments to Ford Credit's financial statement leverage, is useful to our investors because it reflects the way Ford Credit manages its business. Ford Credit retains interests in receivables sold in off-balance sheet securitization transactions, and, with respect to subordinated retained interests, has credit risk. Accordingly, it considers securitization as an alternative source of funding and evaluates credit losses, receivables and leverage on a managed as well as a financial statement basis. As a result, the managed leverage measure provides our investors with meaningful information regarding management's decision-making processes.
Managed Leverage.
     In calculating its managed leverage ratio, Ford Credit adds the total amount of receivables sold in securitizations, net of retained interests, to its debt. It also deducts cash and cash equivalents because these generally correspond to excess debt beyond the amount required to support Ford Credit's financing operations. It adds minority interests to equity because all of the debt of such consolidated entities is included in total debt. It excludes the impact of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 in both the numerator and the denominator in order to exclude the interim effects of changes in market rates because Ford Credit generally repays its debt funding obligations as they mature.
     . The appendix (page 9 of 14) to Exhibit 99.8 and slides 3 and 4 of Exhibit 99.9 discuss Ford Credit's loss to receivables ratios on an "on-balance sheet" and a managed basis. The appendix (page 9 of 14) to Exhibit 99.8 and slides 3 and 4 of Exhibit 99.9 indicate that Ford Credit's total on-balance sheet credit loss ratio was 1.52% (including credit losses on reacquired receivables) and was 1.40% (excluding credit losses on reacquired receivables) in the third quarter of 2003. Slide 4 of Exhibit 99.9 indicates that Ford Credit's on-balance sheet credit loss ratio for its U.S. retail and lease segment was 1.80% (including credit losses on reacquired receivables) and was 1.59% (excluding credit losses on reacquired receivables) for the same period. A loss-to-receivables ratio equals net credit losses divided by the average amount of net receivables outstanding for the period. The receivables that were
Loss-to-Receivables Ratio

reacquired in the second quarter of 2003 are those of FCAR Owner Trust ("FCAR"), an entity integral to a Ford Credit asset-backed commercial paper program. FCAR was consolidated for financial statement purposes with Ford Credit in the second quarter of 2003. The financial measure that is most directly comparable to these loss-to-receivables ratios and that is calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is the on-balance sheet credit loss ratio excluding losses on the reacquired FCAR receivables, which GAAP-based ratio is disclosed in a footnote to the slides referred to above. We believe that the use of the non-GAAP on-balance sheet credit loss ratio is useful to our investors because it provides a more complete representation of our actual on-balance sheet credit loss experience.
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized on the date indicated.

NEWS
IMMEDIATE RELEASE
FORD ANNOUNCES THIRD-QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS
DEARBORN, Mich., Oct. 16  Ford Motor Company [NYSE: F] today reported a net loss of $25 million, or 1 cent per share, for the third quarter of 2003. This compares with a net loss of $326 million, or 18 cents per share, in the third quarter of 2002.
The 2003 third-quarter net income includes the effects of adopting a new accounting standard (Financial Interpretation 46), which revises U.S. GAAP consolidation requirements, resulting in a change in accounting treatment of several entities. The adoption of the standard reduced third-quarter net income by $264 million, or 14 cents per share.
Earnings from continuing operations, before the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principles related to FIN 46, were $237 million, or 13 cents per share, compared with a loss of $244 million, or 14 cents per share, in the third quarter of 2002.
 
Ford recently announced restructuring actions related to Ford Europe that include personnel reductions in the United Kingdom, Germany and a shift removal in Genk, Belgium. The company incurred a charge of $56 million for a portion of these actions in the third quarter of 2003. Charges of between $550 million and $600 million for the balance of these actions are expected to be incurred, primarily in the fourth quarter of 2003.
Excluding the $56 million third-quarter charge, Ford's third-quarter earnings from continuing operations were 15 cents per share. This result exceeds the First Call consensus estimate of analysts, which projected a loss of 11 cents per share.
Ford's third-quarter 2003 total revenue declined to $36.9 billion from $39.3 billion in the year-ago period, primarily reflecting lower vehicle unit sales.
"We continue to make significant progress on cutting costs, building relationships and launching great products," said Bill Ford, chairman and chief executive officer. "Our successful UAW negotiations, coupled with sales records set in September by F-Series and Volvo in the U.S. and Jaguar worldwide, make it clear that Ford Motor Company is moving in the right direction. During the next year alone, we will launch 40 new products across all of our vehicle brands to consumers worldwide."
AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR
On a pre-tax basis, Ford's worldwide automotive sector reported a loss of $609 million during the third quarter of 2003, compared with a loss of $618 million a year ago. Excluding the $56 million restructuring charge in Ford Europe, third-quarter results were a loss of $553 million.
Worldwide automotive revenue for the third quarter declined 6.5 percent, or $2.1 billion, to $30.3 billion during the third quarter of 2003. Worldwide vehicle-unit sales in the quarter were 1,410,000, down from 1,656,000 units in the 2002 third quarter.
 
Automotive cash, marketable securities, loaned securities and Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association (VEBA) assets on Sept. 30 were $26.9 billion, down from $28.7 billion at the end of the second quarter, and up from $25.3 billion at the end of 2002.
NORTH AMERICA AUTOMOTIVE
North America Automotive reported a loss of $116 million on a pre-tax basis, compared with a pre-tax profit of $591 million in the third quarter of 2002. The decline primarily reflects lower market share and a planned reduction in dealer stocks, related primarily to the F-150, Freestar and Monterey changeovers. Favorable cost performance and product mix were partial offsets.
North America Automotive revenue in the third quarter was $17.9 billion, down from $21.3 billion in the 2002 third quarter, primarily reflecting lower sales volume, partially offset by improved product mix.
INTERNATIONAL AUTOMOTIVE
The 2003 third-quarter pre-tax loss for International Automotive was $494 million, compared with a loss of $714 million for the year-ago period.
Ford Europe incurred a pre-tax loss of $452 million in the third quarter, compared with a pre-tax loss of $246 million during the 2002 period. The decline primarily reflects a planned reduction in dealer stocks; unfavorable net pricing, product mix and exchange rates; and the restructuring charge of $56 million discussed above, partially offset by cost improvements. Ford Europe's revenue in the third quarter was $4.7 billion, compared with $4.4 billion during the third quarter of 2002.
Ford Europe:
The pre-tax loss for Ford South America narrowed to $26 million during the third quarter from a loss of $243 million during the year-ago period, primarily reflecting favorable exchange rates as well as improved net pricing and market share. Third-quarter revenue in South America rose to $500 million, compared with $400 million in the third quarter of 2002.
Ford South America:
 
During the third quarter of 2003, Ford Asia-Pacific reported a pre-tax profit of $1 million, compared with a pre-tax loss of $49 million in the same period last year. The improvement reflected higher industry volumes and market share as well as favorable exchange rates, partially offset by higher development costs for new products. Revenue rose to $1.6 billion, compared with $1.1 billion during the third quarter of 2002.
Ford Asia-Pacific:
PAG reported a pre-tax loss of $22 million for the third quarter, compared with a pre-tax loss of $160 million for the third quarter of 2002. PAG's improvement reflected favorable vehicle mix and lower costs, partially offset by unfavorable exchange rates. Third-quarter revenue for PAG was $5.6 billion, compared with $4.9 billion a year ago.
Premier Automotive Group (PAG):
FORD CREDIT
Ford Motor Credit Company reported record net income of $504 million for the third quarter of 2003, up $210 million from earnings of $294 million in the same period a year earlier. On a pre-tax basis, Ford Credit earned $809 million in the third quarter of 2003 compared with $460 million in the third quarter of 2002. The increase in earnings primarily reflected a lower provision for credit losses, the favorable impact of the interest rate environment on borrowing costs, and the favorable market valuation of derivative instruments.
HERTZ
Hertz reported pre-tax earnings of $186 million in the third quarter, compared with $160 million during the same period a year ago. The result is attributable to strong cost performance and higher rental volumes, partially offset by lower pricing.
OUTLOOK
"Despite increasing competitive pressures in the U.S. and Europe, we remain committed to achieving at least automotive pre-tax breakeven, excluding special items. This commitment reflects continued progress in reducing costs and the growing acceptance of our new products," said Don Leclair, chief financial officer.
 
Based on continued strong performance in the financial services group, Ford is revising its full-year earnings guidance from $0.70 per share to $0.95 to $1.05 per share, based on income from continuing operations, excluding special items.
