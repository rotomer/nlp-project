IMMEDIATE RELEASE - ----------------- FORD SETS 2004 FINANCIAL MILESTONES - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- o Ford anticipates increased profit for 2004 to a range of $1.20 to $1.30 per share, or total company pre-tax profit of $3.5 to $3.8 billion, excluding special items. o Total automotive pre-tax profit, excluding special items, is targeted in the range of $900 million to $1.1 billion for 2004. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- DEARBORN, Mich., Jan. 9 - Ford Motor Company today announced financial milestones for 2004 that call for an increase in the company's overall earnings as new product launches and operational improvements drive growth in profitability. Based on goals that include quality improvements throughout all company operations, regional market share stability or gains, and continued cost savings, the company said it anticipates full-year 2004 earnings per share of $1.20 to $1.30, excluding special items, which equates to total company pre-tax profit of $3.5 to $3.8 billion. "Over the past two years, Ford has consistently delivered on financial commitments and exceeded earnings estimates and profit targets," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Bill Ford. "This progress has given us tremendous momentum and is only the beginning. In 2004 we will continue to accelerate our efforts, improving both automotive and overall corporate profits." To achieve profit growth in 2004, the company is targeting total automotive pre-tax profits in the range of $900 million to $1.1 billion compared with an estimate of slightly better than breakeven for 2003, in each case excluding special items. The improvement from 2003 primarily reflects significantly improved results at Ford Europe and PAG.
2 Achievement of these goals will move Ford closer to meeting its mid-decade annual pre-tax profit goal of $7 billion, excluding special items, which was announced in January 2002. Bill Ford and his management team outlined the business outlook and financial milestones for 2004 in a presentation today to the investment community.
3 "Our 2004 milestones reflect our commitment to a solidly profitable business," said Chief Financial Officer Don Leclair. "By building on the basics, we will continue to reduce our operating costs and improve our quality, while launching great products that establish Ford as an industry leader." Ford Motor Company, headquartered in Dearborn, Mich., is the world's second largest automaker, with approximately 335,000 employees in 200 markets on six continents.
