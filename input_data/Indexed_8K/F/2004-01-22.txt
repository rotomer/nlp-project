     Exhibits 99.1, 99.8 and 99.9 to this report contain certain "non-GAAP financial measures" as defined in Item 10 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The non-GAAP financial measures include financial results excluding special items, net pricing and operating cash flows in respect of our Automotive sector, and managed leverage and credit loss ratios in respect of our subsidiary, Ford Motor Credit Company ("Ford Credit"). Each of these non-GAAP financial measures is discussed below, including the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States ("GAAP") and the reasons why we believe the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to our investors.
     The exhibits discuss our operating-related cash flows before contributions to trusts to fund pension and health care obligations and before tax refunds for the fourth quarter and full year 2003 and our milestone for operating-related cash flow for 2004. The exhibits indicate that we had positive operating cash flow before contributions and tax refunds of $1.5 billion for the fourth quarter and about $100 million for the full year 2003. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP to this cash flow measure is Cash Flows from Operating Activities Before Securities Trading. Slide 22 of Exhibit 99.8 and the appendix (page 17 of 17) to Exhibit 99.8 combine to provide a reconciliation of our non-GAAP operating cash flow measure and Cash Flows from Operating Activities Before Securities Trading. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Before Securities Trading was negative $3.5 billion for fourth quarter and positive $1.3 billion for the full year 2003. We believe the non-GAAP operating cash flow before contributions and tax refunds measure is useful to investors because it includes cash flow elements not included in Cash Flows from Operating Activities Before Securities Trading that we consider to be related to our operating activities (for example, capital spending). As a result, our operating cash flow measure provides investors with a more relevant measure of the cash generated by our operations.
Operating Cash Flows.
     The exhibits indicate that our 2003 milestones were based, in part, on net pricing planning assumptions for 2003 of zero in the United States (for Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brand vehicles) and 1% in Europe (for Ford brand vehicles), in each case at constant volume, mix and exchange rates, compared to 2002. The exhibits further indicate changes in net pricing for the full year 2003 were negative 0.6% and negative 1.7% in the United States and Europe, respectively. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP to this net pricing measure is the period-over-period change in Automotive Sales. The period-over-period change in Automotive Sales is affected by changes in unit sales volume, product mix, foreign exchange rates, wholesale prices for vehicles sold and marketing incentives. The net pricing measure (which measures the combined effect of changes in wholesale prices and marketing incentives, while excluding the effects of changes in unit sales volumes, product mix, and foreign exchange rates) is useful to
Net Pricing.

investors because it provides an indication of the underlying direction of changes in revenue in one performance measure. The change in Automotive Sales on a per unit basis for the full year 2003 compared with 2002 was an increase of 4.4% for North America and an increase of 15.0% for Europe. The appendix (page 9 of 17) to Exhibit 99.8 contains a reconciliation of the change in net pricing in 2003 compared with 2002 to the change in Automotive Sales for the same periods.
     The exhibits discuss the fourth quarter and full year 2003 pre-tax profits excluding special items for our Automotive Sector and each of our primary operating segments within the Automotive sector. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP to this measure is pre-tax profits including the special items. We believe that pre-tax profits excluding special items is useful to investors because it excludes elements that we do not consider to be indicative of our on-going operating activities (for example, the effect of recent agreements with Visteon Corporation). As a result, pre-tax profits excluding special items provides investors with a more relevant measure of the results generated by our operations. Slide 4 of Exhibit 99.8 includes a list of the special items and the impact of each on our fourth quarter and full year 2003 results. The tables below set forth the pre-tax profits for our Automotive Sector and each of our operating segments within the Automotive sector both excluding and including the special items for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively.
Financial Results Excluding Special Items.

     The exhibits discuss Ford Credit's leverage (i.e., debt-to-equity ratio) on both a financial statement and managed basis. Financial statement leverage is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP to our non-GAAP managed leverage financial measure. The appendices to the exhibits contain a reconciliation of Ford Credit's non-GAAP managed leverage measure to its financial statement leverage. The exhibits indicate that Ford Credit's financial statement and managed leverage at December 31, 2003 were 12.0 and 13.0 to 1, respectively. We believe that the use of the non-GAAP managed leverage measure, which is the result of several adjustments to Ford Credit's financial statement leverage, is useful to our investors because it reflects the way Ford Credit manages its business. Ford Credit retains interests in receivables sold in off-balance sheet securitization transactions, and, with respect to subordinated retained interests, has credit risk. Accordingly, it considers securitization as an alternative source of funding and evaluates credit losses, receivables and leverage on a managed as well as a financial statement basis. As a result, the managed leverage measure provides our investors with meaningful information regarding management's decision-making processes.
Managed Leverage.
     In calculating its managed leverage ratio, Ford Credit adds the total amount of receivables sold in off-balance sheet securitizations, net of retained interests, to its debt. It also deducts cash and cash equivalents because these generally correspond to excess debt beyond the amount required to support Ford Credit's financing operations. It adds minority interests to equity because all of the debt of such consolidated entities is included in total debt. It excludes the impact of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 in both the numerator and the denominator in order to exclude the interim effects of changes in market rates because Ford Credit generally repays its debt funding obligations as they mature.

     . The exhibits discuss Ford Credit's loss to receivables ratios on an "on-balance sheet" and a managed basis. The exhibits indicate that Ford Credit's total on-balance sheet credit loss ratio was 1.67% (including credit losses on reacquired receivables) and was 1.60% (excluding credit losses on reacquired receivables) for the full year 2003. The exhibits further indicate that Ford Credit's on-balance sheet credit loss ratio for its U.S. retail and lease business was 2.18% (including credit losses on reacquired receivables) and was 1.98% (excluding credit losses on reacquired receivables) for the fourth quarter 2003. A loss-to-receivables ratio equals net credit losses divided by the average amount of net receivables outstanding for the period. The receivables that were reacquired in the second quarter of 2003 are those of FCAR Owner Trust ("FCAR"), an entity integral to a Ford Credit asset-backed commercial paper program. FCAR was consolidated for financial statement purposes with Ford Credit in the second quarter of 2003. The financial measure that is most directly comparable to these loss-to-receivables ratios and that is calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is the on-balance sheet credit loss ratio excluding losses on the reacquired FCAR receivables. We believe that the use of the non-GAAP on-balance sheet credit loss ratio is useful to our investors because it provides a more complete representation of our actual on-balance sheet credit loss experience.

DEARBORN, Mich., Jan. 22  Ford Motor Company [NYSE: F] today reported full-year 2003 net income of $495 million, or 27 cents per share. This compares with a net loss of $980 million, or 55 cents per share, for full-year 2002.
Excluding special items, Ford's full-year earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.14. This result exceeded the full-year guidance of $1.05 to $1.10 per share and the comparable year-ago result of 56 cents per share.
"We have dramatically improved our profitability, beaten Wall Street's expectations for eight consecutive quarters, and moved closer to achieving our mid-decade goals," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Bill Ford. "As this month's North American International Auto Show demonstrated, we have the right products and strategy to achieve our 2004 milestones."
 
The following table reconciles the impact of special items, changes in accounting principle and discontinued operations for fourth-quarter and full-year earnings.
Including special items, Ford's 2003 pre-tax profit totaled $1.4 billion, an increase from $951 million in 2002. Ford's 2003 pre-tax profit, excluding special items, increased to $3.4 billion from $1.9 billion in 2002. Following are 2003 special items, presented on a pre-tax basis:

Ford's 2003 accomplishments included:
* Pre-tax profits, excluding special items. ** At constant volume, mix and exchange; excluding special items.
Looking ahead, Ford Motor Company will introduce 40 new products worldwide in 2004. Key introductions include Ford Freestyle, Five Hundred and Mustang; Mercury Montego; Jaguar S-TYPE; Aston Martin DB9 coupe; Volvo V50; and the world's first, no-compromise, full hybrid, the Ford Escape Hybrid.
Ford reported a net loss of $793 million, or 43 cents per share, for the fourth quarter of 2003. This compares with a net loss of $130 million, or 7 cents per share, for the fourth quarter of 2002.

AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR
The following is a discussion of fourth-quarter and full-year pre-tax results by our automotive operations excluding special items. Reconciliation to pre-tax U.S. GAAP results follows at the end of this document.
For the full year, Ford's worldwide automotive sector earned a pre-tax profit of $104 million in 2003, a $357 million improvement from a loss of $253 million a year ago.
For the fourth quarter, Ford's worldwide automotive operations reported a pre-tax loss of $4 million, a $236 million improvement from a year-ago loss of $240 million.
Automotive revenue for full-year 2003 was $138.4 billion, up three percent from $134.3 billion a year ago. Automotive revenue for the fourth quarter was $39.8 billion, up from $34.6 billion a year ago.
Automotive gross cash at Dec. 31, 2003 totaled $25.9 billion of cash, marketable and loaned securities and short-term VEBA.
The Americas, which includes the company's automotive operations in North and South America, reported a 2003 pre-tax profit of $1.6 billion, down $236 million from 2002.
THE AMERICAS
For the fourth quarter, the Americas reported a pre-tax profit of $193 million, compared with a pre-tax profit of $417 million in 2002.
Ford's North America operations posted a full-year 2003 pre-tax profit of $1.8 billion, compared with $2.5 billion last year. The decline was primarily due to the absence of an increase in dealer stocks in 2002, unfavorable net pricing, lower market share and unfavorable exchange rates, partially offset by cost savings and favorable mix. Full-year revenue totaled $83.6 billion, down from $87.1 billion a year ago.
North America:
 
The North America automotive pre-tax profit for the fourth quarter was $197 million, down from $513 million a year ago. The decrease primarily reflected higher costs related to the introduction of new vehicles, higher pension and healthcare expenses, and unfavorable exchange rates, partially offset by cost reductions in other areas, improved mix and favorable net pricing. Revenue increased to $22.8 billion from $21.2 billion in the year-ago period.
Ford's South America operations reported a 2003 pre-tax loss of $130 million, a $492 million improvement from 2002. The improvement reflected the non-recurrence of currency devaluations in 2002, favorable mix, higher market share, improved net pricing and lower costs. Revenue was $1.9 billion, up $328 million from 2002.
South America:
For the fourth quarter, South America's automotive pre-tax loss totaled $4 million, a $92 million improvement from 2002. The improvement primarily reflected lower costs, favorable mix, higher market share and improved net pricing. Revenue increased to $623 million, compared to $335 million in the 2002 fourth quarter.
International automotive operations reported a full-year pre-tax loss of $905 million, a $575 million improvement from a 2002 loss of $1,480 million.
INTERNATIONAL AUTOMOTIVE
For the fourth quarter, International Automotive pre-tax profit totaled $172 million, an improvement of $624 million from a year-ago loss of $452 million.
Ford Europe's automotive operations reported a pre-tax loss of $1.1 billion for 2003, compared with a loss of $549 million a year ago. The decline primarily reflected unfavorable net pricing, adverse mix, unfavorable exchange rates, and a reduction in dealer stocks, partially offset by cost reductions. Full-year revenue totaled $22.2 billion, up from $18.9 billion a year ago.
Europe:
For the fourth quarter, Ford Europe reported a pre-tax profit of $60 million, an improvement of $77 million from a loss of $17 million a year ago. The improvement primarily reflected lower costs, improved results at Otosan, a joint venture in Turkey, and higher dealer stocks. These were offset by lower pricing, lower market share and unfavorable exchange. Fourth quarter revenue totaled $7.4 billion, an improvement of $1.8 billion over the year-ago period.
 
Ford's Asia Pacific automotive operations posted a loss of $25 million, an improvement of $151 million from a loss of $176 million in 2002. The improvement primarily reflected favorable exchange rates, improved net pricing, higher industry volumes in the region and improved market share. Revenue increased to $5.8 billion from $4.4 billion in 2002.
Ford Asia Pacific:
Asia Pacific's fourth-quarter pre-tax profit totaled $26 million, a $61 million improvement from a loss of $35 million in the year-ago period. The increase in profitability is primarily explained by favorable exchange rates and lower costs, partially offset by unfavorable net pricing. Revenue increased to $1.5 billion, compared with $1.3 billion in the 2002 fourth quarter.
PAG reported a pre-tax profit of $164 million for 2003, compared with a loss of $740 million last year. The improvement of $904 million primarily reflected cost reductions and improved mix, partially offset by unfavorable exchange rates. Revenue increased to $24.9 billion from $21.3 billion a year ago.
Premier Automotive Group:
PAG's fourth-quarter pre-tax profit totaled $108 million, a $496 million improvement from a year-earlier loss of $388 million. The improvement primarily reflected cost efficiencies and favorable volume and mix, partially offset by unfavorable exchange rates. Revenue increased to $7.5 billion from $6 billion in the year-ago period.
Ford Motor Credit Company reported record net income of $1.8 billion in 2003, up $583 million from earnings of $1.2 billion a year earlier. On a pre-tax basis, Ford Credit earned $3.0 billion in 2003 compared with $2.0 billion in 2002. The increase in earnings primarily reflected a lower provision for credit losses and the favorable market valuation of derivative instruments and associated exposures, partially offset by the impact of lower average net receivables.
FORD CREDIT
 
In the fourth quarter of 2003, Ford Credit's net income was $470 million, up $116 million from $354 million in the same period a year earlier. On a pre-tax basis, Ford Credit earned $839 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 compared with $594 million in 2002. The increase in earnings primarily reflected a lower provision for credit losses, the favorable market valuation of derivative instruments and associated exposures, offset partially by lower sales of receivables.
Hertz reported a full-year 2003 pre-tax profit of $228 million, up from $200 million in 2002. Hertz earned $44 million in the 2003 fourth quarter, up from a year-ago pre-tax profit of $27 million. The year-over-year improvements reflected strong cost performance and improved leisure demand, partially offset by lower pricing.
HERTZ
"Through sound execution of our plans, we have cut costs, introduced a variety of new products, significantly improved our international operations and improved overall quality," said Chief Financial Officer Don Leclair. "This gives us increasing confidence in our ability to achieve the bottom-line goals we've set for 2004."
OUTLOOK
Based on operational metrics that include continued quality improvements, regional market-share stability or gains, and continued cost reductions, the company expects full-year 2004 earnings per share of $1.20 to $1.30 from continuing operations, excluding special items. This outlook assumes 2004 industry sales of 17 million vehicles in the U.S. and 16.9 million vehicles in Europe.
Ford's first-quarter earnings guidance is a range of 40 to 45 cents per share, based on income from continuing operations, excluding special items.
