Sales of passenger cars were 92,580, down 17 percent and trucks were 194,801, down 3 percent. Year-to-date through June, the company's sales were 1.7 million, down 3 percent compared with the same period a year ago. Sales of trucks were 1.1 million, up 1 percent, and sales of passenger cars were 0.6 million, down 11 percent. Ford F-Series, America's best-selling vehicle, posted sales of 74,935, up 1 percent. June was the tenth month in a row of higher F-Series sales coinciding with the introduction of the new F-150 model. A new Super Duty model, built at Ford's Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville, will debut later this summer.
The Ford Escape, America's best-selling small sport utility vehicle, set another monthly record as June sales increased 11 percent to 16,314. Production of the Escape hybrid will begin in August at Ford's Kansas City Assembly Plant in Claycomo, Missouri. Business investment has made an important contribution to the current economic recovery and helped to increase sales of Ford's Econoline - America's best-selling full-size van. In June, Econoline sales increased 21 percent to 16,963. Although Volvo's June sales were down 3 percent, Volvo set a first half record as XC90 sales remained strong and the new S40 sedan gained traction in the U.S. market from younger buyers. The new V50 wagon has started to arrive at Volvo retailers. ###
