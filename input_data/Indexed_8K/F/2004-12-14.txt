He also will be eligible for the same post-retirement benefits, such as health care and life insurance on the same terms and conditions as other Company salaried employees retiring at the same time. He also will be eligible for two executive vehicles under the Executive Evaluation Vehicle Program, consistent with standard benefits under that program. In connection with his retirement arrangement, he agreed not to enter into any arrangement that would be competitive with the Company or any subsidiaries and to maintain confidentiality on all Company matters, refrain from engaging in inimical conduct toward the Company and assist in litigation on the Company's behalf. He also agreed to assist in the transfer of operations and responsibilities to Jim Padilla by January 28, 2005 and to resign from the Board of Directors and any charitable boards on which he participates on the Company's behalf.

During the term of the agreement, he will be reimbursed for customary and reasonable business-related expenses and travel that he is authorized to take, consistent with Company policies and procedures. During the term of the agreement, Mr. Scheele will be provided with an office and computer support when in Dearborn and will be provided travel support services by the Company in making aircraft travel arrangements in connection with services to be provided under the agreement. He will not be entitled to use the Company aircraft.
