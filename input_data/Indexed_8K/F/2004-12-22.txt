Item 2.06. Material Impairments.
     On December 20, 2004, Ford Motor Company determined charges are necessary for the impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets of held-for-sale operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The charges are the result of the Company's decision to divest its interest in certain consolidated dealerships of its Asia Pacific & Africa/Mazda segment of its Automotive sector within the next year, as market conditions warrant. The decision to divest was based on the Company's effort to build on the basics of and focus on its core business. The charges are estimated to range between $65 million and $85 million on a pre-tax basis. It is estimated that no cash expenditures will result from these impairment charges.
