Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

     Exhibits 99.1, 99.8 and 99.9 to this report contain certain "non-GAAP financial measures" as defined in Item 10 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The non-GAAP financial measures include the following: operating-related cash flow for Ford's Automotive sector, financial results that exclude special items, and managed leverage and loss-to-receivables ratios for our subsidiary, Ford Motor Credit Company ("Ford Credit"). Each of these non-GAAP financial measures is discussed below, along with the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States ("GAAP") and the reason we believe the presentation of each non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors.
     The exhibits hereto discuss operating-related cash flow before contributions to trusts (which fund pension and health care obligations) and before tax refunds for the fourth quarter and full year 2004. The exhibits also include a milestone for operating-related cash flow for 2004. These exhibits indicate that our Automotive sector had operating-related cash flow before contributions and tax refunds for the fourth quarter and for the full year 2004 of $1.5 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is Cash Flow from Operating Activities before Securities Trading for our Automotive sector. Slide 21 and the Appendix (pages 16 and 17) to Exhibit 99.8 combine to provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP operating-related cash flow to Cash Flow from Operating Activities before Securities Trading. Cash Flow from Operating Activities before Securities Trading for our Automotive sector netted to zero for the fourth quarter of 2004, and was $1.3 billion for the full year 2004.
Operating-Related Cash Flow
.
Table of Contents
     We believe that the non-GAAP measure of operating-related cash flow before contributions and tax refunds is useful to investors because it includes cash flow elements not included in the GAAP measure of Cash Flow from Operating Activities before Securities Trading for our Automotive sector which we consider to be related to operating activities (for example, capital spending). Consequently, operating-related cash flow provides investors with a more relevant measure of the cash generated by Ford's Automotive operations than the GAAP measure of Cash Flow from Operating Activities before Securities Trading.
     The exhibits hereto also discuss pre-tax profits for the fourth quarter and full year 2004 excluding special items for Ford's Automotive sector and each of the primary operating segments and business units within the Automotive sector. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is pre-tax profits including special items. Ford believes that pre-tax profits excluding special items is a useful measure to provide investors, because it excludes those items that Ford does not consider to be indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities. As a result, pre-tax profits excluding special items provides investors with a more relevant measure of the results generated by our operations. The fourth slide of Exhibit 99.8 includes a list of the special items and their impact on fourth quarter and full year 2004 results. The second page of the Appendix to Exhibit 99.8 demonstrates the impact of special items on results for the full year 2004. Additionally, the tables set forth below show the pre-tax profits for our Automotive sector for each of the operating segments and business units within our Automotive sector, and for our Financial Services sector (both including and excluding special items), for the fourth quarter and full year 2004

     The exhibits hereto also discuss Ford Credit's leverage (i.e., debt-to-equity ratio) on both a financial statement and managed basis. Financial statement leverage is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP to the non-GAAP managed leverage financial measure. The appendices to the exhibits hereto contain a reconciliation of Ford Credit's non-GAAP managed leverage measure to its financial statement leverage. The appendices indicate that Ford Credit's financial statement and managed leverage at December 31, 2004 were 12.6 and 13.7 to 1, respectively. We believe that the use of the non-GAAP managed leverage measure, which is the result of several adjustments to Ford Credit's financial statement leverage, is useful to investors because it reflects the way Ford Credit manages its business. Ford Credit retains interests in receivables sold in off-balance sheet securitization transactions, and, with respect to subordinated retained interests, has credit risk. Accordingly, Ford Credit considers securitization as an alternative source of funding and evaluates credit losses, receivables and leverage on a managed as well as on a financial statement basis. As a result, the managed leverage measure provides investors with meaningful information regarding management's decision-making processes.
Managed Leverage
.
     In calculating its managed leverage ratio, Ford Credit adds the total amount of receivables sold in off-balance sheet securitizations (including securitized funding from discontinued operations), net of retained interests (including retained interest in securitized receivables from discontinued operations), to its debt. It also deducts cash and cash equivalents because these generally correspond to excess debt beyond the amount required to support Ford Credit's financing operations. It adds minority interests to equity because all of the debt of such consolidated entities is included in total debt. It excludes the impact of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 in both the numerator and the denominator in order to exclude the interim effects of changes in market rates, because Ford Credit generally repays its debt funding obligations as they mature.
Table of Contents
     . Exhibit 99.9 discusses Ford Credit's loss-to-receivables ratio on an "on-balance sheet" and a managed basis. Exhibit 99.9 indicates that Ford Credit's total on-balance sheet loss-to-receivables ratio for the fourth quarter of 2004 was 1.23% (including charge-offs on reacquired receivables), and 1.18% (excluding charge-offs on reacquired receivables). Exhibit 99.9 further indicates that Ford Credit's on-balance sheet loss-to-receivables ratio for the full year 2004 was 1.10% (including charge-offs on reacquired receivables), and 1.04% (excluding charge-offs on reacquired receivables). A loss-to-receivables ratio equals net credit losses divided by the average amount of net receivables outstanding for the period. The receivables that were reacquired in the second quarter of 2003 are those of FCAR Owner Trust ("FCAR"), an entity integral to a Ford Credit asset-backed commercial paper program. FCAR was consolidated for financial statement purposes with Ford Credit in the second quarter of 2003. The financial measure that is most directly comparable to these loss-to-receivables ratios and that is calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is the on-balance sheet loss-to-receivables ratio excluding losses on the reacquired FCAR receivables. Ford believes that the use of the non-GAAP on-balance sheet loss-to-receivables ratio is useful to investors because it provides a more complete representation of actual on-balance sheet loss-to-receivables experience.

DEARBORN, Mich., Jan. 20  Ford Motor Company [NYSE: F] today reported full-year 2004 net income of $3.5 billion, or $1.73 per share, an increase of nearly $3 billion, or $1.46 per share, from a year ago, as the company achieved record financial services profits and improved automotive results. In 2003, the company reported net income of $495 million, or 27 cents per share.
Excluding special items, Ford's full-year earnings from continuing operations totaled $4.3 billion in 2004, or $2.11 per share. This compares with year-ago earnings from continuing operations of $2.2 billion, or $1.13 per share, excluding special items.
Total full-year sales and revenue for 2004 was $170.8 billion, up $7.2 billion from $163.6 billion last year.
"In 2004, our company gained momentum, delivering more revenue and earnings, more new products, and more innovative breakthroughs, such as the Escape Hybrid, the industry's first full-hybrid sport utility vehicle," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Bill Ford. "We also confronted operating challenges with our Jaguar brand and high industry marketing costs. Looking forward, we're going to build on our successes as we launch more new products in 2005 and beyond."
In addition, the company said 2004 net income was affected by a fourth-quarter pre-tax charge taken to reduce the value of a receivable owed to Ford by Visteon Corporation. The receivable relates to costs for which Visteon reimburses Ford over the long-term for post-retirement health care benefits and life insurance provided to Ford hourly employees assigned to Visteon and other select Visteon employees.

FOURTH QUARTER
For the fourth quarter, the company reported net income of $104 million, or 6 cents per share. This compares with a fourth-quarter loss of $793 million, or 43 cents per share, in 2003. Excluding special items, fourth-quarter earnings from continuing operations totaled $555 million, or 28 cents per share, compared to $594 million, or 30 cents per share, a year ago.

AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR
The following is a discussion of Ford's fourth-quarter and full-year pre-tax results for its automotive operations. The pre-tax results exclude special items. Reconciliation to pre-tax U.S. GAAP results is set forth below in the Attachment that accompanies this press release.

tax-related interest on refunds and settlements of prior-year audits, and improved parts profits, offset partially by unfavorable volume, mix and currency exchange.
For the fourth quarter, Ford's worldwide Automotive sector reported a pre-tax loss of $470 million, a decline of $483 million from a pre-tax profit of $13 million a year earlier. The decline primarily reflected unfavorable volume, mix and currency exchange, offset partially by net interest.
Worldwide automotive revenue for 2004 was $147.1 billion, an increase of $8.8 billion from revenue of $138.3 billion a year ago. Total fourth-quarter automotive revenue was $38.9 billion, a decline of $900 million from revenue of $39.8 billion a year ago.
Total company vehicle unit sales in 2004 were 6,798,000, an increase of 62,000 units from 2003. Fourth-quarter vehicle unit sales totaled 1,751,000, a decline of 133,000 units.
Automotive gross cash at Dec. 31, 2004 totaled $23.6 billion of cash, marketable securities, loaned securities and short-term Voluntary Employee Benefits Association (VEBA) assets.
The Americas reported a full-year pre-tax profit for 2004 of $1.6 billion, a decline of $58 million from a year ago. For the fourth quarter, the Americas had a pre-tax loss of $426 million, compared to a pre-tax profit of $201 million a year earlier.
THE AMERICAS
For 2004, Ford's North America automotive operations reported a full-year pre-tax profit of $1.5 billion, a decline of $327 million from 2003. The decline primarily reflected lower volumes. For the year, North America's revenue totaled $83 billion, down $580 million from a year earlier, as higher per-unit revenue offset partially a decline in vehicle unit sales.
North America:
For the fourth quarter, North America automotive operations lost $470 million, compared to pre-tax profit of $205 million in 2003. The decline primarily reflected lower volumes and

unfavorable currency exchange, offset partially by favorable pricing. Fourth-quarter revenue fell to $21.1 billion, down from $22.8 billion in 2003.
Ford's South America automotive operations reported a full-year pre-tax profit of $140 million, an increase of $269 million from a 2003 pre-tax loss of $129 million. The improvement primarily reflected higher volume and pricing, offset partially by higher commodity costs. Full-year revenue improved to $3 billion from $1.9 billion in 2003.
South America:
In the fourth quarter, Ford's South America automotive operations posted a pre-tax profit of $44 million, an improvement of $48 million from a pre-tax loss of $4 million a year ago. The improvement primarily reflected higher volume and pricing, offset partially by higher commodity costs. Revenue increased to $899 million, up from $623 million a year ago, as South America had higher volumes for its Fiesta, EcoSport, Focus, Ka and Cargo models.
The combined full-year pre-tax loss for Ford Europe and Premier Automotive Group (PAG) was $626 million for 2004. This compares to a loss of $936 million for 2003. The combined full-year revenue totaled $54.2 billion, an increase of $7.3 billion from 2003 revenue of nearly $47 billion.
FORD EUROPE AND PREMIER AUTOMOTIVE GROUP (PAG)
For the fourth quarter, Ford Europe and PAG had a combined pre-tax loss of $324 million, a decline from a pre-tax profit of $176 million a year ago. Combined fourth-quarter revenue totaled $15.3 billion, an increase from $14.8 billion in the prior-year period.
Ford Europe posted a full-year pre-tax profit of $114 million, reversing a pre-tax loss of $1.1 billion in 2003. The substantial improvement primarily reflected cost savings, and higher profits from a joint venture in Turkey. Revenue for the year totaled $26.5 billion, compared to $22.2 billion in 2003.
Ford Europe:
For the fourth quarter, Ford Europe reported a pre-tax loss of $69 million, a decline from a pre-tax profit of $62 million in the prior-year period. The deterioration primarily reflected

lower unit sales, offset partially by fixed cost reductions stemming from improvement actions taken in 2003. Fourth-quarter revenue was $7.4 billion, about flat from a year ago.
For 2004, PAG reported a full-year pre-tax loss of $740 million, a decline from a pre-tax profit of $171 million in 2003. The decline primarily reflected unfavorable currency exchange and lower volumes at Jaguar, offset partially by improved pricing. Full-year revenue for the group was $27.6 billion, up $2.8 billion from 2003.
Premier Automotive Group:
In the fourth quarter, PAG's pre-tax loss was $255 million, a deterioration of $369 million from a pre-tax profit of $114 million a year ago. The year-over-year decline primarily reflected unfavorable currency exchange related to a weakening of the U.S. dollar, and lower volumes at Jaguar. Revenue for the period was $7.8 billion, up from $7.4 billion in the 2003 fourth quarter.
For the full year, Asia Pacific and Africa/Mazda earned a combined pre-tax profit of $163 million, compared with $46 million a year ago. The improvement of $117 million primarily reflected higher profits from Ford's investment in Mazda and associated operations.
ASIA PACIFIC AND AFRICA/MAZDA
For full-year 2004, Asia Pacific and Africa reported a pre-tax profit of $45 million, an improvement of $68 million from a pre-tax loss of $23 million a year ago. The improvement primarily reflected higher sales in Australia, South Africa and Taiwan. Full-year revenue was $7 billion, an increase from $5.8 billion in 2003.
Asia Pacific and Africa:
For the fourth quarter, Asia Pacific and Africa reported a pre-tax loss of $13 million, compared with a pre-tax profit of $26 million in the year-ago period. The decline is primarily the result of higher engineering costs and unfavorable currency exchange, offset partially by stronger volume and mix, and favorable net pricing. Fourth-quarter revenue was $1.6 billion, compared to $1.5 billion in 2003.

For full-year 2004, Ford's share of the pre-tax profit of Mazda and associated operations was $118 million, up from $69 million a year ago.
Mazda:
For the 2004 fourth quarter, Ford's share of the pre-tax profit of Mazda and associated operations was a pre-tax loss of $9 million, an improvement from a pre-tax loss of $22 million a year ago. The fourth-quarter loss is primarily due to a reduction in the value of Ford's holding of Mazda convertible bonds.
For the full year, excluding special items, Ford's Financial Services sector reported a record pre-tax profit of $5 billion, up $1.7 billion over 2003, driven by strong profits at both Ford Motor Credit Company and The Hertz Corporation. For the fourth quarter, excluding special items, the Financial Services sector earned a pre-tax profit of $1 billion, an improvement of $144 million over a year ago.
FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR
Ford Credit reported record net income of $2.9 billion in 2004, up $1.1 billion from earnings of $1.8 billion a year earlier. On a pre-tax basis, excluding special items, Ford Credit earned $4.4 billion in 2004, compared with $3 billion in the previous year. The increase in earnings primarily reflected improved credit loss performance and leasing results.
Ford Motor Credit Company:
For the fourth quarter of 2004, Ford Credit earned net income of $543 million, up $73 million from $470 million a year earlier. On a pre-tax basis, Ford Credit earned $859 million in the fourth quarter, compared with $794 million in the previous year. The increase in earnings primarily reflected improved credit loss performance.
Hertz reported a full-year 2004 pre-tax profit of $493 million, a year-over-year improvement of $265 million. The improvement primarily reflected higher car and equipment rental volumes, better fleet utilization, and higher profits from the sales of used vehicles and equipment.
