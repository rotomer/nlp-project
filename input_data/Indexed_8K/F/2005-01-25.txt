Ford NEWS FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - --------------------- FORD ANNOUNCES 2005 FINANCIAL MILESTONES - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- o Ford anticipates 2005 earnings per share of $1.75 to $1.95, based on total company pre-tax profit in the range of $5 billion to $5.7 billion, excluding special items. o Total Automotive pre-tax profit milestone for 2005 is $1.5 billion to $2 billion, excluding special items. o Total Financial Services pre-tax profit milestone for 2005 is $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion, excluding special items. o Company anticipates first-quarter earnings per share in 2005 of 25 to 35 cents, excluding special items. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- DEARBORN, Mich., Jan. 25 - Ford Motor Company today announced financial milestones for 2005 that call for increased profit from the Company's worldwide automotive operations and lower financial services profit. Based on goals that call for improvements in quality, market share and automotive profit, the Company said it anticipates full-year 2005 earnings per share of $1.75 to $1.95, excluding special items, which is equivalent to total company pre-tax profit of $5 billion to $5.7 billion. The Company also anticipates first-quarter earnings per share in the range of 25 to 35 cents. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Bill Ford and his senior management team outlined their 2005 milestones and underlying assumptions during a presentation today with investors and analysts in New York.
"Last year our reinvigorated cycle plan kicked in, and we introduced more new vehicles around the world than at any other time in our 100-plus years," said Bill Ford. "Looking ahead, just stabilizing our business isn't enough. Our objective is to win. For 2005 and beyond, we're going to build great products, a strong business, and a better world." The Company is targeting total Automotive sector pre-tax profit in the range of $1.5 billion to $2 billion compared with pre-tax profit of $850 million earned in 2004, in each case excluding special items. (See Attachment One below for explanation of special items.) The anticipated increase in automotive profit reflects significantly improved profit from the Premier Automotive Group, and flat-to-improved performance from The Americas (North and South), Ford Europe and Asia Pacific and Africa/Mazda. Also, the Company anticipates Financial Services sector profit of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion in 2005, excluding special items. This compares with a pre-tax profit of nearly $5 billion in 2004, excluding special items. Strong profit performance for both Ford Motor Credit and Hertz is projected to continue in 2004, but results for Ford Motor Credit will be down from 2004, reflecting lower volume, increasing interest rates and non-recurrence of reserve reductions. The Company said achievement of the 2005 milestones would position it to meet its 2006 goal of achieving total company pre-tax profit of $7 billion, excluding special items. The 2005 assumptions and milestones are:
