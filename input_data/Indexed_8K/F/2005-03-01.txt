Sales of trucks declined 8 percent resulting in an overall sales decline of 3 percent.

"We are extremely pleased with the sales curve for our new products," said Earl Hesterberg, Ford group vice president, North America Marketing Sales and Service. "In just five months, we have very nearly reached our sales targets for the Chicago products." Ford Mustang continued to set a torrid sales pace in February, as sales to individual retail customers were 57 percent higher than a year ago. Lower fleet deliveries partially offset the increase in retail demand resulting in an overall Mustang sales increase of 32 percent. "The Mustang convertible is arriving just in time for the spring selling season," said Hesterberg. So is the Lincoln Mark LT. Lincoln dealers delivered the first luxury pickup trucks at the end of February - just one month after the start of production. Both Mercury and Lincoln posted sales increases in February. "We expect stronger sales in the months ahead for Lincoln and Mercury," said Hesterberg. "The Mercury Montego and Mariner have helped Mercury get off to a good start in 2005. In addition to the Mark LT, the franchise will benefit by the addition of the Mercury Milan and Lincoln Zephyr later in the year." Ford Focus contributed to the increase in passenger car sales. At the beginning of February, Ford partnered with Dell Computer in a unique promotion that helped February Focus sales increase 10 percent compared with a year ago. Sales for Ford's small sport utility vehicles continued to grow. Combined sales for the Ford Escape and Mercury Mariner totaled 17,115, up 18 percent compared with a year ago. Sales for the Ford Escape Hybrid in February were 1,092. Almost 5,000 hybrid models of the Escape have been sold since the product debuted in October.

Volvo dealers reported a sales increase in February bolstered by higher sales of the new S40 sedan and V50 wagon as well as continued strong sales of the XC90 crossover sport utility vehicle. Land Rover dealers reported record February sales thanks to the all-new LR3 and continued strong Range Rover sales. North American Production Plans - ------------------------------- The company plans to build 940,000 vehicles (290,000 cars and 650,000 trucks) in its North American assembly plants in the second quarter 2005.
