-2- Item 8.01. Other Events. - ------------------------ Our news release dated March 16, 2005 concerning first-quarter and full-year earnings guidance, filed as Exhibit 99 to this report, is incorporated by reference herein. The exhibit discusses our earnings guidance on a per share basis that excludes special items. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles to this measure is earnings per share on a basis that includes special items. We believe the earnings per share measure excluding special items is useful to investors because it excludes elements that we do not consider indicative of earnings from our on-going operating activities and, accordingly, provides investors with a more relevant measure of the results of our operations.
