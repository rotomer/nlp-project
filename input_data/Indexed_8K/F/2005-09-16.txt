assuming any other Liability of Visteon or any of its Affiliates (or any predecessor of any such Person or any prior owner of all or part of its businesses and assets). All such other Liabilities shall be retained by and remain Liabilities of Visteon and its Affiliates (all such Liabilities not being assumed being herein referred to as the "VISTEON RETAINED LIABILITIES"), and Visteon agrees to timely perform and discharge in accordance with their respective terms all such other Liabilities relating to the Business.

Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 2.04, no Liability shall be considered a "Visteon Retained Liability" under this Agreement to the extent such Liability results from Visteon's inability to take an action under Section 4.01 for which it had sought consent pursuant to Section 4.01 by virtue of the Company's failure to consent to the taking of such action by Visteon. 19
Section 2.05. Transfer or Assignment of Contributed Contracts and Rights. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, and except as provided in the Software License and Contribution Agreement with respect to software licenses, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to convey, transfer or assign any Contributed Asset or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom if such conveyance, transfer or assignment, without the consent of a third party thereto, would constitute a breach or other contravention of such Contributed Asset or in any way adversely affect the rights of or require a material payment by the Company or Visteon thereunder (unless such consent is obtained prior to the Closing). Visteon and the Company will use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of the other parties to any such Contributed Asset or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder for the assignment thereof to the Company (or Subsidiary of the Company) and, to the extent required, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Visteon "B" Purchase Agreement, as the Company may request; provided, that, except as set forth in the Software License and Contribution Agreement with respect to software licenses, in Section 5.03 of this Agreement or in Section 5.04 of the Visteon "B" Purchase Agreement, such efforts shall not require Visteon or the Company to incur any material expenses or Liabilities or provide any material financial accommodation or to provide a guarantee to obtain any such consent (provided that Visteon agrees to accept a consent notwithstanding that it does not include a release). If such consent is not obtained, or if an attempted conveyance, transfer or assignment thereof would be ineffective, would adversely affect the rights of Visteon thereunder so that the Company would not in fact receive all such rights, or would require a material payment by the Company or Visteon, until such consent is obtained (whereupon such Contributed Asset shall be promptly transferred by Visteon to the Company or applicable Subsidiary of the Company pursuant to the applicable provisions of this Agreement), Visteon and the Company will cooperate in a mutually agreeable arrangement under which the Company would obtain benefits and assume obligations thereunder, including making any required payments thereunder, in accordance with this Agreement, including sub-contracting, sub-licensing, or sub-leasing to the Company, or under which Visteon would enforce or operate for the benefit of the Company the applicable Contributed Asset and any claim, right or benefit arising thereunder. Visteon will promptly pay to the Company when received all monies received by Visteon under any Contributed Asset or any claim, right or benefit arising thereunder, except to the extent the same represents an Excluded Asset.

ARTICLE 6 TAX MATTERS Section 6.01. Allocation of Consideration. At least 10 days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver a schedule to Visteon (the "PRELIMINARY ASSET ALLOCATION SCHEDULE") setting forth the aggregate consideration (including the Assumed Liabilities to the extent properly taken into account for this purpose) for the Contributed Assets, as determined for federal income Tax purposes, and the allocation of the consideration among the Contributed Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "CODE"). The Company shall also provide such supporting material, including accountants' workpapers and appraisals, as Visteon shall reasonably request in support of the Preliminary Asset Allocation Schedule. If within 30 days after the delivery of the Preliminary Asset Allocation Schedule, Visteon notifies the Company in writing that Visteon objects to the valuations reflected in the computation of the aggregate consideration or the allocation of consideration set forth therein, the parties shall endeavor in good faith to resolve such dispute within 20 days. If there are no disputed items or when all disputed items are resolved, the Preliminary Asset Allocation Schedule, as adjusted to reflect any such resolution, shall become the "FINAL ASSET ALLOCATION SCHEDULE". Visteon and the Company will act in accordance with the determination and allocation of the consideration set forth in the Final Asset Allocation Schedule for all Tax 46
purposes, including with respect to any forms or reports (including IRS Form 8594) required to be filed pursuant to Section 1060 of the Code, the regulations thereunder or any provisions of local, state or foreign law, and to cooperate in the preparation of any such forms or reports and to timely file such forms or reports. Neither party shall take any position that is inconsistent with the determinations and allocation of the consideration set forth in the Final Asset Allocation Schedule in any communication with any taxing authority, unless and until the taking of such position is required by law or as a result of a final determination (without any obligation to appeal such final determination to the United States Supreme Court).

For purposes of this Section 6.02(b), in the case of any Straddle Period, the Pre-Closing Tax Period Taxes shall be computed as if the Pre-Closing Tax Period ended as of the close of business on the date of the consummation of the closing under the Visteon "B" Purchase Agreement. Section 6.03. Refunds and Credits. Any refunds and credits attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period, or to the portion of a Straddle Period allocable to Visteon, shall be for the account of Visteon and any refunds and credits 47

Section 6.05. Transfer Taxes. Subject to Section 4.C. of each Mexican Asset Purchase Agreement, all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes and fees to be incurred in connection with transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any real property transfer Tax and any similar Tax) ("TRANSFER TAXES") shall be borne by Visteon.

The party requesting assistance hereunder shall reimburse the other for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in providing such assistance. The Company and Visteon shall (i) preserve and cause to be preserved all information, returns, books, records and documents relating to any Liabilities for Taxes with respect to a taxable period until the later of 60 days after the expiration of all applicable statutes of limitation and extensions thereof, or the conclusion of all litigation with respect to Taxes for such period and (ii) give reasonable written notice to the other party prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such information, returns, books, 48

(a) The party seeking indemnification under Section 8.02 (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") agrees to give prompt written notice to the party against whom indemnity is sought (the "INDEMNIFYING PARTY") of the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding ("CLAIM") in respect of which indemnity may be sought under such Section and will provide the Indemnifying Party such information with respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have actually prejudiced in any material respect the Indemnifying Party. (b) The Indemnifying Party shall, subject to the provisions of this Section 8.03, be entitled to assume the defense and control of any Claim asserted by a third party ("THIRD PARTY CLAIM") but shall allow the Indemnified Party a reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel and, subject to Section 8.03(e), at its own expense; provided that prior to assuming control of such defense, the Indemnifying Party must acknowledge that it would have an indemnity obligation for any Damages resulting from such Third Party Claim as provided under this Article 8. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, to assume the defense and control of any Third Party Claim if (i) the Third Party Claim relates to or arises out of any Environmental Liabilities at or affecting any Contributed Real Property, (ii) the Third Party Claim relates to or 52
arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation, or (iii) the Third Party Claim seeks an injunctive or other non-monetary relief against the Indemnified Party. (c) The party assuming the defense and control of a Third Party Claim (the "CONTROLLING PARTY") shall take all steps necessary in the defense or settlement of such Third Party Claim, and shall at all times diligently and promptly pursue the resolution of such Third Party Claim. The other party shall, and shall cause its controlled Affiliates to, cooperate fully with the Controlling Party in the defense of any Third Party Claim defended by the Controlling Party, including by making relevant personnel reasonably available to the Controlling Party in connection with such defense. (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 8.03 to the contrary, neither the Indemnifying Party nor the Indemnified Party shall, without the written consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment unless the claimant provides to such other party an unqualified release from all liability in respect of the Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a bona fide settlement offer solely for money damages is made in writing by the applicable third party claimant, and the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party in writing of the Indemnifying Party's willingness to accept the settlement offer and, subject to the applicable limitations on the Indemnifying Party's indemnification obligations under this Article 8, pay the amount called for by such offer, and the Indemnified Party declines to accept such offer, the Indemnified Party may continue to contest such Third Party Claim, free of any participation by the Indemnifying Party, and the amount of any ultimate liability with respect to such Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party has an obligation to pay under this Article 8 shall be limited to the lesser of (A) the amount of the settlement offer that the Indemnified Party declined to accept plus the aggregate Damages of the Indemnified Party relating to such Third Party Claim through the date of its rejection of the settlement offer or (B) the aggregate Damages of the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party makes any payment on any Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all rights and remedies of the Indemnified Party to any insurance benefits or other claims of the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim. (e) The Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel incurred by each Indemnified Party in defending any Third Party Claim prior to the date the Indemnifying Party assumes control of the defense of the Third Party Claim or if the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim pursuant to the last sentence of Section 8.03(b). After the date the Indemnifying Party assumes control of the defense of the Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall also be liable for the reasonable fees and 53
expenses of one separate counsel (and one local counsel in each applicable jurisdiction) incurred by the Indemnified Parties in defending any Third Party Claim if representation of both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party by the same counsel would create a conflict of interest. (f) In the event that the Indemnifying Party does not accept the defense of any Third Party Claim or the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim pursuant to the last sentence of Section 8.03(b), the Indemnified Party shall use reasonable efforts to inform the Indemnifying Party of material developments with respect to such Third Party Claim and to provide the Indemnifying Party with copies of material filings with any Governmental Authority in respect of such Third Party Claim that are not subject to the attorney-client or another similar privilege. An Indemnified Party shall not settle, compromise or discharge any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. (g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) even where on the Closing Date the Indemnified Party knows of any information that would cause one or more of the representations and warranties made by the Indemnifying Party in this Agreement to be inaccurate or untrue, the Indemnified Party shall not be deemed to have waived (and shall continue to have) its rights to indemnification pursuant to Section 8.02 in respect thereof and (ii) the fact that a matter is covered by or dealt with in one or more of the representations and warranties made in this Agreement shall not in any respect limit or restrict (including by virtue of any applicable exception, qualifier, disclosed item, deductible or cap) Visteon's indemnification obligations with respect to the Visteon Retained Liabilities. Section 8.04. Mitigation. An Indemnified Party shall use reasonable efforts (but without any obligation to incur any material cost or expense) to mitigate Damages for which indemnification is sought under this Article 8. Section 8.05. Calculation of Losses. (a) The amount of any Damages for which indemnification is provided under this Article 8 shall be net of any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under insurance policies or otherwise with respect to such Damages (net of any Tax or expenses incurred in connection with such recovery). The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to recover under insurance policies for any Damages. (b) If the amount of any Damages for which indemnification is provided under this Article 8 gives rise to a currently realizable Tax Benefit (as defined below) to the Indemnified Party making the Claim, then the amount of Damages shall be (i) increased to take account of any net Tax cost incurred by the Indemnified Party arising from the receipt of indemnity payments hereunder 54
(grossed up for such increase) and (ii) reduced to take account of any net Tax Benefit actually or reasonably expected to be realized by the Indemnified Party arising from circumstances underlying or the incurrence or payment of any such Damages. For purposes of this Section 8.05(b) a "TAX BENEFIT" means an amount by which the Tax liability of the party (or group of corporations including the party) is actually reduced (including by deduction, reduction of income by virtue of increased tax basis or otherwise, entitlement to refund, credit or otherwise) plus any related interest received from the relevant taxing authority. In computing the amount of any such Tax cost or Tax Benefit, the indemnified party shall be deemed to recognize all other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit before recognizing any item arising from the receipt of any indemnity payment hereunder or the incurrence or payment of any indemnified Loss. The amount of any increase, reduction or payment hereunder shall be adjusted to reflect any final determination (which shall include the execution of Form 870-AD or successor form) with respect to the Indemnified Party's liability for Taxes, and payments between the parties to this Agreement to reflect such adjustment shall be made if necessary. Any indemnity payment under this Article 8 shall be treated as an adjustment to the value of the asset upon which the underlying indemnification claim was based, unless a final determination (which shall include the execution of a Form 870-AD or successor form) with respect to the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates causes any such payment not to be treated as an adjustment to the value of the asset for United States federal income tax purposes. Section 8.06. No Consequential Damages. Except in cases of fraud or willful misrepresentation or in respect of any such damages that arise from a Third Party Claim, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under this Article 8 for any consequential, incidental, indirect, special or punitive damages, including lost profits. Section 8.07. Exclusive Remedy. From and after the Closing, except in the event of fraud or willful misrepresentation (in which case the parties shall be entitled to exercise all of their rights, and seek all Damages available to them, under law or in equity) the sole and exclusive remedy for any breach or failure to be true and correct, or alleged breach or failure to be true and correct, of any representation or warranty or any covenant or agreement in this Agreement, shall be indemnification in accordance with this Article 8. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 8.07 shall not operate to limit the rights of the parties to seek equitable remedies (including specific performance or injunctive relief). Section 8.08. No Double Recovery. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no indemnified party shall be entitled to indemnification under any provision of this Agreement for any amount to the extent such indemnified party or its Affiliate has been indemnified for such amount pursuant to this Agreement, the other Contribution Agreement Transaction Documents, the Visteon "A" 55
Transaction Agreement, the other Visteon "A" Transaction Documents (as defined in the Visteon "A" Transaction Agreement), the Visteon "B" Purchase Agreement, the other Visteon "B" Transaction Documents (as defined in the Visteon "B" Purchase Agreement), the Confidentiality Agreement or any other agreement, contract or instrument executed in connection herewith or therewith. ARTICLE 9 TERMINATION Section 9.01. Grounds for Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing: (i) by mutual written agreement of Visteon and the Company; (ii) by either Visteon or the Company if the Closing shall not have been consummated on or before December 31, 2005 (the "OUTSIDE DATE"); provided that the right to terminate the Agreement pursuant to this clause (ii) shall not be available to any party whose material breach of any of its obligations under this Agreement primarily contributes to the failure of the Closing to be consummated by such date (unless both parties are in material breach of their respective obligations under this Agreement); (iii) by either Visteon or the Company, if any applicable law or regulation makes consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby illegal or otherwise prohibited or if consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby would violate any nonappealable final order, decree or judgment of any Governmental Authority having competent jurisdiction; or (iv) by the Company if Visteon shall have breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) is incapable of being cured by Visteon prior to the Outside Date or is not cured by the earlier of (x) 30 Business Days following written notice to Visteon by the Company of such breach and (y) the Outside Date and (B) if not cured would result in a failure of any condition set forth in Section 7.02(a). The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clauses (ii), (iii) or (iv) shall give notice of such termination to the other party. Section 9.02. Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated as permitted by Section 9.01, such termination shall be without liability of either party (or any stockholder, director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or 56
representative of such party) to the other party to this Agreement; provided that if such termination shall result from the (i) willful failure of either party to fulfill a condition to the performance of the obligations of the other party, (ii) failure to perform a covenant of this Agreement or (iii) breach by either party hereto of any representation or warranty or agreement contained herein, such party shall be fully liable for any and all Damages incurred or suffered by the other party as a result of such failure or breach. The provisions of this Section 9.02, Section 5.05, and Article 10 shall survive any termination hereof pursuant to Section 9.01. ARTICLE 10 MISCELLANEOUS Section 10.01. Notices.

(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement, or in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective. (b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. 58
Section 10.03. Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense. Section 10.04. Successors and Assigns. The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns; provided that neither party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of Visteon, the Company may transfer or assign, in whole or from time to time in part, (i) to Ford or one or more of its Affiliates, the right to acquire all or a portion of the Contributed Assets and to assume the related Assumed Liabilities or (ii) to any acquiror from the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries) or its permitted assigns of one or more of the Contributed Real Properties (and related Contributed Assets) any or all of its rights hereunder (including its rights to seek indemnification hereunder); provided that, in the case of clause (ii), without limiting any assignment of rights (including indemnification rights under Section 8.02(a), including with respect to the Visteon Retained Liabilities) made pursuant to clause (ii), the Company shall require such acquiror to acknowledge, in the applicable purchase agreement, that such acquiror has no rights or remedies against Visteon or its Affiliates arising solely out of the Assumed Liabilities. Upon any such permitted assignment under this Section 10.04, the references in this Agreement to the Company shall also apply to any such assignee unless the context otherwise requires. Section 10.05. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of Michigan, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of such state. Section 10.06. Dispute Resolution. If a dispute arises between the parties relating to this Agreement, the following shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for enforcing the terms hereof and for seeking relief, including damages, injunctive relief and specific performance: (i) The parties promptly shall hold a meeting of senior executives with decision-making authority to attempt in good faith to negotiate a mutually satisfactory resolution of the dispute; provided that no party shall be under any obligation whatsoever to reach, accept or agree to any such resolution; provided further, that no such meeting shall be deemed to vitiate or reduce the obligations and liabilities of the parties or be deemed a waiver by a party hereto of any remedies to which such party would otherwise be entitled. (ii) If the parties are unable to negotiate a mutually satisfactory resolution as provided above, then upon request by either party, the matter 59
shall be submitted to binding arbitration before a sole arbitrator in accordance with the CPR Rules, including discovery rules, for Non-Administered Arbitration. Within five Business Days after the selection of the arbitrator, each party shall submit its requested relief to the other party and to the arbitrator with a view toward settling the matter prior to commencement of discovery. If no settlement is reached, then discovery shall proceed. Upon the conclusion of discovery, each party shall again submit to the arbitrator its requested relief (which may be modified from the initial submission) and the arbitrator shall select only the entire requested relief submitted by one party or the other, as the arbitrator deems most appropriate. The arbitrator shall not select one party's requested relief as to certain claims or counterclaims and the other party's requested relief as to other claims or counterclaims. Rather, the arbitrator must only select one or the other party's entire requested relief on all of the asserted claims and counterclaims, and the arbitrator shall enter a final ruling that adopts in whole such requested relief. The arbitrator shall limit his/her final ruling to selecting the entire requested relief he/she considers the most appropriate from the requests submitted by the parties. (iii) Arbitration shall take place in the City of Dearborn, Michigan unless the parties agree otherwise or the arbitrator selected by the parties orders otherwise. Punitive or exemplary damages shall not be awarded. This Section 10.06 is subject to the Federal Arbitration Act, 28 U.S.C.A. Section 1, et seq., or comparable legislation in non-U.S. jurisdictions, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered by any court having jurisdiction. Section 10.07. Jurisdiction. Subject to Section 10.06, the parties hereto agree that any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in any federal court sitting in Michigan or any Michigan State court sitting in Wayne County or Oakland County, Michigan, so long as one of such courts shall have subject matter jurisdiction over such suit, action or proceeding, and that any cause of action arising out of this Agreement shall be deemed to have arisen from a transaction of business in the State of Michigan. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or any objection that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. 60
Section 10.08. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. Section 10.09. Counterparts; Effectiveness; Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement may be signed in counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other communication). No provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than (i) the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns under Section 10.04 and (ii) Ford as expressly provided in Section 5.08 of the Visteon "B" Purchase Agreement. Section 10.10. Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the other agreements referred to in Section 8 of the Master Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter of such agreements and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to the subject matter of such agreements. Section 10.11. Bulk Sales Laws. The Company and Visteon each hereby waive compliance by Visteon with the provisions of the "bulk sales," "bulk transfer" or similar laws of any state. Section 10.12. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. Section 10.13. Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in the courts specified in Section 10.07. 61

Section .06. Dispute Resolution. If a dispute arises between the parties relating to this Agreement, the following shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for enforcing the terms hereof and for seeking relief, including damages, injunctive relief and specific performance: (i) The parties promptly shall hold a meeting of senior executives with decision-making authority to attempt in good faith to negotiate a mutually satisfactory resolution of the dispute; provided that no party shall be under any obligation whatsoever to reach, accept or agree to any such resolution; provided further that no such meeting shall be deemed to vitiate or reduce the obligations and liabilities of the parties or be deemed a waiver by a party hereto of any remedies to which such party would otherwise be entitled. (ii) If the parties are unable to negotiate a mutually satisfactory resolution as provided above, then upon request by either party, the matter shall be submitted to binding arbitration before a sole arbitrator in accordance with the CPR Rules, including discovery rules, for Non-Administered Arbitration. Within five Business Days after the selection of the arbitrator, each party shall submit its requested relief to the other party and to the arbitrator with a view toward settling the matter prior to commencement of discovery. If no settlement is reached, then discovery shall proceed. Upon the conclusion of discovery, each party shall again submit to the arbitrator its requested relief (which may be modified from the initial submission) and the arbitrator shall select only the entire requested relief submitted by one party or the other, as the arbitrator deems most appropriate. The arbitrator shall not select one party's requested relief as to certain claims or counterclaims and the other party's requested relief as to other claims or counterclaims. Rather, the arbitrator must only select one or the other party's entire requested relief on all of the asserted claims and counterclaims, and the arbitrator shall enter a final ruling that adopts in whole such requested relief. The arbitrator shall limit his/her final ruling to selecting the entire requested relief he/she considers the most appropriate from the requests submitted by the parties. (iii) Arbitration shall take place in the City of Dearborn, Michigan unless the parties agree otherwise or the arbitrator selected by the parties orders otherwise. Punitive or exemplary damages shall not be awarded. This Section .06 is subject to the Federal Arbitration Act, 28 U.S.C.A. Section 1, et seq., and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered by any court having jurisdiction. Section .07. Jurisdiction. Subject to Section .06, the parties hereto agree that any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the 23
transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in any federal court sitting in Michigan or any Michigan State court sitting in Wayne County or Oakland County, Michigan, so long as one of such courts shall have subject matter jurisdiction over such suit, action or proceeding, and that any cause of action arising out of this Agreement shall be deemed to have arisen from a transaction of business in the State of Michigan. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or any objection that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Section .08. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.

This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other communication).

Section .11. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic 24
or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. Section .12. Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in the courts specified in Section .07. 25

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.03, if the Closing Date is not a Business Day, Buyer shall deliver the cash amount required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.03(a)(i) to Seller on the Business Day immediately preceding the scheduled Closing Date (but subsequent to the consummation of the closing under the Contribution Agreement), subject to the prior delivery by the parties of the documents required to be delivered pursuant to this Section 2.03 and Section 2.03 of the Visteon "A" Transaction Agreement (such documents to be held in escrow by the parties' counsel pending release at the Closing). If the Closing does not occur on the scheduled Closing Date, Seller shall promptly (on the next Business Day) repay the cash amount delivered by Buyer pursuant to the preceding sentence to Buyer. Section 2.04. Estimate of Inventories Purchase Price. 15 days prior to the date on which the Closing is scheduled to occur, Seller shall, in consultation with Buyer, prepare and furnish to Buyer a statement (the "INITIAL STATEMENT"), prepared in reasonable detail, with specificity and in accordance with the Inventory Accounting Principles, setting forth Seller's good faith estimate of the Inventories Purchase Price, which estimate will be based on the closing accounts stated in Seller's books of account as of the end of the immediately preceding calendar month and shall also take into account additions thereto and subtractions therefrom subsequent to such date and until the date on which the Closing is scheduled to occur based on Seller's good faith estimates taking into account 7
Seller's historical practices and forecasts. If Buyer agrees with such estimate or Buyer does not object to such calculation within seven days after Seller's delivery of the Initial Statement, such amount shall be deemed to be the Estimated Inventories Purchase Price and shall be paid by Buyer to Seller at the Closing pursuant to Section 2.03(a)(i). If Buyer disagrees with such estimate, Buyer shall, within seven days after delivery of the Initial Statement, deliver a written notice to Seller stating that Buyer disagrees with such calculation and specifying in reasonable detail those items or amounts as to which Buyer disagrees. If Buyer disagrees with Seller's estimate of the Inventories Purchase Price set forth in the Initial Statement, the parties shall promptly hold a meeting of senior executives with decision-making authority to attempt in good faith to negotiate and mutually agree on the estimate of the Inventories Purchase Price. If the parties are able to agree, such agreed upon estimated amount shall be deemed to be the Estimated Inventories Purchase Price and shall be paid by Buyer to Seller at the Closing pursuant to Section 2.03(a)(i). If the parties are unable to agree, the estimated Inventories Purchase Price payable by Buyer to Seller at the Closing pursuant to Section 2.03(a)(i) shall be the amount set forth on the Statement of Assets. Section 2.05. Post-Closing Calculations. (a) As promptly as practicable, but no later than 90 days, after the Closing Date, Buyer will cause to be prepared and delivered to Seller a statement setting forth Buyer's calculation, in accordance with the Inventory Accounting Principles, of the Inventories Purchase Price. (b) If Seller disagrees with Buyer's calculation of the Inventories Purchase Price delivered pursuant to Section 2.05(a), Seller may, within 45 days after delivery of the statement referred to in Section 2.05(a), deliver a notice to Buyer disagreeing with Buyer's calculation of the Inventories Purchase Price and setting forth Seller's calculation of the Inventories Purchase Price. Any such notice of disagreement shall specify those items or amounts as to which Seller disagrees, and Seller shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the statement delivered by Buyer pursuant to Section 2.05(a). (c) If a notice of disagreement shall be duly delivered pursuant to Section 2.05(b), Buyer and Seller shall, during the 15 days following such delivery, use their best efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to determine the Inventories Purchase Price, which amount shall not be less than the amount thereof shown in Buyer's calculations delivered pursuant to Section 2.05(a) or more than the amount thereof shown in Seller's calculation delivered pursuant to Section 2.05(b). If, during such period, Buyer and Seller are unable to reach such agreement, they shall promptly thereafter cause Ernst & Young (the "REFEREE") promptly, and in any event within 45 days, to review this Agreement and the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of calculating the Inventories Purchase Price. In making such calculation, the Referee shall consider only those items or amounts in Buyer's calculation of the 8
Inventories Purchase Price as to which Seller has disagreed and must only use the accounting principles, methods and procedures of the Inventory Accounting Principles in reviewing such disputed items or amounts. The Referee shall deliver to Buyer and Seller, as promptly as practicable, a report setting forth such calculation of the Inventories Purchase Price.
