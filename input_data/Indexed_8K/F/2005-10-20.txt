     Please note that Exhibit 99 discusses pre-tax profits excluding special items for Ford's Automotive sector and the primary operating segments and business units within the Automotive sector. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is pre-tax profits including special items. Ford believes that pre-tax profits excluding special items is a useful measure to provide investors, because it excludes those items that Ford does not consider to be indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities. As a result, pre-tax profits excluding special items provides investors with a more relevant measure of the results generated by our operations.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
FORD REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2005 FINANCIAL RESULTS
DEARBORN, Mich., Oct. 20, 2005  Ford Motor Company [NYSE: F] today reported a net loss of 15 cents per share, or $284 million, for the third quarter of 2005. This compares with net income of 15 cents per share, or $266 million, in the third quarter of 2004.
Ford's third-quarter loss from continuing operations, excluding special items, was 10 cents per share, or $191 million, compared to a profit of 27 cents per share, or $515 million, in the same period last year.*
Ford's total sales and revenue in the third quarter was $40.9 billion, compared to $39.1 billion in the year-ago period.
* Earnings per share from continuing operations excluding special items is calculated on a basis that includes pre-tax profit and provision for taxes and minority interest. See table following "Safe Harbor/Risk Factors" for the nature and amount of these special items and a reconciliation to GAAP.
 
"As our results indicate, we face many challenges in this competitive and difficult environment," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Bill Ford. "We have demonstrated throughout the year that we will continue to take the actions necessary to return our core business to sustainable profitability. We understand the issues, our priorities, and have the right team in place to get the job done."
Third-quarter actions included:
The following discussion of the results of our Automotive sector and Automotive business units is on a basis that excludes special items. See table following "Safe Harbor/Risk Factors" for the nature and amount of these special items and a reconciliation to GAAP.
On a pre-tax basis, worldwide automotive losses in the third quarter were $1.3 billion, a decline of $732 million from a loss of $609 million during the same period a year ago.
AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR
Worldwide automotive sales for the third quarter rose to $34.7 billion from $32.8 billion in the same period last year. Worldwide vehicle-unit sales in the quarter were 1,531,000, up from 1,508,000 a year ago.
Total cash, including automotive cash, marketable securities, loaned securities and short-term Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association (VEBA) assets on September 30, 2005 was $19.6 billion, down from $21.8 billion at the end of the second quarter.
 
For the third quarter, the Americas reported a pre-tax loss of $1.1 billion, a decline of $648 million from a $422 million pre-tax loss in the same period a year ago.
THE AMERICAS
In the third quarter, Ford's North American automotive operations reported a pre-tax loss of $1.2 billion, a decline of $685 million from a $481 million pre-tax loss a year ago. Lower dealer inventories, unfavorable vehicle mix, lower net pricing and higher warranty and material costs contributed to the deterioration. Higher industry volumes and market share were partial offsets. Included in the higher warranty costs was the favorable impact of the $240 million settlement reached with Bridgestone Firestone North American Tire, LLC regarding Firestone's August 2000 voluntary safety recall and Ford's May 2001 tire replacement program. Sales were $18.2 billion, up $59 million from the same period a year ago.
North America:
Ford's South American automotive operations reported a third-quarter pre-tax profit of $96 million, an increase of $37 million from a $59 million pre-tax profit a year ago. Higher volumes and net pricing in excess of higher commodity costs were the primary drivers of the improvement. Sales for the third quarter improved to $1.2 billion from $784 million in 2004.
South America:
The 2005 third quarter combined pre-tax loss for Ford Europe and PAG automotive operations was $163 million, an improvement of $41 million compared with a loss of $204 million for the year-ago period.
FORD EUROPE AND PREMIER AUTOMOTIVE GROUP (PAG)
Ford Europe's third-quarter pre-tax loss was $55 million, compared with a pre-tax loss of $33 million during the 2004 period. The decline was more than explained by higher material costs. These were partially offset by higher net pricing and higher subsidiary profits. Ford Europe's sales in the third quarter were $6.4 billion, compared with $5.9 billion during the third quarter of 2004.
Ford Europe:
PAG reported a pre-tax loss of $108 million for the third quarter, compared with a pre-tax loss of $171 million for the same period in 2004. This is more than explained by the impact of new products, resulting in a richer mix and improved net pricing, primarily at Land Rover. Unfavorable currency exchange was a significant partial offset. Third-quarter sales for PAG were $6.8 billion, compared with $6.1 billion a year ago.
Premier Automotive Group:
 
The 2005 third quarter combined pre-tax profit for Ford Asia-Pacific and Africa/Mazda was $133 million, an improvement of $85 million compared with a profit of $48 million for the year-ago period.
FORD ASIA-PACIFIC AND AFRICA/MAZDA
For the third quarter of 2005, Ford Asia-Pacific and Africa reported a pre-tax profit of $21 million, a decline of $14 million from a $35 million pre-tax profit a year ago. The decline was primarily explained by a higher mix of smaller cars, partially offset by improved net pricing. Sales were $1.9 billion, unchanged from third quarter 2004.
Ford Asia-Pacific and Africa:
During the third quarter of 2005, Ford's share of Mazda profits and associated operations was $112 million, an improvement of $99 million from $13 million during the same period a year ago. The improvement primarily reflects gains on our investment in Mazda's convertible bonds and improved operating results at Mazda.
Mazda:
Third-quarter earnings included a loss of $241 million in other automotive financial results. This is a decline of $210 million from the same period last year, primarily reflecting the non-recurrence of tax-related interest income on refund claims received last year.
OTHER AUTOMOTIVE
Ford Motor Credit Company reported net income of $577 million in the third quarter of 2005, down $157 million from a year earlier. On a pre-tax basis from continuing operations, Ford Motor Credit earned $901 million in the third quarter, compared with $1.1 billion in the previous year. The decrease in earnings primarily reflected higher borrowing costs and the impact of lower receivable levels, partially offset by improved credit loss performance.
FORD MOTOR CREDIT COMPANY
Hertz reported a third-quarter pre-tax profit of $262 million, an improvement of $13 million from the same period in 2004. The improvement reflected higher car and equipment rental volume, partially offset by lower pricing.
THE HERTZ CORP.
 
In total, special items reduced earnings per share by 6 cents in the third quarter. Charges for Visteon-related actions, personnel reduction programs, and fuel cell technology were partially offset by a gain on the sale of a non-core business.
SPECIAL ITEMS*
* See table following "Safe Harbor/Risk Factors" for the nature and amount of these special items and a reconciliation to GAAP.
Commenting on the Company's financial outlook, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Don Leclair said, "We expect the fourth quarter to be another extremely competitive period. Our new products put us in an excellent position to compete in the marketplace. We will continue the turnaround in our operations in Europe, the investment in growth in Asia, and to address our issues in North America."
OUTLOOK
The Company's 2005 full-year earnings guidance is expected to be at the low end of the current guidance range of $1.00 to $1.25 per share. Full-year earnings-per-share guidance excludes the effect of special items and discontinued operations, which are presently estimated to include the following items:
