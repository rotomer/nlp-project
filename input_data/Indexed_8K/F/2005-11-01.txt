IMMEDIATE RELEASE
FORD'S U.S. SALES DECLINED IN OCTOBER
 
 
DEARBORN
,
Mich., November 1 - U.S. consumers purchased 199,847 new vehicles from Ford, Lincoln, Mercury, Jaguar, Land Rover and Volvo dealers in October, down 26 percent compared with a year ago. Most models experienced sharp declines in October in the wake of this summer's strong sales.
Both car and truck sales were lower than a year ago, but cars fared better than trucks owing to contributions from new products. In October, all-new mid-size sedans arrived in dealer showrooms. Sales for the Ford Fusion (4,078), Mercury Milan (1,336), and Lincoln Zephyr (1,204) easily exceeded Ford's expectations.
"The Ford Fusion, Mercury Milan, and Lincoln Zephyr were notable exceptions to an otherwise slow month," said Steve Lyons, Ford group vice president, North America Marketing, Sales and Service.
"Many Ford dealers likened the consumer response to Fusion as on par with the reception of the Ford Mustang a year ago."
