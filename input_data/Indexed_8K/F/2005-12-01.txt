IMMEDIATE RELEASE
FORD'S NOVEMBER U.S. SALES IMPROVE VERSUS OCTOBER BUT LOWER THAN YEAR AGO
 
 
DEARBORN
,
Mich., December 1 - U.S. consumers purchased 201,711 new vehicles from Ford, Lincoln, Mercury, Jaguar, Land Rover and Volvo dealers in November, down 15 percent compared with a year ago. Car sales were down 7 percent and truck sales were down 18 percent.
November sales were 1 percent higher than October as sales to individual retail customers were up 5 percent. The month-to-month improvement reflects higher sales of the company's all-new mid-size sedans (Ford Fusion, Mercury Milan, and Lincoln Zephyr) as well as higher sales for Ford's F-Series truck.
"Recent economic data and higher November auto sales are encouraging," said Steve Lyons, Ford group vice president, North America Marketing, Sales and Service. "It suggests we're moving beyond the payback period following last summer's record sales. We expect December sales will show further improvement."
