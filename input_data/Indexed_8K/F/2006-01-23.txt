Please note that Exhibit 99 to this Form 8-K discusses pre-tax profits excluding special items for Ford's Automotive sector and the primary operating segments and business units within the Automotive sector. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is pre-tax profits including special items. Ford believes that pre-tax profits excluding special items is a useful measure to provide investors, because it excludes those items that Ford does not consider to be indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities. As a result, pre-tax profits excluding special items provides investors with a more relevant measure of the results generated by our operations.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
FORD MOTOR COMPANY REPORTS 2005 NET INCOME OF
$2 BILLION, PROFITABLE FOR THIRD CONSECUTIVE YEAR
DEARBORN, Mich., Jan. 23, 2006 - Ford Motor Company [NYSE: F] today reported 2005 full-year
net income of $2 billion, or $1.04 per share. In 2004, the company reported net income of $3.5 billion,
or $1.73 per share.
Excluding special items, Fords 2005 full-year after-tax income from continuing operations totaled
$2.5 billion, or $1.28 per share. This compares with year-ago earnings from continuing operations of
$4.3 billion, or $2.11 per share, excluding special items.
Full-year sales and revenue for 2005 was $178.1 billion, up from $171.7 billion a year ago.
 
We accomplished many things in 2005, including the successful launch of the new Ford Fusion, Mercury Milan and Lincoln Zephyr, introduction of the companys new innovation initiative, completion of the sale of Hertz, and an agreement with the UAW to help reduce rising health care costs, said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Bill Ford. Excluding North America, our automotive operations made great progress in 2005; we must keep working to improve our business in each and every region.
Special items reduced earnings by 6 cents per share in the fourth quarter. The pre-tax effect of these items includes: a charge of $1.3 billion for impairment of Jaguar and Land Rover fixed assets; personnel reduction actions of $962 million; and the sale of The Hertz Corporation for a total profit of $1.5 billion, $1.4 billion of which was recorded in the fourth quarter. In addition, the companys repatriation of foreign earnings pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 resulted in a permanent tax savings of about $250 million. Largely as a result of these factors and costs associated with Visteon-related restructuring, special items reduced full-year income by 15 cents per share. Finally, full-year net income from continuing operations was reduced by 9 cents primarily for a cumulative change in accounting principles related to recent accounting guidance on the recognition of environmental obligations.
FULL-YEAR HIGHLIGHTS
Ford Motor Company full-year highlights include:
 
 
FOURTH QUARTER
In the fourth quarter, the company reported net income of $124 million, or 8 cents per share. This compares with fourth quarter net income of $104 million, or 6 cents per share, in 2004. Excluding special items, fourth quarter after-tax income from continuing operations totaled $511 million, or 26 cents per share, compared to $554 million, or 28 cents per share, a year ago.
 
Total sales and revenue in the fourth quarter were $47.6 billion, compared to $44.9 billion in the
year-ago period.
 
 
The following discussion of the results of our Automotive sector and Automotive business units is on a
pre-tax basis that excludes special items. See table following Safe Harbor/Risk Factors for the nature and amount of these special items and a reconciliation to GAAP.
AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR
For the full year, Fords worldwide Automotive sector reported a pre-tax loss of $1 billion, compared with pre-tax profit of $850 million a year ago. The decline primarily reflected unfavorable cost performance, volume and mix, and exchange, partially offset by net pricing.
For the fourth quarter, Fords worldwide Automotive sector reported a pre-tax loss of $12 million, an improvement of $458 million from a pre-tax loss of $470 million a year earlier. The improvement primarily reflected favorable volume and mix, net pricing, cost performance and exchange.
Worldwide automotive revenue for 2005 was $154.5 billion, an improvement from revenue of
$147.1 billion a year ago. Total fourth-quarter automotive revenue was $41.8 billion, an increase of
$3 billion from a year ago.
 
 
Total company vehicle unit sales in 2005 were 6,818,000, an increase of 20,000 units from 2004. Fourth-quarter vehicle unit sales totaled 1,853,000, an increase of 102,000 units from a year ago.
Automotive cash at Dec. 31, 2005, totaled $25.1 billion of cash, marketable securities, loaned securities and short-term Voluntary Employee Benefits Association (VEBA) assets.
THE AMERICAS

$1.6 billion a year ago. For the fourth quarter, the Americas had a pre-tax loss of $15 million, an improvement of $411 million compared to a pre-tax loss of $426 million a year earlier.
North America:
For 2005, Fords North America automotive operations reported a pre-tax loss of
$1.6 billion, a decline of $3 billion from 2004. The decline primarily reflected unfavorable cost performance, lower U.S. market share, lower dealer inventories and adverse exchange. For the year,
North Americas sales totaled $81.4 billion, compared with $83 billion a year earlier.
For the fourth quarter, North America automotive operations reported a pre-tax loss of $143 million, compared to a pre-tax loss of $470 million in 2004. The improvement primarily reflected cost reductions and favorable net pricing, partially offset by operating losses incurred by the former Visteon activities now controlled by Ford. Fourth-quarter sales were $22.1 billion, compared with $21.1 billion in 2004.
South America:
Fords South America automotive operations reported a pre-tax profit of $389 million,
an increase of $249 million from a 2004 pre-tax profit of $140 million. The improvement primarily reflected net pricing and favorable volume, as well as a stronger Brazilian currency. Full-year sales improved to $4.4 billion from $3 billion in 2004.
In the fourth quarter, Fords South America automotive operations posted a pre-tax profit of $128 million, an improvement of $84 million, compared with a pre-tax profit of $44 million in 2004. The improvement primarily reflected favorable net pricing and exchange. Fourth-quarter sales were $1.3 billion, an improvement from $899 million a year ago.
FORD EUROPE AND PREMIER AUTOMOTIVE GROUP (PAG)
The combined 2005 full-year pre-tax profit for Ford Europe and PAG was $36 million. This compares with a loss of $626 million for 2004. For the fourth quarter, Ford Europe and PAG had a combined pre-tax profit of $112 million, an improvement from a pre-tax loss of $324 million a year ago.
 
 
 
Ford Europe:
Ford Europe posted a full-year pre-tax profit of $136 million, compared with a pre-tax
profit of $114 million a year ago. The improvement primarily reflected favorable cost performance and exchange, partially offset by unfavorable net pricing and mix. Sales for the year totaled $30.2 billion, compared to $26.5 billion in 2004.
For the fourth quarter, Ford Europe reported a pre-tax profit of $66 million, an improvement from a pre-tax loss of $69 million a year ago. The improvement primarily reflected favorable cost performance and higher profits at our operations in Turkey, partially offset by unfavorable product mix. Fourth-quarter sales totaled $8.2 billion, compared to $7.4 billion a year ago.
Premier Automotive Group:
For 2005, PAG reported a full-year pre-tax loss of $100 million, an improvement from a pre-tax loss of $740 million a year ago. The improvement primarily reflected the impact of new products, primarily at Land Rover, that resulted in a richer mix and improved net pricing. Full-year sales for the group totaled $30.3 billion, compared to $27.6 billion in 2004.
In the fourth quarter, PAG reported a pre-tax profit of $46 million, an improvement of $301 million, compared with a pre-tax loss of $255 million in the year-ago period.

Fourth-quarter sales totaled $8 billion, compared to $7.8 billion a year ago.
ASIA PACIFIC AND AFRICA/MAZDA
For the full year, Asia Pacific and Africa/Mazda reported a pre-tax profit of $316 million, compared with a pre-tax profit of $163 million a year ago. In the fourth quarter, Asia Pacific and Africa/Mazda reported a pre-tax loss of $7 million, compared with a pre-tax loss of $22 million in 2004.
Asia Pacific and Africa:
For full-year 2005, Asia Pacific and Africa reported a pre-tax profit of
$61 million, an improvement of $16 million when compared with the year ago period. The improvement primarily reflected favorable exchange and higher volume, which was partially offset by unfavorable vehicle mix and higher costs. Full-year sales totaled $7.7 billion, an increase from $7 billion in 2004.
For the fourth quarter, Asia Pacific and Africa reported a pre-tax loss of $39 million, compared with a
pre-tax loss of $13 million in the year-ago period. The decline primarily reflected deterioration of results in Ford Australia due to lower volumes and unfavorable mix. Fourth-quarter sales totaled $1.8 billion, compared to $1.6 billion in 2004.
 
Mazda:
For full-year 2005, Fords share of the pre-tax profit of Mazda and associated operations was
$255 million, compared with $118 million a year ago. For the fourth quarter, Fords share of the pre-tax profit of Mazda and associated operations was a pre-tax-profit of $32 million, compared with a pre-tax loss of $9 million a year ago. The improvement in both periods primarily reflected gains in our investment in Mazdas convertible bonds, as well as higher operating results at Mazda.
FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR
Financial Services Sector results include The Hertz Corporation through Dec. 21, 2005, the date on which it was sold. For the full year, excluding special items, Fords Financial Services sector reported a pre-tax profit of $4.4 billion, compared with a pre-tax profit of $5 billion last year. For the fourth quarter, excluding special items, the Financial Services Sector earned a pre-tax profit of $881 million, compared with pre-tax profits of $1 billion a year ago.
Ford Motor Credit Company:
Ford Motor Credit reported net income of $2.5 billion in 2005, down
$370 million from a year earlier. On a pre-tax basis from continuing operations, Ford Motor Credit earned $3.9 billion in 2005, down $570 million from 2004.
In the fourth quarter of 2005, Ford Motor Credit's net income was $465 million, down $78 million from a year earlier. On a pre-tax basis from continuing operations, Ford Motor Credit earned $737 million in the fourth quarter, compared with $859 million the previous year. The decrease in earnings in both fourth-quarter and full-year 2005 primarily reflected lower volumes and margins, partially offset by lower
credit losses.
The Hertz Corporation:
Hertz reported a full-year 2005 pre-tax profit of $569 million, excluding special items, which was a year-over-year improvement of $76 million. Hertz reported a fourth-quarter pre-tax profit of $121 million, excluding special items, which was an increase of $14 million from the same
period in 2004.
