IMMEDIATE RELEASE
FORD MOTOR COMPANY REPORTS JANUARY U.S. SALES
INCREASED 2 PERCENT
 
 
 
DEARBORN,
Mich., Feb. 1 - Ford Motor Company's January U.S. sales increased 2 percent compared with a year ago. Car sales increased 18 percent and truck sales declined 7 percent - continuing trends seen in 2005. Last year, Ford posted its first car sales increase since 1999.
Ford's new mid-size sedans - the Ford Fusion, Mercury Milan, and Lincoln Zephyr - continued to gain momentum. Combined sales for the trio totaled 14,714, up 25 percent compared with December. In contrast, Ford estimates U.S. industry sales declined 20 percent from December to January, reflecting historical seasonal patterns. January's sales for the new mid-size sedans translate to an annual sales rate of 220,000 - well above Ford's original estimates.
Ford's F-Series truck, America's best selling vehicle for 24 years in a row, posted January sales of 52,771 up 7 percent. Sales for most other light trucks declined.
