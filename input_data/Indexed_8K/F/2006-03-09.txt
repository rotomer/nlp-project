Item 4.01. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant
.
On March 8, 2006, the Ford Motor Company Tax-Efficient Savings Plan for Hourly Employees (the "Plan") engaged Plante & Moran, PLLC ("Plante & Moran") as the independent accountant to audit the Plan's financial statements. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC"), the Plan's prior independent accountant, has been dismissed as of March 8, 2006. As a result, Plante & Moran will conduct the audit of the Plan's financial statements for the Plan year ended December 31, 2005 and the one-day Plan period ended December 31, 2004. The decision to change the independent accountant for the Plan was approved by the Audit Committee of Ford Motor Company's Board of Directors on March 8, 2006.
The change in accounting firm described above pertains only to the financial statements of the Plan and does not affect PwC's engagement as the independent registered public accounting firm of Ford Motor Company or Ford Motor Credit Company.
PwC's reports on the Plan's financial statements for the Plan years ended December 30, 2004 and December 30, 2003 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principle. During the years ended December 30, 2004 and December 30, 2003, and through March 8, 2006, there were no disagreements with PwC on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of PwC, would have caused them to make reference thereto in their reports on the financial statements for such years.
During the years ended December 30, 2004 and December 30, 2003 and through March 8, 2006, there have been no "reportable events" (as that term is defined in Item 304 (a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K issued under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), with respect to the Plan.
The Plan furnished PwC with a copy of this Current Report on Form 8-K prior to filing it with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). The Plan also requested that PwC furnish a letter addressed to the SEC stating whether it agrees with the statements made in this Current Report. A copy of PwC's letter addressed to the SEC is filed with this Current Report as Exhibit 16.1.
