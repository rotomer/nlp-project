Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On April 13, 2006, the Board of Directors of the Company, consistent with the practices of a number of other major corporations, approved the Company entering into individual indemnity agreements with each of the members of the Board of Directors implementing with more specificity the indemnification provisions provided by the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation dated August 2, 2000. Attached as an exhibit is the form of the Indemnity Agreement approved by the Board of Directors.
 
Item 2.05. Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
On April 13, 2006, Ford Motor Company committed to a plan to idle and cease production at its Twin Cities Assembly Plant in St. Paul, Minnesota, and its Norfolk Assembly Plant in Norfolk, Virginia. See our related press release, filed as Exhibit 99 and incorporated by reference herein, for a discussion of the facts and circumstances surrounding this action.
 
The idling of these two assembly plants is part of a plan announced by the Company on January 23, 2006, to idle 14 manufacturing facilities by 2012, including seven vehicle assembly plants, in its North American automotive operations. Associated with these plant closings, we intend to reduce total employment by 25,000 to 30,000 people during the period 2006 through 2012. In addition to the Twin Cities Assembly Plant and the Norfolk Assembly Plant, the other facilities that the Company previously announced would be idled are: the St. Louis Assembly Plant; the Atlanta Assembly Plant; the Wixom Assembly Plant; the Windsor Casting Plant; and the Batavia Transmission Plant. In addition, production at our St. Thomas Assembly Plant will be reduced to one shift. These actions will reduce Ford's North American assembly capacity by 1.2 million units, or 26%, by the end of 2008.
 
The special charges in 2006 associated with these actions are estimated at $2.4 billion on a pre-tax basis, which includes a pre-tax charge of approximately $1.7 billion related to costs associated with the expected layoffs and attendant jobs bank benefits (under the provisions of our collective bargaining agreements, we are required to pay idled workers who meet certain conditions substantially all of their wages and benefits for the term of the current agreements), and voluntary termination packages agreed to with our unions which we have offered and will offer to idled workers to avoid the payment of these benefits. Associated with these employee-related costs is a non-cash pre-tax charge of approximately $425 million related to a pension curtailment. In addition, associated with the idling of the plants is a pre-tax charge of approximately $280 million, primarily non-cash, of other facility related costs. 
 
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits
.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

 
Exhibit 10
 
 
 
Indemnification Agreement (this 
Agreement
), dated as of April __, 2006 between Ford Motor Company, a Delaware corporation (the 
Company
), and __________ (
Indemnitee
).
 
 
WHEREAS, highly competent persons have become more reluctant to serve publicly-held corporations as directors or in other capacities unless they are provided with adequate protection through insurance and indemnification against risks of claims and actions against them arising out of their service to and activities on behalf of the corporation.
 
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the 
Board
) has determined that, in order to attract and retain qualified individuals, the Company will attempt to maintain on an ongoing basis, at its sole expense, liability insurance to protect persons serving the Company and its subsidiaries from certain liabilities. Although the furnishing of such insurance has been a customary and widespread practice among United States-based corporations and other business enterprises, the Company believes that, given current market conditions and trends, such insurance may be available to it in the future only at higher premiums and with more exclusions. At the same time, directors, officers, and other persons in service to corporations or business enterprises are being increasingly subjected to expensive and time-consuming litigation relating to, among other things, matters that traditionally would have been brought only against the Company or business enterprise itself.
 
WHEREAS, the Certificate of Incorporation
 
of the Company provides that the Company shall indemnify and advance expenses to all directors and officers of the Company in the manner set forth therein and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and the Companys Certificate of Incorporation provides for limitation of liability for directors. In addition, Indemnitee may be entitled to indemnification pursuant to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (
DGCL
). The Certificate of Incorporation and the DGCL expressly provide that the indemnification provisions set forth therein are not exclusive, and thereby contemplate that contracts may be entered into between the Company and members of the board of directors, officers and other persons with respect to indemnification.
 
 
 
WHEREAS, the uncertainties relating to such insurance and to indemnification have increased the difficulty of attracting and retaining such persons.
 
WHEREAS, the Board has determined that the increased difficulty in attracting and retaining such persons is detrimental to the best interests of the Companys stockholders and that the Company should act to assure such persons that there will be increased certainty of such protection in the future.
 
WHEREAS, it is reasonable, prudent and necessary for the Company contractually to obligate itself to indemnify, and to advance expenses on behalf of, such persons to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law so that they will serve or continue to serve the Company free from undue concern that they will not be so indemnified.
 
WHEREAS, this Agreement is a supplement to and in furtherance of the Certificate of Incorporation Company and any resolutions adopted pursuant thereto and shall not be deemed a substitute therefor, nor to diminish or abrogate any rights of Indemnitee thereunder.
 
WHEREAS, Indemnitee is concerned that the protection available under the Companys charter and by-laws and insurance may not be adequate, and may not be willing to serve as an officer or director of the Company without greater certainty concerning such protection, and the Company desires Indemnitee to serve in such capacity and is willing to provide such greater certainty.
 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the covenants contained herein, the Company and Indemnitee do hereby covenant and agree as follows:
 
 
(a)

person
 means an individual, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, association, trust or other entity or organization.

 includes any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or other proceeding (which shall include an arbitration or other alternate dispute resolution mechanism), whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative in nature (including any appeal therefrom) and whether instituted by or on behalf of the Company or any other party, in any such case, in which Indemnitee was, is or may be involved as a party or otherwise by reason of any Corporate Status of Indemnitee or by reason of any action taken (or failure to act) by him or on his part while serving in any Corporate Status (in each case, whether or not serving in such capacity at the time any liability or expense is incurred for which indemnification or advancement of expenses can be provided under this Agreement), or any inquiry or investigation that Indemnitee in good faith believes might lead to the institution of any such action, suit or other proceeding;
provided
that Proceeding shall not include an action, suit or other proceeding contemplated by
Section 7.06(b)
.
 
(b)
  
For the purposes of this Agreement:
 
References to the Company shall include, in addition to the surviving or resulting corporation in any merger or consolidation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a merger or consolidation which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, employees or agents, so that if Indemnitee is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a
 
 
3
 
director, officer, employee or agent of another Enterprise, then Indemnitee shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Agreement with respect to the surviving or resulting corporation as Indemnitee would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.
 
References to director, officer, employee or agent shall include a trustee, general partner, managing member, fiduciary or board of directors committee member.
 
References to serving at the request of the Company shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any other Enterprise which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer, employee or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner not opposed to the best interests of the Company.
 
 
 
Section 2.01
. Services by Indemnitee.
Indemnitee hereby agrees to serve or continue to serve as a director of the Company, for so long as Indemnitee is duly elected or appointed or until Indemnitee tenders his resignation or is removed.
 
 
 
Section 3.01

(a)

any and all Expenses and Liabilities actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on Indemnitees behalf
.
 
(b)
  
To the extent that Indemnitee is a party to (or a participant in) and is successful, on the merits or otherwise, in respect of any Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter therein, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection therewith. If Indemnitee is successful, on the merits or otherwise, as to one or more but less than all claims, issues or matters in any Proceeding, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with each successfully resolved claim, issue
 
 
4
 
or matter and any claim, issue or matter related to each such successfully resolved claim, issue or matter. For purposes of this
Section 3.01(b)
and without limitation, the termination of any Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter in a Proceeding by dismissal, with or without prejudice, shall be deemed to be a successful result as to such Proceeding, claim, issue or matter.
 
(c)
  
To the extent that Indemnitee is, by reason of his Corporate Status, a witness in any Proceeding to which Indemnitee is not a party, he shall be indemnified against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection therewith.
 
Section 3.02
. Advancement of Expenses.
(a)
The Company shall advance any Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on his behalf in connection with a Proceeding within
 
20 days after receipt by the Company of a written request for advancement of expenses, which request may be delivered to the Company at such time and from time to time as Indemnitee deems appropriate in his sole discretion. Advances shall be made without regard to Indemnitees ability to repay such amounts and without regard to Indemnitees ultimate entitlement to indemnification under this Agreement or otherwise.
Any such advances shall be made on an unsecured basis and be interest free.
 
 
(b)
  
Indemnitee agrees that Indemnitee shall reimburse the Company for all amounts advanced by the Company pursuant to
Section 3.02
if and only to the extent that it is ultimately determined that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company for such Expenses.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Indemnitee seeks a judicial adjudication or an arbitration pursuant to

, Indemnitee shall not be required to reimburse the Company pursuant to this
Section 3.02(b)
until a final determination (as to which all rights of appeal have been exhausted or lapsed) has been made.

(i)
the Board authorized the action, suit or other proceeding (or part thereof) prior to its initiation or
(ii)
the Company provides the indemnification, in its sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the Company under applicable law
.
 
Section 3.04
. Defense Of Claims.

The Company shall not settle any Proceeding (in whole or in part) which would impose any Expense, Liability or limitation on Indemnitee without Indemnitees prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. Indemnitee shall not settle any Proceeding (in whole or in part) which would impose any Expense, Liability or limitation on the Company without the Companys prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

if the Company has not been previously notified, after receipt of written notice of any other matter with respect to which Indemnitee intends to seek indemnification or advancement of expenses under
Section 3.01
or
Section 3.02
. The omission by Indemnitee to so notify the Company will not relieve the Company from any liability which it may have to Indemnitee (i) under this Agreement except and only to the extent the Company can establish that such omission to notify resulted in actual material prejudice to the Company or (ii) otherwise than under this Agreement.
 
(b)
  
Indemnitee may thereafter deliver to the Company a written request for indemnification pursuant to this Agreement at such time and from time to time as Indemnitee deems appropriate in his sole discretio
n, which request shall also be deemed a request for advancement of expenses under
Section 3.02
.
 
Section 4.02
. Determination of Entitlement.
 
(a)
Except as otherwise provided pursuant to
Section 3.01(b)
and
Section 3.01(c)
, a determination shall be made with respect to Indemnitees entitlement thereto in the specific case
(i)
by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors or of a committee of Disinterested
 
 
6
 
Directors designated by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors (in either case, even though less than a quorum of the Board) or
(ii)
if there are no Disinterested Director or the Disinterested Directors so direct, by Independent Counsel. If a Change in Control shall have occurred, such determination shall, if so requested by Indemnitee in his or her discretion, be made by Independent Counsel. Any determination made by Independent Counsel pursuant to this
Section 4.02(a)
shall be in the form of a written opinion to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee. Indemnitee shall reasonably cooperate with the person or persons making such determination including providing to such person or persons upon reasonable advance request any documentation or information which is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and which is reasonably available to Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such determination. Any costs or expenses (including fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by Indemnitee in so cooperating with the person or persons making such determination shall be borne by the Company (irrespective of the determination as to Indemnitees entitlement to indemnification), and the Company hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold Indemnitee harmless therefrom.
 
 
As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings:
 
Disinterested Director
 means a director of the Company who is not and was not a party to the Proceeding in respect of which indemnification or advancement of expenses is sought by Indemnitee.
 
Change in Control
 shall be deemed to have occurred in any one of the following circumstances occurring after the date hereof:
 
(i)
  
any person or group (as such terms are used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act) (other than a trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the Company) shall have become, without prior approval of the Companys Board, the beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of voting securities of the Company representing 15% or more of the total voting power of the Companys then outstanding voting securities;
 
(ii)
  
the individuals who on the date hereof constitute the Board (including, for this purpose, any new director whose election or nomination for election by the Companys stockholders was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then still in office who were directors on the date hereof or whose election or nomination was so approved) cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the members of the Board; or
 
 
7
 
(iii)
  
the stockholders of the Company shall have approved a merger or consolidation of the Company with any other entity, other than a merger or consolidation which would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving or resulting entity) more than 51% of the total voting power of the voting securities of the surviving or resulting entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation
 
and with the power to elect at least a majority of the board of directors or other governing body of such surviving or resulting entity;
 
(iv)
  
the stockholders of the Company shall have approved a plan of complete liquidation of the Company or the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company;
 
(v)
  
there shall have occurred an event required to be reported with respect to the Company in response to Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A (or in response to any similar item on any similar schedule or form) under the Exchange Act, regardless of whether the Company is then subject to such reporting requirement.
 
Independent Counsel
 means a law firm, or a member of a law firm, that is experienced in matters of corporate law and neither currently is, nor in the five years previous to its selection or appointment has been, retained to represent (i) the Company or Indemnitee in any matter material to either such party (provided that acting as an Independent Counsel under this Agreement or in a similar capacity with respect to any other indemnification arrangements between the Company and its present or former directors shall not be deemed a representation of the Company or Indemnitee) or (ii) any other party to the Proceeding giving rise to a claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term Independent Counsel shall not include any person who, under the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing, would have a conflict of interest in representing either the Company or Indemnitee in an action to determine Indemnitees rights under this Agreement.
 
(b)
  
If the determination is to be made by Independent Counsel, such Independent Counsel shall be selected as provided in this
Section 4.02(b)
. If a Change in Control shall not have occurred, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Board (and shall be reasonably acceptable to Indemnitee), and the Company shall give written notice to Indemnitee advising him of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected. If a Change in Control shall have occurred, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by Indemnitee and be reasonably
 
 
8
 
acceptable to the Company (unless Indemnitee shall request that such selection be made by the Board, in which event the preceding sentence shall apply), and Indemnitee shall give written notice to the Company advising it of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected. If, within 20 days after receipt by the Company of a request for indemnification pursuant to
Section 4.01(b)
, no Independent Counsel shall have been selected and not objected to, either the Company or Indemnitee may petition a court of competent jurisdiction (or, at Indemnitees option pursuant to
Section 5.01
, an arbitration) for resolution of any objection which shall have been made to the selection of Independent Counsel and/or for the appointment of another person as Independent Counsel, and the person with respect to whom all objections are so resolved or the person so appointed shall act as Independent Counsel.
The Company agrees to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of any Independent Counsel appointed pursuant to this Section
and to indemnify such person against any and all expenses, claims, liabilities and damages arising out of or relating to this Agreement or its engagement pursuant hereto
. Upon the due commencement of any judicial proceeding pursuant to Section 5.01(a) of this Agreement, the Independent Counsel shall be discharged and relieved of any further responsibility in such capacity (subject to the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing).
 
(c)
  
The determination with respect to Indemnitees entitlement to indemnification shall, to the extent practicable, be made pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.02 not later than 30 calendar days after receipt by the Company of a written demand on the Company for indemnification (which written demand shall include such documentation and information as is reasonably available to Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification). The body or person making the determination with respect to Indemnitees entitlement to indemnification shall notify Indemnitee of such written determination no later than two business days thereafter.
 
(d)
  
If it is determined that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, payment to Indemnitee shall be made within 20 days after such determination.
 
Section 4.03
. Presumptions and Burdens of Proof; Effect of Certain Proceedings.
(a)
In making any determination as to Indemnitees entitlement to indemnification hereunder, Indemnitee shall be entitled to a presumption that he is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement if Indemnitee has submitted a request for indemnification in accordance with
Section 4.01(b)
, and the Company shall have the burdens of coming forward with evidence and of persuasion to overcome that presumption.
 
 
9
 
(b)
  
The termination of any Proceeding or of any claim, issue or matter therein by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not of itself create a presumption that Indemnitee did not meet any particular standard of conduct or have any particular belief or that a determination has been made that imdemnification is not permitted pursuant to this Agreement.
 
(c)
  
For purposes of any determination of good faith, Indemnitee shall be deemed to have acted in good faith if Indemnitees action is based on the records or books of account of the Company or other Enterprise, as applicable, including financial statements, or on information supplied to Indemnitee by the officers of such entity in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for such entity or on information or records given or reports made to such entity by an independent certified public accountant, appraiser or other expert selected with reasonable care by such entity. The provisions of this
Section 4.03(c)
shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way other circumstances in which Indemnitee may be deemed or found to have met the applicable standard of conduct
to be indemnified pursuant to this Agreement.
 
(d)
  
The knowledge or actions or failure to act of any other director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or other Enterprise, as applicable, shall not be imputed to Indemnitee for purposes of determining Indemnitees right to indemnification under this Agreement.
 
(e)
  
If a determination as to Indemnitees entitlement to indemnification shall not have been made pursuant to this Agreement within 60 days after receipt by the Company of the request therefor or
 
disposition of the matter that is the subject of the request for indemnification, the requisite determination of entitlement to indemnification shall be deemed to have been made in favor of Indemnitee, and Indemnitee shall be entitled to such indemnification, absent a misstatement of a material fact in the information provided by Indemnitee pursuant to
Section 4.01(b)
and
Section 4.02(a)
or an omission of a material fact necessary in order to make the information provided not misleading;
provided
that such 60-day period may be extended for a reasonable time, not to exceed an additional 30 days, if the person or persons making the determination in good faith requires such additional time to obtain or evaluate any documentation or information relating thereto.
 
 
Section 5.01
.
Adjudication or Arbitration
.
(a)
Indemnitee shall be entitled to an adjudication (by a court of competent jurisdiction or, at Indemnitees option,
 
 
10
 
through an arbitration conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association) of any determination pursuant to
Section 4.02
that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this Agreement.
Any such adjudication shall be conducted in all respects as a
de novo
trial or arbitration on the merits, and any prior adverse determination shall not be referred to or introduced into evidence, create a presumption that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses, be a defense or otherwise adversely affect Indemnitee. In any such judicial proceeding or arbitration, the provisions of
Section 4.03
(including the presumption in favor of Indemnitee and the burdens on the Company) shall apply.
 
(b)
  
Indemnitee shall also be entitled to an adjudication (by a court of competent jurisdiction or, at Indemnitees option, through an arbitration as described above) of any other disputes under this Agreement.
 
(c)
  
If a determination shall have been made pursuant to
Section 4.02
that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Company shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this
Section 5.01
, absent a misstatement of a material fact in the information provided by Indemnitee pursuant to
Section 4.01(b)
and
Section 4.02(a)
or an omission of a material fact necessary in order to make the information provided not misleading.
 
(d)
  
In connection with any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this
Section 5.01
, the Company shall not oppose Indemnitees right to seek such adjudication, shall be precluded from asserting that the procedures and presumptions of this Agreement are not valid, binding or enforceable and shall stipulate in any such court or before any such arbitrator that the Company is bound by all of the provisions of this Agreement
.
 
 
Section 6.01
. D&O Liability Insurance.
(a)
 
To the extent the Company obtains any insurance policies providing liability insurance (
Liability Insurance
) for directors of the Company in their capacities as directors or in any other capacities where they are acting for or on behalf of the Company, in respect of acts or omissions occurring while serving in any such capacity, Indemnitee shall be covered by such insurance policies as in effect from time to time in accordance with the applicable terms to the maximum extent of the coverage provided under such policies for any other director.
 
 
11
 
(b)
  
To the extent the Company has any such liability insurance policies, the Company shall, promptly after receiving notice of a Proceeding as to which Indemnitee is a party or a participant (as a witness or otherwise), give notice of such Proceeding to the insurers under such policies in accordance with the procedures set forth in the respective policies and shall thereafter take all necessary or desirable actions to cause such insurers to pay, on behalf of Indemnitee, all amounts payable as a result of such Proceeding in accordance with the terms of such policies. The failure or refusal of any such insurer to pay any such amount shall not affect or impair the obligations of the Company under this Agreement.
 
(c)
  
Upon request by Indemnitee, the Company shall provide to Indemnitee copies of the Liability Insurance policies as in effect from time to time. The Company shall promptly notify Indemnitee of any material changes in such insurance coverage.
 
 
Section 7.01
. Nonexclusivity of Rights.
The rights of indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which Indemnitee may at any time be entitled to under applicable law, the Companys certificate of incorporation or bylaws, any other agreement, any vote of stockholders or resolution of directors or otherwise.
No amendment, alteration or repeal of this Agreement or of any provision hereof shall limit or restrict any right of Indemnitee under this Agreement in respect of any action taken or omitted by such Indemnitee in his Corporate Status prior to such amendment, alteration or repeal. To the extent that a change in Delaware law, whether by statute or judicial decision, permits greater indemnification or advancement of expenses than would be afforded currently under this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties hereto that Indemnitee shall be entitled under this Agreement to the greater benefits so afforded by such change. No right or remedy herein conferred is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder or otherwise shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other right or remedy.
 
Section 7.02
. Subrogation, etc.
 
(a)
In the event of any payment under this Agreement, the Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and take all actions necessary to secure such rights, including execution of such
 
 
12
 
documents as are necessary to enable the Company to bring suit to enforce such rights.
 
(b)
  
The Company shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any payment of amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder (or for which advancement is provided hereunder) if and to the extent that Indemnitee has otherwise actually received such payment under any insurance policy or otherwise.
 
(c)
  
The Companys obligation to indemnify or advance expenses hereunder to Indemnitee who is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of any other Enterprise shall be reduced by any amount Indemnitee has actually received as indemnification or advancement of expenses from such Enterprise.

IMMEDIATE RELEASE
FORDS TWIN CITIES AND NORFOLK ASSEMBLY PLANTS
WILL BE IDLED AS WAY FORWARD PLAN MOVES AHEAD
DEARBORN, Mich., April 13, 2006 - Ford Motor Company [NYSE: F] today announced that its Twin Cities Assembly Plant in St. Paul, Minn., and the Norfolk Assembly Plant in Virginia will be idled in 2008 as part of the companys Way Forward plan to restore North American automotive operations to profitability no later than 2008.
Going forward, Ford will be able to maintain its production capacity and undisputed leadership of the full-size pickup truck market with fewer plants, thanks to flexible manufacturing.
The Way Forward plan, which was announced on Jan. 23, is a comprehensive roadmap to strengthen the companys Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brands through innovative new products, better quality, straightforward pricing, lower costs and more flexible, efficient operations. As part of the plan, Ford said in January that it would idle and cease manufacturing operations at 14 plants, including seven assembly plants.
 
 
 
 
In addition to Norfolk and Twin Cities, the plants announced to date include Wixom (Mich.) Assembly, St. Louis Assembly, Atlanta Assembly, Windsor (Ontario) Casting and Batavia (Ohio) Transmission.
A decision to end production at a plant is not an easy one and Im deeply mindful of the impact this decision has on Ford employees, families and communities, explains Mark Fields, Ford Motor Company executive president and president of The Americas. Unfortunately, these are necessary steps we must take to move the business forward.
The Way Forward is a long-term strategy and journey, Fields continues. But we are very satisfied with early progress and momentum, and we remain committed to all of the targets established in what remains a long-term strategy and journey.
The Norfolk plant, which opened in 1925, currently employs 2,275 hourly and 158 salaried workers. The Twin Cities plant, which also opened in 1925, employs 1,750 hourly and 135 salaried workers. These staff reductions are part of the 25,000 - 30,000 job workforce reduction announced as part of the Way Forward plan.
 
Even with the idling of Norfolk, Ford will remain the undisputed leader in full-size pickup truck sales, thanks to flexible manufacturing. In the first quarter, Ford sold 199,801 F-Series trucks, up more than 5 percent compared with a year ago, and posted a 2.7 point increase in segment market share, while many domestic and Asian competitors posted share declines. Ford said it is on track to sell more than 900,000 F-Series pickups for an unprecedented third year in a row.
Future product plans surrounding Ford compact pickups will be announced closer to the end of Ford Ranger production in Twin Cities in 2008. Ranger sales in the first quarter totaled 22,378 units, down 15.9 percent.
Ford also remains committed to building a new low-cost manufacturing site for the future, as the company announced in January.
