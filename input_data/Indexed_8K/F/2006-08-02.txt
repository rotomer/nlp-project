Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
.
We are revising our reported results for the second quarter of 2006 from that announced previously. On July 20, 2006, we announced a net loss of $123 million, or $0.07 per share. Our net loss for the second quarter of 2006 has been increased by $131 million to a net loss of $254 million, or $0.14 per share. This
 
change reflects an increase in estimates of our pension curtailment loss, as well as subsequent events with respect to conditions that existed as of the date of our balance sheet.
As a result of this, we now project our full-year 2006 pension curtailment expense to be $1.2 billion (up from $1 billion) and our full-year 2006 special items to be $3.8 billion.
 
 
Item 8.01. Other Events
.
At June 30, 2006, our retiree VEBA contained $6.2 billion, invested on a long-term basis consistent with our pension asset investments. We plan to change our investment strategy for this VEBA to invest about $3 billion of the total amount in shorter-duration fixed income investments to facilitate the payment of retiree benefits.
Based on the recent trend in sales, we now expect our Premier Automotive Group operating segment to be unprofitable for 2006. We previously projected it to be profitable, but close to breakeven, on a pre-tax basis (excluding special items) for 2006.
Our news release dated August 2, 2006 concerning the hiring of a strategic advisor, filed as Exhibit 99 to this report, is incorporated by reference herein.
 
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits
.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
