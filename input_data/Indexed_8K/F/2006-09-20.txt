North American Assembly Capacity Plans
 
There are several ways to measure our vehicle assembly capacity, two of which are installed capacity and manned capacity. Installed capacity refers to the physical capability of the plant and equipment if fully manned. Manned capacity refers to the degree to which the installed capacity has been staffed. In addition, in North America there generally exists the capability to work overtime or schedule downtime to adjust the manned capacity in the short term to match sales.
In the longer term, a useful measure of capacity is maximum installed capacity. This reflects the full physical capacity of the plant and equipment, including maximum overtime. In the shorter term, a useful measure is manned straight-time capacity. This reflects the extent to which labor is being utilized to make the installed capacity capable of actually assembling vehicles.
On September 15, 2006, we indicated that our North American assembly capacity would be reduced to
3.6 million units in 2008. As indicated in the table below, our projected North American sales divided by our maximum installed assembly capacity of 3.6 million units results in a capacity utilization rate of 84% in 2008. Our North American straight-time manned capacity utilization in 2008 is projected to be 100% as a result of plant idlings as well as shift eliminations and linespeed reductions. Reducing our manned capacity in this manner allows us to achieve major cost savings versus today, while allowing plant idlings to be coordinated with planned product changes, which we believe is the best economic approach.
 
 
-----
* Based on a two-shift operating pattern
By the end of the decade, our maximum installed assembly capacity in North America will be reduced so that it closely matches projected sales of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brand units.
