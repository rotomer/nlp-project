Item 2.05. Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
 
Reference is made to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed September 18, 2006, in which we stated that in response to changing facts and circumstances, Ford committed to an acceleration of its previously announced restructuring plan (referred to as our Way Forward plan), which accelerated plan was described therein. We also stated that neither the costs nor the cash expenditures, primarily for personnel separations, associated with these new and accelerated actions could at that time be reasonably estimated. We have now estimated the following life-time costs for such restructuring actions (in millions):
______
* As defined in Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006.
Of the total $11,182 million of estimated costs, $9,982 million has been accrued in 2006 and the balance, which is primarily related to salaried personnel-reduction programs, is expected to be accrued in the first quarter of 2007. We expect a curtailment gain for other postretirement employee benefit obligations related to hourly personnel separations that occur in 2007, which gain we expect to record in 2007. Of the costs estimated above, those relating to Job Bank Benefits and personnel-reduction programs also constitute cash expenditure estimates.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
