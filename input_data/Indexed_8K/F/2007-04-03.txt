Ford is moving quickly to operate profitably at lower volumes and a changed mix, and we are encouraged our retail market share appears to be stabilizing over the past several months, Fields adds. Our newest products also are achieving the sales targets we have set for ourselves, another sign that were making good progress.
 
Combined sales for Ford's new mid-size sedans were 24,094, up 40 percent compared with March 2006. Fusion sales were 15,790 (any-month record), up 48 percent compared with a year ago, and eclipsed the previous record of 15,468 set August 2006. Milan sales were 4,678 (any-month record), up 45 percent, and bettered the previous record of 4,156 set August 2006. Lincoln MKZ sales were 3,626, up 13 percent, a March record and second highest any-month.
The Ford Edge and Lincoln MKX crossovers were introduced in December 2006 and already are achieving sales levels comparable to long-established products in the crossover utility category. Edge sales were 10,915, up 37 percent compared with February and Lincoln MKX sales were 3,054, up 32 percent compared with February. In March, Ford, Mercury and Lincoln crossover sales totaled 37,915, up 42 percent compared with a year ago. In the first quarter of 2007, crossover sales totaled 89,081, up 29 percent compared with first quarter 2006.
An all-new full-size crossover will debut at the New York Auto show on Wednesday.

Compared with March 2006, which was F-Series' highest sales month of 2006, sales were down 15 percent. The company expects F-Series' comparisons to improve as availability of the all-new 2008 model Super Duty increases.
