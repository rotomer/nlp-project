DEARBORN, Mich., June 1  Ford Motor Companys new and redesigned crossovers are setting the pace in the industrys fastest-growing segment and helped Ford to achieve its best retail sales performance of 2007.

These new crossovers are the right products at the right time, said Mark Fields, Fords President of the Americas.  Consumer demand for the Ford Edge and Lincoln MKX has exceeded our original expectations, so were raising the bar.  We now expect Ford Edge sales to reach 120,000 this year  20 percent higher than our original forecast.
The redesigned 2008 model Ford Escape and Mercury Mariner crossovers also are scoring with consumers.  Escape sales were 18,953, up 13 percent from a year ago, and Mariner sales were 4,395, up 87 percent.  Each of these products posted their third highest sales month ever.  In addition, the Escape and Mariner hybrid models set May sales records.  Escape hybrid sales were 2,680 and Mariner hybrid sales were 534.
In total, Ford crossovers were up 67 percent compared with a year ago as the company continues to achieve the largest sales increase in the industrys fastest-growing segment.
Crossovers helped Ford to post a solid retail result in May.  Although retail sales were 3 percent lower than a year ago, May was the best retail performance for any month this year.  The companys total sales (including sales to fleet customers) were 259,470, down 7 percent.  The larger decline in total sales reflected a planned reduction in sales to daily rental companies.
Other new and redesigned products contributed to Fords strong retail performance in May.  Retail sales for the Ford Expedition were higher than a year ago, and Expedition sales have increased nine months in a row.
The Lincoln brand posted another retail sales increase  its eighth month in a row of higher retail sales.  Lincolns rebound has resulted from sales of the new Lincoln MKX crossover, the new Lincoln MKZ sedan and the redesigned Navigator.
Land Rover dealers reported a 7 percent sales increase in May, reflecting the addition of the all-new LR2 crossover.
