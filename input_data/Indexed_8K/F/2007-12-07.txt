Item 3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
Pursuant to an agreement entered into on December 4, 2007, on December 7, 2007, Ford Motor Company ("Ford") issued an aggregate of 62,000,761 shares of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share,  in exchange for $441,991,000 principal amount of Ford's 6 3/8% Debentures due February 1, 2029 and $124,943,000 principal amount of Ford's 6 5/8% Debentures due October 1, 2028 (collectively, the "Debentures"), beneficially owned by an institutional holder of the Debentures.  Ford did not receive any cash proceeds as a result of the exchange of its common stock for the Debentures, which Debentures have been retired and cancelled.  Ford completed this transaction to reduce its debt and interest costs, increase its equity and, thereby, improve its balance sheet.
The issuance of the shares of Ford common stock in this exchange was made by Ford pursuant to the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, contained in Section 3(a)(9) of such act on the basis that this offer constituted an exchange with an existing holder of Ford securities and no commission or other remuneration was paid to any party for soliciting such exchange.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
