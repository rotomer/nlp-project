Ford Fusion retail sales were up 31 percent, Mercury Milan retail sales were up 19 percent and Lincoln MKZ retail sales were up 20 percent.

Lower sales to daily rental companies (down 32 percent) also contributed to the companys sales decline.  Overall, Ford, Lincoln and Mercury sales totaled 189,247, down 12 percent compared with a year ago.  Retail sales to individual customers were down 7 percent.
Total Ford Motor Company sales, including Jaguar, Land Rover, and Volvo, totaled 200,727, down 12 percent.
