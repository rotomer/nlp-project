Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
On March 25, 2008, Ford Motor Company (Ford, the "Company," "we," "our," or "us") signed a sale and purchase agreement (the Sale and Purchase Agreement) with Tata Motors Limited (Tata Motors) for the sale of our Jaguar and Land Rover operations ("Jaguar Land Rover").  The sale was completed on June 2, 2008.
Under the terms of the transaction, Tata Motors purchased 100% of the outstanding shares in Jaguar Cars Limited, Land Rover and related companies, and their respective subsidiaries, and certain assets used by Jaguar Land Rover, including ownership rights in, or licenses to use, related intellectual property and the assets of related national sales companies, that were owned by Ford affiliates not being transferred.
We received approximately $2.4 billion in cash for the sale of Jaguar Land Rover.  Included in this amount is about $100 million representing an estimate of purchase price adjustments for cash and debt balances transferred to Tata Motors at the time of sale.  As part of the transaction, we contributed about $600 million to the Jaguar Land Rover pension plans.  Accordingly, net cash received on June 2, 2008 totaled about $1.8 billion.  Total proceeds are subject to additional purchase price adjustments (e.g., relating to working capital, cash, and debt) which will be calculated and paid pursuant to the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement.
 
Item 8.01. Other Events.
 
We review and present our business results in two sectors: Automotive and Financial Services.  Within these sectors, our business is divided into reportable segments based upon the organizational structure used to evaluate performance and make decisions on resource allocation, as well as availability and materiality of separate financial results consistent with that structure.  Our Automotive sector results were formerly reported in the following five segments:  Ford North America, Ford South America, Ford Europe, Premier Automotive Group, and Ford Asia Pacific and Africa/Mazda.  Beginning with the first quarter of 2008, we changed our Automotive sector reporting to disclose the following seven segments:  Ford North America, Ford South America, Ford Europe, Volvo, Ford Asia Pacific Africa, Mazda and Associated Operations, and Jaguar Land Rover and Aston Martin. Included in each segment described below are the associated costs to design, develop, manufacture, and service vehicles and parts.
Ford North America segment includes primarily the sale of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brand vehicles and related service parts in North America (the United States, Canada and Mexico).  Also included within this segment is the sale of Mazda6 vehicles by our consolidated subsidiary, AutoAlliance International, Inc. (previously included in the results for Ford Asia Pacific Africa).
Ford South America segment includes primarily the sale of Ford-brand vehicles and related service parts in South America.
Ford Europe segment includes primarily the sale of Ford-brand vehicles and related service parts in Europe (including all parts of Turkey and Russia).
The Volvo segment includes primarily the sale of Volvo-brand vehicles and related service parts throughout the world (including in North America, South America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Africa).
Ford Asia Pacific Africa segment includes primarily the sale of Ford-brand vehicles and related service parts in the Asia Pacific region and Africa.
The Mazda and Associated Operations segment includes our share of the results of Mazda Motor Corporation ("Mazda"), of which we owned 33.4% at December 31, 2007, as well as certain of our Mazda-related investments.
The Jaguar Land Rover and Aston Martin segment includes primarily the sale of Jaguar Land Rover brand vehicles and related service parts throughout the world (including in North America, South America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Africa).  In May 2007, we completed the sale of our 100% interest in Aston Martin and, therefore, the sale of Aston Martin-brand vehicles and related service parts throughout the world are included within this segment up until the date of sale.
Exhibit 99.1, filed with this Report and incorporated herein by reference, updates "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007 ("Form 10-K Report") (with revisions to Notes 13, 18, and 25 of the Notes to the Financial Statements, and an updated Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm) to reflect the changes in our segment reporting structure described above.
 
 
 
 
Updates to the Form 10-K Report relate solely to the presentation of segment-specific disclosures on a basis consistent with the changes in segment reporting structure, and have no effect on our previously-reported results of operations, financial condition or cash flows in the Form 10-K Report.  All other information in the Form 10-K Report remains materially unchanged and has not been otherwise updated for events occurring after the date of filing of February 27, 2008.  The information in this Report should be read in conjunction with our Form 10-K Report and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2008.

Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits
The following unaudited pro forma condensed statements of income (consolidated and sector) for the year ended December 31, 2007 and the three months ended March 31, 2008 have been prepared to present our results of operations as if the sale of Jaguar Land Rover had occurred at the beginning of the annual period.  The unaudited pro forma condensed balance sheets (consolidated and sector) as of March 31, 2008 have been prepared to present our financial position as if the sale of Jaguar Land Rover had occurred on March 31, 2008.
These pro forma financial statements do not purport to be indicative of the financial position or results of operations of Ford as of such date or for such periods, nor are they necessarily indicative of future results.  We have agreed with Tata Motors that we will continue to supply Jaguar Land Rover with engines, stampings and technologies.  The pro forma adjustments to our balance sheet reflect these activities; adjustments to the income statement do not, and these activities are not expected to be significant to our income/(loss) from continuing operations.

NOTE 1.  PRINCIPLES OF PRESENTATION AND CONSOLIDATION
Principles of Presentation and Consolidation
Our financial statements are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States and are shown on a consolidated basis, and on a sector basis for Automotive and Financial Services.  We believe the additional information provided in the sector statements enables the reader to better understand the operating performance, financial position, cash flows, and liquidity of our two very different businesses.  The difference between the total assets and total liabilities as presented in our sector balance sheet and our consolidated balance sheet is the result of netting of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Our financial statements include consolidated majority-owned subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entities ("VIEs") of which we are the primary beneficiary.  The equity method of accounting is used for our investments in entities for which we do not have control or are not the primary beneficiary, but over whose operating and financial policies we have the ability to exercise significant influence.
To provide comparative prior-year balance sheets, certain amounts on our December 31, 2006 consolidated and sector balance sheets and related footnotes have been reclassified for operations held for sale in 2007.  See Note 20 for information about our held-for-sale operations.
Certain Transactions Between Automotive and Financial Services Sectors
Intersector transactions occur in the ordinary course of business.  We formally documented certain long-standing business practices with Ford Motor Credit Company LLC ("Ford Credit"), our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, in a 2001 agreement that was amended in 2006.  Additional details on certain transactions and the effect on each sector's balance sheet at December 31 are shown below (in billions):
 
__________
Additionally, amounts recorded as revenue by the Financial Services sector and billed to the Automotive sector for interest supplements and other support costs for special financing and leasing programs were $4.6 billion in 2007, $3.5 billion in 2006, and $3.3 billion in 2005.  The Automotive sector had accrued in $5.4 billion and $4.6 billion for interest supplements at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and about $900 million for residual-value supplements in the United States and Canada to be paid to Ford Credit over the term of the related finance contracts at December 31, 2007 and 2006.
Accrued liabilities and deferred revenue
 
FS - 8
 
NOTE 2.  SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Automotive sales consist primarily of revenue generated from the sale of vehicles.  Sales are recorded when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to our customers (generally dealers and distributors).  For the majority of our sales, this occurs when products are shipped from our manufacturing facilities.  When vehicles are shipped to customers or modifiers on consignment, revenue is recognized when the vehicle is sold to the ultimate customer.  We also sell vehicles to daily rental car companies subject to guaranteed repurchase options.  These vehicles are accounted for as operating leases.  At the time of transfer, the proceeds are recorded as deferred revenue in .  The difference between the proceeds and the guaranteed repurchase amount is recognized in over the term of the lease, using a straight-line method.  Also at the time of transfer, the cost of the vehicles is recorded as an operating lease in .  The difference between the cost of the vehicle and the estimated auction value is depreciated in c over the term of the lease.  At December 31, 2007 and 2006, included in was $3.2 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively, and included in was $2.9 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively, for these vehicles.

Revenue Recognition  Financial Services Sector
Revenue from finance receivables (including direct financing leases) is recognized using the interest method.  Certain origination costs on receivables are deferred and amortized, using the interest method, over the term of the related receivable as a reduction in financing revenue.  Rental revenue on operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.  Initial direct costs related to leases are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.  The accrual of rental payments on operating leases and interest on receivables is discontinued at the time a receivable is determined to be uncollectible.
Income generated from cash and cash equivalents, investments in marketable securities, and other miscellaneous receivables is reported in .
Financial Services revenues
Marketing Incentives and Interest Supplements
Marketing incentives, including customer and dealer cash payments and costs for special financing and leasing programs paid to the Financial Services sector, are recognized by the Automotive sector as revenue reductions.  These revenue reductions are accrued at the later of the date the related vehicle sales to the dealers are recorded or the date the incentive program is both approved and communicated.  We generally estimate these accruals using marketing incentives that are approved as of the balance sheet date and are expected to be effective at the beginning of the subsequent period.  The Financial Services sector identifies payments for special financing and leasing programs as interest supplements or other support costs and recognizes them consistent with the earnings process of the underlying receivable or operating lease.
Supplier Price Adjustments
We frequently negotiate price adjustments with our suppliers throughout a production cycle, even after receiving production material.  These price adjustments relate to changes in design specifications or to other commercial terms such as economics, productivity, and competitive pricing.  We recognize price adjustments when we reach final agreement with our suppliers.  In general, we avoid direct price changes in consideration of future business; however, when these occur, our policy is to defer the financial statement impact of any such price change given explicitly in consideration of future business where guaranteed volumes are specified.
Raw Material Arrangements
We negotiate prices for and facilitate the purchase of raw materials on behalf of our suppliers.  These raw material arrangements, which take place independently of any purchase orders being issued to our suppliers, are negotiated at arms length and do not involve volume guarantees to either party.  When we pass the risks and rewards of ownership to our suppliers, including inventory risk, market price risk, and credit risk for the raw material, we record both the cost of the

Warranty and Extended Service Plans
Estimated warranty costs and additional service actions are accrued for at the time the vehicle is sold to a dealer, including costs for basic warranty coverage on vehicles sold, product recalls, and other customer service actions.  Fees or premiums for the issuance of extended service plans are recognized in income over the contract period in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in performing services under the contract.
Government Grants and Loan Incentives
From time to time, we receive grants and loan incentives from domestic and foreign governments.  They are recorded in the financial statements as dictated by the grant agreement, either as a reduction of expenses or a reduction of the cost of the capital investment.  The benefit of grants and loan incentives is recorded when performance is complete and all conditions as specified in the agreement are fulfilled.  When recorded as a reduction of expense, grants and loan incentives are recorded as a reduction in .

Foreign Currency Translation
The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries using the local currency as their functional currency are translated to U.S. dollars using end-of-period exchange rates and any resulting translation adjustments are contained in   The net translation adjustments for 2007 and 2006 were an increase in net assets and of $1.8 billion and $2.6 billion (net of tax of $0 for 2007 and $3 million benefit for 2006), respectively.  In 2005, the net translation adjustment was a decrease in net assets and   of $3.7 billion (net of tax of $299 million).  This net translation adjustment also reflects amounts transferred to net income as a result of the sale or liquidation of an entity, resulting in a gain of $116 million (primarily from the sale of Hertz) in 2005.

For additional discussion of hedging activities, see Note 23.  The net after-tax income effects of these adjustments were a gain of $217 million in 2007, a loss of $17 million in 2006, and a gain of $621 million in 2005.

Cash and cash equivalents and investments that are restricted as to withdrawal or usage under the terms of certain contractual arrangements are recorded in on our consolidated balancesheet.

Marketable, Loaned and Other Securities
We classify securities as trading, available-for-sale, or held-to-maturity.  Trading and available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value, and held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost.  The fair value of trading and available-for-sale securities is determined by quoted market prices.  The estimated fair value of securities for which there are no quoted market prices is based on similar types of securities traded in the market.  Realized gains and losses are accounted for using the specific identification method.
Unrealized gains and losses on trading securities, as well as realized gains and losses for all securities, are recorded in and .  Unrealized holding gains and losses for available-for-sale securities are reported, net of tax, in .
Automotive interest income and other non-operating income/(expense), net
Financial Services revenues
Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss)
We utilize a systematic process to evaluate whether unrealized losses related to investments in debt and equity securities are temporary in nature.  Factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been below cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery.  If losses are determined to be other than temporary, the investment carrying amount is considered impaired and adjusted downward to a revised fair basis.
Expected maturities of debt securities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without penalty.
We loan certain securities from our portfolio to other institutions.  Such securities are classified as .  Collateral for the loaned securities, consisting of cash or other securities, is maintained at a rate of 102% of the market value of a loaned security.  We have securities as collateral in the amount of $10 billion and $4.4 billion for 2007 and 2006, respectively.  These securities have not been pledged or sold.  We have cash as collateral in the amount of $480 million and $931 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively.  This cash collateral is recorded in on the consolidated balance sheet and on the sector balance sheet offset by a current obligation to return the collateral inon the consolidated balance sheet and on the sector balance sheet.

Allowance for Credit Losses
The allowance for credit losses is our estimate of the probable credit losses inherent in finance receivables and operating leases at the date of the balance sheet and is included in and .  The allowance is based on factors such as historical trends in credit losses and recoveries (including key metrics such as delinquencies, repossessions, and bankruptcies), the composition of our present portfolio (including vehicle brand, term, risk evaluation, and new/used vehicles), trends in historical and projected used vehicle values and economic conditions.  Additions to the allowance for credit losses are recorded as charges to the Finance receivables and lease investments are charged to the allowance for credit losses at the earlier of the time an account is deemed to be uncollectible or the account is 120 days delinquent, taking into consideration the financial condition of the borrower or lessee, the value of the collateral, recourse to guarantors and other factors. Recoveries on finance receivables and lease investments previously charged off as uncollectible are credited to the allowance for credit losses.

NOTE 2.  SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Sales of Receivables
Ford Credit securitizes finance receivables and net investment in operating leases and sells retail installment sale contracts in whole-loan sale transactions to fund operations and to maintain liquidity.  Most of its securitizations do not meet the criteria for off-balance sheet treatment.  As a result, the securitized assets and associated debt remain on its balance sheet and no gain or loss is recorded for these transactions.
Ford Credit records its sales of receivables as off-balance sheet when each of the following criteria is met:
For off-balance sheet sales of receivables, gains or losses are recognized in the period in which the sale occurs.  Ford Credit retains certain interests in receivables sold in off-balance sheet securitization transactions.  In determining the gain or loss on each sale of finance receivables, the investment in the sold receivables pool is allocated between the portions sold and retained based on their relative fair values at the date of sale.  Retained interests may include residual interest in securitizations, restricted cash held for the benefit of securitization investors, and subordinated securities. These interests are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains recorded, net of tax, as a separate component of .  Residual interests in securitizations represent the present value of monthly collections on the sold finance receivables in excess of amounts needed for payment of the debt and other obligations issued or arising in the securitization transactions.  Ford Credit does not retain any interests in the whole-loan sale transactions but continues to service the sold receivables.
Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss)
In both off-balance sheet securitization transactions and whole-loan sales, Ford Credit also retains the servicing rights and generally receives a servicing fee.  The fee is recognized as collected over the remaining term of the related sold finance receivables. Ford Credit establishes a servicing asset or liability when the servicing fee does not adequately compensate for retaining the servicing rights.  Interest supplement payments due from affiliates related to receivables sold in off-balance sheet securitizations or whole-loan sale transactions are recorded, on a present value basis, as a receivable in on its balance sheet at the time the receivables are sold.  Present value accretion is recognized in .

Financial Services revenues
Depreciation and Amortization
Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated primarily using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset.  Useful lives range from 3 years to 36 years.  The estimated useful lives generally are 14.5 years for machinery and equipment, and 30 years for buildings and land improvements.  Maintenance, repairs, and rearrangement costs are expensed as incurred.
Beginning January 1, 2006, we changed our method of amortization for special tools from an activity-based method (units-of-production) to a time-based method.  The time-based method amortizes the cost of special tools over their expected useful lives using a straight-line method or, if the production volumes for major product programs associated

NOTE 2.  SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(Continued)
with the tools are expected to materially decline over the life of the tool, an accelerated method reflecting the rate of decline.  For 2006, this change in method decreased by $135 million.
Automotive cost of sales
Goodwill
Beginning with 2006, our policy is to perform annual testing of goodwill and certain other net intangible assets during the fourth quarter to determine whether any impairment has occurred.  Goodwill impairment testing is also performed following an allocation of goodwill to a business to be disposed, or following a triggering event for the long-lived asset impairment test.  Testing is conducted at the reporting unit level, which is generally the same level as our operating segments.  To test for goodwill impairment, the carrying value of each reporting unit is compared with its fair value.  Fair value is estimated using the present value of free cash flows method.  Prior to 2006, our policy was to test in the second quarter; in 2005, we tested in both the second and fourth quarters.  Fourth quarter testing is considered preferable because it allows us to use more current financial information and matches our business plan timing.  This change in accounting principle does not delay, accelerate or avoid an impairment charge or affect our financial statements.
Asset Impairments
  We perform an impairment test on an asset group to be discontinued, held for sale, or otherwise disposed of when management has committed to the action and the action is expected to be completed within one year.  We estimate fair value to approximate the expected proceeds to be received, less transaction costs, and compare it to the carrying value of the asset group.  An impairment charge is recognized when the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value.
Held-for-Sale and Discontinued Operations.
We monitor the carrying value of long-lived asset groups held and used for potential impairment when certain triggering events have occurred.  These events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses.  When a triggering event occurs, a test for recoverability is performed, comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows (utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates) to the carrying value of the asset group.  If the test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment, the asset group's fair value is measured relying primarily on the discounted cash flow methodology.  Additionally, we consider various market multiples (e.g., revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA")) and consult with external valuation experts.  An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value.
Held-and-Used Long-Lived Assets.  
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities, our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and our revenue and expenses during the periods reported.  Estimates are used when accounting for certain items such as marketing accruals, warranty costs, employee benefit programs, etc.  Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances.  Due to the inherent uncertainty involved with estimates, actual results may differ.

NOTE 4.  FINANCE RECEIVABLES  FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR
Net finance receivables at December 31 were as follows (in millions):
__________
Finance receivables that originated outside of the United States were $55.7 billion and $49.4 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  Other finance receivables consisted primarily of real estate, commercial and other collateralized loans and accrued interest.  At December 31, 2007, finance receivables included $1.7 billion owed by the three customers with the largest receivables balances.
Included in net finance and other receivables at December31, 2007 and 2006 were $67.2 billion and $56.5 billion, respectively, of finance receivables that have been sold for legal purposes in securitizations that do not satisfy the requirements for accounting sale treatment.  These receivables are available only for payment of the debt or other obligations issued or arising in the securitization transactions; they are not available to pay our other obligations or the claims of our other creditors.
 
The fair value of finance receivables is generally calculated by discounting future cash flows using an estimated discount rate that reflects the current credit, interest rate, and prepayment risks associated with similar types of instruments.  For finance receivables with short maturities (generally three months or less), the book value approximates fair value.

Assets subject to operating leases are depreciated on the straight-line method over the term of the lease to reduce the asset to its estimated residual value.  Estimated residual values are based on assumptions for used vehicle prices at lease termination and the number of vehicles that are expected to be returned.  Operating lease depreciation expense (which includes gains and losses on disposal of assets) was as follows (in millions):

Retained Interest in Securitized Assets
Components of retained interest in off-balance sheet securitized assets at December 31 included the following (in millions):
Investments in subordinated securities and restricted cash are senior to the residual interest in securitization transactions.  Retained interests are recorded at fair value.  The fair value of restricted cash held for investors is calculated based on the projected amortization of the cash and discounted at the transaction discount rate.  In determining the fair value of residual interest in securitization transactions, Ford Credit discounts the projected cash flows retained at the transaction discount rates.
Investment and Other Income
The following table summarizes the activity related to off-balance sheet sales of receivables reported in for the years ended December 31 (in millions):
Financial Services revenues
For the year ended December 31, 2007, Ford Credit utilized certain point-of-sale assumptions to value the residual interest in its retail transactions, which included a discount rate of 12.5%, prepayment speeds of 1.5% (which represent expected payments earlier than scheduled maturity dates), and net credit losses of 1.3% over the life of sold receivables.  The weighted-average life of the underlying assets was 56.1 months.  For the year ended December 31, 2006, Ford Credit utilized certain point-of-sale assumptions to value the residual interest in its retail transactions, which included a discount rate of 11.0%, prepayment speeds of 0.9% to 1.5% (which represent expected payments earlier than scheduled maturity dates), and net credit losses of 0.1% to 2.3% over the life of sold receivables.

Cash Flow
The following table summarizes the cash flow movements between the transferees and Ford Credit in its off-balance sheet sales of receivables for the years ended December 31 (in millions):
During the fourth quarter of 2005, Ford Credit consolidated its off-balance sheet wholesale securitization program as a result of certain changes authorized in accordance with the transaction documents.  The accounting consolidation did not have an impact on Ford Credit's earnings, credit facilities, unsecured debt programs or other securitization programs.  This transaction was primarily non-cash and increased receivables by $17.9 billion and debt by $15.8 billion upon consolidation.
Ford Credit repurchased $36 million, $36 million, and $43 million of receivables in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively, relating to off-balance sheet sales of receivables due to receivable contract modifications or breach of initial eligibility criteria representations.
Other Disclosures
The following table summarizes key assumptions used at December 31, 2007 in estimating cash flows from off-balance sheet sales of retail receivables, and the corresponding sensitivity of the current fair values to 10% and 20% adverse changes (in millions, except percentages):
The effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of residual interest in securitization transactions was calculated without changing any other assumptions, although changes in one factor may result in changes in another.

Outstanding delinquencies over 30 days related to the off-balance sheet securitized portfolio were $180 million and $208 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  Credit losses, net of recoveries, were $65 million and $84 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  Expected static pool credit losses related to
outstanding securitized retail receivables were 1.1% at December 31, 2007.  To calculate the static pool credit losses, actual and projected future credit losses are added together and divided by the original balance of each pool of assets.
On-Balance Sheet Securitizations
At December 31, 2007 and 2006, finance receivables of $67.2 billion and $56.5 billion, respectively, have been sold for legal purposes in securitizations that do not satisfy the requirements for accounting sale treatment.  In addition, at December 31, 2007 and 2006, net investment in operating leases of $18.9 billion and $15.2 billion, respectively, have been included in securitizations that do not satisfy the requirements for accounting sale treatment.  These receivables and net investment in operating leases are available only for payment of the debt or other obligations issued or arising in the securitization transactions.  At December 31, 2007 and 2006, associated debt of $69.2 billion and $59.6 billion, respectively, is reported on Ford Credit balance sheet for financial statement reporting purposes.  This debt includes long-term and short-term asset-backed debt that is payable only out of collections on the underlying securitized assets and related enhancements.  The cash balances to be used only to support the on-balance sheet securitizations at December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $4.7 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively.  On-balance sheet securitizations generally use VIEs of which Ford Credit is the primary beneficiary.

During 2006, we projected a decline in net cash flows for the Ford North America segment, primarily reflecting lower market share assumptions and capacity reductions.  As a result, in the third quarter of 2006, we tested the long-lived assets of this segment for recoverability and recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $2.2 billion in , representing the amount by which the carrying value of these assets exceeded the fair value.
Automotive cost of sales
During the third quarter of 2006, we also reviewed our business plan for the Jaguar Land Rover operating unit and, consistent with 2006 operating results, projected lower sales, a decline in net cash flows for this operating unit based on cost performance shortfalls and currency exchange deterioration.  As a result, we tested the long-lived assets of this operating unit for recoverability and recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $1.6 billion in , representing the amount by which the carrying value of these assets exceeded the fair value.
Automotive cost of sales
During 2005, we updated our Premier Automotive Group ("PAG") Improvement Plan for the Jaguar Land Rover operating unit.  We projected a decline in net cash flows for the Jaguar Land Rover operating unit, based on updated market projections primarily reflecting recent market performance for Jaguar.  As a result, we tested the long-lived assets of this operating unit for recoverability and recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $1.3 billion in representing the amount by which the carrying value of these assets exceeded the fair value.

NOTE 14.  VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES
We consolidate VIEs of which we are the primary beneficiary.  The liabilities recognized as a result of consolidating these VIEs do not necessarily represent additional claims on our general assets; rather, they represent claims against the specific assets of the consolidated VIEs.  Conversely, assets recognized as a result of consolidating these VIEs do not represent additional assets that could be used to satisfy claims against our general assets.  Reflected in our December 31, 2007 and 2006 balance sheets are consolidated VIE assets of $6.3 billion and $5.6 billion, respectively, for the Automotive sector and $82.4 billion and $69.5 billion, respectively, for the Financial Services sector.

VIEs of which we are the primary beneficiary:
Activities with the joint ventures described below include purchasing substantially all of the joint ventures' output under a cost-plus-margin arrangement and/or volume dependent pricing.  Described below are the most significant of the VIEs that were consolidated.
AutoAlliance International, Inc. ("AAI") is a 50/50 joint venture with Mazda in North America.  AAI is engaged in the manufacture of automobiles on behalf of Ford and Mazda, primarily for sale in North America.
Ford Otosan ("Otosan") is a joint venture in Turkey with the Koc Group of Turkey (41% partner) and public investors (18%).  Otosan is the single-source supplier of the Ford Transit Connect model, and an assembly supplier of the Ford Transit van model, both of which we sell primarily in Europe.
Getrag Ford Transmissions GmbH ("GFT") is a 50/50 joint venture with Getrag Deutsche Venture GmbH and Co. KG.  GFT is the primary supplier of manual transmissions for use in our European vehicles.
Getrag All Wheel Drive AB is a 40/60 joint venture between Volvo Cars and Getrag Dana Holding GmbH. The joint venture produces all-wheel-drive components.
Tekfor Cologne GmbH ("Tekfor") is a 50/50 joint venture with Neumayer Tekfor GmbH. Tekfor produces transmission and chassis components for use in our vehicles.
Pininfarina Sverige, AB is a 40/60 joint venture between Volvo Cars and Pininfarina, S.p.A. The joint venture was established to engineer and manufacture niche vehicles.
We also hold interests in certain Ford and/or Lincoln Mercury dealerships.  At December 31, 2007, we consolidated a portfolio of approximately 83 dealerships that are part of our Dealer Development program.  The program's purpose is to facilitate the establishment of independent franchised dealers by allowing a participating dealership to become the sole owner of a Ford and/or Lincoln Mercury dealership corporation by purchasing equity from us using the operator's share of dealership net profits.  We supply and finance the majority of vehicles and parts to these dealerships, and the operators have a contract to buy our equity interest over a period of time.
VIEs of which we are not the primary beneficiary:
In 2005, as part of the Hertz transaction, we provided cash-collateralized letters of credit to support the payment obligations of Hertz Vehicle Financing, a VIE which is wholly owned by Hertz and of which we are not the primary beneficiary.  The fair value of our obligation related to these letters of credit, which will expire no later than December 21, 2011, was approximately $18 million at December 31, 2007.  For additional discussion of these letters of credit, see Note 28.
The risks and rewards associated with our interests in joint ventures deemed to be VIEs of which we are not the primary beneficiary are based primarily on ownership percentages.  Our maximum exposure (approximately $357 million at December 31, 2007) to any potential losses, should they occur, associated with these VIEs is limited to equity investments.

Ford Credit uses SPEs in a variety of securitizations.  Some on-balance sheet securitizations discussed in Note 7 use SPEs that are considered VIEs of which Ford Credit is the primary beneficiary, and these SPEs have been consolidated.
VIEs of which we are not the primary beneficiary:
Ford Credit has investments in certain joint ventures deemed to be VIEs of which it is not the primary beneficiary.  The risks and rewards associated with Ford Credit's interests in these entities are based primarily on ownership percentages.  Ford Credit's maximum exposure (approximately $76 million at December 31, 2007) to any potential losses, should they occur, associated with these VIEs is limited to its equity investments and, where applicable, receivables due from the VIEs.
Ford Credit also sells finance receivables to bank-sponsored asset-backed commercial paper issuers that are SPEs of the sponsor bank.  These SPEs are not consolidated by Ford Credit.  All of these sales constitute sales for legal purposes, but some of the sales do not satisfy the requirement for accounting sale treatment.  The outstanding balance of finance receivables was approximately $3.4 billion and $5.2 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Senior Convertible Indebtedness
At December 31, 2007, we have outstanding $4.95 billion in principal amount of unsecured Senior Convertible Notes (the "Convertible Notes") that mature in 2036.  The Convertible Notes pay interest semiannually at a rate of 4.25% per annum.  The Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of Ford Common Stock, based on a conversion rate (subject to adjustment) of 108.6957 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes (which is equal to a conversion price of $9.20 per share, representing a 25% conversion premium based on the closing price of $7.36 per share on December 6, 2006).  Holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of the Convertible Notes for cash on December 20, 2016 and December 15, 2026 or upon a change in control of the Company or for shares of Ford Common Stock upon a designated event, in each case for a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes being repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of repurchase.  We may redeem for cash all or a portion of the Convertible Notes at our option at any time or from time to time on or after December 20, 2016 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date.  We also may terminate the conversion rights at any time on or after December 20, 2013 if the closing price of Ford Common Stock exceeds 140% of the then-prevailing conversion price for twenty trading days during any consecutive thirty trading day period.
Subordinated Convertible Indebtedness
At December 31, 2007, Ford Motor Company Capital Trust II ("Trust II"), a subsidiary trust, had outstanding 6.50% Cumulative Convertible Trust Preferred Securities with an aggregate liquidation preference of $2.9 billion (the Trust Preferred Securities).  The sole assets of Trust II are $3 billion of 6.50% Junior Subordinated Convertible Debentures due 2032 of Ford Motor Company (the "Subordinated Debentures").  As of January 15, 2007, the Subordinated Debentures had become redeemable at our option.  We guarantee the payment of all distribution and other payments of the Trust Preferred Securities to the extent not paid by Trust II, but only if and to the extent we have made a payment of interest or principal on the Subordinated Debentures.  Trust II is not consolidated by us as it is a VIE in which we do not have a significant variable interest and of which we are not the primary beneficiary.
On August 3, 2007, pursuant to an exchange or conversion offer made by Trust II and Ford to holders of Trust Preferred Securities, holders of 42,543,071 then-outstanding Trust Preferred Securities with an aggregate liquidation preference of $2.1 billion elected to convert such securities into an aggregate 194,494,157 shares of Ford Common Stock.  The conversion offer provided for a premium of 1.7468 additional shares of Ford Common Stock, over the 2.8249 shares of Ford Common Stock into which each Trust Preferred Security was convertible pursuant to its conversion terms.  As a result of the exchange, we recorded a pre-tax loss of $632 million in .

Credit Facilities*
Automotive Sector
On December15, 2006, we entered into an agreement (the "Credit Agreement") which provides for a seven-year $7 billion term-loan facility and a five-year revolving credit facility of $11.5 billion.  At December 31, 2007, $10.9 billion of the revolving credit facility was available for use.  We may designate certain of our domestic and foreign subsidiaries, including Ford Credit, as borrowers under the revolving facility.  We and certain of our domestic subsidiaries that constitute a substantial portion of our domestic automotive assets (excluding cash) are guarantors under the Credit Agreement, and future material domestic subsidiaries will become guarantors when formed or acquired.
 
.  The borrowings of the Company, the subsidiary borrowers, and the guarantors under the Credit Agreement are secured by a substantial portion of our domestic automotive assets (excluding cash).  The collateral includes a majority of our principal domestic manufacturing facilities, excluding facilities to be closed, subject to limitations set forth in existing public indentures and other unsecured credit agreements; domestic accounts receivable; domestic inventory; up to $4 billion of marketable securities or cash proceeds therefrom; 100% of the stock of our principal domestic subsidiaries, including Ford Credit (but excluding the assets of Ford Credit); certain intercompany notes of Ford VHC AB, a holding company for Volvo, Ford Motor Company of Canada, Limited ("Ford Canada") and Grupo Ford S. de R.L. de C.V. (a Mexican subsidiary); 66% to 100% of the stock of all major first tier foreign subsidiaries (including Volvo); and certain domestic intellectual property, including trademarks.
Collateral
.  The Credit Agreement requires ongoing compliance with a borrowing base covenant and contains other restrictive covenants, including a restriction on our ability to pay dividends.  The Credit Agreement prohibits the payment of dividends (other than dividends payable solely in stock) on Ford Common and Class B Stock, subject to certain limited exceptions.  In addition, the Credit Agreement contains a liquidity covenant requiring us to maintain a minimum of $4 billion in the aggregate of domestic cash, cash equivalents, loaned and marketable securities and short-term Voluntary Employee Benefit Association ("VEBA") assets and/or availability under the revolving credit facility.
Covenants
With respect to the borrowing base covenant, we are required to limit the outstanding amount of debt under the Credit Agreement as well as certain permitted additional indebtedness secured by the collateral described above such that the total debt outstanding does not exceed the value of the collateral as calculated in accordance with the Credit Agreement (the "Borrowing Base value").
The following table provides detail of Borrowing Base values for various categories of collateral, which reflects our Jaguar and Land Rover operations (in billions, except percentages):

Based on the Borrowing Base value of $22.3 billion and the total outstanding amount of debt secured by collateral of $7.5 billion, the resulting collateral coverage ratio is 2.96.  Assuming the $11.5 billion revolving credit facility were fully drawn and the $1.5 billion of non-loan exposure permitted under the facility were fully utilized, the collateral coverage ratio would have been 1.12.
.  In addition to customary payment, representation, bankruptcy and judgment defaults, the Credit Agreement contains cross-payment and cross-acceleration defaults with respect to other debt for borrowed money, and a change in control default.
Events of Default
. At December 31, 2007, we had $1.6 billion of other Automotive credit facilities with financial institutions, including $1.1 billion of worldwide Automotive unsecured credit facilities and about $500 million of local credit facilities to foreign Automotive affiliates.  Of the lines available for use, 51% (or about $500 million) are committed through June 30, 2009, including 37% (or about $400 million) which are committed through December 31, 2011.  The worldwide credit facilities may be used, at Ford's option, by any of its direct or indirect, majority-owned subsidiaries on a guaranteed basis.  All of the worldwide unsecured credit facilities are free of material adverse change clauses, restrictive financial covenants (for example, debt-to-equity limitations and minimum net worth requirements), and credit rating triggers that would limit our ability to obtain funding.
Other Automotive Credit Facilities
 
Financial Services Sector
  At December 31, 2007, Ford Credit and its majority-owned subsidiaries, including FCE Bank, plc ("FCE"), had $3 billion of contractually-committed unsecured credit facilities with financial institutions, of which $2.1 billion were available for use.  Of the lines available for use, 56% (or about $1.1 billion) are committed through June 30, 2009, including 19% (or about $400 million) which are committed through December 31, 2011.  Of the $3 billion, $500 million constitute Ford Credit bank lines (of which about $200 million are worldwide) and $2.5 billion are FCE bank lines (of which $2.4 billion are worldwide).  The Ford Credit worldwide credit facilities may be used, at Ford Credit's option, by any of its direct or indirect, majority-owned subsidiaries.  Similarly, the FCE worldwide credit facilities may be used, at FCE's option, by any of FCE's direct or indirect, majority-owned subsidiaries.  Ford Credit or FCE, as the case may be, will guarantee any such borrowings.  All of the worldwide credit facilities are free of material adverse change clauses, restrictive financial covenants (for example, debt-to-equity limitations and minimum net worth requirements) and credit rating triggers that could limit Ford Credit's ability to obtain funding.
Credit Facilities.
In addition, at December 31, 2007, banks provided $17.2 billion of contractually-committed liquidity facilities to support Ford Credit's two on-balance sheet, asset-backed commercial paper programs; $16.9 billion supported Ford Credit's retail securitization program ("FCAR") and $300 million supported Ford Credit's Motown Notes wholesale securitization program ("Motown Notes").  Of the contractually-committed liquidity facilities, 48% (or $8 billion) are committed through June 30, 2012, and the remainder are committed for a shorter period of time.  Utilization of each of these facilities is subject to conditions specific to each program and Ford Credit having a sufficient amount of eligible assets for securitization.  The FCAR program must be supported by liquidity facilities equal to at least 100% of its outstanding balance.  At December 31, 2007, $16.7 billion of FCAR's bank liquidity facilities were available to support FCAR's asset-backed commercial paper, subordinated debt or FCAR's purchase of Ford Credit's asset-backed securities, and the remaining $200 million of bank liquidity facilities were available to support FCAR's purchase of Ford Credit's asset-backed securities. The Motown Notes program must be supported by liquidity facilities equal to at least 5% of its outstanding balance.  The Motown Notes program bank liquidity facilities are available to support the issuance of Motown Notes, but these facilities cannot be accessed directly to fund the purchase of Ford Credit's wholesale receivables.  Ford Credit is not presently issuing Motown Notes and does not intend to use this program in the foreseeable future as there is presently a lack of investor demand for extendible commercial paper.  At December 31, 2007, the outstanding balances were $13.7 billion for the FCAR program and zero for the Motown Notes program.
SM
  Ford Credit and its subsidiaries, including FCE, have entered into agreements with a number of bank-sponsored asset-backed commercial paper conduits ("conduits") and other financial institutions, whereby such parties are contractually committed, at Ford Credit's option, to purchase from Ford Credit's eligible retail or wholesale assets or to purchase or make advances under asset-backed securities backed by retail or wholesale assets for proceeds up to $30.8 billion at December 31, 2007 ($18.1 billion retail and $12.7 billion wholesale) of which $10 billion
Committed Liquidity Programs.
are commitments to FCE.  These committed liquidity programs have varying maturity dates, with $21.2 billion having maturities within the next twelve months (of which $3.4 billion relates to FCE commitments), and the balance having
maturities between February 2009 and September 2011.  Ford Credit's ability to obtain funding under these programs is subject to it having a sufficient amount of assets eligible for these programs.  At December 31, 2007, $17.1 billion of these commitments were in use.  These programs are extremely liquid funding sources as Ford Credit is able to obtain funding from available capacity generally within two days. These programs are free of material adverse change clauses, restrictive financial covenants (for example, debt-to-equity limitations and minimum net worth requirements) and credit rating triggers that could limit Ford Credit's ability to obtain funding.  However, the unused portion of these commitments may be terminated if the performance of the underlying assets deteriorates beyond specified levels.  Based on Ford Credit's experience and knowledge as servicer of the related assets, we do not expect any of these programs to be terminated due to such events.

In addition, Ford Credit has a committed liquidity program for the purchase of up to $6 billion of unrated asset-backed securities, of which $4 billion is committed through 2009 that at Ford Credit's option can be supported with various retail, wholesale, or lease assets.  Ford Credit's ability to obtain funding under this program is subject to it having a sufficient amount of assets available to issue the securities.  This program is also free of material adverse change clauses, restrictive financial covenants (for example, debt-to-equity limitations and minimum net worth requirements), and credit rating triggers that could limit Ford Credit's ability to obtain funding.  At December 31, 2007, Ford Credit had $3.9 billion of outstanding funding in this program.
NOTE 17.  SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION
At December 31, 2007, a variety of Ford stock-based compensation grants or awards were outstanding for employees (including officers) and members of the Board of Directors.  All stock-based compensation plans are approved by the shareholders.
We have stock-based compensation outstanding under two Long-term Incentive Plans ("LTIP"), the 1990 LTIP and the 1998 LTIP.  No further grants may be made under the 1990 LTIP and all outstanding units thereunder are exercisable.  All outstanding stock-based compensation under the 1990 LTIP continues to be governed by the terms and conditions of the existing agreements for those grants.  Grants may continue to be made under the 1998 LTIP through April 2008.
Under the 1998 LTIP, 2% of our issued Common Stock as of December 31 becomes available for granting plan awards in the succeeding calendar year.  Any unused portion is available for later years.  The limit may be increased up to 3% in any year, with a corresponding reduction in shares available for grants in future years.  At December 31, 2007, the number of unused shares carried forward was 88.1 million shares.
Upon stock-settled compensation exercises and awards, shares were either new issues or were issued from treasury stock.  We do not expect to repurchase a significant number of shares for treasury stock during 2008.
Stock Options
We measure the fair value of the majority of our stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, using historical volatility and the simplified method of calculating the expected term.  Our expected term is calculated by averaging the vesting term (3 years) and the contractual term of the option (10 years).  Historical data is also used to estimate option exercise behaviors and employee termination experience within the valuation model.  Based on our assessment of employee groupings and observable behaviors, we determined that a single grouping is appropriate.
Under the 1998 LTIP, 33% of the options are generally exercisable after the first anniversary of the date of grant, 66% after the second anniversary, and 100% after the third anniversary.  Stock options expire ten years from the grant date and are expensed in using a three-year cliff vesting methodology.

We have 205.6 million fully-vested stock options, with a weighted-average exercise price of $19.38 and remaining term of 3.8 years.  We expect 40.9 million stock options (after forfeitures), with a weighted-average exercise price of $8.63 and remaining term of 8.4 years to vest in the future.  There is no intrinsic value for unvested and vested options at December 31, 2007.
 
We received about $9 million from the exercise of stock options in 2007.  The tax benefit realized was .  An equivalent of about $11 million in treasury shares and new issues were used to settle exercised options.  For options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, the difference between the fair value of the common shares issued and their respective exercise price was about $1 million, $1 million, and $9 million, respectively.

Restricted Stock Units
We grant performance and time-based restricted stock units to employees under the 1998 LTIP.  Restricted stock units awarded in stock ("RSU-stock") provide the recipients with the right to shares of stock after a restriction period.  Outstanding RSU-stock are either strictly time-based or a combination of performance and time-based.  The restriction periods vary dependent upon the specific grant (1-5 years).  The fair value of the units is the average of the high and low market price of our Common Stock on the grant date.
Time-based RSU-stock awards issued in 2006 and prior vest at the end of the restriction period.  The expense is taken equally over the restriction period.  For time-based RSU-stock awards issued in 2007, the awards vest under the graded vesting method.  One-third of the RSU-stock awards vest after the first anniversary of the grant date, one-third after the second anniversary, and one-third after the third anniversary.  The expense is recognized in accordance with this graded vesting method.  Under both methods, at the end of the restriction period, the RSU-stock is fully expensed in
Selling, administrative, and other expenses.
 
Performance RSU-stock have a performance period (usually 1-3 years) and a restriction period (usually 1-3 years).  Compensation expense for these awards is not recognized until it is probable and estimable.  Expense is then recognized over the performance and restriction periods based on the fair market value of Ford stock at grant date

Other Share-Based Awards
Pursuant to the 1998 LTIP we also grant other share-based awards to select executives and other key employees, in addition to stock options and restricted stock units.  These awards include restricted stock, cash awarded restricted stock units, performance stock rights, and stock appreciation rights.  These awards have various vesting criteria which may include service requirements, individual performance targets, and company-wide performance targets.

NOTE 18.  EMPLOYEE SEPARATION ACTIONS AND EXIT AND DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES
Automotive Sector
General
We began implementing a number of different employee separation actions during 2006, our accounting for which is dependent on the design of the individual benefit action.
Jobs Bank Benefits Reserve
As part of our plan to reduce and realign vehicle assembly capacity and related manufacturing to bring it more in line with demand and shifting customer preferences, we announced plans to close a number of North American manufacturing facilities.  Additionally, we plan to sell or close essentially all of the remaining Automotive Components Holdings, LLC ("ACH") plants.  Hourly employees working at these U.S. plants are represented by the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America ("UAW"); hourly employees working at the Canadian plants identified above are represented by the National Automobile, Aerospace, Transportation and General Workers Union of Canada ("CAW").  Our 2003 collective bargaining agreement with the UAW expired in September 2007. The new 2007 collective bargaining agreement continues a job security program, pursuant to which we are required to pay idled employees who meet certain conditions a portion of their wages and benefits for a specified period of time.
 
FS - 35
 
NOTE 18.  EMPLOYEE SEPARATION ACTIONS AND EXIT AND DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES
(Continued)
Our collective bargaining agreement with the CAW contains a provision pursuant to which we are required to pay idled employees a portion of their wages and certain benefits for a specified period of time based on the number of credits an employee has received.  This agreement is scheduled to expire in September 2008.  We refer to these benefits under the UAW and CAW agreements as "Jobs Bank Benefits."
The Jobs Bank Benefits reserve includes an amount for benefits expected to be provided in their present form under the current UAW and CAW collective bargaining agreements.  The Jobs Bank Benefits provided to our hourly employees at facilities that will be closed by 2010 are expensed when it becomes probable that the employees will be permanently idled.
We recorded the expense in , and the following table summarizes the activity in the related Jobs Bank Benefits reserve:
Automotive cost of sales
The reserve balance above takes into account several factors: the demographics of the population at each affected facility, redeployment alternatives, and recent experience relative to voluntary redeployments. Due to the complexities inherent in estimating this reserve, our actual costs could differ materially. We continue to expense costs associated with the small number of employees who are temporarily idled on an as-incurred basis.
Separation Actions
The cost of voluntary employee separation actions is recorded at the time of an employee's acceptance, unless the acceptance requires explicit approval by the Company.  The costs of conditional voluntary separations are accrued when all conditions are satisfied.  The costs of involuntary separation programs are accrued when management has approved the program and the affected employees are identified.
.  During 2006, we offered voluntary separation packages to our entire UAW hourly workforce, established a reserve for the costs associated with this action., and recorded an expense in The following table summarizes the activity in the related separation reserve:
UAW Voluntary Separations
Automotive cost of sales.  
The 2007 ending balance in the reserve represents, in part, the cost of separation packages for employees (1,374 shown in the table above) who accepted a retirement package and ceased duties, but who will remain on our employment rolls until they reach retirement eligibility.  The reserve for these employees will be released over the period through the end of 2009.  The remaining balance of the reserve reflects costs associated with employee tuition programs.

Operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes were $3.5 billion at December 31, 2007.  A substantial portion of those losses have a remaining carryforward period beyond 2015; the remaining losses will begin to expire in 2008.  Tax credits available to offset future tax liabilities are $1.2 billion.  A substantial portion of these credits have a remaining carryforward period of 10 years or more.  Tax benefits of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are evaluated on an ongoing basis, including a review of historical and projected future operating results, the eligible carryforward period, and other circumstances.  Effective September 30, 2006, the balance of deferred taxes primarily at our U.S., Jaguar, and Land Rover entities has changed from a net deferred tax liability position to a net deferred tax asset position.  Due to the cumulative losses we have incurred at these operations and their near-term financial outlook, we have established a valuation allowance of $8.6 billion against the net deferred tax asset.
We adopted the provisions of Interpretation No. 48, ("FIN 48") on January 1, 2007.  As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, we recorded an increase of $1.3 billion to .  The favorable impact to was primarily the result of recognizing a receivable of approximately $1.5 billion associated with refund claims and related interest for prior years that met the "more-likely-than-not" recognition threshold of FIN 48. These prior year refund claims and related interest were not recognized as of December 31, 2006 because they were considered gain contingencies under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 5,   and could not be recognized until the contingency lapsed.The amount of unrecognized tax benefits at January 1, 2007 was $1.9 billion.

Although examinations have been completed in these jurisdictions, various unresolved transfer pricing disputes exist for years dating back to 1994.
Effective with the adoption of FIN 48, we have elected to recognize accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits and tax related penalties in the on our consolidated income statement.  During 2007, we recorded approximately $62 million in interest and penalties to our consolidated income statement.

NOTE 23.  DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
Our operations are exposed to global market risks, including the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, certain commodity prices and interest rates.  The objective of our risk management program is to manage the financial and operational exposure arising from these risks by offsetting gains and losses on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on derivatives used to hedge them.  We document our hedging objectives, practices, procedures, and accounting treatment.  In addition, we review our hedging program and our derivative positions, as well as our strategy, on a regular basis.
 
FS - 47
 
NOTE 23.  DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
(Continued)
Our use of derivatives to manage market risk results in the risk of a counterparty defaulting on a derivative contract.  We establish exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize this risk and provide counterparty diversification.  We also enter into master netting agreements with counterparties that usually allow for netting of certain exposures.  Many of these agreements permit netting between derivative and non-derivative exposures and our accounting policy is to not offset fair value amounts of our derivative assets and liabilities.  For Ford Credit, this policy represents a change as of December 31, 2007 and has been applied retrospectively to the 2006 balance sheet.  Substantially all of our counterparties have long-term debt ratings of single-A or better.  The aggregate fair value of derivative instruments in asset positions on December 31, 2007, is $4.2 billion, and represents the maximum loss that would be recognized at the reporting date if all counterparties failed to perform as contracted.
Hedge Accounting Designations
We have elected to apply hedge accounting to certain derivatives.  Derivatives that receive designated hedge accounting treatment are documented and evaluated for effectiveness in accordance with our policies.  Some derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting; for others, we elect not to apply hedge accounting treatment.  With the exception of certain electricity supply contracts, we have elected to apply the normal purchase and normal sales classification to all physical supply contracts that are entered into for the purpose of procuring commodities to be used in production within a reasonable time during the normal course of our business.  We do not apply normal purchase and normal sales to certain electricity physical supply contracts which had notional balances of $65 million and $51 million on December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  We report changes in the fair value of these derivatives through

.  We use forward and option contracts to manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange and commodity price risks.  We apply the critical terms method of assessing effectiveness for derivatives designated as hedging forecasted transactions.  The effective portion of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges is deferred in and is recognized in when the hedged item affects earnings. Our policy is to cease hedge accounting at the time forecasted transactions are recognized as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and report subsequent changes in fair value through .  An amount is also reclassified from and recognized in earnings if it becomes probable that the original forecasted transaction will not occur. Our cash flow hedges mature within two years or less.  The exchange of cash associated with cash flow hedges which are de-designated prior to maturity is reported in in our statements of cash flows.

Risk is reduced in two ways:  (1) through the use of funding instruments that have interest and maturity profiles similar to the assets they are funding, and (2) through the use of interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives.  Interest rate swaps are used to manage the effects of interest rate fluctuations.  Foreign currency exchange agreements, including forward contracts and swaps, are used to manage foreign exchange exposure. We adhere to a risk management policy that is reviewed on a regular basis by our management.  We do not engage in any speculative activities in the derivative markets
In 2007, we did not apply designated hedge accounting to any of our derivative instruments. In prior periods presented, we elected to apply hedge accounting to certain derivatives.  Derivatives that received designated hedge accounting treatment were documented and the relationships were evaluated for effectiveness at the time they were designated as well as throughout the hedge period.
.  Ford Credit uses certain derivatives to reduce the risk of changes in the fair value of liabilities.  We have designated receive-fixed, pay-float interest rate swaps as hedges of existing fixed-rate debt.  The risk being hedged was the risk of changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate.  For certain interest rate swaps we used the dollar-offset method to assess hedge effectiveness.  Hedge ineffectiveness was the difference between the change in fair value of the entire derivative instrument and the change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate.  Ineffectiveness was recorded directly in earnings.  The notional balances for these highly effective interest rate swaps were $0, $1.1 billion, and $1.8 billion at December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.  Other interest rate swaps met the specific criteria to assume no ineffectiveness in the hedge relationship.  These interest rate swaps had notional balances of $0, $0, and $3.8 billion at December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.
Fair Value Hedges
.  Ford Credit has designated receive-float, pay-fixed interest rate swaps as hedges of existing floating rate debt.  The risk being hedged was the risk of changes in the cash flows of the hedged item attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate.  We used the change in variable cash flows method to measure hedge ineffectiveness, which was the difference between the change in the fair value of the float leg of the swap and the change in fair value of the hedged item.  Hedge ineffectiveness was recorded directly in earnings.  Ford Credit had no receive-float, pay-fixed interest rates swaps classified as cash flow hedges at December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005.
Cash Flow Hedges
. Ford Credit has used foreign currency forwards and options to hedge the net assets of certain foreign entities to offset the translation and economic exposures related to its investment in these entities.  We assessed effectiveness based upon a comparison of the hedge with the beginning balance of the net investment level hedged, with subsequent quarterly tests based upon changes in spot rates to determine the effective portion of the hedge.  Ford Credit had no foreign currency forwards or options classified as net investment hedges at December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005.
Net Investment Hedges
. In 2007, we did not apply hedge accounting to our derivatives.  Some derivatives did not qualify for hedge accounting; for others, we elected not to apply hedge accounting. We report changes in the fair value of these derivatives through .  The earnings impact primarily relates to interest rate swaps, which are included in evaluating Ford Credit's overall risk management objective, and foreign currency derivatives, which are offset by the revaluation of foreign denominated debt.  The notional amount of derivatives not designated for hedge accounting was $181.8 billion, $158.7 billion, and $143.7 billion at December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

NOTE 24.  RETIREMENT BENEFITS
Employee Retirement and Savings Plans
We have two principal qualified defined benefit retirement plans in the United States.  The Ford-UAW Retirement Plan covers hourly employees represented by the UAW, and the General Retirement Plan covers substantially all other Ford employees in the United States hired on or before December 31, 2003.  The hourly plan provides noncontributory benefits related to employee service.  The salaried plan provides similar noncontributory benefits and contributory benefits related to pay and service.  Other U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries have separate plans that generally provide similar types of benefits for their employees.  We established, effective January 1, 2004, a defined contribution plan generally covering new salaried U.S. employees hired on or after that date.  Ford-UAW Retirement Plan expense accruals for UAW-represented Ford employees previously assigned to Visteon ("Visteon Hourly Employees") were charged to Visteon.  Pursuant to definitive agreements with Visteon signed on September 12, 2005, these charges were discontinued effective October 1, 2005.
For our plans that provide benefits based on salary, we project employee future salary growth for such salary-related benefits.  Certain of our defined benefit pension plans provide benefits that are not based on salary (e.g., U.S. Ford-UAW Retirement Plan, noncontributory portion of the U.S. General Retirement Plan, and Canada Ford-UAW Retirement Plan).  The salary growth assumption is not applicable to these benefits.
 
FS - 51
 
NOTE 24.  RETIREMENT BENEFITS
(Continued)
Plan obligations and costs are based on existing retirement plan provisions.  No assumption is made regarding any potential future changes to benefit provisions beyond those to which we are presently committed (e.g., in existing labor contracts).
In general, our plans are funded, with the main exceptions being certain plans in Germany and U.S. defined benefit plans for senior management.  In such cases, an unfunded liability is recorded.
The expense for our worldwide defined contribution plans was $130 million in 2007, $80 million in 2006 and $134 million in 2005.  This includes the expense for company matching contributions to our primary employee savings plans (United States and Canada) of $34 million in 2007, $0 in 2006 and $44 million in 2005.  Company matching contributions were reinstated in June 2007.
Other Postretirement Employee Benefits
We, and certain of our subsidiaries, sponsor plans to provide other postretirement benefits for retired employees, primarily certain health care and life insurance benefits.  The Ford UAW Hospital-Surgical-Medical-Drug-Dental-Vision Program ("H-S-M-D-D-V Program") covers hourly employees represented by the UAW, and the Ford Salaried Health Care Plan covers substantially all other Ford employees in the United States hired before June 1, 2001.  U.S. salaried employees hired on or after June 1, 2001 are covered by a separate plan that provides for annual company allocations to employee-specific notional accounts to be used to fund postretirement health care benefits.  We also provide company-paid postretirement life insurance benefits to U.S. salaried employees hired before January 1, 2004 and all U.S. hourly employees.  Our employees generally may become eligible for benefits when they retire; however, benefits and eligibility rules may be modified from time to time.
Effective January 1, 2007 for U.S. salaried employees hired before June 1, 2001, we established a company contribution limit set at 2006 levels for retiree health care benefits.  U.S. salaried employees hired on or after June 1, 2001 participate in a defined contribution retiree health care plan.  In addition, for U.S. salaried employees hired before January 1, 2004 who are retirement eligible after June 1, 2006, company-paid retiree life insurance benefits are limited to $50,000 (employees hired on or after January 1, 2004 do not receive company-paid life insurance benefits).  These benefit changes resulted in a reduction in 2006 and ongoing expense of about $400 million annually as well as a decrease in the year-end 2005 OPEB obligation of about $3 billion.
Effective January 1, 2008 for U.S. salaried employees hired before June 1, 2001, we replaced health care coverage (including prescription drugs and dental) for retirees and surviving spouses who are age 65 and older or Medicare eligible with a new Health Reimbursement Arrangement ("HRA").  Each such surviving spouse, retiree and his or her eligible spouse are provided an annual amount of up to $1,800 in an HRA account.  The HRA may be used to help offset health care, dental, vision and hearing costs.  This benefit change resulted in a decrease in the year-end 2006 OPEB obligation of about $500 million and a reduction in 2006 and ongoing expense of about $80 million annually.
On November 3, 2007, we agreed in principle with the UAW on a Memorandum of Understanding that permanently shifts responsibility for providing retiree health care benefits to current and former UAW-represented employees from the Company to a New Retiree Plan ("New Plan") funded by a new independent Voluntary Employee Benefit Association Trust ("New VEBA", and together with the New Plan, "MOU").  The effective date of the MOU is anticipated to occur in the third quarter of 2008.  This date is subject to, among other conditions, federal district court approval of the final settlement agreement relating to the MOU and SEC pre-clearance of the accounting treatment of the New VEBA and our retiree health care obligation.
In 2005, we entered into an agreement with the UAW ("Agreement") to increase retiree health care cost sharing as part of our overall cost reduction efforts.  On July 13, 2006 we received the necessary court approval of a settlement of a lawsuit challenging proposed modifications to the H-S-M-D-D-V Program and cost savings began to accrue as of that date.  The Agreement provides for increased cost sharing of health care expenses by retirees presently covered under the H-S-M-D-D-V Program ("Plan Amendment") and established an independent Defined Contribution Retiree Health Benefit Trust ("UAW Benefit Trust") which serves as a non-Ford sponsored Voluntary Employee Benefits Association.  The UAW Benefit Trust is used to mitigate the reduction in health plan benefits for certain eligible present and future
retirees, surviving spouses and other dependents.  This settlement agreement will remain in effect until September 14, 2011, at which point either Ford or the UAW may provide notice of a desire to terminate the Agreement.  If and when the MOU is implemented, which is the later of January 1, 2010 or the date on which any appeals or challenges to court approval are exhausted, the Agreement will be superseded by the MOU.

NOTE 24.  RETIREMENT BENEFITS
(Continued)
The Agreement was accounted for as a negative amendment to the H-S-M-D-D-V Program in the amount of $4 billion, net of $90 million representing the present value of our commitment to fund the UAW Benefit Trust (discussed below) discounted at 6.5%.  We are amortizing the negative plan amendment on a straight-line basis over 12 years (which represented the average remaining service period of our active workforce at the effective date of the plan amendment).  In addition we are accreting interest expense on the discounted value of the funding commitment noted above.  The interest expense recorded was $4 million and $2 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Our commitment to fund the UAW Benefit Trust consists of three non-contingent cash payments ("buy-down") totaling $108 million.  We paid the first installment of $30 million in cash on August 10, 2006.  As allowed by the Agreement, the second installment of $35 million was paid in cash on January 2, 2008.  We are committed to make a third contribution of $43 million in 2009.
The UAW Benefit Trust is controlled by the UAW Benefit Association Plan Committee ("Committee") which is appointed by the UAW.  The Committee does not and will not include any representatives of the Company.  The Committee has the right to appoint an independent trustee ("Trustee") for purposes of managing the assets.  The assets of the UAW Benefit Trust are the responsibility of the Committee, which has full fiduciary responsibility for the investment strategy, safeguarding of assets, and execution of the benefit plan as designed.  Benefit payments to eligible participants in the UAW Benefit Trust are limited in amount to the assets held by the UAW Benefit Trust.  Each year, the Committee will determine the level of benefits to be paid to eligible participants.  If the value of the assets in the UAW Benefit Trust is deemed insufficient by the Trustee, the Trustee may accelerate our obligation for the third contribution to the extent necessary to enable the UAW Benefit Trust to continue paying benefits.
 
As part of the Agreement, we also agreed to transfer to the UAW Benefit Trust the right to an amount of cash determined by the appreciation of 8.75 million shares of Ford Common Stock above $8.145 per share.  These stock appreciation rights were exercisable for three years from the effective date of the Plan Amendment.  One third of the 8.75 million stock appreciation rights were available on July 13, 2006.  On the first anniversary of the effective date of the Agreement, another third of the 8.75 stock appreciation rights were available.  As of November 3, 2007, these stock appreciation rights had not been exercised.  As allowed by the Agreement, we agreed with the UAW to satisfy this obligation by making an aggregate cash contribution of $33 million to the UAW Benefit Trust on the effective date of the MOU.  Using the Black-Scholes model to measure the fair value of stock appreciation rights on a graded vesting schedule, we expensed $8 million related to stock appreciation rights in 2006.  An additional $25 million was expensed in 2007, recorded in .
Automotive cost of sales
As part of the Agreement, UAW members also agreed to divert to the UAW Benefit Trust payments of a previously-negotiated 2006 wage increase and a portion of negotiated cost-of-living increases through 2011 as they are earned.  This is subject to change based on court approval of the final settlement agreement of the MOU.  In 2007 and 2006, respectively, we expensed $152 million and $44 million of diverted wage increases.
The average annual cost savings to Ford from the Plan Amendment is about $650 million, with annual cash savings of about $200 million.

In 2005, an agreement was reached with Visteon which included forgiving a receivable related to Visteon's remaining UAW OPEB obligation and a portion of Visteon's salary obligation for former Ford employees and retirees.  The total receivable forgiven was about $800 million, of which $600 million was recorded in 2004 as an allowance for doubtful receivables.  At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had a long-term receivable of $121 million and $127 million, respectively, representing Visteon's remaining responsibility for the benefits of the Visteon salaried employees.

Plan Contributions and Drawdowns
Our policy for funded pension plans is to contribute annually, at a minimum, amounts required by applicable laws, regulations, and union agreements.  We do from time to time make contributions beyond those legally required.  In 2007, we made $1.6 billion of cash contributions to our funded pension plans.  During 2008, we expect to contribute to our worldwide pension plans (including Jaguar and Land Rover plans) $2.3 billion from available Automotive cash and cash equivalents.  This amount includes about $400 million of benefit payments paid directly by us for unfunded plans.  Based on current assumptions and regulations, we do not expect to have a legal requirement to fund our major U.S. pension plans in 2008.

Plan Asset Information
Our investment strategy for pension assets has a long-term horizon, in keeping with the long-term nature of the liabilities.  Our prior target pension asset allocations disclosed in our 2006 Form 10-K Report were about 70% equity investments and 30% fixed income investments, with less than one percent in alternative investments (such as private equity).  In July 2007, to reduce the volatility of the value of our U.S. pension assets relative to U.S. pension liabilities, we revised our investment strategy to reduce the proportion of equity investments and increase the proportion of assets in fixed income and alternative investments.  Specifically, we disclosed a revised target asset allocation for year-end 2007 of about 50% public equity investments, 45% fixed income investments, and up to 5% alternative investments.  The target asset allocation for Ford U.K. plans is about 65% public equity investments and 35% fixed income investments.
Pension.  
In order to reduce the volatility of the value of our U.S. pension assets relative to U.S. pension liabilities, we have made further changes to our investment strategy to reduce the proportion of public equity investments and increase the proportion of assets in alternative investments.  Our new target asset allocation, which we expect to reach within the next five years, is about 30% public equity investments, 45% fixed income investments, and up to 25% alternative investments (e.g., private equity, real estate, and hedge funds).
All assets are externally managed and most assets are actively managed.  Ford securities comprised less than five percent of the total market value of our assets in major worldwide plans (including U.S., U.K., Canada, Germany, Sweden, Netherlands, Belgium, and Australia) during 2007 and 2006.
Public equity and fixed income investment managers are permitted to use derivatives as efficient substitutes for traditional securities and to manage exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks.  Interest rate and foreign currency derivative instruments are used for the purpose of hedging changes in the fair value of assets that result from interest rate changes and currency fluctuations.  Interest rate derivatives are also used to adjust portfolio duration.  Derivatives may not be used to leverage or to alter the economic exposure to an asset class outside the scope of the mandate to which an investment manager has been appointed.
Alternative investment managers are permitted to employ leverage (including through the use of derivatives or other tools) that may alter economic exposure.

Guarantees
The fair values of guarantees and indemnifications during 2007 and 2006 are recorded in the financial statements.  At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the following guarantees and indemnifications were issued and outstanding:
  We guarantee debt and lease obligations of certain joint ventures, as well as certain financial obligations of outside third parties to support business and economic growth.  Expiration dates vary, and guarantees will terminate on payment and/or cancellation of the obligation.  A payment by us would be triggered by failure of the guaranteed party to fulfill its obligation covered by the guarantee.  In some circumstances, we are entitled to recover from the third party amounts paid by us under the guarantee.  However, our ability to enforce these rights is sometimes stayed until the guaranteed party is paid in full, and may be limited in the event of insolvency of the third party or other circumstances.  The maximum potential payments under these guarantees total $7.6 million for 2007 and $100 million for 2006, the majority of which relates to the Automotive sector.  The decrease in potential payments is due primarily to the expiration of guarantees related to a joint venture.
Guarantees related to affiliates and third parties.
In December 2005, we completed the sale of Hertz.  As part of this transaction, we provided cash-collateralized letters of credit in an aggregate amount of $200 million to support the asset-backed portion of the buyer's financing for the transaction.  Our commitment to provide the letters of credit expires no later than December 21, 2011 and supports the payment obligations of Hertz Vehicle Finance LLC under one or more series of asset-backed notes ("asset-backed notes").  The letters of credit can be drawn upon on any date funds allocated to pay interest on the asset-backed notes are insufficient to pay scheduled interest payments, principal amounts due on the legal final maturity date, or when the balance of assets supporting the asset-backed notes is less than the outstanding balance of the asset-backed notes.  The carrying value of our deferred gain related to the letters of credit was $18 million for 2007 and $23 million for 2006, which represents the estimated fair value of our guarantee.
In 1996, we issued $500 million of 7.25% Notes due October 1, 2008.  In 1999, we entered into a de-recognition transaction to defease our obligation as primary obligor with respect to the principal of these notes.  As part of this transaction, we placed certain financial assets into an escrow trust for the benefit of the noteholders, and the trust became the primary obligor with respect to the principal (we became secondarily liable for the entire principal amount).
We also have guarantees outstanding associated with a subsidiary trust, Ford Motor Company Capital Trust II.  On August 3, 2007, we completed a conversion offer related to our Trust Preferred Securities.  For further discussion of our Trust Preferred Securities, see Notes 16 and 21.

These indemnifications might include claims against any of the following: environmental, tax, and shareholder matters;
Indemnifications.
intellectual property rights; power generation contracts; governmental regulations and employment-related matters; dealers, supplier, and other commercial contractual relationships; and financial matters, such as securitizations.  Performance under these indemnities would generally be triggered by a breach of terms of the contract or by a third-party claim.  We regularly evaluate the probability of having to incur costs associated with these indemnifications and have accrued for expected losses that are probable.  We are party to numerous indemnifications and many of these indemnities do not limit potential payment; therefore, we are unable to estimate a maximum amount of potential future payments that could result from claims made under these indemnities.
Warranty
Included in the warranty cost accruals are costs for basic warranty coverages on vehicles sold.  Additional service actions, such as product recalls and other customer service actions, are not included in the warranty reconciliation below, but are also accrued for at the time of sale.  Estimates for warranty costs are made based primarily on historical warranty claim experience.  The following is a tabular reconciliation of the product warranty accruals (in millions):
The warranty reconciliation excludes divested and held-for-sale operations as of 2007 and 2006.  For further discussion of these amounts, see Note 20.
Litigation and Claims
Various legal actions, governmental investigations and proceedings and claims are pending or may be instituted or asserted in the future against us, including but not limited to those arising out of alleged defects in our products; governmental regulations relating to safety, emissions and fuel economy; financial services; employment-related matters; dealer, supplier and other contractual relationships; intellectual property rights; product warranties; environmental matters; shareholder or investor matters; and financial reporting matters.  Certain of the pending legal actions are, or purport to be, class actions.  Some of the foregoing matters involve or may involve compensatory, punitive, or antitrust or other treble damage claims in very large amounts, or demands for recall campaigns, environmental remediation programs, sanctions, or other relief, which, if granted, would require very large expenditures.
Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and the outcome of individual litigated matters is not predictable with assurance.  We have established accruals for certain of the matters discussed in the foregoing paragraph where losses are deemed probable and reasonably estimable.  It is reasonably possible, however, that some of the matters discussed in the foregoing paragraph for which accruals have not been established could be decided unfavorably to us and could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts or a range of amounts that cannot be estimated at December 31, 2007.  We do not reasonably expect, based on our analysis, that such matters would have a material effect on future financial statements for a particular year, although such an outcome is possible.

Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations
On December 31, 2005, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 47, ("FIN 47").  In accordance with FIN 47, we accrue for costs related to legal obligations to perform certain activities in connection with the retirement, disposal or abandonment of assets for which the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated.
Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations
We have identified asbestos abatement and PCB removal as conditional asset retirement obligations.  Asbestos abatement was estimated using site-specific surveys where available and a per/square foot estimate where surveys were unavailable.  PCB removal costs were based on historical removal costs per transformer and applied to transformers identified by a PCB transformer global survey we conducted.
Other conditional asset retirement obligations exist, including regulated substances.  These costs, however, are not estimable until a triggering event occurs (e.g., plant closing) due to the absence of historical cost, range of potential settlement dates and variability among plants.  Once a triggering event occurs and additional regulated substance asset retirement obligations can be estimated, those costs are included as part of the liability.
Upon adoption of FIN 47, the full amount of our estimate of conditional asset retirement obligations related to asbestos abatement and PCB removal was expensed, as an after-tax charge of $251 million shown in at December 31, 2005.  The liability for conditional asset retirement obligations was $390 million and $399 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
Ford Motor Company:
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, of stockholders' equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Ford Motor Company and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  In addition, in our opinion, the accompanying financial statement schedule presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.  Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and the financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A of the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007 (not presented herein).  Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, the financial statement schedule and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
Our audits of the financial statements were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic financial statements taken as a whole.  The accompanying sector balance sheets and the related sector statements of income and of cash flows are presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of the basic financial statements.  Such information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.
As discussed in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for uncertain tax positions in 2007.  As discussed in Note 24 the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans and as discussed in Note 2, the Company also changed the timing of its annual goodwill and other intangible assets impairment testing, and its amortization method for special tools in 2006.  As discussed in Note 28 the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for conditional asset retirement obligations in 2005.

A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
