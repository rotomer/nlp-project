IMMEDIATE RELEASE
MAY BRINGS RECORD SALES FOR FORD FOCUS, FUSION
 
DEARBORN, Mich., June 3, 2008  For the second time in its nine-year history, Ford Focus sales eclipsed the 30,000-unit milestone in May.
Focus sales totaled 32,579, up 53 percent compared with a year ago.  Retail sales to individual customers more than doubled (up 105 percent).  The first time was October 2001, when industry sales soared in response to zero-percent financing.
Our dealers are selling the Focus at unprecedented turn rates, said Jim Farley, Ford group vice president, Marketing and Communications.  In fact, Focus retail sales were 91 percent of beginning inventory, which puts it in the same league as the industrys best-selling small cars.  This is a strong statement about customer demand for Fords newest small car.

Ford is moving to increase Focus availability.  In early April, Ford announced plans to produce 245,000 Focus units in 2008, approximately 30% more than in 2007.  Ford now is targeting to produce 280,000 Focus units in 2009.
Ford Fusion sales were the highest for any month ever (18,088) and up 27 percent from a year ago, including a 30 percent increase to retail customers.  The Mercury Sable and Milan also posted higher retail sales.
Our products and our dealers are getting us back in the car business, Farley said.  Our small and mid-size cars are outperforming the industry, and were only just beginning.
Late this year, a redesigned Fusion, Milan and MKZ will go into production.  Additionally, Fusion and Milan will be offered in new hybrid versions.
Last week, Ford announced its global B-car, the Ford Fiesta, will be produced in North America in early 2010.  Two Fiesta models will be offered  a sedan and a hatchback  helping feed customers growing demand for small cars.
In all, Ford, Lincoln and Mercury car sales to retail customers were up 20 percent.  Total car sales, including sales to fleet customers, were up 4 percent in May.
In May, crossover sales were lower than a year ago but remained at high levels as sales for the Ford Escape and Edge, Mercury Mariner and Lincoln MKX were among the highest recorded.  During the past two years, sales growth for the companys crossovers has outpaced the industry.
The companys gains in the small and mid-size car market are helping to mitigate sharp declines among traditional SUVs (down 44 percent) and trucks and vans (down 29 percent) as well as lower sales to daily rental companies (down 30 percent).
Ford, Lincoln and Mercury sales totaled 206,000, down 16 percent.
