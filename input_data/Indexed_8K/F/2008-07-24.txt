Item 2.06. Material Impairments
We disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed May 22, 2008 that a material impairment charge to fixed assets in our North American Automotive operations was required based on the financial impact of rapidly-changing U.S. market conditions, but we could not at that time reasonably estimate the amount of the impairment charge.  The changes in market condition included: (1) a more pronounced and accelerated shift in consumer preferences away from full-size trucks and traditional sport utility vehicles to smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles as a result of higher fuel prices; (2) greater-than-anticipated escalation of commodity costs; and (3) lower-than-anticipated industry demand in the United States.  In connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the second quarter of 2008, we estimate that this impairment charge reflected in those financial statements will be $5.3 billion on a pre-tax basis.  This impairment charge will not result in any cash expenditures.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
