Item 8.01. Other Events
Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. ("Lehman CPI") is one of the lenders participating in our $11.5 billion revolving credit facility that is part of our secured Credit Agreement dated December 15, 2006.  Lehman CPI's commitment under the revolving credit facility is $890 million, all of which is presently unfunded.  In addition, Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB ("Lehman Brothers Bank") provides $238 million of the aggregate $16.3 billion of contractually-committed liquidity facilities supporting the retail securitization program of Ford Motor Credit Company LLC, our wholly-owned subsidiary.  Lehman Brothers Bank's commitment is guaranteed by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. ("Lehman"), which is the ultimate parent company of Lehman CPI and Lehman Brothers Bank.
On September 15, 2008, it was reported that Lehman filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, but that its subsidiaries, which would include Lehman CPI and Lehman Brothers Bank, were not included in the filing.  We are presently assessing the impact, if any, that the bankruptcy filing by Lehman will have on Lehman CPI's and Lehman Brothers Bank's commitments described above.
For further information regarding our secured Credit Agreement and Ford Credit's contractually-committed liquidity facilities supporting its retail securitization program, see Note 16 of the Notes to Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K Report for the year ended December 31, 2007, as well as our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2008 and June 30, 2008.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
