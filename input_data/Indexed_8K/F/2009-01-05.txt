IMMEDIATE RELEASE
F-SERIES DRIVES FORD TO HIGHER MARKET SHARE FOR THIRD CONSECUTIVE MONTH
DEARBORN, Mich., Jan. 5, 2009  New vehicles, including the all-new F-150 truck, and fuel-efficient powertrains are winning over customers for Ford, Lincoln and Mercury, which realized market share increases for a third consecutive month in December.  Ford estimates its market share was 14.6 percent in December, up 0.7 of a point versus a year ago.  This marks the first time since 1997 Ford has achieved a market share increase three months in a row.
This is a strong ending to end a very challenging year, said Jim Farley, Fords group vice president, Marketing and Communications.  In addition to finishing the year with increased market share, we received several accolades from third parties concerning our world-class quality and safety, and we turned some heads on the fuel economy front with our 41 mpg Fusion Hybrid, the most fuel-efficient mid-size sedan in America.
 
 
 
The F-Series truck played a key role in Fords fourth quarter market share gains.  The all-new F-150 accounted for 8,600 of total F-Series sales in December, an increase of 84 percent compared with November 2008.  For the year, F-Series sales totaled 515,513.
Our thanks go out to our customers, our dealers and, of course, the Ford employees and supplier partners who design, engineer and manufacture quality, fuel-efficient trucks delivering unmatched capability, Farley said.  The all-new F-150 affirms what Ford has known for years  that listening to customers provides the best rewards.
The all-new F-150 recently was named 2009 Truck of the Year, a finalist for the North American Truck of the Year and the Texas Auto Writers Associations Truck of Texas.
Motor Trend
Ford Flex, the companys newest crossover utility, finished 2008 with its best sales month of the year, netting 2,685 sales.  Flex has the highest conquest rate of any Ford vehicle and is a finalist for the North American Car of the Year.
In other car news, Ford Focus posted full-year sales of 195,823, the small cars highest sales year since 2004 and up 13 percent versus full-year 2007.  Focus parlayed SYNC technology and 35 mpg highway fuel economy, which is 5 mpg better than Toyotas Corolla and 2 mpg better than the smaller Honda Fit, to achieve a market share increase in the competitive small car segment  its first share increase since Focus was introduced during the 2000 model year.
Meanwhile, Ford Fusion posted near-record sales of 147,569 units in 2008.  Fusion, Mercury Milan and Lincoln MKZ are redesigned for the 2010 model year and will arrive in dealer showrooms this spring.  The first-ever Fusion Hybrid will be Americas most fuel-efficient mid-size car with 41 mpg in the city and 36 mpg on highway  besting the Toyota Camry hybrid by 8 mpg in the city and 2 mpg on highway.
