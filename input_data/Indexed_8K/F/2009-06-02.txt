The previous Fusion record was set last month with 18,321 cars when Fusion cracked the foreign stranglehold on the mid-size sedan market.  It was the first time since July 2002 that a domestic car was one of the top three mid-size cars selling to retail customers.  Recent independent studies rate Fusion and the Mercury Milan as having the best predicted reliability among all mid-size sedans.  In addition, both models are rated the most fuel-efficient sedans in America.
Combined sales for the Fusion and Milan hybrids and the Ford Escape and Mercury Mariner hybrids totaled 3,906  a new company record for hybrid sales in a single month.  The previous record was set in April 2006, with 3,420 hybrids.
The previous Flex record also was set last month with 3,190 vehicles.  Combined sales for all crossover utilities were 35,582, Fords strongest crossover sales month since last May.
May marked the first full sales month of the 2010 Ford Mustang.  Mustang sales totaled 8,812, the highest sales month since last July.  This year marks the 45 anniversary of Americas legendary pony car.
th
Lincoln was one of the few brands in the U.S. to achieve a sales increase in May.  Lincoln sales totaled 8,566, up 2 percent versus a year ago.  Lincolns sedans, the all-new MKS, redesigned MKZ and venerable Town Car paced Lincolns sales increase.  A new Lincoln full-size crossover, the MKT, will debut later this year.
Inventories and Production
At the end of May, Ford vehicle inventories totaled 350,000 (equivalent to 56 days supply).  This level was 41,000 vehicles lower than at the end of April and 210,000 vehicles lower than a year ago.
Given tightly controlled inventories and the strength of its new products in the market, Ford is increasing second quarter North American production by 10,000 vehicles (to 445,000).  Ford also announced it plans to build 460,000 vehicles in the third quarter, an increase of 42,000 vehicles compared with third quarter 2008.

At Ford, the future is now, said Czubay.  New products account for 50 percent of our sales, and demand for these products is driving our market share gains.  We encourage customers who are in the market for a new vehicle to Drive the Ford Difference. 
To provide added incentive, Ford is announcing a new summer merchandising program, Drive the Ford Difference.  From June 2 through June 30, Ford will cover up to three months worth of payments up to $2,100, and Ford Credit will offer 0 percent financing on select Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles.
