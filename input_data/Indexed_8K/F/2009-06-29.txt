Item 8.01. Other Events
Ford Motor Company (the Company) submitted an application for term loans totaling $11.4 billion to the United States Department of Energy (the DOE) dated November 18, 2008 pursuant to the DOEs Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Incentive Program (the ATVM Program).  The Companys application, which was deemed substantially complete on December 16, 2008, relates to ATVM Program expenditures approved by the DOE to be made by the Company extending beyond 2011.  By mutual agreement of the Company and the DOE, the Companys application was amended and restated on June 12, 2009 (as so amended and restated, the Application) to request, initially, term loans totaling $5.937 billion to fund, in part, the ATVM Program expenditures approved through 2011.  Loans to fund the approved ATVM Program expenditures beyond 2011 are subject to further approvals by the DOE.  The ATVM Program was authorized by section 136 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, as amended from time to time (Section 136), to provide up to $25 billion of loans to automobile and automobile part manufacturers for the cost of re-equipping, expanding, or establishing manufacturing facilities in the United States to produce advanced technology vehicles or qualified components, and for associated engineering integration costs.  Loans under the ATVM will be made by and through the Federal Financing Bank, an instrumentality of the United States government created by the Federal Financing Bank Act of 1973 that is under the general supervision of the Secretary of the Treasury (FFB).
On June 23, 2009, the Company and DOE entered into a Conditional Commitment Letter (the Commitment Letter) pursuant to which DOE is willing to (i) arrange a 13-year multi-draw term loan facility (the Facility) under the ATVM Program in the aggregate principal amount of $5.937 billion, (ii) designate the Company as a borrower under the ATVM Program and (iii) cause FFB to enter into a Note Purchase Agreement for the purchase of notes to be issued by the Company evidencing such loans.  The Commitment Letter is filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and is incorporated by reference herein.
DOEs commitment under the Commitment Letter is subject to (a) the preparation, execution and delivery of definitive agreements (the Loan Documents) as set forth in the Term Sheet attached to the Commitment Letter (the Term Sheet) incorporating the terms and conditions set forth in the Conditional Commitment Letter and the Term Sheet, satisfactory to DOE; (b) the absence of a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Commitment Letter); (c) DOEs satisfaction with all legal matters with respect to the Company; (d) DOEs satisfaction with all tax and accounting matters with respect to the Company; (e) DOEs satisfaction, in its reasonable discretion, with the capital, corporate and organizational structure of the Company; (f) the Companys receipt of all material governmental and third party consents (if any) necessary to permit the loans and the borrowings; and (g) those conditions precedent specified in the Term Sheet.
The proceeds of advances under the Facility will be used to finance certain costs eligible for financing under the ATVM Program (Eligible Project Costs) that are incurred though 2011 in the implementation of thirteen advanced technology vehicle programs approved by DOE (each, a Project).  The Commitment Letter limits the amount of advances that may be used to fund Eligible Project Costs for each Project, and the Companys ability to borrow to finance Eligible Project Costs with respect to a Project will be conditioned on the Company meeting agreed milestones and fuel economy targets for that Project.
Advances against the loans may be requested from the date of the definitive agreements to June 30, 2012, and the loans will mature on June 15, 2022 (the Maturity Date). Each advance will bear interest at a blended rate based on the Treasury yield curve at the time such advance is borrowed based on the principal amortization schedule for that advance.  Interest will be payable quarterly in arrears.  The principal amount of the loans will be payable in equal quarterly installments commencing on September 15, 2012 through the Maturity Date.
The Companys obligations under the Facility will be secured by a first priority security interest in any assets purchased or developed with the proceeds of the loans and a security interest in all of the collateral pledged under the Companys existing Credit Agreement dated as of December 15, 2006 (the Existing Credit Agreement) subordinated solely to (a) prior perfected security interests securing certain indebtedness as defined in the Term Sheet and letters of credit not to exceed $19,100,000,000 and cash management and hedging obligations in an amount not to exceed $1,500,000,000 and (b) certain other permitted liens described in the Term Sheet.  Certain of the Companys domestic subsidiaries that, together with the Company, hold a substantial portion of the Companys consolidated domestic automotive assets (excluding cash) and that guarantee the Existing Credit Agreement will guarantee the Company's obligations under the Facility, and future material domestic subsidiaries will become guarantors when formed or acquired.
 
- 2 -
 
In order to provide the subordinated security interest necessary to secure the Company's obligations under the Facility and any obligations under future loans up to the $11 billion in the aggregate that may be extended by DOE pursuant to the Application, the Existing Credit Agreement will have to be amended to increase from $4 billion to $14 billion the limit of second lien debt that can be secured by the assets securing the Company's obligations under the Existing Credit Agreement.  Such an amendment will require the vote of lenders holding a majority in principal amount of outstanding indebtedness or commitments under the Existing Credit Agreement.  Similarly, an amendment will be required to increase from $4 billion to $14 billion a second lien debt limitation applicable to the Company's $3 billion principal amount 9.5% Guaranteed Secured Note due January 1, 2018 (Second Lien Note), issued pursuant to the UAW Retiree Health Care Settlement Agreement described in Note 23 of the Notes to the Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008.  The Settlement Agreement established a new Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association trust that on December 31, 2009 would assume the obligation to provide retiree health care to eligible active and retired UAW-represented employees of Ford and their eligible spouses, surviving spouses and dependents.
. The Loan Documents will contain affirmative covenants substantially similar to those in the Existing Credit Agreement (including similar baskets and exceptions), including delivery of the Companys financial statements and those of certain of its subsidiaries, delivery of compliance certificates and notices of default, maintenance of the Companys automotive business and corporate existence, delivery of certain future guarantees and collateral, as well as certain other affirmative covenants required in connection with the ATVM Program, including compliance with ATVM Program requirements, introduction of advanced technology vehicles to meet or exceed projected overall annual fuel economy improvements and delivery of progress reports and audit reports with respect to the Projects.
Affirmative Covenants
. The Loan Documents will contain negative covenants substantially similar to those in the Existing Credit Agreement, including restrictive covenants that limit, subject to certain exceptions, the Companys ability to pay dividends, make certain repurchases of equity or repay certain of its material indebtedness prior to maturity, its ability and the ability of the guarantors to incur secured indebtedness, the Companys ability to merge or consolidate with another person or to grant liens on the collateral securing the credit facilities, and the ability of the Companys foreign subsidiaries whose equity has been pledged under the Credit Agreement to incur indebtedness. The Loan Documents will also contain negative pledge and sale-leaseback covenants substantially similar to covenants in the Existing Credit Agreement and the Companys existing senior unsecured debt.
Negative Covenants
. The Loan Documents will contain a covenant substantially similar to the liquidity covenant in the Existing Credit Agreement requiring the Company to maintain an aggregate minimum amount of $4,000,000,000 of domestic cash, cash equivalents, loaned and marketable securities and short-term VEBA assets and/or availability under its revolving credit facility.
Liquidity Covenant

. The Loan Documents will contain the following events of default that are substantially similar to those in the Existing Credit Agreement or otherwise required in connection with the ATVM Program:
Events of Default
Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the Loan Documents will include usual and customary notice periods and remedies.
It is anticipated that the Loan Documents will be entered into and the conditions thereto will be satisfied, including obtaining necessary amendments to the second lien debt limit applicable to the Existing Credit Agreement and the Second Lien Note, by August of this year, following which draws under the Facility can begun being made.

Subject to the terms of the Funding Agreements, each Advance shall have its own interest rate (the ), which rate will be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury as of the date the respective Advance is made.  The Interest Rate for each Advance will be a rate per annum equal to the single equivalent rate for the payment stream on the Advance under the terms of the Funding Agreements.  The single equivalent rate will be determined first by envisioning the payment stream on the Advance under the Funding Agreements as a payment stream on a series of bonds in which each one of such bonds has a principal amount equal to the level principal installment due on each payment date on the Advance, and each bond matures on the same date as each payment date on the Advance, and then by assigning to each serial bond a separate interest rate derived from the daily Treasury Yield Curve corresponding to each bonds maturity date.  Then, a single equivalent rate is calculated and given to the Advance that produces the same payment stream that the sum of the payments on the individual serial bonds produces.

The Borrowers obligations under the Loans will be secured by:
The security interests granted in the ATVM Collateral will be made in favor of the United States of America, acting by and through DOE (and including, without limitation, FFB) or agents designated by them to act.  Subject to intercreditor provisions substantially identical to the terms and conditions of Section 8 of the Collateral Trust Agreement, the Borrower shall be permitted to grant a second-priority perfected security interest in the First Lien Collateral to the lenders under the Existing Credit Agreement or lenders under any refinanced or replacement credit agreement.
The security interest in the Subordinate Collateral shall be released on the first date on which each of the following has occurred: () the senior, unsecured, long term indebtedness of the Borrower has at least two of the following three ratings: at least Baa3 by Moodys, at least BBB- by Fitch and/or at least BBB- by S&P, () the Borrower has delivered to DOE a certificate of a Responsible Officer (as defined in the Conditional Commitment Letter) certifying that such condition has been satisfied, and () the security interest in favor of the lenders under the Existing Credit Agreement is concurrently released pursuant to Section 10.15(c) of the Existing Credit Agreement, that if at any time thereafter after the Existing Credit Agreement is refinanced, replaced or terminated, the Borrower grants a security interest (other than Specified Liens (as defined below)) on any assets that would otherwise have constituted Subordinate Collateral, the quarterly installments of principal that would have been due on March 15, 2022 and June 15, 2022 shall, at the election of DOE in its sole discretion, become due and payable on the next Quarterly Date after such security interest is granted. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, Specified Liens means (i) Designated Liens and (ii) other liens securing obligations in an aggregate Outstanding Amount (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) not exceeding $3,000,000,000.
