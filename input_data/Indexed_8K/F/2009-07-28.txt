Item 3.02  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.
On July 22, 2009, Ford Motor Company ("Ford") entered into the Third Amendment (the "Third Amendment") to the Credit Agreement dated as of December 15, 2006 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the "Credit Agreement"), among Ford, the subsidiary borrowers from time to time parties thereto, the several banks and other financial institutions or entities from time to time parties thereto (the "Lenders"), Citibank, N. A. and Goldman Sachs Credit Partners, L.P., as syndication agents, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and the other agents parties thereto.  This amendment was approved by revolving and term loan lenders holding 93.2% of the aggregate principal amount of loans and commitments outstanding under the Credit Agreement, which exceeded the requirement that lenders holding a majority of the aggregate principal amount of loans and commitments outstanding approve the amendment for it to become effective. The Third Amendment is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and is incorporated by reference herein.  Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein are as set forth in the Third Amendment.
Amendment to Credit Agreement.  
Prior to the Third Amendment, the Credit Agreement provided for a $4 billion Permitted Second Lien Debt basket.  As a result of the Third Amendment, the Credit Agreement has been amended to, among other things, permit up to $14.4 billion of Permitted Second Lien Debt to be secured by liens on the collateral securing the Credit Agreement.  The amended Permitted Second Lien Debt basket is comprised of the previous $4 billion basket (now designated as Primary Second Lien Debt), plus up to $5.9 billion for Permitted Phase I Government Debt, plus Permitted Phase II Government Debt in an amount up to the lesser of (a) $7 billion and (b) $10.4 billion less the amount of Permitted Phase I Government Debt outstanding at any time.  The aggregate principal amount of Permitted Phase I Government Debt and Permitted Phase II Government Debt is limited to $10.4 billion.  Ford may also use any unused capacity in the $4 billion Primary Second Lien Debt basket to secure U.S. government loans.
Permitted Phase I Government Debt (a) must be provided by the U.S. government in connection with the Department of Energy ("DOE") Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Incentive Program ("ATVM Program") or any successor, replacement or similar program; (b) with respect to (i) interest rate methodology, (ii) fees, (iii) amortization, (iv) final maturity date, (v) collateral, liens, priority and inter-creditor arrangements, and (vi) negative covenants (including the absence of financial covenants), must not be on terms that are materially less favorable to Ford or the Lenders than the terms set forth in the Conditional Commitment Letter, dated as of June 23, 2009 (the "DOE Commitment Letter"), by and between Ford and the DOE (a copy of which was included as an exhibit to Ford's Current Report on Form 8-K dated June 23, 2009 ); and (c) must be on terms, taken as a whole, that are not more restrictive to Ford than the terms of the Credit Agreement (other than with respect to interest rate, fees, call features or premiums).
("June 2009 Form 8-K Report")
Permitted Phase II Government Debt (a) must be provided by (i) the U.S. government, or (ii) a commercial bank and guaranteed by the U.S. government, in each case, in connection with the ATVM Program or any successor, replacement or similar program; (b) must have a final maturity date not earlier than six months after the later of the Revolving Termination Date and the Term Loan Maturity Date (each as defined in the Credit Agreement), in each case, in effect at the date of incurrence of such Permitted Phase II Government Debt; (c) must have a weighted average life to maturity longer than the weighted average life to maturity of the Term Loans then outstanding; and (d) must be on terms, taken as a whole, that are not more restrictive to Ford than the terms of the Credit Agreement (other than with respect to interest rate, fees, call features or premiums).
As disclosed in the June 2009 Form 8-K Report, Ford entered into the DOE Commitment Letter, pursuant to which the DOE is willing to arrange a loan facility under its ATVM Program in the aggregate principal amount of $5.9 billion to fund over time qualifying expenses related to the development of advanced technology vehiclesDOE's commitment under the DOE Commitment Letter is subject to, among other things, preparation and execution of definitive agreements.

The Third Amendment was necessitated to facilitate Ford's application to the DOE dated November 18, 2008 for term loans pursuant to the ATVM Program totaling $11.4 billion, which are required to be secured.  Ford's application, which was deemed by the DOE to be substantially complete on December 16, 2008, relates to ATVM Program expenditures approved by the DOE to be made by Ford extending beyond 2011.  By mutual agreement between Ford and the DOE, Ford's application was amended and restated on June 12, 2009 to request, initially, term loans totaling $5.9 billion to fund, in part, the ATVM Program expenditures approved through 2011.  Loans to fund the approved ATVM Program expenditures beyond 2011 are subject to further approvals by the DOE.
  On July 23, 2009, Ford entered into an amendment to the Retiree Health Care Settlement Agreement dated as of March 28, 2008 (the "2008 Settlement Agreement") between Ford, the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (the "UAW") and class representatives of former UAW-represented Ford employees ("class representatives").  The 2008 Settlement Agreement established a new Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association trust (the "New VEBA") that on December 31, 2009 would assume the obligation to provide retiree health care benefits to eligible active and retired UAW Ford hourly employees and their eligible spouses, surviving spouses and dependents.  The 2008 Settlement Agreement is described in more detail in Note 23 of the Notes to the Financial Statements in Ford's 2008 Form 10-K Report.  The amendment to the 2008 Settlement Agreement ("Amended Settlement Agreement") is filed as Exhibit 10.2 hereto and is incorporated by reference herein.
Amendment to UAW Retiree Health Care Settlement Agreement.
The Amended Settlement Agreement provides for smoothing of payment obligations and provides Ford the option to use Ford Common Stock to satisfy up to approximately 50% of Ford's future payment obligations to the New VEBA.  The Amended Settlement Agreement is subject to final court approval and other conditions.
In the event that the Amended Settlement Agreement is approved by the court and the other conditions to its implementation are met, Ford will issue to the New VEBA two notes, Note A and Note B, which will have covenants and events of default that will mirror those contained in the Credit Agreement.  These notes will be issued to the New VEBA in lieu of:  (i) the notes contemplated to be issued under the 2008 Settlement Agreement (i.e., a 5.75% Senior Convertible Note due January 1, 2013 in the principal amount of $3,334 million (the "Convertible Note"), a 9.5% Guaranteed Secured Note due January 1, 2018 in the principal amount of $3 billion (the "Second Lien Note"), and a 9% Short Term Note due December 31, 2009 in the principal amount of $2,281.91 million, which represented the value of the assets at December 31, 2008 in the Temporary Asset Account ("TAA") established under the 2008 Settlement Agreement (together, the "Old Notes")), and (ii) the base amount payments consisting of annual installments of $52.3 million payable through 2022 under the 2008 Settlement Agreement.
Note A, a non-interest bearing note in the principal amount of $6,705.47 million, will require Ford to make cash payments to the New VEBA beginning on December 31, 2009, and thereafter on June 30 of each year in the period 2010 through 2022.  Note B, a non-interest bearing note in the principal amount of $6,511.85 million, also will require Ford to make payments to the New VEBA beginning on December 31, 2009, and thereafter on June 30 of each year in the period 2010 through 2022.  Note B, however, gives Ford the option, subject to certain conditions, of making each payment in cash, Ford Common Stock, or a combination of cash and Ford Common Stock, with any Ford Common Stock to be delivered in satisfaction of such payment obligation being valued based on the volume-weighted average price per share for the 30 trading-day period ending on the second business day prior to the relevant payment date.  The aggregate principal amount of Note A and Note B (i.e., $13.2 billion), and the amortization thereof, represent approximately the equivalent value of:  (i) the principal amounts of and interest payments on the Old Notes, (ii) the annual $52.3 million base payment amounts, and (iii) an additional $25 million per year during the period 2009 through 2018, which is intended to cover transaction costs the New VEBA may incur in selling any shares of Ford Common Stock delivered pursuant to the terms of Note B.  Note A and Note B do not include or represent amounts constituting assets in the existing internal VEBA ($2.7 billion at December 31, 2008) or interest payments on the Old Notes and base amount payments made since January 1, 2009 and prior to December 31, 2009 into the TAA.  These assets or amounts will be transferred in accordance with the original terms of the 2008 Settlement Agreement.
 
-3-
 
Under the Amended Settlement Agreement, Ford will also issue to the New VEBA a warrant entitling it to purchase approximately 362 million shares of Ford Common Stock at an exercise price of $9.20 per share, which is intended to mirror the economic value of the conversion option of the Convertible Note provided for in the 2008 Settlement Agreement.  In addition, an amended securityholder and registration rights agreement provides for certain hedging restrictions, certain sales restrictions relating to Note A and Note B as well as the warrant and shares of Ford Common Stock, and customary registration rights relating to the sale of shares of Ford Common Stock received by the New VEBA pursuant to Ford's stock payment option in respect of Note B, as well as the warrant and shares of Ford Common Stock issued upon the exercise thereof.
On July 22, 2009, Ford and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Ford-UAW Holdings LLC (the "LLC") amended that certain Note Purchase Agreement dated as of April 7, 2008 between them (the "Note Purchase Agreement").  The Note Purchase Agreement governs and relates to the Second Lien Note referenced above issued in April 2008 by Ford to the LLC pursuant to the 2008 Settlement Agreement.  The amendment to the Note Purchase Agreement, which was consented to by the UAW and counsel to class representatives, is filed as Exhibit 10.3 hereto and is incorporated by reference herein.
Amendment to 2008 Note Purchase Agreement.  
The amendment to the Note Purchase Agreement amended a covenant therein that restricted Ford from having more than $4 billion of second lien debt secured by its assets outstanding at any time, subject to certain exceptions.  To permit Ford to borrow funds from the DOE or other federal governmental authorities (or a commercial bank and guaranteed by the DOE or other federal governmental authority) in excess of $4 billion secured on a second lien basis with the collateral pledged under the Credit Agreement, the parties to the Note Purchase Agreement amended this restriction to permit up to $14.4 billion of second lien debt, subject to the following conditions: (i) any such debt in excess of $4 billion ("Junior Lien Debt")  must be owed to the DOE or other federal governmental authority (or a commercial bank and guaranteed by the DOE or other federal governmental authority); (ii) any Junior Lien Debt, through an inter-creditor agreement, must be junior to the Second Lien Note and (iii) subject to certain exceptions, the Note Purchase Agreement must be amended to include the benefit of any terms contained in existing or future Junior Lien Debt if such terms, taken as whole, are more favorable to the lenders thereof than those contained in the Note Purchase Agreement.  This covenant, as amended, also will be a term of Note A and Note B.
As a result of the condition described in clause (iii) of the preceding paragraph, the Note Purchase Agreement also was amended to add covenants and events of default that are consistent with those provided for in the DOE Commitment Letter referenced above.  These additional covenants and events of default mirror those contained in the Credit Agreement.

Terms used in the Settlement Agreement Amendment and not otherwise defined herein shall have the same meaning as defined in the Settlement Agreement (as hereinafter defined).
The Final Effective Date under the 2008 Settlement Agreement occurred on August 29, 2008.
With regard to Ford, the UAW and the Class (as defined therein), the 2008 Settlement Agreement (i) resolved and settled all claims that arise in connection with Hardwick II; (ii) resolved and settled all claims, motions and other issues pertaining to or remaining in Hardwick I; (iii) amended, superseded or otherwise supplanted the Hardwick I Settlement Agreement; and (iv) provided the basis upon which the judgment entered July 13, 2006 in Hardwick I shall be satisfied, superseded or amended as necessary to give full force and effect to the terms of the 2008 Settlement Agreement.  The 2008 Settlement Agreement also resolved and settled any and all claims for Ford contributions to the Existing External VEBA, and provided for the termination of the Existing External VEBA and the transfer of all assets and liabilities of the Existing External VEBA to the New VEBA.
 
 
 
The 2008 Settlement Agreement recognized and approved on the basis set forth therein: (i) the amendment of the Ford Retiree Health Plan to terminate coverage for and exclude from coverage, the Class and the Covered Group (as defined therein); (ii) the transfer of the assets of the Existing Internal VEBA to the New VEBA; (iii) the termination of participation by the Class and the Covered Group under the Existing Internal VEBA; (iv) the termination of the Existing External VEBA in conjunction with the establishment of the New Plan, and the transfer to the New VEBA of all assets and liabilities of the Existing External VEBA; (v) that all claims for Retiree Medical Benefits incurred after the Implementation Date by the Class and the Covered Group, including but not limited to COBRA continuation coverage where such election is (or had been) made on or after retirement and any coverage provided on a self-paid basis in retirement, shall be solely the responsibility and liability of the New Plan and the New VEBA; (vi) the Committees designation under the New Plan and New VEBA as named fiduciary and administrator of the New Plan; (vii) that the New Plan shall replace the Ford Retiree Health Plan with respect to the provision of Retiree Medical Benefits to the Class and the Covered Group; (viii) that the New VEBA shall receive certain payments and other consideration as described therein from the Existing Internal VEBA, the Existing External VEBA and Ford; (ix) that Fords obligation to pay into the New VEBA is fixed and capped as described therein; and (x) that the New VEBA shall serve as the exclusive funding mechanism for the New Plan.
This Settlement Agreement Amendment is entered into by the parties to the 2008 Settlement Agreement to implement certain amendments that the parties agree are necessary to provide funding for the provision of Retiree Medical Benefits to the Class and the Covered Group as contemplated by the 2008 Settlement Agreement. In connection with the 2009 negotiations between Ford and the UAW over the terms of certain modifications to the Ford-UAW National Agreements, the UAW and its financial advisors engaged in further review and analysis of Fords financial condition in light of the economic conditions facing the automotive industry and the effect thereof on the ability of Ford to meet its payment obligations under the 2008 Settlement Agreement, absent the restructuring of such obligations pursuant to this Settlement Agreement Amendment.  Class Counsel and their financial advisors engaged in similar review and analysis.  The UAW, Class Counsel and their respective financial advisors also analyzed the benefits of the amendments to the 2008 Settlement Agreement provided for herein and the favorable impact of entering into such amendments on the ability of the New VEBA to provide Retiree Medical Benefits over the long term in accordance with the 2008 Settlement Agreement. The UAW and the Class Representatives (on behalf of the Class, by and through Class Counsel) are entering into this Settlement Agreement Amendment based in part on progress by Ford in respect of restructuring actions with other stakeholders including, but not limited to, the restructuring initiatives completed by Ford and Ford Motor Credit Company LLC on or before April 8, 2009 and described in press releases attached as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 to the April 6, 2009 filing by Ford on Form 8-K.

Throughout the 2007 negotiations between Ford and the UAW over the terms of a new Ford-UAW National Agreement, the parties engaged in extended discussions concerning the impact of rising health care costs on Fords financial condition and its ability to compete in the North American marketplace.  Ford provided the UAW with extensive information as to its financial condition and health care expenditures.  On behalf of the UAW, a team of investment bankers, actuaries, and legal experts have reviewed Fords information, and provided the UAW with an assessment as to the state of Fords financial condition and analyzed the benefits of entering into the MOU.  Ford officials also met with representatives of the UAW and its team of experts and answered questions and provided further detail, as requested.  The UAW and its team of experts have now analyzed, , the funds necessary to provide ongoing Retiree Medical Benefits through the New Plan and the New VEBA.
inter
alia
 
During these discussions, Ford asserted, as it had in Hardwick I, that it has the right to unilaterally modify and/or terminate the health care benefits applicable to its hourly retirees and that, without this Settlement Agreement, Ford would exercise its right to terminate the Hardwick I Settlement Agreement according to its terms as well as exercise its right to unilaterally modify retiree health care benefits.  Although the UAW acknowledges Fords right to terminate the Hardwick I Settlement Agreement, it continues to assert that the retiree health care benefits are vested and that Ford does not have the right to unilaterally modify or terminate retiree health care benefits.
 
On behalf of the Class, Class Counsel conducted a substantial factual investigation and legal inquiry prior to entering into the 2008 Settlement Agreement.  Similar to what was done by the UAW, this included, , review of Fords financial information, review and analysis of  collective bargaining agreements, relevant health care plan documents, and actuarial information, and review of material on Fords health care costs.  Class Counsel retained experts to review the financial and actuarial information and, with the assistance of these experts, conducted an extensive review of Fords projected financial condition, Fords ability to provide Retiree Medical Benefits over the long term, and the proposed New VEBAs ability to provide Retiree Medical Benefits over the long term with the funds available from the 2008 Settlement Agreement.  Class Counsel has also thoroughly investigated the law applicable to the Class Members claims and has done so considering the collective bargaining agreements and health care plan documents affecting these claims.  Class Counsel examined the benefits and certainty to be obtained under the 2008 Settlement Agreement for an aging Class, and has considered the costs, risks and delays associated with the prosecution of complex and time-consuming litigation, and the likely appeals of any rulings in favor of any party.

alia

In connection with the 2009 negotiations between Ford and the UAW over the terms of certain modifications to the 2007 Ford-UAW National Agreement, the UAW and its financial advisors engaged in further review and analysis of Fords financial condition in light of the economic conditions facing the automotive industry and the effect thereof on the ability of Ford to meet its payment obligations under the 2008 Settlement Agreement, absent the restructuring of such obligations pursuant to an amendment to the 2008 Settlement Agreement.  They also analyzed the benefits of the amendments to the 2008 Settlement Agreement provided for in the Setlement Agreement Amendment and the favorable impact of entering into such amendments on the ability of the New VEBA to provide Retiree Medical Benefits over the long term in accordance with this Settlement Agreement.  Acting on behalf of the Class, Class Counsel and their advisors conducted a similar review and analysis of Fords financial condition and of the benefits of the amendments to the 2008 Settlement Agreement, as reflected herein, and the favorable impact of entering into such amendments on the ability of the New VEBA to provide Retiree Medical Benefits over the long term in accordance with this Settlement Agreement.  Based on that review and analysis, Class Counsel believes that, in consideration of all the circumstances, the amendments are fair, reasonable, adequate and in the best interest of all members of the Class.  Class Counsel participated in the negotiation of this Settlement Agreement.
 
A.            .  The Approval Order provided that the New Plan and New VEBA, both subject to ERISA, shall be administered by the Committee.  The Committee was established on October 16, 2008.

The Approval Order designated the initial independent members who are set forth in Attachment 1 of to this Settlement Agreement.  In the event that any member of the Committee resigns, dies, becomes incapacitated or otherwise ceases to be a member, a replacement member shall be appointed as described in the Trust Agreement.
Committee
Exhibit A
 
B.            . The EBA, acting through the Committee, shall establish and maintain the New Plan for the purpose of providing Retiree Medical Benefits to the Class and the  Covered Group as set forth in this Settlement Agreement.  The Committee shall begin administering the New Plan so as to be able to provide Retiree Medical Benefits for the Class and the Covered Group with respect to claims incurred after the Implementation Date.  The New VEBA was established on October 16, 2008.  The New Plan shall be ERISA-covered and the New VEBA shall meet the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.  All payments to the New Plan and the New VEBA made or caused to be made by Ford under the Settlement Agreement are payments pursuant to section 302(c)(2) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, as amended ("LMRA"), 29 U.S.C. 186(c)(2).
Establish and Maintain
 
C.            .

No member of the Committee shall be authorized to act for Ford or shall be an agent or representative of Ford for any purpose.  Furthermore, Ford shall not be a fiduciary with respect to the New Plan or New VEBA, and shall have no rights, obligations or responsibilities with respect to the New Plan or New VEBA other than as specifically set forth in this Settlement Agreement.
Limitation on Ford Role
 
12
 
 
 
A.            .  With respect to claims incurred on or prior to the Implementation Date, Retiree Medical Benefits for the Class and the Covered Group shall continue to be provided by the Ford Retiree Health Plan and the Existing External VEBA at the same level and scope as provided for by the Ford Retiree Health Plan and the Existing External VEBA under the Hardwick I Settlement Agreement, including Mitigation from the Existing External VEBA (for those entitled to it).  The payment by Ford and/or the Ford Retiree Health Plan of Retiree Medical Benefits for claims incurred on or prior to the Implementation Date shall not reduce Fords payment obligations to the New Plan and the New VEBA under this Settlement Agreement.
On or Prior to Implementation Date
 
B.            .  With respect to claims incurred after the Implementation Date, the New Plan and the New VEBA shall have sole responsibility for and be the exclusive source of funds to provide Retiree Medical Benefits for the Class and the Covered Group, including but not limited to COBRA continuation coverage where such election is made after retirement.  Neither Ford, the Ford Retiree Health Plan, the Existing Internal VEBA, nor any other Ford person, entity, or benefit plan shall have any responsibility or liability for Retiree Medical Benefits for individuals in the Class or in the Covered Group for claims incurred after the Implementation Date.  Fords sole obligations to the New Plan and the New VEBA are those set forth in this Settlement Agreement.
After Implementation Date
 
The Committee shall have such authority to establish Benefits as described in the Trust Agreement, including raising or lowering benefits.  However, in no event may the Committee amend the New Plan or New VEBA to provide benefits other than Retiree Medical Benefits until the expiration of the Initial Accounting Period.  The ability of the New Plan and the New VEBA to pay for Retiree Medical Benefits will depend on numerous factors, many of which are outside of the control of UAW, the Committee, the New Plan and the New VEBA, including, without limitation, the investment returns, actuarial experience and other factors.
 
C.            .  The Approval Order provided and the Amendment Approval Order shall provide that all obligations of Ford and all provisions of the Ford Retiree Health Plan in any way related to Retiree Medical Benefits for the Class and/or the Covered Group, and all provisions of applicable collective bargaining agreements, contracts, letters and understandings in any way related to Retiree Medical Benefits for the Class and the Covered Group are forever and irrevocably terminated as of the end of the Implementation Date, or otherwise amended so as to be consistent with this Settlement Agreement and the fundamental understanding that all Ford obligations regarding Retiree Medical Benefits for the Class and the Covered Group are terminated as set forth in this Settlement Agreement.  Summary Plan Descriptions of the Ford Retiree Health Plan shall be amended to reflect the termination of Ford and Ford Retiree Health Plan responsibilities for Retiree Medical Benefits for the Class and the Covered Group for claims incurred after the Implementation Date as set forth herein.
Amendment of Ford Retiree Health Plan and Reimbursement of Ford
 
13
 
 
The New Plan and New VEBA shall reimburse Ford or the Ford Retiree Health Plan, as applicable, for any Retiree Medical Benefits advanced or provided by Ford or the Ford Retiree Health Plan with regard to claims incurred by members of the Class and the Covered Group after the Implementation Date, including, but not limited to, situations where a retirement is made retroactive and the medical claims were incurred after the Implementation Date or where Ford is notified of an intent by a member of the Class and the Covered Group to retire under circumstances where there is insufficient time to transfer responsibility for Retiree Medical Benefits to the New Plan and Ford or the Ford Retiree Health Plan provides interim coverage for Retiree Medical Benefits.  To the extent such reimbursement may not be permitted by law, the UAW, the Class, Class Counsel and the Committee shall fully cooperate with Ford in securing any legal or regulatory approvals that are necessary to permit such reimbursement.
 
 
A.            . The 2008 Settlement Agreement provided for the Existing Internal VEBA balance as of December 31, 2007 to be determined using the December 31, 2007 valuation from the independent trustee of the Existing Internal VEBA,which was to be based on the existing trust agreement for the Existing Internal VEBA.  In accordance with this methodology, the December 31, 2007 valuation of the Existing Internal VEBA for purposes of this Section 6.A is $3,739,851,094.10.  The determination of the Existing Internal VEBA balance as of December 31, 2007 is final and binding on Ford, the UAW, the Committee, the Class Representatives, the Class, the Covered Group and Class Counsel for purposes of this Settlement Agreement upon an Independent Audit.

Ford does not guarantee or warrant the investment returns on the assets in the Existing Internal VEBA.
Investment of Assets
 
C.            .  Since the date of the 2008 Settlement Agreement no amounts have been withdrawn by Ford, and no amounts shall be withdrawn by Ford, from the Existing Internal VEBA, including its investment returns, until transfer to the New VEBA under Section 12 or termination of this Settlement Agreement under Section 30 of this Settlement Agreement.  If the Implementation Date occurs, Ford shall cause all assets in the Existing Internal VEBA, including investment returns thereon, net of trust expenses (this shall only include expenses to the extent permitted by ERISA) not previously taken into account in determining investment returns, to be transferred from the Existing Internal VEBA to the New VEBA as set forth in Sections 8.A and 12.B of this Settlement Agreement.  Ford and the Committee shall enter into discussions in advance of such transfer with regard to the method of allocating, transferring and/or otherwise handling any illiquid or otherwise non-transferable investments in the Existing Internal VEBA so as to preserve as much as possible the economic value of such investments and minimize any losses due to the liquidation of assets.  Such discussions shall be completed by November 30, 2009.  The determinations made by Ford as a product of these discussions with the Committee regarding the way to transfer illiquid or otherwise non-transferable investments in the Existing Internal VEBA shall be final and binding on Ford, the UAW, the Committee, the Class Representatives, the Class, the Covered Group and Class Counsel.

Promptly after the date of this Settlement Agreement, Ford shall cause the LLC to execute and deliver an instrument of accession, supplementing the accession previously delivered pursuant to the 2008 Settlement Agreement, in which it shall agree to be bound by and to perform the provisions of Sections 7, 8 and 12 of this Settlement Agreement to the extent applicable to the LLC.

Upon termination of the TAA for any reason, Ford and the LLC may use the assets of the TAA and the LLC for any corporate purpose.
Termination of TAA; Liquidation of LLC
 
G.            .

General
 
B.            .

Limitation on Liens
 
 
 
26

Application of the dispute resolution process set forth in Section 26 of this Settlement Agreement does not relieve Ford of the obligation to pay accrued Interest for the period of time that the dispute resolution process is in effect in order to cure a default.
Dispute Resolution
 
27

Cooperation by Ford
 
To the extent permitted by law, Ford shall also allow retiree participants to voluntarily have required contributions withheld from pension benefits and to the extent reasonably practical, credited to the Ford Separate Retiree Account of the New VEBA on a monthly basis.  A retiree participant may elect or withdraw consent for pension withholdings at any time by providing 45 days written notice to the Pension Plan administrator or such shorter period that may be required by law; provided, however, that Ford will not be required to obtain new affirmative consents from existing retiree participants who provided consent pursuant to the Hardwick I Settlement Agreement to the extent that any required contributions may be withheld in accordance with such prior consent.
 
To the extent permitted by law, Ford shall also cooperate with the Committee to make provision for the New VEBA payments of the $76.20 Special Benefit to be incorporated into monthly Ford pension checks for eligible retirees and surviving spouses.  It shall be the responsibility of the Committee and the New VEBA to advise Fords pension paying agent in a timely manner of eligibility changes with regard to the Special Benefit payment.  The timing of the information provided to Fords pension paying agent shall determine the timing for the incorporation into the monthly pension check.  It will be the responsibility of the Committee and the New VEBA to establish a bank account for the funding of the Special Benefit payments, and Fords pension paying agent will be provided with the approval to draw on that account for the payment of the benefit.  The Committee and the New VEBA shall assure that the bank account is adequately funded for any and all such payments.  If adequate funds do not exist for the payments, then Fords pension paying agent shall not make such payments until the required funding is established in the account.  It will be the responsibility of the Committee and the New VEBA to audit the eligibility for, and payment of, the Special Benefit. Additionally, the Committee and the New VEBA shall be responsible for the payment of reasonable costs associated with Fords administration of the payment of this Special Benefit and the pension withholdings, including development of administrative and recordkeeping processes, monthly payment processing, audit and reconciliation functions and the like.
 
28

This shall include the cost of educational efforts and communications with respect to retirees, creation of administrative procedures, initial development of record sharing procedures, the testing of computer systems, vendor selection and contracting, and other activities incurred on or before the Implementation Date, including but not limited to costs associated with drafting the Trust Agreement, seeking from the Internal Revenue Service a determination of the tax-exempt status of the New VEBA, plan design and actuarial and other professional work necessary for initiation of the New Plan and New VEBA and the benefits to be provided thereunder.  Ford payments described in this Section shall not reduce its payment obligations under this Settlement Agreement, and if the New VEBA is a multi-employer welfare trust, the costs described in this Section, to the extent not allocable to a specific employer, shall be pro-rated among the participating companies based on the ratio of required funding for each company.  Payment of these costs shall be set forth explicitly in the Approval Order.  Notwithstanding this paragraph, the Dental Benefit Eligibility & Enrollment Plan Sponsor Agreement and the Administrative Services Agreement, each by and between Ford and the Trust Committee of the Independent Health Care Trust for the UAW Retirees of Ford Motor Company, shall remain in full force and effect until otherwise terminated by the parties thereto.
 
B.            .  The UAW and the Committee shall cooperate and shall timely furnish Ford with such information, and any schedules supporting such information, related to the New Plan and New VEBA, in a form and to the extent maintained by the UAW and the Committee, as may be reasonably necessary to permit Ford to comply with requirements of the SEC, including, but not limited to, any disclosures contemplated or agreed to with the staff of the SEC as a result of Fords discussions with the staff, and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, including but not limited to SFAS 87, SFAS 106, SFAS 132R, SFAS 157, and SFAS 158 (as amended), for disclosure in Ford's financial statements and any filings with the SEC.
Cooperation With Ford
 
 
 
The parties agree that the assets of the TAA and the LLC shall not be plan assets of the New Plan and New VEBA unless and until actual transfer or payment to the New VEBA.  The UAW, Ford, and the Class and Class Counsel acknowledge that the instrument establishing the TAA and communications to the Class regarding the TAA, shall be consistent with the principles set forth in DOL Advisory Opinions 92-02A, 92-24 and 94-31A so as to avoid the assets in the TAA being deemed plan assets within the meaning of ERISA.  If Ford determines that the assets in the TAA and/or the LLC as described in Section 7 of this Settlement Agreement are likely to be deemed plan assets, Ford shall apply for a prohibited transaction exemption from the DOL to permit the acquisition and holding of the employer security in the TAA and/or the LLC.  The UAW, the Class and Class Counsel shall fully cooperate with Ford in securing any such legal or regulatory approvals.
 
29
 
 
If Ford elects to transfer New Note A, New Note B, the Warrants and any Payment Shares to the New VEBA and such notes and securities are not qualifying employer securities, Fordand the New VEBA shall have received a prohibited transaction exemption or reasonable assurance of retroactive regulatory relief reasonably satisfactory to Ford and the New VEBA from the DOL that would permit the New VEBA to acquire and hold such notes and securities. Similarly, if qualifying employer securities and employer real property would exceed 10 percent of the total assets in the New VEBA immediately after transfer of New Note A, New Note B, the Warrants and any Payment Shares to the New VEBA, then Ford and the New VEBAshall have received a prohibited transaction exemption or reasonable assurance of retroactive regulatory relief reasonably satisfactory to Ford and the New VEBA from the DOL to permit the New VEBA to acquire and hold such notes and securities.  The UAW, the Class and Class Counsel shall fully cooperate with Ford and the New VEBA in securing any necessary legal or regulatory approvals.  If Ford and the New VEBA cannot obtain either a prohibited transaction exemption or reasonable assurance of retroactive regulatory relief reasonably satisfactory to Ford and the New VEBA prior to November 30, 2009, (i) the parties shall meet and seek to agree upon an appropriate, mutually satisfactory alternative that is (A) economically equivalent in value to the New VEBA and to Ford and (B) that does not constitute a prohibited transaction under ERISA (an ) and (ii) the parties shall be authorized without further order of the Court to adopt such Equivalent Payment Structure, in satisfaction of their rights and obligations hereunder.
 
 
Equivalent Payment Structure
 
 
Subject to approval by the Court as part of the Amendment Approval Order, Ford hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the UAW, and its current or former officers, directors, employees and expert advisors (each, an ), to the extent permitted by law, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, obligations, assessments, penalties, judgments, awards, and other liabilities related to any decision, recommendations or other actions taken prior to the date of this Settlement Agreement (collectively, Indemnification Liabilities), and shall fully reimburse any Indemnified Party for any and all reasonable and documented attorney fees and expenses (collectively, ), as and when incurred, of investigating, preparing or defending any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, arising out of or in connection with any Indemnification Liabilities incurred as a result of an Indemnified Partys entering into, or participation in the negotiations for, this Settlement Agreement and the MOU and the transactions contemplated in connection herewith; provided, however, that such indemnity shall not apply to any portion of any such Indemnification Liability or Indemnity Expense that resulted from the gross negligence, illegal or willful misconduct by an Indemnified Party; provided, further, that such indemnity shall not apply to any Indemnification Liabilities to a Ford Active Employee for breach of the duty of fair representation.
Indemnified Party
Indemnity Expenses
 
30
 
 
Nothing in this Section 23 or any provision of this Settlement Agreement shall be construed to provide an indemnity for any member or any actions of the Committee; provided however, that an Indemnified Party who becomes a member of the Committee shall remain entitled to any indemnity to which the Indemnified Party would otherwise be entitled pursuant to this Section 23 for actions taken, or for a failure to take actions, in any capacity other than as a member of the Committee; and provided further, that nothing in this Section 23 or any other provision of this Settlement Agreement shall be construed to provide an indemnity for any Indemnification Liabilities or Indemnity Expenses relating to (i) management of the assets of the New VEBA or (ii) for any action, amendment or omission of the Committee with respect to the provision and administration of Retiree Medical Benefits.
 
If an Indemnified Party receives notice of any action, proceeding or claim as to which the Indemnified Party proposes to demand indemnification hereunder, it shall provide Ford prompt written notice thereof.  Failure by an Indemnified Party to so notify Ford shall relieve Ford from the obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder only to the extent that Ford suffers actual prejudice as a result of such failure, but Ford shall not be obligated to provide reimbursement for any Indemnity Expenses incurred for work performed prior to its receipt of written notice of the claim.  If an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder, Ford shall have the right to participate in such proceeding or elect to assume the defense of such action or proceeding at its own expense and through counsel chosen by Ford (such counsel being reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party).  The Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith in such defense.  Upon the assumption by Ford of the defense of any such action or proceeding, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in, but not control the defense of, such action and retain its own counsel but the expenses and fees shall be at its expense unless (a) Ford has agreed to pay such Indemnity Expenses, (b) Ford shall have failed to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to an Indemnified Party in a timely manner, or (c) the Indemnified Party shall have been advised by counsel that there are actual or potential conflicting interests between Ford and the Indemnified Party that require separate representation, and Ford has agreed that such actual or potential conflict exists (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld); provided, however, that Ford shall not, in connection with any such action or proceeding arising out of the same general allegations, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate law firm at any time for all Indemnified Parties not having actual or potential conflicts among them, except to the extent that local counsel, in addition to its regular counsel, is required in order to effectively defend against such action or proceeding.  All such fees and expenses shall be invoiced to Ford, with such detail and supporting information as Ford may reasonably require, in such intervals as Ford shall require under its standard billing processes.
 
If the Indemnified Party receives notice from Ford that Ford has elected to assume the defense of the action or proceeding, Ford will not be liable for any attorney fees or other legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the matter.
 
Ford shall not be liable for any settlement of any claim against an Indemnified Party made without Fords written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.  Ford shall not, without the prior written consent of an Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, settle or compromise any claim, or permit a default or consent to the entry of any judgment, that would create any financial obligation on the part of the Indemnified Party not otherwise within the scope of the indemnified liabilities.

(iii)           if the Number of Warrants represented by a Warrant Certificate shall not have been exercised in full, deliver a new Warrant Certificate, countersigned by the Warrant Agent, for the balance of the number of Warrants represented by the surrendered Warrant Certificate.
           Each Person in whose name any shares of Common Stock are issued shall for all purposes be deemed to have become the holder of record of such shares as of the Exercise Date or, in the case of a Warrant subject to Full Physical Settlement only, the date of payment by the Warrantholder of the Exercise Price in accordance with Section 3.03(b), if later.  However, if any such date is a date when the stock transfer books of the Company are closed, such Person shall be deemed to have become the holder of such shares at the Close of Business on the next succeeding date on which the stock transfer books are open.

The Company shall reimburse the Warrant Agent for any amounts paid by the Warrant Agent in respect of a fractional share or fractional Warrant upon such exercise in accordance with Section 3.06 hereof.
(b)
           The Company acknowledges that any bank accounts maintained by the Warrant Agent in connection with the services provided hereunder will be established and maintained in the name of the Paying Agent.

Section 3.06
.  No Fractional Shares to Be Issued.
 
           If any fraction of a Warrant shall be exercised hereunder, the Company shall pay the relevant Warrantholder Cash in lieu of the corresponding fraction of a share of Common Stock valued at the Closing Sale Price on the Exercise Date.  However, if more than one Warrant shall be exercised hereunder at one time by the same Warrantholder, the number of full shares which shall be issuable upon exercise thereof shall be computed on the basis of all Warrants (including any fractional Warrants) so exercised.  If any fraction of a share of Common Stock would, except for the provisions of this Section 3.06, be issuable on the exercise of any Warrant or Warrants (including any fractional Warrants), the Company shall pay the Warrantholder Cash in lieu of such fractional shares valued at the Closing Sale Price on the Exercise Date.

           Any Cash to be paid, or Common Stock to be delivered, to the Warrantholders hereunder shall be delivered to the Warrant Agent no later than the Business Day immediately preceding the date such consideration is required to be delivered to the Warrantholders.
(b)
           The Warrant Agent shall have no liability for any failure or delay in performing its duties hereunder caused by any failure or delay of the Company in providing such calculations or items to the Warrant Agent.  The Warrant Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock or Units of Reference Property that may at any time be issued or delivered upon the exercise of any Warrant, and it makes no representation with respect thereto.

.  (a) If a Designated Event occurs prior to January 1, 2011 and a Warrantholder elects to exercise its Warrants in connection with such Designated Event, the Company shall reduce the Exercise Price for the Warrants exercised by an amount (the ) and increase the Number of Warrants for the relevant Warrant Certificate (or portion thereof) as described in this Article 4.  An exercise of a Warrant shall be deemed for the purposes of this Section 4.01 to be in connection with a Designated Event if the Exercise Date for such Warrant falls during the period commencing on the effective date of the relevant Designated Event (the ) and ending on the 30 calendar day following the Effective Date for such Designated Event.
Section 4.01
Adjustment to Exercise Price Upon Designated Event.
 
Exercise Price Reduction
Effective Date
th
           Notwithstanding Section 4.01(a), the Exercise Price shall not be reduced (and the Number of Warrants for the relevant Warrant Certificate (or portion thereof) shall not be correspondingly increased) in the case of any Designated Event if at least 90% of the consideration, excluding Cash payments for fractional shares of Common Stock and Cash payments made pursuant to dissenters appraisal rights, in a transaction otherwise constituting a Designated Event consists of shares of common stock, depositary receipts or other certificates representing common equity interests traded on a U.S. national securities exchange, or will be so traded immediately following such transaction, and as a result of such transaction the Warrants become exercisable solely for such consideration.
(b)
(a) Within 15 calendar days after the Effective Date of any Designated Event, the Company shall mail a written notice of such Designated Event by first-class mail to the Warrant Agent and to each Warrantholder.  The notice must state the events causing, and the Effective Date of, such Designated Event.  If the Company fails to provide such notice within 15 calendar days of the Effective Date, the period during which Warrantholders may exercise their Warrants and receive the relevant Exercise Price Reduction (and the corresponding increase in the Number of Warrants for the relevant Warrant Certificate (or portion thereof)) will be extended by the number of calendar days that such notification is delayed or not otherwise provided to Warrantholders beyond the specified notice deadline.
Section 4.02
.  Notice of Designated Event.  
           The Company shall mail a notice to Warrantholders and issue a press release through Dow Jones & Company, Inc. or Bloomberg Business News or other similarly broad public medium that is customary for such press releases no later than 10 days prior to the anticipated Effective Date for any Designated Event. The failure to deliver such notice or issue such press release shall not affect the validity of such transaction.
(b)
 
19
 
(a) The amount of the Exercise Price Reduction with respect to Warrants exercised in connection with any Designated Event shall be determined by reference to the table below in Section 4.03(c) and shall be based on the Effective Date of, and the Applicable Price for, such Designated Event.
Section 4.03
.  Exercise Price Reduction.
 
           The Applicable Prices set forth in the first row of the table below (i.e., the column headers), and the Exercise Price Reduction amounts set forth in the table below, shall each be adjusted at the same time and in the manner as the Exercise Price as set forth in Article 5.
(b)
           The following table sets forth the amount of the Exercise Price Reduction for given Applicable Prices and Effective Dates:
(c)
           If the exact Applicable Price and/or Effective Date are not set forth in the table above, then:
(d)
(i)           if the actual Applicable Price is between two Applicable Prices in the table or the Effective Date is between two Effective Dates in the table, the Exercise Price Reduction shall be determined by a straight-line interpolation between the Exercise Price Reduction set forth for the higher and lower Applicable Prices and/or the earlier and later Effective Dates in the table, based on a 365-day year, as applicable;
(ii)           if the actual Applicable Price is equal to or in excess of $40.00 per share, subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 4.03(b), the Exercise Price shall not be reduced pursuant to this Section 4.03 (and there shall be no corresponding increase to the Number of Warrants for the relevant Warrant Certificate (or portion thereof) pursuant to Section 4.04) upon exercise of any Warrant in connection with the relevant Designated Event; and
(iii)           if the Applicable Price is equal to or less than $8.00 per share, subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 4.03(b), the Exercise Price shall not be reduced pursuant to this Section 4.03 (and there shall be no corresponding increase to the Number of Warrants for the relevant Warrant Certificate (or portion thereof) pursuant to Section 4.04) upon exercise of any Warrant in connection with the relevant Designated Event.
 
20
 
           Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Company reduce the Exercise Price if the reduction would cause the Exercise Price to fall below $8.00, such price subject to adjustment at the same time and in the same manner as the Exercise Price as set forth in Article 5.
(e)
If the Exercise Price for any Warrants that are exercised in connection with a Designated Event is reduced pursuant to Section 4.03, the Number of Warrants for the exercised Warrant Certificate (or portion thereof) shall concurrently be increased by multiplying the Number of Warrants for such exercised Warrant Certificate (or portion thereof) prior to such increase by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which is the Exercise Price prior to giving effect to such Exercise Price Reduction and (ii) the denominator of which is the Exercise Price after giving effect to such Exercise Price Reduction.
Section 4.04
.  Adjustment to Number of Warrants.  
The Exercise Price for the Warrants shall be subject to adjustment (without duplication) upon the occurrence of any of the following events:
Section 5.01
.  Adjustments to Exercise Price.
           The issuance of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution to all holders of Common Stock, or a subdivision or combination of Common Stock, in which event the Exercise Price shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
(a)
 
where:
 
21
 
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the Close of Business on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution, or immediately after the Open of Business on the effective date for such subdivision or combination, as the case may be. If any dividend or distribution or subdivision or combination of the type described in this Section 5.01(a) is declared or announced but not so paid or made, the Exercise Price shall again be adjusted to the Exercise Price that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution or subdivision or combination had not been declared or announced, as the case may be.
           The issuance to all holders of Common Stock of rights or warrants entitling them for a period expiring 60 days or less from the date of issuance of such rights or warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into Common Stock) at less than (or having a conversion price per share less than) the Current Market Price of Common Stock, in which event the Exercise Price will be adjusted based on the following formula:
(b)
 
where:
 
22
 
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the Close of Business on the Record Date for such issuance.  In the event that the issuance of such rights, warrants or convertible securities is announced but such rights, warrants or convertible securities are not so issued, the Exercise Price shall again be adjusted to be the Exercise Price that would then be in effect if the Record Date for such issuance had not occurred.  To the extent that such rights or warrants are not exercised prior to their expiration or shares of Common Stock are otherwise not delivered pursuant to such rights, warrants or convertible securities, upon the expiration, termination or maturity of such rights, warrants or convertible securities, the Exercise Price shall be readjusted to the Exercise Price that would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights, warrants or convertible securities been made on the basis of the delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered.  In determining the aggregate price payable for such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received for such rights or warrants, as well as any consideration received in connection with the conversion of any convertible securities issued upon exercise of such rights or warrants, and the value of such consideration, if other than Cash, shall be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.
           The dividend or other distribution to all holders of Common Stock of shares of the Companys Capital Stock (other than Common Stock) or evidences of the Companys indebtedness, rights or warrants to purchase the Companys securities, or the Companys assets (excluding any dividend, distribution or issuance covered by clauses (a) or (b) above or (d) or (e) below), in which event the Exercise Price will be adjusted based on the following formula:
(c)
 
where:
 
23
 
Such decrease shall become effective immediately after the Close of Business on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution. In the event that such dividend or distribution is declared or announced but not so paid or made, the Exercise Price shall again be adjusted to be the Exercise Price which would then be in effect if such distribution had not been declared or announced.
However, if the transaction that gives rise to an adjustment pursuant to this clause (c) is one pursuant to which the payment of a dividend or other distribution on Common Stock consists of shares of capital stock of, or similar equity interests in, a subsidiary of the Company or other business unit of the Company (i.e., a spin-off) that are, or, when issued, will be, traded or quoted on the New York Stock Exchange or any other national or regional securities exchange or market, then the Exercise Price will instead be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
where:
 
24
 
Such decrease shall be made immediately after the Close of Business on the last Trading Day of the Valuation Period for such dividend or distribution, but shall be given effect immediately after the Close of Business on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution.  To the extent that the Exercise Date for any Warrant occurs during the Valuation Period for such dividend or distribution, the Settlement Date for such Warrants shall be postponed to the third Business Day immediately following the last Trading Day of such Valuation Period.  In the event that such dividend or distribution is declared or announced but not so paid or made, the Exercise Price shall again be adjusted to be the Exercise Price which would then be in effect if such distribution had not been declared or announced.
           Dividends or other distributions consisting exclusively of Cash to all holders of Common Stock, in which event the Exercise Price will be adjusted based on the following formula:
(d)
 
where:
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the Close of Business on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution. In the event that such dividend or distribution declared or announced but is not so paid or made, the Exercise Price shall again be adjusted to be the Exercise Price which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared or announced.
 
25
 
           The Company or one or more subsidiaries of the Company make purchases of Common Stock pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer (other than offers not subject to Rule 13e-4 under the Exchange Act) by the Company or a subsidiary of the Company for the Common Stock, to the extent that the Cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock validly tendered or exchanged exceeds the Closing Sale Price per share of Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (the ), in which event the Exercise Price will be adjusted based on the following formula:
(e)
Offer Expiration Date
 
 
where:
 
26
 
An adjustment, if any, to the Exercise Price pursuant to this clause (e) shall become effective immediately prior to the Open of Business on the second Trading Day immediately following the Offer Expiration Date.  In the event that the Company or a subsidiary of the Company is obligated to purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to any such tender offer or exchange offer, but the Company or such subsidiary is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases, or all such purchases are rescinded, then the Exercise Price shall again be adjusted to be the Exercise Price which would then be in effect if such tender offer or exchange offer had not been made.  Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, if the application of this clause (e) to any tender offer or exchange offer would result in an increase in the Exercise Price, no adjustment shall be made for such tender offer or exchange offer under this clause (e).
           For the purposes of Section 5.01(a), (b) and (c), any dividend or distribution to which Section 5.01(c) is applicable that also includes shares of Common Stock, or rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock (or both), shall be deemed instead to be (i) a dividend or distribution of the indebtedness, assets or shares of Capital Stock other than such shares of Common Stock or rights or warrants (and any Exercise Price adjustment required by Section 5.01(c) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall be made in respect of such dividend or distribution (without regard to the parenthetical in Section 5.01(c) that begins with the word excluding)) (ii) immediately followed by a dividend or distribution of such shares of Common Stock or such rights or warrants (and any further Exercise Price adjustment required by Section 5.01 with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made), except any shares of Common Stock included in such dividend or distribution shall not be deemed outstanding at the Close of Business on the Record Date.
(f)
Concurrently with any adjustment to the Exercise Price under Section 5.01, the Number of Warrants for each Warrant Certificate will be adjusted such that the Number of Warrants for each such Warrant Certificate in effect immediately following the effectiveness of such adjustment will be equal to the Number of Warrants for each such Warrant Certificate in effect immediately prior to such adjustment, a fraction, (i) the numerator of which is the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment and (ii) the denominator of which is the Exercise Price in effect immediately following such adjustment.

(iii)           are also issued in respect of future issuances of Common Stock,
shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of Article 5 (and no adjustment to the Exercise Price or the Number of Warrants under this Article 5 will be made) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event, whereupon such rights and warrants shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the Exercise Price and the Number of Warrants for each Warrant Certificate shall be made under this Article 5 (subject in all respects to Section 5.04).
           If any such right or warrant is subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights or warrants become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of indebtedness or other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and Record Date with respect to new rights or warrants with such rights (subject in all respects to Section 5.04).
(b)
           In addition, except as set forth in Section 5.04, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in Section 5.03(b)) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Exercise Price and the Number of Warrants for each Warrant Certificate under Article 5 was made (including any adjustment contemplated in Section 5.04):
(c)
(i)           in the case of any such rights or warrants that shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by the holders thereof, the Exercise Price and the Number of Warrants for each Warrant Certificate shall be readjusted upon such final redemption or repurchase to give effect to such distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a Cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder or holders of Common Stock with respect to such rights or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights or warrants), made to all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase; and
(ii)           in the case of such rights or warrants that shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by the holders thereof, the Exercise Price and the Number of Warrants for each Warrant Certificate shall be readjusted as if such rights and warrants had not been issued.

If a Company shareholders rights plan under which any rights are issued provides that each share of Common Stock issued upon exercise of Warrants at any time prior to the distribution of separate certificates representing such rights shall be entitled to receive such rights, prior to the separation of such rights from the Common Stock, the Exercise Price and the Number of Warrants for each Warrant Certificate shall not be adjusted pursuant to Section 5.01.  If, however, prior to any exercise of a Warrant, such rights have separated from the Common Stock, the Exercise Price and the Number of Warrants for each Warrant Certificate shall be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Company dividended or distributed to all holders of Common Stock, the Companys Capital Stock, evidences of the Companys indebtedness, certain rights or warrants to purchase the Companys securities or other of the Companys assets as described in Section 5.01(c), subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such rights.
Section 5.04
.  Shareholder Rights Plans.
To the extent Net Share Settlement applies to the exercise of any Warrant, the Board of Directors shall make appropriate adjustments to the amount of Cash or number of shares of Common Stock, as the case may be, due upon exercise of the Warrant, as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the intent of this Article 5 and to avoid unjust or inequitable results as determined in its good faith judgment, to account for any adjustment to the Exercise Price and the Number of Warrants for the relevant Warrant Certificate that becomes effective, or any event requiring an adjustment to the Exercise Price and the Number of Warrants for the relevant Warrant Certificate where the Record Date or effective date (in the case of a subdivision or combination of the Common Stock) of the event occurs, during the period beginning on, and including, the Exercise Date and ending on, and including, the related Settlement Date.
Section 5.05
.  Other Adjustments if Net Share Settlement Applies.  
The Company may from time to time, to the extent permitted by law and subject to applicable rules of the New York Stock Exchange, decrease the Exercise Price and/or increase the Number of Warrants for each Warrant Certificate by any amount for any period of at least 20 days.  In that case, the Company shall give the Warrantholders at least 15 days prior notice of such increase or decrease, and such notice shall state the decreased Exercise Price and/or increased Number of Warrants for each Warrant Certificate and the period during which the decrease and/or increase will be in effect.  The Company may make such decreases in the Exercise Price and/or increases in the Number of Warrants for each Warrant Certificate, in addition to those set forth in this Article 5, as the Companys Board of Directors deems advisable, including to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of the Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock (or rights to acquire stock) or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes.
Section 5.06
.  Discretionary Adjustments.  
 
29
 
(a) Except in accordance with Section 5.01, the Exercise Price and the Number of Warrants for any Warrant Certificate will not be adjusted for the issuance of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock or carrying the right to purchase any of the foregoing.
Section 5.07
.  Restrictions on Adjustments.  
           Neither the Exercise Price nor the Number of Warrants for any Warrant Certificate will be adjusted:

(ii)           for a change in the par value of the Common Stock.
           In no event will the Company adjust the Exercise Price or make a corresponding adjustment to the Number of Warrants for any Warrant Certificate to the extent that the adjustment would reduce the Exercise Price below the par value per share of Common Stock.
(c)
           Notwithstanding anything in this Article 5 to the contrary, the Exercise Price will not be adjusted, and no corresponding adjustment shall be made to the Number of Warrants for any Warrant Certificate, to the extent that the Exercise Price, as adjusted in accordance with Section 5.01, would be reduced below $8.00 (such price subject to adjustment in the same manner and at the same time as adjustments to the Exercise Price pursuant to this Article 5).
(d)
           No adjustment shall be made to the Exercise Price or the Number of Warrants for any Warrant Certificate for any of the transactions described in Section 5.01 if the Company makes provisions for Warrantholders to participate in any such transaction without exercising their Warrants on a basis and with notice that the Board of Directors determines in good faith to be fair and appropriate.
(e)
           No adjustment shall be made to the Exercise Price, nor will any corresponding adjustment be made to the Number of Warrants for any Warrant Certificate, unless the adjustment would result in a change of at least 1% of the Exercise Price; that any adjustments that are less than 1% of the Exercise Price shall be carried forward and such carried forward adjustments, regardless of whether the aggregate adjustment is less than 1% of the Exercise Price, shall be made (i) annually, on each anniversary of the Exchange Date and (ii) five Business Days prior to the Expiration Date, unless such adjustment has already been made.

for any Warrant Certificate then in effect shall be required by reason of the taking of such record.
In any case in which Section 5.01 provides that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after (a) a Record Date for an event, (b) the effective date (in the case of a subdivision or combination of the Common Stock) or (c) the Offer Expiration Date for any tender or exchange offer pursuant to Section 5.01(e) (each a ), the Company may elect to defer, until the later of the date the adjustment to the Exercise Price and Number of Warrants for each Warrant Certificate can be definitively determined and the occurrence of the applicable Adjustment Event (as hereinafter defined), (i) issuing to the Warrantholder of any Warrant exercised after such Determination Date and before the occurrence of such Adjustment Event, the additional shares of Common Stock or other securities or assets issuable upon such exercise by reason of the adjustment required by such Adjustment Event over and above the Common Stock issuable upon such exercise before giving effect to such adjustment and (ii) paying to such Warrantholder any amount in Cash in lieu of any fractional share of Common Stock or fractional Warrant pursuant to Section 3.06.

(iii)           any consolidation, merger or combination involving the Company;
(iv)           any sale or conveyance to a third party of all or substantially all of the Companys assets; or

(each such event a ), in each case as a result of which the Common Stock would be converted into, or exchanged for, stock, other securities, other property or assets (including cash or any combination thereof) (the ), then, following the effective time of the transaction, the right to receive shares of Common Stock upon exercise of a Warrant shall be changed to a right to receive, upon exercise of such Warrant, the kind and amount of shares of stock, other securities or other property or assets (including cash or any combination thereof) that a holder of one share of Common Stock would have owned or been entitled to receive in connection with such Reorganization Event (such kind and amount of Reference Property per share of Common Stock, a ).  In the event holders of Common Stock have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in a Reorganization Event, the type and amount of consideration into which the Warrants shall be exercisable from and after the effective time of such Reorganization Event shall be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of Common Stock in such Reorganization Event.  The Company hereby agrees not to become a party to any Reorganization Event unless its terms are consistent with this Section 5.09.
Reorganization Event
Reference Property
Unit of Reference Property
           At any time from, and including, the effective time of a Reorganization Event:
(b)
(i)           if Full Physical Settlement applies upon exercise of a Warrant, the Full Physical Share Amount per Warrant shall be equal to a single Unit of Reference Property;
(ii)           if Net Share Settlement applies upon exercise of a Warrant, the Net Share Amount per Warrant shall be a number of Units of Reference Property calculated as set forth in Section 3.03(c), except that the Closing Sale Price used to determine such Net Share Amount on any Trading Day shall be the Unit Value for such Trading Day;
(iii)           the Company shall pay Cash in lieu of delivering any fraction of a Unit of Reference Property or any fractional Warrant in accordance with Section 3.06 based on the Unit Value as of the Exercise Date; and
(iv)           the Closing Sale Price and the Current Market Price shall be calculated with respect to a Unit of Reference Property.
           The value of a Unit of Reference Property (the ) shall be determined as follows:
(c)
Unit Value
 
32
 
(i)           any shares of common stock of the successor or purchasing corporation or any other corporation that are traded on a national or regional stock exchange included in such Unit of Reference Property shall be valued as if such shares were Common Stock using procedures set forth in the definition of Closing Sale Price in Section 1.01;
(ii)           any other property (other than Cash) included in such Unit of Reference Property shall be valued in good faith by the Board of Directors or by a New York Stock Exchange member firm selected by the Board of Directors; and
(iii)           any Cash included in such Unit of Reference Property shall be valued at the amount thereof.
           On or prior to the effective time of any Reorganization Event, the Company or the successor or purchasing Person, as the case may be, shall execute an amendment to this Warrant Agreement providing that the Warrants shall be exercisable for Units of Reference Property in accordance with the terms of this Section 5.09.  If the Reference Property in connection with any Reorganization Event includes shares of stock or other securities and assets of a Person other than the successor or purchasing Person, as the case may be, in such Reorganization Event, then the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such amendment to this Warrant Agreement to be executed by such other Person and such amendment shall contain such additional provisions to protect the interests of the Warrantholders as the Board of Directors shall reasonably consider necessary by reason of the foregoing.  Any such amendment to this Warrant Agreement shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Article 5.  In the event the Company shall execute an amendment to this Warrant Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.09, the Company shall promptly file with the Warrant Agent an Officers Certificate briefly stating the reasons therefor, the kind or amount of cash, securities or property or asset that will comprise a Unit of Reference Property after the relevant Reorganization Event, any adjustment to be made with respect thereto and that all conditions precedent have been complied with.  The Company shall cause notice of the execution of amendment to be mailed to each Warrantholder, at its address appearing on the Warrant Register, within 20 Business Days after execution thereof.  Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such amendment.
(d)
           The above provisions of this Section 5.09 shall similarly apply to successive Reorganization Events.
(e)
            If this Section 5.09 applies to any event or occurrence, no other provision of this Article 5 shall apply to such event or occurrence.
(f)
           This Section 5.09 does not limit the rights of Warrantholders or the Companys rights in the event of a Designated Event, including Warrantholders right to receive an Exercise Price Reduction and corresponding increase in the Number of Warrants for each Warrant Certificate in connection with a Designated Event under Article 4.
(g)
 
33
 
(a) The Company may, without the consent of the Warrantholders, consolidate with, merge into or sell, lease or otherwise transfer in one transaction or a series of related transactions the consolidated assets of the Company and its subsidiaries substantially as an entirety to any corporation, limited liability company, partnership or trust organized under the laws of the United States or any of its political subdivisions so long as:
Section 5.10
.  Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets. 
(i)           the successor assumes all the Companys obligations under this Warrant Agreement and the Warrants; and
(ii)           an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that the consolidation, merger, sale, lease or other transfer complies with the provisions of this Warrant Agreement, have been delivered to the Warrant Agent.
           In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale, lease or other transfer and upon any such assumption by the successor corporation, limited liability company, partnership or trust, such successor entity shall succeed to and be substituted for the Company with the same effect as if it had been named herein as the Company. Such successor entity thereupon may cause to be signed, and may issue any or all of the Warrants issuable pursuant to this Warrant Agreement which theretofore shall not have been signed by the Company; and, upon the order of such successor entity, instead of the Company, and subject to all the terms, conditions and limitations in this Warrant Agreement prescribed, the Warrant Agent shall authenticate and deliver, as applicable, any Warrants that previously shall have been signed and delivered by the officers of the Company to the Warrant Agent for authentication, and any Warrants which such successor entity thereafter shall cause to be signed and delivered to the Warrant Agent for such purpose.
(b)
For the purposes of this Article 5, the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held, directly or indirectly, by the Company, but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock.
Section 5.11
.  Common Stock Outstanding.  
(a) The Board of Directors has authorized and will reserve for issuance such number of shares of Common Stock as the Board of Directors believes will be issuable upon the exercise of all outstanding Warrants for shares of Common Stock (assuming, for purposes of this covenant, that Full Physical Settlement applies to all Warrants exercised hereunder). The Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock that shall be so issuable shall be duly and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
Section 5.12
.  Covenant to Reserve Shares for Issuance on Exercise.  
 
34
 
           The Company agrees to authorize and direct its current and future transfer agents for the Common Stock to reserve for issuance the number of shares of Common Stock specified in this Section 5.12.  The Company shall instruct the transfer agent to deliver to the Warrant Agent, upon written request from the Warrant Agent substantially in the form of Exhibit F (or as separately agreed between the Warrant Agent and the transfer agent), stock certificates (or beneficial interests therein) required to honor outstanding Warrants upon exercise thereof in accordance with the terms of this Warrant Agreement.  The Company shall pay to the Warrant Agent, as agent for the Warrantholders, any Cash that may be payable as provided in this Article 5.  Promptly after the date of expiration of Warrants, the Warrant Agent shall certify to the Company the aggregate Number of Warrants then outstanding, and thereafter no shares shall be required to be reserved in respect of such Warrants.
(b)
           If permitted or required by the rules of any national securities exchange or over the counter market or other domestic market on which the Common Stock is listed at any time, if any, the Company shall apply to have listed or quoted all shares of Common Stock issued upon exercise of the Warrants (other than shares of Common Stock bearing the restrictive legend set forth on Exhibit B hereto) on any such exchange or market.
(c)
The Company shall be responsible for making all calculations called for under this Warrant Agreement. These calculations include, but are not limited to, the Exercise Date, the Current Market Price, the Closing Sale Price, the Exercise Price, the Number of Warrants for each Warrant Certificate and the number of shares of Common Stock or Units of Reference Property, if any, to be issued upon exercise of any Warrants. The Company shall make the foregoing calculations in good faith and, absent manifest error, the Companys calculations shall be final and binding on Warrantholders. The Company shall provide a schedule of the Companys calculations to the Warrant Agent, and the Warrant Agent is entitled to rely upon the accuracy of the Companys calculations without independent verification.
Section 5.13
.  Companys Determinations Final.  
Whenever the Exercise Price or the Number of Warrants for each Warrant Certificate is adjusted, the Company shall promptly mail to Warrantholders a notice of the adjustment. The Company shall file with the Warrant Agent such notice and an Officers Certificate briefly stating the facts requiring the adjustment and the manner of computing it.  The certificate shall be conclusive evidence that the adjustment is correct, and the Warrant Agent shall not be deemed to have any knowledge of any adjustments unless and until it has received such certificate.  The Warrant Agent shall not be under any duty or responsibility with respect to any such certificate except to exhibit the same to any Warrantholder desiring inspection thereof.
Section 5.14
.  Notice of Adjustments.  
 
35
 
The Warrant Agent shall at no time be under any duty or responsibility to any Warrantholder to determine whether any facts exist that may require an adjustment of the Exercise Price and the Number of Warrants for each Warrant Certificate, or with respect to the nature or extent of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed, herein or in any supplemental agreement provided to be employed, in making the same.  The Warrant Agent shall have no duty to verify or confirm any calculation called for hereunder.  The Warrant Agent shall have no liability for any failure or delay in performing its duties hereunder caused by any failure or delay of the Company in providing such calculations to the Warrant Agent.  The Warrant Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock or of any securities or property which may at any time be issued or delivered upon the exercise of any Warrant or upon any adjustment pursuant to this Article 5, and it makes no representation with respect thereto.  The Warrant Agent shall not be responsible for any failure of the Company to make any Cash payment or to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock or stock certificates or other securities or property or scrip upon the surrender of any Warrant for the purpose of exercise or upon any adjustment pursuant to this Article 5, or to comply with any of the covenants of the Company contained in this Article 5.
Section 5.15
.  Warrant Agent Not Responsible for Adjustments or Validity.  
The form of Warrant Certificate need not be changed because of any adjustment made pursuant to this Article 5, and Warrant Certificates issued after such adjustment may state the same information (other than the adjusted Exercise Price and the adjusted Number of Warrants for such Warrant Certificates) as are stated in the Warrant Certificates initially issued pursuant to this Warrant Agreement.  However, the Company may at any time in its sole discretion (which shall be conclusive) make any change in the form of Warrant Certificate that it may deem appropriate and that does not materially adversely affect the interest of the Warrantholders; and any Warrant Certificates thereafter issued or countersigned, whether in exchange or substitution for an outstanding Warrant Certificate or otherwise, may be in the form as so changed.
Section 5.16
.  Statements on Warrants.  
Warrantholders shall not be entitled, by virtue of holding Warrants, to vote, to consent, to receive dividends, to receive notice as stockholders with respect to any meeting of stockholders for the election of the Companys directors or any other matter, or to exercise any rights whatsoever as the Companys stockholders unless, until and only to the extent such holders become holders of record of shares of Common Stock issued upon settlement of the Warrants.
Section 6.01
.  No Rights as Stockholders.  
 
36
 
If any Warrant at any time is mutilated, defaced, lost, destroyed or stolen, then on the terms set forth in this Warrant Agreement, such Warrant may be replaced at the cost of the applicant (including legal fees of the Company) at the office of the Warrant Agent. The applicant for a new Warrant shall, in the case of any mutilated or defaced Warrant, surrender such Warrant to the Warrant Agent and, in the case of any lost, destroyed or stolen Warrant, furnish evidence satisfactory to the Company of such loss, destruction or theft, and, in each case, furnish evidence satisfactory to the Company of the ownership and authenticity of the Warrant together with such indemnity as the Company may require.  Any such new Warrant Certificate shall constitute an original contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the allegedly lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed Warrant Certificate shall be at any time enforceable by anyone.  An applicant for such a substitute Warrant Certificate shall also comply with such other reasonable regulations and pay such other reasonable charges as the Company or the Warrant Agent may prescribe.  All Warrant Certificates shall be held and owned upon the express condition that the foregoing provisions are exclusive with respect to the substitution for lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed Warrant Certificates, and shall preclude any and all other rights or remedies notwithstanding any law or statute existing or hereafter enacted to the contrary with respect to the substitution for and replacement of negotiable instruments or other securities without their surrender.
Section 6.02
.  Mutilated or Missing Warrant Certificates.  
(a) This Warrant Agreement may be modified or amended by the Company and the Warrant Agent in writing, without the consent of the holder of any Warrant, for the purposes of, among other things:

38
 
(v)           reduce the percentage of Warrants outstanding necessary to modify or amend this Warrant Agreement or to waive any past default; or

If the office of the Warrant Agent becomes vacant by resignation or incapacity to act or otherwise, the Company shall appoint in writing a successor warrant agent in place of the Warrant Agent.  If the Company shall fail to make such appointment within a period of 60 days after it has been notified in writing of such resignation or incapacity by the resigning or incapacitated warrant agent or by any holder of Warrants (who shall, with such notice, submit his Warrant Certificate for inspection by the Company), then the holder of any Warrants may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor warrant agent.

The combined capital and surplus of any such successor warrant agent shall be deemed to be the combined capital and surplus as set forth in the most recent report of its condition published prior to its appointment; that such reports are published at least annually pursuant to law or to the requirements of a Federal or state supervising or examining authority.  After appointment, any successor warrant agent shall be vested with all the authority, powers, rights, immunities, duties and obligations of its predecessor warrant agent with like effect as if originally named as warrant agent hereunder, without any further act or deed; but if for any reason it becomes necessary or appropriate, the predecessor warrant agent shall execute and deliver, at the expense of the Company, an instrument transferring to such successor warrant agent all the authority, powers and rights of such predecessor warrant agent hereunder; and upon request of any successor warrant agent, the Company shall make, execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all instruments in writing to more fully and effectually vest in and conform to such successor warrant agent all such authority, powers, rights, immunities, duties and obligations.

Section 7.06
.  Reliance on Counsel.  
Whenever in the performance of its duties under this Warrant Agreement the Warrant Agent shall deem it necessary or desirable that any matter be proved or established by the Company prior to taking or suffering or omitting any action hereunder, such matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Warrant Agent, be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by an Officers Certificate delivered to the Warrant Agent; and such Officers Certificate shall, in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Warrant Agent, be full warrant to the Warrant Agent for any action taken, suffered or omitted in good faith by it under the provisions of this Warrant Agreement in reliance upon such certificate; but in its discretion the Warrant Agent may in lieu thereof accept other evidence of such fact or matter or may require such further or additional evidence as to it may seem reasonable.

The Warrant Agent shall not be liable for or by reason of any of the statements of fact or recitals contained in this Warrant Agreement or in the Warrant Certificates (except its countersignature thereof) or be required to verify the same, and all such statements and recitals are and shall be deemed to have been made by the Company only.

The Company agrees to indemnify the Warrant Agent and save it harmless against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities, including judgments, costs and reasonable counsel fees, for anything done or omitted in good faith by the Warrant Agent in the execution of this Warrant Agreement or otherwise arising in connection with this Warrant Agreement, except as a result of the Warrant Agents negligence or willful misconduct or bad faith.
Section 7.11

The Warrant Agent shall be under no obligation to institute any action, suit or legal proceeding or to take any other action likely to involve expense unless the Company or one or more Warrantholders shall furnish the Warrant Agent with reasonable security and indemnity for any costs and expenses which may be incurred, but this provision shall not affect the power of the Warrant Agent to take such action as the Warrant Agent may consider proper, whether with or without any such security or indemnity.
Section 7.12
.  Legal Proceedings.  
The Warrant Agent in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner of Warrants or other securities of the Company, or become pecuniarily interested in any transaction in which the Company may be interested, or contract with or lend money to the Company or otherwise act as fully and freely as though it were not Warrant Agent under this Warrant Agreement.  Nothing herein shall preclude the Warrant Agent from acting in any other capacity for the Company or for any other legal entity.
Section 7.13
.  Other Transactions in Securities of the Company.  
The Warrant Agent shall act hereunder solely as agent and not in a ministerial or fiduciary capacity, and its duties shall be determined solely by the provisions hereof.

No implied covenants or obligations shall be read into the Warrant Agreement against the Warrant Agent.  No provision of the Warrant Agreement shall require the Warrant Agent to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
