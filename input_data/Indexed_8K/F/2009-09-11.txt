Item 1.01.  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
Item 3.03  Material Modification to Rights of Security Holders
On September 11, 2009, Ford Motor Company (the "Company") entered into the Tax Benefit Preservation Plan, dated September 11, 2009 (the "Plan"), between the Company and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as rights agent.  Our Board of Directors (the "Board") adopted the Plan in an effort to protect stockholder value by attempting to protect against a possible limitation on our ability to use net operating losses, tax credits and other tax assets (the "Tax Attributes") to reduce potential future federal income tax obligations.  In the past, we have experienced substantial operating losses, and under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and rules promulgated by the Internal Revenue Service, we may "carry forward" these losses in certain circumstances to offset future earnings and thus reduce our federal income tax liability, subject to certain requirements and restrictions.  To the extent that the Tax Attributes do not otherwise become limited, we believe that we will be able to use a significant amount of the Tax Attributes, and therefore these Tax Attributes could be a substantial asset to us.  If, however, we experience an "ownership change," as defined in Section 382 of the Code, our ability to use the Tax Attributes will be substantially limited, and the timing of the usage of the Tax Attributes could be substantially delayed, which could therefore significantly impair the value of the Tax Attributes.
This summary provides only a general description of the Plan and therefore should be read together with the entire Plan, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.  The following description is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibit.
On September 9, 2009, the Board declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (the "Rights") for each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Stock"), and class B stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Class B Stock"), of the Company under the terms of the Plan.  The dividend is payable on September 25, 2009 to the stockholders of record as of the close of business on September 25, 2009 (the "Record Date").  Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company (the "Preferred Stock") at a price of $35.00 per one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock (the "Purchase Price"), subject to adjustment.  The description and terms of the Rights are set forth in the Plan.
As a result of declaring a dividend of the Rights, until the earlier to occur of (i) the close of business on the tenth business day following the public announcement of facts that indicate that a person or group has become an "Acquiring Person" by acquiring beneficial ownership of 4.99% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (or the Board becoming aware of an "Acquiring Person") or (ii) the close of business on the tenth business day (or, except in certain circumstances, such later date as may be specified by the Board) following the commencement of, or announcement of an intention to make, a tender offer or exchange offer the consummation of which would result in the beneficial ownership by a person or group of 4.99% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, in each case with certain exceptions (the earlier of such dates being called the "Distribution Date"), the Rights will be evidenced, with respect to the Common Stock and Class B Stock certificates outstanding as of the Record Date (or any book-entry shares in respect thereof), by such Common Stock or Class B Stock certificate (or registration in book-entry form) together with the summary of rights, and the Rights will be transferable only in connection with the transfer of Common Stock or Class B Stock.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any person or group that beneficially owns 4.99% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock on September 11, 2009 will not be deemed an Acquiring Person under the Plan unless and until such person or group acquires beneficial ownership of additional shares of Common Stock representing one-half of one percent (0.5%) or more of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding.  The Board may, in its sole discretion, exempt any person or group from being deemed an Acquiring Person for purposes of the Plan if the Board determines that such person's or group's ownership of Common Stock will not jeopardize or endanger the availability of, or otherwise limit in any way the use of, the Company's Tax Attributes.
 
2
 
The Plan provides that, until the Distribution Date (or earlier expiration or redemption of the Rights), the Rights will be attached to and will be transferred with and only with the Common Stock and Class B Stock.  Until the Distribution Date (or earlier expiration or redemption of the Rights), new shares of Common Stock and Class B Stock issued after the Record Date upon transfer or new issuances of Common Stock and Class B Stock will contain a notation incorporating the Plan by reference (with respect to shares represented by certificates) or notice thereof will be provided in accordance with applicable law (with respect to uncertificated shares).  Until the Distribution Date (or earlier expiration of the Rights), the surrender for transfer of any certificates representing shares of Common Stock or Class B Stock outstanding as of the Record Date, even without such notation or a copy of the summary of rights, or the transfer by book-entry of any uncertificated shares of Common Stock and Class B Stock, will also constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with such shares.  As soon as practicable following the Distribution Date, separate certificates evidencing the Rights ("Right Certificates") will be mailed to holders of record of the Common Stock and Class B Stock as of the close of business on the Distribution Date and such separate Right Certificates alone will evidence the Rights.
The Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date.  The Rights will expire upon the earliest of the close of business on September 11, 2012 (unless that date is advanced or extended), the final adjournment of the Company's 2010 annual meeting of stockholders if stockholder approval of the Plan has not been received prior to that time, the time at which the Rights are redeemed or exchanged under the Plan, the repeal of Section 382 of the Code or any successor statute if the Board determines that the Plan is no longer necessary for the preservation of the Company's Tax Attributes, or the beginning of a taxable year of the Company to which the Board determines that no Tax Attributes may be carried forward.

The Purchase Price payable, and the number of shares of Preferred Stock or other securities or property issuable, upon exercise of the Rights is subject to adjustment from time to time to prevent dilution (i) in the event of a stock dividend on, or a subdivision, combination or reclassification of, the Preferred Stock, (ii) upon the grant to holders of the Preferred Stock of certain rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase Preferred Stock at a price, or securities convertible into Preferred Stock with a conversion price, less than the then-current market price of the Preferred Stock or (iii) upon the distribution to holders of the Preferred Stock of evidences of indebtedness or assets (excluding regular periodic cash dividends or dividends payable in Preferred Stock) or of subscription rights or warrants (other than those referred to above).
The number of outstanding Rights is subject to adjustment in the event of a stock dividend on the Common Stock and Class B Stock payable in shares of Common Stock or Class B Stock or subdivisions, consolidations or combinations of the Common Stock occurring, in any such case, prior to the Distribution Date.
Shares of Preferred Stock purchasable upon exercise of the Rights will not be redeemable.  Each share of Preferred Stock will be entitled, when, as and if declared, to a minimum preferential quarterly dividend payment of the greater of (a) $10.00 per share, and (b) an amount equal to 1,000 times the dividend declared per share of Common Stock.  In the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the holders of the Preferred Stock will be entitled to a minimum preferential payment of the greater of (a) $1.00 per share (plus any accrued but unpaid dividends), and (b) an amount equal to 1,000 times the payment made per share of Common Stock.  Each share of Preferred Stock will have 1,000 votes, voting together with the Common Stock and Class B Stock.  Finally, in the event of any merger, consolidation or other transaction in which outstanding shares of Common Stock are converted or exchanged, each share of Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive 1,000 times the amount received per share of Common Stock.  These rights are protected by customary antidilution provisions.
Because of the nature of the Preferred Stock's dividend, liquidation and voting rights, the value of the one one-thousandth interest in a share of Preferred Stock purchasable upon exercise of each Right should approximate the value of one share of Common Stock.
In the event that any person or group becomes an Acquiring Person with respect to the Rights, each holder of a Right, other than Rights beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person (which will thereupon become null and void), will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise of a Right (including payment of the Purchase Price) that number of shares of Common Stock having a market value of two times the Purchase Price.
At any time after any person or group becomes an Acquiring Person but prior to the acquisition by such Acquiring Person of beneficial ownership of 50% or more of the voting power of the shares of Common Stock and Class B Stock then outstanding, the Board may exchange the Rights (other than Rights owned by such Acquiring Person, which will have become null and void), in whole or in part, for shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock (or a series of the Company's preferred stock having equivalent rights, preferences and privileges), at an exchange ratio of one share of Common Stock, or a fractional share of Preferred Stock (or other stock) equivalent in value thereto, per Right (subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends and similar transactions).
 
4
 
With certain exceptions, no adjustment in the Purchase Price will be required until cumulative adjustments require an adjustment of at least 1% in such Purchase Price.  No fractional shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock will be issued (other than fractions of Preferred Stock which are integral multiples of one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock, which may, at the election of the Company, be evidenced by depositary receipts), and in lieu thereof an adjustment in cash will be made based on the current market price of the Preferred Stock or the Common Stock.
At any time prior to the time an Acquiring Person becomes such, the Board may redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of $.001 per Right (the "Redemption Price") payable, at the option of the Company, in cash, shares of Common Stock or such other form of consideration as the Board shall determine.  The redemption of the Rights may be made effective at such time, on such basis and with such conditions as the Board in its sole discretion may establish.  Immediately upon any redemption of the Rights, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the Redemption Price.
For so long as the Rights are then redeemable, the Company may, except with respect to the Redemption Price, amend the Plan in any manner.  After the Rights are no longer redeemable, the Company may, except with respect to the Redemption Price, amend the Plan in any manner that does not adversely affect the interests of holders of the Rights (other than the Acquiring Person).
Until a Right is exercised or exchanged, the holder thereof, as such, will have no rights as a stockholder of the Company, including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends.
This summary description of the Plan does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference to Exhibit 4.1 of this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Exhibit 3.1
FORD MOTOR COMPANY, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (the "Corporation"), in accordance with the provisions of Section 103 thereof, DOES HEREBY CERTIFY:
That pursuant to the authority vested in the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the "Board of Directors") in accordance with the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the said Corporation (the "Certificate of Incorporation"), the said Board of Directors on September 9, 2009 adopted the following resolution creating a series of 8,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock designated as "Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock":

Exhibit 3.1
1.               There shall be a series of Preferred Stock that shall be designated as "Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock," and the number of shares constituting such series shall be 8,000,000.  Such number of shares may be increased or decreased by resolution of the Board of Directors; provided, however, that no decrease shall reduce the number of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock to less than the number of shares then issued and outstanding plus the number of shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding rights, options or warrants or upon conversion of outstanding securities issued by the Corporation.
Designation and Amount.
2.              
Dividends and Distribution.
(A)           Subject to the prior and superior rights of the holders of any shares of any class or series of stock of the Corporation ranking prior and superior to the shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, in preference to the holders of shares of any class or series of stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock in respect thereof, shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash on the 1 day of March, June, September and December, in each year (each such date being referred to herein as a "Quarterly Dividend Payment Date"), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) $10.00 or (b) the Adjustment Number (as defined below) times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and the Adjustment Number times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Corporation (the "Common Stock"), or shares of Class B Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Corporation (the "Class B Stock"), or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or Class B Stock (by reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Common Stock or the Class B Stock since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock.  The "Adjustment Number" shall initially be 1,000.  In the event the Corporation shall at any time after September 25, 2009 (i) declare and pay any dividend on Common Stock and Class B Stock payable in shares of Common Stock or Class B Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the Adjustment Number in effect immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such Adjustment Number by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock and Class B Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock and Class B Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.

Exhibit 3.1
(B)            The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock as provided in paragraph (A) above immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock and Class B Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or Class B Stock).
(C)            Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date; in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.  Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest.  Dividends paid on the shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding.  The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be no more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.
3.                The holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:
Voting Rights.
(A)           Each share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to a number of votes equal to the Adjustment Number on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation.
(B)           Except as required by law, by Section 3(C) and by Section 10 hereof, holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of Common Stock and Class B Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action.

Exhibit 3.1
(C)           If, at the time of any annual meeting of stockholders for the election of directors, the equivalent of six quarterly dividends (whether or not consecutive) payable on any share or shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock are in default, the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall be increased by two.  In addition to voting together with the holders of Common Stock and Class B Stock for the election of other directors of the Corporation, the holders of record of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class to the exclusion of the holders of Common Stock and Class B Stock, shall be entitled at said meeting of stockholders (and at each subsequent annual meeting of stockholders), unless all dividends in arrears on the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock have been paid or declared and set apart for payment prior thereto, to vote for the election of two directors of the Corporation, the holders of any Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock being entitled to cast a number of votes per share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock as is specified in paragraph (A) of this Section 3.  Each such additional director shall serve until the next annual meeting of stockholders for the election of directors, or until his successor shall be elected and shall qualify, or until his right to hold such office terminates pursuant to the provisions of this Section 3(C).  Until the default in payments of all dividends which permitted the election of said directors shall cease to exist, any director who shall have been so elected pursuant to the provisions of this Section 3(C) may be removed at any time, without cause, only by the affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock at the time entitled to cast a majority of the votes entitled to be cast for the election of any such director at a special meeting of such holders called for that purpose, and any vacancy thereby created may be filled by the vote of such holders.  If and when such default shall cease to exist, the holders of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be divested of the foregoing special voting rights, subject to revesting in the event of each and every subsequent like default in payments of dividends.  Upon the termination of the foregoing special voting rights, the terms of office of all persons who may have been elected directors pursuant to said special voting rights shall forthwith terminate, and the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be reduced by two.  The voting rights granted by this Section 3(C) shall be in addition to any other voting rights granted to the holders of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock in this Section 3.
4.              
Certain Restrictions.
(A)           Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or distributions payable on the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2 are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not declared, on shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been paid in full, the Corporation shall not:
 
4
 
Exhibit 3.1
(i)             declare or pay dividends on, make any other distributions on, or redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock;
(ii)            declare or pay dividends on or make any other distributions on any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are then entitled; or
(iii)           purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, or any shares of stock ranking on a parity with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to all holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, or to such holders and holders of any such shares ranking on a parity therewith, upon such terms as the Board of Directors, after consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the respective series and classes, shall determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or classes.
(B)            The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the Corporation unless the Corporation could, under paragraph (A) of this Section 4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.
5.              Any shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be retired promptly after the acquisition thereof.  All such shares shall upon their retirement become authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock to be created by resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors, subject to any conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth herein.
Reacquired Shares.  
6.              
Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up.
(A)           Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, voluntary or otherwise, no distribution shall be made to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have received an amount per share (the "Series A Liquidation Preference") equal to the greater of (i) $1.00 plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of such payment, or (ii) the Adjustment Number times the per share amount of all cash and other property to be distributed in respect of the Common Stock and Class B Stock upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation.
 
5
 
Exhibit 3.1
(B)            In the event, however, that there are not sufficient assets available to permit payment in full of the Series A Liquidation Preference and the liquidation preferences of all other classes and series of stock of the Corporation, if any, that rank on a parity with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock in respect thereof, then the assets available for such distribution shall be distributed ratably to the holders of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and the holders of such parity shares in proportion to their respective liquidation preferences.
(C)            Neither the merger or consolidation of the Corporation into or with another entity nor the merger or consolidation of any other entity into or with the Corporation shall be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation within the meaning of this Section 6.
7.             In case the Corporation shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the outstanding shares of Common Stock and Class B Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case each share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed in an amount per share equal to the Adjustment Number times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of Common Stock and Class B Stock is changed or exchanged.
Consolidation, Merger, Etc.  
8.             Shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall not be subject to redemption by the Corporation.
No Redemption.  
9.             The Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall rank junior to all other series of the Preferred Stock as to the payment of dividends and as to the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, unless the terms of any such series shall provide otherwise, and shall rank senior to the Common Stock and Class B Stock as to such matters.
Ranking.  
10.            At any time that any shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation shall not be amended, by merger, consolidation or otherwise, which would materially alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely without the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class.
Amendment.

Exhibit 4.1
 
 
 
Exhibit 4.1
 
 
 
 
Exhibit 4.1
Tax Benefit Preservation Plan, dated as of September 11, 2009 ("Plan"), between Ford Motor Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as Rights Agent (the "Rights Agent").
The Company has generated net operating loss carryovers and tax credit carryovers for United States federal income tax purposes ("NOLs"), which will potentially provide valuable Tax Benefits (as defined below) to the Company.  The ability to use the NOLs may be impaired or destroyed by an "ownership change" within the meaning of Section 382 (as defined below). The Company desires to avoid such an "ownership change" and thereby preserve the ability to utilize the NOLs.  In furtherance of such objective, the Company desires to enter into this Plan.
The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board of Directors") has adopted resolutions creating a series of preferred stock designated as "Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock" and has authorized and declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a "Right") for each share of Common Stock (as hereinafter defined) and one Right for each share of Class B Stock (as hereinafter defined) of the Company outstanding as of the Close of Business (as defined below) on September 25, 2009 (the "Record Date"), each Right initially representing the right to purchase one one-thousandth (subject to adjustment) of a share of Preferred Stock (as hereinafter defined), upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein set forth, and has further authorized and directed the issuance of one Right (subject to adjustment as provided herein) with respect to each share of Common Stock and Class B Stock that shall become outstanding between the Record Date and the earlier of the Distribution Date and the Expiration Date (as such terms are hereinafter defined); , , that Rights may be issued with respect to shares of Common Stock and Class B Stock that shall become outstanding after the Distribution Date and prior to the Expiration Date in accordance with Section 22.
provided
however
Accordingly, in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements herein set forth, the parties hereby agree as follows:
Section 1.  .  For purposes of this Plan, the following terms have the meaning indicated:
Certain Definitions
 
1
 
Exhibit 4.1
(a)            "Acquiring Person" shall mean any Person (other than any Exempt Person) that has become, in itself or, together with all Affiliates and Associates of such Person, the Beneficial Owner of 4.99% or more of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding; , , that any Existing Holder (as defined below) will not be deemed to be an Acquiring Person for any purpose of this Plan on and after the date on which the adoption of this Plan is first publicly announced unless and until such time as such Existing Holder acquires Beneficial Ownership of additional shares of Common Stock representing .5% of the Common Stock then outstanding, unless, upon becoming the Beneficial Owner of such additional shares of Common Stock, such Person is not then the Beneficial Owner of 4.99% or more of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding; , , that a Person will not be deemed to have become an Acquiring Person solely as a result of (i) a reduction in the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding, (ii) the exercise of any options, warrants, rights or similar interests (including restricted stock) granted by the Company to its directors, officers and employees, (iii) any unilateral grant of any security by the Company or any issuance by the Company of shares of its capital stock to such Person, or (iv) an Exempt Transaction, unless and until such time as such Person thereafter acquires Beneficial Ownership of one additional share of Common Stock (other than pursuant to a dividend or distribution paid or made by the Company on the outstanding Common Stock or Class B Stock or pursuant to a split or subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock or Class B Stock), unless, upon becoming the Beneficial Owner of such additional share of Common Stock, such Person is not then the Beneficial Owner of 4.99% or more of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding.  No Qualified Holder shall become an "Acquiring Person" as a result of such Qualified Holder becoming the Beneficial Owner of shares of Common Stock into which shares of Class B Stock are convertible or have been converted pursuant to Section 2.4 of Article Fourth of the Certificate of Incorporation.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Board determines in good faith that a Person who would otherwise be an "Acquiring Person," as defined pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 1(a), has become such inadvertently (including, without limitation, because (A) such Person was unaware that it beneficially owned a percentage of Common Stock that would otherwise cause such Person to be an "Acquiring Person" or (B) such Person was aware of the extent of its Beneficial Ownership of Common Stock but had no actual knowledge of the consequences of such Beneficial Ownership under this Plan), and such Person divests as promptly as practicable a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock so that such Person would no longer be an Acquiring Person, as defined pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 1(a), then such Person shall not be deemed to be or to have become an "Acquiring Person" for purposes of this Plan as a result of such inadvertent acquisition.  In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Person who would otherwise be an "Acquiring Person," as defined pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 1(a), has become such as a result of an acquisition of Beneficial Ownership of shares of Common Stock that the Board in its sole discretion determines in good faith, prior to the Distribution Date that would otherwise occur as a result of such acquisition, will not jeopardize or endanger the availability to the Company of the NOLs, then such Person shall not be deemed to be or to have become an "Acquiring Person" for purposes of this Plan as a result of such acquisition, unless and until such time as such Person thereafter acquires Beneficial Ownership of one additional share of Common Stock (other than pursuant to a dividend or distribution paid or made by the Company on the outstanding Common Stock or Class B Stock or pursuant to a split or subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock or Class B Stock), unless, upon becoming the Beneficial Owner of such additional share of Common Stock, such Person is not then the Beneficial Owner of 4.99% or more of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding or the Board determines otherwise in accordance with this sentence or the preceding sentence.  For all purposes of this Plan, any calculation of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any particular time, including for purposes of determining the particular percentage of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of which any Person is the Beneficial Owner, shall be made in accordance with the last sentence of Rule 13d-3(d)(1)(i) of the General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange Act (as defined below) as in effect on the date hereof.

(a)            The Company covenants and agrees that it will cause to be reserved and kept available out of its authorized and unissued shares of Preferred Stock or any shares of Preferred Stock held in its treasury, the number of shares of Preferred Stock that will be sufficient to permit the exercise in full of all outstanding Rights.
(b)            So long as the shares of Preferred Stock (and, following the time that a person becomes an Acquiring Person, shares of Common Stock and other securities) issuable upon the exercise of Rights may be listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange or listed on any other national securities exchange or quotation system, the Company shall use its best efforts to cause, from and after such time as the Rights become exercisable, all shares reserved for such issuance to be listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange or listed on any other national securities exchange or quotation system upon official notice of issuance upon such exercise.

(c)            From and after such time as the Rights become exercisable, the Company shall use its best efforts, if then necessary, to permit the issuance of shares of Preferred Stock (and following the time that a Person first becomes an Acquiring Person, shares of Common Stock and other securities) upon the exercise of Rights, to register and qualify such shares of Preferred Stock (and following the time that a Person first becomes an Acquiring Person, shares of Common Stock and other securities) under the Securities Act and any applicable state securities or "Blue Sky" laws (to the extent exemptions therefrom are not available), cause such registration statement and qualifications to become effective as soon as possible after such filing and keep such registration and qualifications effective until the earlier of (x) the date as of which the Rights are no longer exercisable for such securities and (y) the Expiration Date.  The Company may temporarily suspend, for a period of time not to exceed ninety (90) days, the exercisability of the Rights in order to prepare and file a registration statement under the Securities Act and permit it to become effective.  Upon any such suspension, the Company shall issue a public announcement stating that the exercisability of the Rights has been temporarily suspended, as well as a public announcement at such time as the suspension is no longer in effect.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, the Rights shall not be exercisable in any jurisdiction unless the requisite qualification or exemption in such jurisdiction shall have been obtained and until a registration statement under the Securities Act (if required) shall have been declared effective.
(d)            The Company covenants and agrees that it will take all such action as may be necessary to ensure that all shares of Preferred Stock (and following the time that a Person first becomes an Acquiring Person, shares of Common Stock and other securities) delivered upon exercise of Rights shall, at the time of delivery of the certificates therefor (subject to payment of the Purchase Price), be duly and validly authorized and issued and fully paid and nonassessable shares.
(e)            The Company further covenants and agrees that it will pay when due and payable any and all federal and state transfer taxes and charges which may be payable in respect of the issuance or delivery of the Right Certificates or of any shares of Preferred Stock (or shares of Common Stock and other securities) upon the exercise of Rights.  The Company shall not, however, be required to pay any transfer tax or charge which may be payable in respect of any transfer or delivery of Right Certificates to a Person other than, or the issuance or delivery of certificates or depositary receipts for the Preferred Stock (or shares of Common Stock and other securities) in a name other than that of, the registered holder of the Right Certificate evidencing Rights surrendered for exercise or to issue or deliver any certificates or depositary receipts for Preferred Stock (or shares of Common Stock and other securities) upon the exercise of any Rights until any such tax or charge shall have been paid (any such tax being payable by that holder of such Right Certificate at the time of surrender) or until it has been established to the Company's reasonable satisfaction that no such tax or charge is due.

Exhibit 4.1
Section 10.  .  Each Person in whose name any certificate for Preferred Stock is issued upon the exercise of Rights shall for all purposes be deemed to have become the holder of record of the shares of Preferred Stock represented thereby on, and such certificate shall be dated, the date upon which the Right Certificate evidencing such Rights was duly surrendered and payment of the Purchase Price (and any applicable transfer taxes or charges ) was made; , , that if the date of such surrender and payment is a date upon which the Preferred Stock transfer books of the Company are closed, such Person shall be deemed to have become the record holder of such shares on, and such certificate shall be dated, the next succeeding Business Day on which such transfer books are open.  Prior to the exercise of the Rights evidenced thereby, the holder of a Right Certificate shall not be entitled to any rights of a holder of Preferred Stock for which the Rights shall be exercisable, including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends or other distributions, and shall not be entitled to receive any notice of any proceedings of the Company, except as provided herein.

Adjustment of Purchase Price, Number and Kind of Shares and Number of Rights
(a)            (i)  In the event the Company shall at any time after the date of this Plan (A) declare a dividend on the Preferred Stock payable in shares of Preferred Stock, (B) subdivide the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, (C) combine the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock into a smaller number of shares of Preferred Stock or (D) issue any shares of its capital stock in a reclassification of the Preferred Stock (including any such reclassification in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing or surviving corporation), except as otherwise provided in this Section 11(a), the Purchase Price in effect at the time of the record date for such dividend or of the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification, as the case may be, and the number and kind of shares of capital stock issuable on such date, shall be proportionately adjusted so that the holder of any Right exercised after such time shall be entitled to receive the aggregate number and kind of shares of capital stock which, if such Right had been exercised immediately prior to such date and at a time when the Preferred Stock transfer books of the Company were open, the holder would have owned upon such exercise and been entitled to receive by virtue of such dividend, subdivision, combination or reclassification.

Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, however, from and after the time (the "Invalidation Time") when any Person first becomes an Acquiring Person, any Rights that are beneficially owned by (x) any Acquiring Person (or any Affiliate or Associate of any Acquiring Person), (y) a transferee of any Acquiring Person (or any such Affiliate or Associate) who becomes a transferee after the Invalidation Time or (z) a transferee of any Acquiring Person (or any such Affiliate or Associate) who became a transferee prior to or concurrently with the Invalidation Time pursuant to either (I) a transfer from the Acquiring Person to holders of its equity securities or to any Person with whom it has any continuing agreement, arrangement or understanding regarding the transferred Rights or (II) a transfer that the Board has determined is part of a plan, arrangement or understanding which has the purpose or effect of avoiding the provisions of this paragraph, and subsequent transferees of such Persons, shall be void without any further action and any holder of such Rights shall thereafter have no rights whatsoever with respect to such Rights under any provision of this Plan.  The Company shall use all reasonable efforts to ensure that the provisions of this Section 11(a)(ii) are complied with, but shall have no liability to any holder of Right Certificates or other Person as a result of its failure to make any determinations with respect to an Acquiring Person or its Affiliates, Associates or transferees hereunder.  From and after the Invalidation Time, no Right Certificate shall be issued pursuant to Section 3 or Section 6 hereof that represents Rights that are or have become void pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph, and any Right Certificate delivered to the Rights Agent that represents Rights that are or have become void pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph shall be canceled.

Exhibit 4.1
(iii)           The Company may at its option (or, if required to comply with its Certificate of Incorporation, shall) substitute for a share of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of Rights in accordance with the foregoing subparagraph (ii) such number or fraction of shares of Preferred Stock (or, if required to comply with its Certificate of Incorporation, equivalent shares of its capital stock) having an aggregate current market value equal to the current per share market price of a share of Common Stock.  In the event that there shall be an insufficient number of shares of Common Stock authorized but unissued (and unreserved) to permit the exercise in full of the Rights in accordance with the foregoing subparagraph (ii), the Board shall, with respect to such deficiency, to the extent permitted by applicable law and any material agreements then in effect to which the Company is a party, (A) determine the excess of (x) the value of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of a Right in accordance with the foregoing subparagraph (ii) (the "Current Value") over (y) the then-current Purchase Price multiplied by the number of one-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock for which a Right was exercisable immediately prior to the time that the Acquiring Person became such (such excess, the "Spread"), and (B) with respect to each Right (other than Rights which have become void pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii)), make adequate provision to substitute for the shares of Common Stock issuable in accordance with subparagraph (ii) upon exercise of the Right and payment of the applicable Purchase Price, (1) cash, (2) a reduction in such Purchase Price, (3) shares of Preferred Stock or other equity securities of the Company (including, without limitation, shares or fractions of shares of preferred stock which, by virtue of having dividend, voting and liquidation rights substantially comparable to those of the shares of Common Stock, are deemed in good faith by the Board to have substantially the same value as the shares of Common Stock (such shares of preferred stock and shares or fractions of shares of preferred stock are hereinafter referred to as "Common Stock Equivalents")), (4) debt securities of the Company, (5) other assets, or (6) any combination of the foregoing, having a value which, when added to the value of the shares of Common Stock actually issued upon exercise of such Right, shall have an aggregate value equal to the Current Value (less the amount of any reduction in such Purchase Price), where such aggregate value has been determined by the Board upon the advice of a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected in good faith by the Board; , , that if the Company shall not make adequate provision to deliver value pursuant to clause (B) above within thirty (30) days following the date that the Acquiring Person became such (the "Section 11(a)(ii) Trigger Date"), then the Company shall be obligated to deliver, to the extent permitted by applicable law and any material agreements then in effect to which the Company is a party, upon the surrender for exercise of a Right and without requiring payment of such Purchase Price, shares of Common Stock (to the extent available), and then, if necessary, such number or fractions of shares of Preferred Stock (to the extent available) and then, if necessary, cash, which shares and/or cash have an aggregate value equal to the Spread.  If, within the thirty (30) day period referred to above the Board shall determine in good faith that it is likely that sufficient additional shares of Common Stock could be authorized for issuance upon exercise in full of the Rights, then, if the Board elects, such thirty (30) day period may be extended to the extent necessary, but not more than ninety (90) days after the Section 11(a)(ii) Trigger Date, in order that the Company may seek stockholder approval for the authorization of such additional shares (such thirty (30) day period, as it may be extended, is hereinafter called the "Substitution Period").  To the extent that the Company determines that some action need be taken pursuant to the second and/or third sentence of this Section 11(a)(iii), the Company (x) shall provide, subject to Section 11(a)(ii) hereof and the last sentence of this Section 11(a)(iii) hereof, that such action shall apply uniformly to all outstanding Rights and (y) may suspend the exercisability of the Rights until the expiration of the Substitution Period in order to seek any authorization of additional shares and/or to decide the appropriate form of distribution to be made pursuant to such second sentence and to determine the value thereof.  In the event of any such suspension, the Company shall issue a public announcement stating that the exercisability of the Rights has been temporarily suspended, as well as a public announcement at such time as the suspension is no longer in effect.  For purposes of this Section 11(a)(iii), the value of the shares of Common Stock shall be the current per share market price (as determined pursuant to Section 11(d)(i)) on the Section 11(a)(ii) Trigger Date and the per share or fractional value of any "Common Stock Equivalent" shall be deemed to equal the current per share market price of the Common Stock on such date.  The Board may, but shall not be required to, establish procedures to allocate the right to receive shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of the Rights among holders of Rights pursuant to this Section 11(a)(iii).

Shares of Preferred Stock and Equivalent Preferred Shares owned by or held for the account of the Company shall not be deemed outstanding for the purpose of any such computation.

 (ii)           For the purpose of any computation hereunder, if the Preferred Stock is publicly traded, the "current per share market price" of the Preferred Stock shall be determined in accordance with the method set forth in Section 11(d)(i).  If the Preferred Stock is not publicly traded but the Common Stock is publicly traded, the "current per share market price" of the Preferred Stock shall be conclusively deemed to be the current per share market price of the Common Stock as determined pursuant to Section 11(d)(i) multiplied by the then applicable Adjustment Number (as defined in and determined in accordance with the Certificate of Designation for the Preferred Stock).  If neither the Common Stock nor the Preferred Stock is publicly traded, "current per share market price" shall mean the fair value per share as determined in good faith by the Board, whose determination shall be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent and shall be binding on the Rights Agent.
(e)            No adjustment in the Purchase Price shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in the Purchase Price; , , that any adjustments not required to be made by reason of this Section 11(e) shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment.  All calculations under this Section 11 shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one ten-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock or share of Common Stock or other share or security as the case may be.  Notwithstanding the first sentence of this Section 11(e), any adjustment required by this Section 11 shall be made no later than the earlier of (i) three years from the date of the transaction which requires such adjustment or (ii) the Expiration Date.  If as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to Section 11(a) hereof, the holder of any Right thereafter exercised shall become entitled to receive any shares of capital stock of the Company other than the Preferred Stock, thereafter the Purchase Price and the number of such other shares so receivable upon exercise of a Right shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to the Preferred Stock contained in Sections 11(a), 11(b), 11(c), 11(e), 11(h), 11(i) and 11(m) and the provisions of Sections 7, 9, 10 and 14 hereof with respect to the Preferred Stock shall apply on like terms to any such other shares.

(g)            Unless the Company shall have exercised its election as provided in Section 11(i), upon each adjustment of the Purchase Price as a result of the calculations made in Sections 11(b) and 11(c), each Right outstanding immediately prior to the making of such adjustment shall thereafter evidence the right to purchase, at the adjusted Purchase Price, that number of one one-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock (calculated to the nearest ten-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock) obtained by (i) multiplying (x) the number of one-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock purchasable upon the exercise of a Right immediately prior to such adjustment by (y) the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment of the Purchase Price and (ii) dividing the product so obtained by the Purchase Price in effect immediately after such adjustment of the Purchase Price.

Each of the Rights outstanding after such adjustment of the number of Rights shall be exercisable for the number of one one-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock for which a Right was exercisable immediately prior to such adjustment.  Each Right held of record prior to such adjustment of the number of Rights shall become that number of Rights (calculated to the nearest ten-thousandth) obtained by dividing the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to adjustment of the Purchase Price by the Purchase Price in effect immediately after adjustment of the Purchase Price.  The Company shall make a public announcement of its election to adjust the number of Rights, indicating the record date for the adjustment, and, if known at the time, the amount of the adjustment to be made.  This record date may be the date on which the Purchase Price is adjusted or any day thereafter, but, if the Right Certificates have been issued, shall be at least 10 days later than the date of the public announcement.  If Right Certificates have been issued, upon each adjustment of the number of Rights pursuant to this Section 11(i), the Company may, as promptly as practicable, cause to be distributed to holders of record of Right Certificates on such record date Right Certificates evidencing, subject to Section 14 hereof, the additional Rights to which such holders shall be entitled as a result of such adjustment, or, at the option of the Company, shall cause to be distributed to such holders of record in substitution and replacement for the Right Certificates held by such holders prior to the date of adjustment, and upon surrender thereof, if required by the Company, new Right Certificates evidencing all the Rights to which such holders shall be entitled as a result of such adjustment.  Right Certificates so to be distributed shall be issued, executed and countersigned in the manner provided for herein and shall be registered in the names of the holders of record of Right Certificates on the record date specified in the public announcement.

(j)             Before taking any action that would cause an adjustment reducing the Purchase Price below the then par value, if any, of the shares of Preferred Stock or other shares of capital stock issuable upon exercise of the Rights, the Company shall take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of Preferred Stock or other such shares at such adjusted Purchase Price.
(k)            In any case in which this Section 11 shall require that an adjustment in the Purchase Price be made effective as of a record date for a specified event, the Company may elect to defer until the occurrence of such event issuing to the holder of any Right exercised after such record date the Preferred Stock, Common Stock or other capital stock or securities of the Company, if any, issuable upon such exercise over and above the Preferred Stock, Common Stock or and other capital stock or securities of the Company, if any, issuable upon such exercise on the basis of the Purchase Price in effect prior to such adjustment; , , that the Company shall deliver to such holder a due bill or other appropriate instrument evidencing such holder's right to receive such additional shares upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment.
provided
however
(l)             Notwithstanding anything in this Section 11 to the contrary, the Company shall be entitled to make such adjustments in the Purchase Price, in addition to those adjustments expressly required by this Section 11, as and to the extent that the Board in its sole discretion shall determine to be advisable in order that any consolidation or subdivision of the Preferred Stock, issuance wholly for cash of any shares of Preferred Stock at less than the current market price, issuance wholly for cash of Preferred Stock or securities which by their terms are convertible into or exchangeable for Preferred Stock, dividends on Preferred Stock payable in shares of Preferred Stock or issuance of rights, options or warrants referred to hereinabove in Section 11(b), hereafter made by the Company to holders of its Preferred Stock shall not be taxable to such stockholders.
(m)            Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, in the event that at any time after the date of this Plan and prior to the Distribution Date, the Company shall (i) declare and pay any dividend on the Common Stock and Class B Stock payable in Common Stock or Class B Stock, or (ii) effect a subdivision, combination or consolidation of the Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend payable in Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then, in any such case, the number of Rights associated with each share of Common Stock and Class B Stock then outstanding, or issued or delivered thereafter, shall be proportionately adjusted so that the number of Rights thereafter associated with each share of Common Stock and Class B Stock following any such event shall equal the result obtained by multiplying the number of Rights associated with each share of Common Stock and Class B Stock immediately prior to such event by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock and Class B Stock outstanding immediately prior to the occurrence of the event and the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock and Class B Stock outstanding immediately following the occurrence of such event.

Exhibit 4.1
(n)            The Company agrees that, after the earlier of the Distribution Date or the Stock Acquisition Date, it will not, except as permitted by Section 23, 24 or 27 hereof, take (or permit any Subsidiary to take) any action if at the time such action is taken it is reasonably foreseeable that such action will diminish substantially or eliminate the benefits intended to be afforded by the Rights.
Section 12.  .  Whenever an adjustment is made as provided in Section 11 hereof, the Company shall promptly (a) prepare a certificate setting forth such adjustment, and a brief statement of the facts accounting for such adjustment, (b) file with the Rights Agent and with each transfer agent for the Common Stock, the Class B Stock or the Preferred Stock a copy of such certificate and (c) mail a brief summary thereof to each holder of a Right Certificate (or if prior to the Distribution Date, to each holder of a certificate representing shares of Common Stock and Class B Stock or Book Entry shares in respect thereof) in accordance with Section 26 hereof.  The Rights Agent shall be fully protected in relying on any such certificate and on any adjustment therein contained and shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any such adjustment unless and until it shall have received such certificate.  Any adjustment to be made pursuant to Section 11 hereof shall be effective as of the date of the event giving rise to such adjustment.

Fractional Rights and Fractional Shares
(a)            The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of Rights (except prior to the Distribution Date in accordance with Section 11(n) hereof) or to distribute Right Certificates which evidence fractional Rights.  In lieu of such fractional Rights, there shall be paid to the registered holders of the Right Certificates with regard to which such fractional Rights would otherwise be issuable, an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of a whole Right.  For the purposes of this Section 14(a), the current market value of a whole Right shall be the closing price of the Rights for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date on which such fractional Rights would have been otherwise issuable.  The closing price for any day shall be the last sale price, regular way, or, in case no such sale takes place on such day, the average of the closing bid and asked prices, regular way, in either case as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ or, if the Rights are not listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ, as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed on the principal national securities exchange on which the Rights are listed or admitted to trading or,  if the Rights are not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, the last quoted price or, if not so quoted, the average of the high bid and low asked prices in the over-the-counter market, as reported by such system then in use or, if on any such date the Rights are not so quoted, the average of the closing bid and asked prices as furnished by a professional market maker making a market in the Rights selected by the Board.  If on any such date no such market maker is making a market in the Rights, the fair value of the Rights on such date as determined in good faith by the Board shall be used.

Exhibit 4.1
(b)            The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of Preferred Stock (other than fractions which are integral multiples of one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock) or to distribute certificates which evidence fractional shares of Preferred Stock (other than fractions which are integral multiples of one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock) upon the exercise or exchange of Rights.  Interests in fractions of Preferred Stock in integral multiples of one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock may, at the election of the Company, be evidenced by depositary receipts, pursuant to an appropriate agreement between the Company and a depositary selected by it; that such agreement shall provide that the holders of such depositary receipts shall have all the rights, privileges and preferences to which they are entitled as beneficial owners (for the purposes of this Section 14(b), as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 or 13d-5 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange Act) of the Preferred Stock represented by such depositary receipts.  In lieu of fractional shares of Preferred Stock that are not integral multiples of one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock, the Company shall pay to the registered holders of Right Certificates at the time such Rights are exercised for shares of Preferred Stock as herein provided an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of one share of Preferred Stock.  For the purposes of this Section 14(b), the current market value of a share of Preferred Stock shall be the closing price of a share of Preferred Stock (as determined pursuant to Section 11(d)(ii) hereof) for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date of such exercise.
provided
(c)            The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of shares of Common Stock or to distribute certificates which evidence fractional shares of Common Stock upon the exercise or exchange of Rights.  In lieu of such fractional shares of Common Stock, the Company shall pay to the registered holders of the Right Certificates at the time such Rights are exercised or exchanged for shares of Common Stock as herein provided an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of a whole share of Common Stock (as determined in accordance with Section 11(d)(i) hereof), for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date of such exercise or exchange.

Exhibit 4.1
(d)            notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, neither the Company nor the Rights Agent shall have any liability to any holder of a Right or other Person as a result of its inability to perform any of its obligations under this Plan by reason of any preliminary or permanent injunction or other order, judgment, decree or ruling (whether interlocutory or final) issued by a court or by a governmental, regulatory, self-regulatory or administrative agency or commission, or any statute, rule, regulation or executive order promulgated or enacted by any governmental authority, prohibiting or otherwise restraining performance of such obligation; , , that the Company must use its reasonable best efforts to have any such injunction, order, judgment, decree or ruling lifted or otherwise overturned as soon as possible.

Concerning the Rights Agent
(a)            The Company agrees to pay to the Rights Agent reasonable compensation for all services rendered by it hereunder and, from time to time, on demand of the Rights Agent, its reasonable expenses and counsel fees and other disbursements incurred in the administration and execution of this Plan and the exercise and performance of its duties hereunder.

In case at the time such successor Rights Agent shall succeed to the agency created by this Plan, any of the Right Certificates shall have been countersigned but not delivered, any such successor Rights Agent may adopt the countersignature of the predecessor Rights Agent and deliver such Right Certificates so countersigned; and in case at that time any of the Right Certificates shall not have been countersigned, any successor Rights Agent may countersign such Right Certificates either in the name of the predecessor Rights Agent or in the name of the successor Rights Agent; and in all such cases such Right Certificates shall have the full force provided in the Right Certificates and in this Plan.
provided

Duties of Rights Agent
 
30
 
Exhibit 4.1
(a)            The Rights Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be legal counsel for the Company and/or the Board), and the opinion of such counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection to the Rights Agent as to any action taken or omitted by it in good faith and in accordance with such opinion.
(b)            Whenever in the performance of its duties under this Plan the Rights Agent shall deem it necessary or desirable that any fact or matter be proved or established by the Company prior to taking or suffering any action hereunder, such fact or matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by a certificate signed by the President and the Secretary of the Company (each, an "Authorized Officer") and delivered to the Rights Agent; and such certificate shall be full authorization to the Rights Agent for any action taken or suffered in good faith by it under the provisions of this Plan in reliance upon such certificate.
(c)            The Rights Agent shall be liable hereunder to the Company and any other Person only for its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.
(d)            The Rights Agent shall not be liable for or by reason of any of the statements of fact or recitals contained in this Plan or in the Right Certificates (except its countersignature thereof) or be required to verify the same, but all such statements and recitals are and shall be deemed to have been made by the Company only.
(e)            The Rights Agent shall not be under any responsibility in respect of the validity of this Plan or the execution and delivery hereof (except the due execution hereof by the Rights Agent) or in respect of the validity or execution of any Right Certificate (except its countersignature thereof); nor shall it be responsible for any breach by the Company of any covenant or condition contained in this Plan or in any Right Certificate; nor shall it be responsible for any change in the exercisability of the Rights (including the Rights becoming void pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii) hereof) or any adjustment in the terms of the Rights (including the manner, method or amount thereof) provided for in Sections 3, 11, 23 and 24, or the ascertaining of the existence of facts that would require any such change or adjustment (except with respect to the exercise of Rights evidenced by Right Certificates after receipt of a certificate furnished pursuant to Section 12, describing such change or adjustment); nor shall it by any act hereunder be deemed to make any representation or warranty as to the authorization or reservation of any shares of Preferred Stock or other securities to be issued pursuant to this Plan or any Right Certificate or as to whether any shares of Preferred Stock or other securities will, when issued, be validly authorized and issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

31
 
Exhibit 4.1
(g)            The Rights Agent is hereby authorized and directed to accept instructions with respect to the performance of its duties hereunder from any person reasonably believed by the Rights Agent to be one of the Authorized Officers of the Company, and to apply to such Authorized Officers for advice or instructions in connection with its duties, and it shall not be liable for any action taken or suffered by it in good faith in accordance with instructions of any such Authorized Officer or for any delay in acting while waiting for those instructions.  Any application by the Rights Agent for written instructions from the Company may, at the option of the Rights Agent, set forth in writing any action proposed to be taken or omitted by the Rights Agent under this Plan and the date on and/or after which such action shall be taken or such omission shall be effective.  The Rights Agent shall not be liable for any action taken by, or omission of, the Rights Agent in accordance with a proposal included in any such application on or after the date specified in such application (which date shall not be less than five Business Days after the date any Authorized Officer of the Company actually receives such application unless any such Authorized Officer shall have consented in writing to an earlier date) unless, prior to taking any such action (or the effective date in the case of an omission), the Rights Agent shall have received written instructions in response to such application specifying the action to be taken or omitted.
(h)            The Rights Agent and any stockholder, director, officer or employee of the Rights Agent may buy, sell or deal in any of the Rights or other securities of the Company or become pecuniarily interested in any transaction in which the Company may be interested, or contract with or lend money to the Company or otherwise act as fully and freely as though it were not Rights Agent under this Plan.  Nothing herein shall preclude the Rights Agent from acting in any other capacity for the Company or for any other legal entity.
(i)             The Rights Agent may execute and exercise any of the rights or powers hereby vested in it or perform any duty hereunder either itself or by or through its attorneys or agents, and the Rights Agent shall not be answerable or accountable for any act, default, neglect or misconduct of any such attorneys or agents or for any loss to the Company resulting from any such act, default, neglect or misconduct, , that reasonable care was exercised in the selection and continued employment thereof.

Exhibit 4.1
Section 21.  .  The Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties under this Plan upon 30 days' notice in writing mailed to the Company and to each transfer agent of the Common Stock or Preferred Stock by registered or certified mail.  In the event the transfer agency relationship in effect between the Company and the Rights Agent terminates, the Rights Agent will be deemed to have resigned automatically and be discharged from its duties under this Plan as of the effective date of such termination, and the Company shall be responsible for sending any required notice.  The Company may remove the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent upon 30 days' notice in writing, mailed to the Rights Agent or successor Rights Agent, as the case may be, and to each transfer agent of the Common Stock, Class B Stock or Preferred Stock by registered or certified mail, and, following the Distribution Date, to the holders of the Right Certificates by first-class mail.  If the Rights Agent shall resign or be removed or shall otherwise become incapable of acting, the Company shall appoint a successor to the Rights Agent.  If the Company shall fail to make such appointment within a period of 30 days after giving notice of such removal or after it has been notified in writing of such resignation or incapacity by the resigning or incapacitated Rights Agent or by the holder of a Right Certificate (who shall, with such notice, submit his Right Certificate for inspection by the Company), then the registered holder of any Right Certificate may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a new Rights Agent.  Any successor Rights Agent, whether appointed by the Company or by such a court, shall be (A) a corporation or other entity organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or any state thereof, which is authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust or stock transfer powers and is subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority and which has at the time of its appointment as Rights Agent a combined capital and surplus of at least $50 million or (B) an affiliate of a corporation or entity described in clause (A) of this sentence.  After appointment, the successor Rights Agent shall be vested with the same powers, rights, duties and responsibilities as if it had been originally named as Rights Agent without further act or deed; but the predecessor Rights Agent shall deliver and transfer to the successor Rights Agent any property at the time held by it hereunder, and execute and deliver any further assurance, conveyance, act or deed necessary for the purpose.  Not later than the effective date of any such appointment the Company shall file notice thereof in writing with the predecessor Rights Agent and each transfer agent of the Common Stock or Preferred Stock, and, following the Distribution Date, mail a notice thereof in writing to the registered holders of the Right Certificates.  Failure to give any notice provided for in this Section 21, however, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of the resignation or removal of the Rights Agent or the appointment of the successor Rights Agent, as the case may be.
Change of Rights Agent
Section 22.  .  Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Plan or of the Rights to the contrary, the Company may, at its option, issue new Right Certificates evidencing Rights in such forms as may be approved by its Board to reflect any adjustment or change in the Purchase Price and the number or kind or class of shares or other securities or property purchasable under the Right Certificates made in accordance with the provisions of this Plan.  In addition, in connection with the issuance or sale of Common Stock and/or Class B Stock following the Distribution Date and prior to the Expiration Date, the Company may with respect to shares of Common Stock and/or Class B Stock so issued or sold pursuant to (i) the exercise of stock options, (ii) under any employee plan or arrangement, (iii) the exercise, conversion or exchange of securities, notes or debentures issued by the Company or (iv) a contractual obligation of the Company, in each case existing prior to the Distribution Date, issue Right Certificates representing the appropriate number of Rights in connection with such issuance or sale.

Section 23.  .
Redemption
(a)            The Board may, at any time prior to such time as any Person first becomes an Acquiring Person, redeem all but not less than all the then outstanding Rights at a redemption price of $0.001 per Right, appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction occurring in respect of the Common Stock after the date hereof (the "Redemption Price").  The redemption of the Rights may be made effective at such time, on such basis and with such conditions as the Board in its sole discretion may establish.  The Company may, at its option, pay the Redemption Price in cash, shares of Common Stock (based on the current market price of the Common Stock at the time of redemption as determined pursuant to Section 11(d)(i) hereof) or any other form of consideration deemed appropriate by the Board.
(b)            Immediately upon the action of the Board ordering the redemption of the Rights pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 23 (or at such later time as the Board may establish for the effectiveness of such redemption), and without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and the only right thereafter of the holders of Rights shall be to receive the Redemption Price.  The Company shall promptly give public notice of any such redemption; , , that the failure to give, or any defect in, any such notice shall not affect the validity of such redemption.  Within 10 days after such action of the Board ordering the redemption of the Rights (or such later time as the Board may establish for the effectiveness of such redemption), the Company shall mail a notice of redemption to all the holders of the then outstanding Rights at their last addresses as they appear upon the registry books of the Rights Agent or, prior to the Distribution Date, on the registry books of the transfer agent for the Common Stock.  Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be deemed given, whether or not the holder receives the notice.  Each such notice of redemption shall state the method by which the payment of the Redemption Price will be made.  The failure to give notice required by this Section 23(b) or any defect therein shall not affect the validity of the action taken by the Company.
provided
however
(c)            In the case of a redemption under Section 23(a) hereof, the Company may, at its option, discharge all of its obligations with respect to the Rights by (i) issuing a press release announcing the manner of redemption of the Rights and (ii) mailing payment of the Redemption Price to the registered holders of the Rights at their last addresses as they appear on the registry books of the Rights Agent or, prior to the Distribution Date, on the registry books of the transfer agent of the Common Stock, and upon such action, all outstanding Right Certificates shall be void without any further action by the Company.

Exhibit 4.1
Section 24.  .
Exchange
(a)            The Board may, at its option, at any time after any Person first becomes an Acquiring Person, exchange all or part of the then outstanding Rights (which shall not include Rights that have not become effective or that have become void pursuant to the provisions of Section 11(a)(ii) hereof) for shares of Common Stock at an exchange ratio of one share of Common Stock (or one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock) per Right, appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction occurring after the date hereof (such amount per Right being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Ratio").  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board shall not be empowered to effect such exchange at any time after an Acquiring Person becomes the Beneficial Owner of shares of Common Stock and/or Class B Stock aggregating 50% or more of the voting power of the shares of Common Stock and Class B Stock then outstanding.  The exchange of the Rights by the Board may be made effective at such time, on such basis and with such conditions as the Board in its sole discretion may establish.  Prior to effecting an exchange pursuant to this Section 24, the Board may direct the Company to enter into a Trust Agreement in such form and with such terms as the Board shall then approve (the "Trust Agreement").  If the Board so directs, the Company shall enter into the Trust Agreement and shall issue to the trust created by such agreement (the "Trust") all of the shares of Common Stock  issuable pursuant to the exchange, and all Persons entitled to  receive shares pursuant to the exchange shall be entitled to receive such shares (and any dividends or distributions made thereon after the date on which such shares are deposited in the Trust) only from the Trust and solely upon compliance with the relevant terms and provisions of the Trust Agreement.
(b)            Immediately upon the effectiveness of the action of the Board ordering the exchange of any Rights pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 24 and without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise such Rights shall terminate and the only right thereafter of a holder of such Rights shall be to receive that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of such Rights held by such holder multiplied by the Exchange Ratio.  The Company shall promptly give public notice of any such exchange and shall promptly mail a notice of any such exchange to all of the holders of the Rights so exchanged at their last addresses as they appear upon the registry books of the Rights Agent; , , that the failure to give, or any defect in, such notice shall not affect the validity of such exchange.  Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be deemed given, whether or not the holder receives the notice.  Each such notice of exchange will state the method by which the exchange of the shares of Common Stock for Rights will be effected and, in the event of any partial exchange, the number of Rights which will be exchanged.  Any partial exchange shall be effected pro rata based on the number of Rights (other than Rights which have become void pursuant to the provisions of Section 11(a)(ii) hereof) held by each holder of Rights.
provided
however

Exhibit 4.1
(c)            The Company may at its option substitute, and, in the event that there shall not be sufficient shares of Common Stock issued but not outstanding or authorized but unissued (and unreserved) to permit an exchange of Rights as contemplated in accordance with this Section 24 (or if the issuance of Common Stock in exchange for any Rights would not otherwise be permitted under the Certificate of Incorporation), the Company shall substitute, to the extent of such insufficiency or to the extent necessary to comply with its Certificate of Incorporation, for each share of Common Stock that would otherwise be issuable upon exchange of a Right, a number of shares of Preferred Stock or fraction thereof (or Equivalent Preferred Shares, as such term is defined in Section 11(b), or other equivalent shares of its capital stock) such that the current per share market price (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) of one share of Preferred Stock (or Equivalent Preferred Share or other equivalent share) multiplied by such number or fraction is equal to the current per share market price of one share of Common Stock (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) as of the date of such exchange.

Benefits of this Plan
 
38
 
Exhibit 4.1
Section 30.  .  Any Person who desires to effect any acquisition of Common Stock that would, if consummated, result in such Person (together with its Affiliates and Associates) beneficially owning 4.99% or more of the then-outstanding Common Stock (or, in the case of an Existing Holder, additional shares of Common Stock representing .5% or more of the then-outstanding Common Stock) (a "Requesting Person") may, prior to the Stock Acquisition Date and in accordance with this Section 30, request that the Board grant an exemption with respect to such acquisition under this Plan so that such acquisition would be deemed to be an "Exempt Transaction" for purposes of this Plan (an "Exemption Request").  An Exemption Request shall be in proper form and shall be delivered by registered mail, return receipt requested, to the Secretary of the Company at the principal executive office of the Company.  To be in proper form, an Exemption Request shall set forth (i) the name and address of the Requesting Person, (ii) the number and percentage of shares of Common Stock then beneficially owned by the Requesting Person, together with all Affiliates and Associates of the Requesting Person, and (iii) a reasonably detailed description of the transaction or transactions by which the Requesting Person would propose to acquire Beneficial Ownership of Common Stock aggregating 4.99% or more of the then outstanding Common Stock (or, in the case of an Existing Holder, additional shares of Common Stock representing .5% or more of the then-outstanding Common Stock) and the maximum number and percentage of shares of Common Stock that the Requesting Person proposes to acquire.  The Board shall make a determination whether to grant an exemption in response to an Exemption Request as promptly as practicable (and, in any event, within ten (10) Business Days) after receipt thereof; , that the failure of the Board to make a determination within such period shall be deemed to constitute the denial by the Board of the Exemption Request.  The Board shall only grant an exemption in response to an Exemption Request if the Board determines in its sole discretion that the acquisition of Beneficial Ownership of Common Stock by the Requesting Person will not jeopardize or endanger the availability to the Company of the NOLs.  Any exemption granted hereunder may be granted in whole or in part, and may be subject to limitations or conditions (including a requirement that the Requesting Person agree that it will not acquire Beneficial Ownership of shares of Common Stock in excess of the maximum number and percentage of shares approved by the Board), in each case as and to the extent the Board shall determine necessary or desirable to provide for the protection of the Company's NOLs.  Any Exemption Request may be submitted on a confidential basis and, except to the extent required by applicable law, the Company shall maintain the confidentiality of such Exemption Request and the Board's determination with respect thereto.  For the avoidance of doubt, any issuance of Common Stock by the Company pursuant to its option to make payments in Common Stock in lieu of cash to the VEBA, as provided in Section 1(t) hereof, shall be deemed an Exempt Transaction without reference to the requirements and process of this Section 30.

All such actions, calculations, interpretations and determinations that are done or made by the Board in good faith shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Company, the Rights Agent, the holders of the Rights, as such, and all other parties.

Without limiting the foregoing, if any provision requiring a specific group of Directors of the Company to act is held by any court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, such determination shall then be made by the Board in accordance with applicable law and the Company's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.

Exhibit 4.1
Exhibit A
FORD MOTOR COMPANY, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (the "Corporation"), in accordance with the provisions of Section 103 thereof, DOES HEREBY CERTIFY:
That pursuant to the authority vested in the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the "Board of Directors") in accordance with the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the said Corporation (the "Certificate of Incorporation"), the said Board of Directors on September 9, 2009 adopted the following resolution creating a series of 8,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock designated as "Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock":
 
A-1
 
Exhibit 4.1
1.                There shall be a series of Preferred Stock that shall be designated as "Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock," and the number of shares constituting such series shall be 8,000,000.  Such number of shares may be increased or decreased by resolution of the Board of Directors; provided, however, that no decrease shall reduce the number of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock to less than the number of shares then issued and outstanding plus the number of shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding rights, options or warrants or upon conversion of outstanding securities issued by the Corporation.
Designation and Amount.
2.              
Dividends and Distribution.
(A)           Subject to the prior and superior rights of the holders of any shares of any class or series of stock of the Corporation ranking prior and superior to the shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, in preference to the holders of shares of any class or series of stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock in respect thereof, shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash on the 1 day of March, June, September and December, in each year (each such date being referred to herein as a "Quarterly Dividend Payment Date"), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) $10.00 or (b) the Adjustment Number (as defined below) times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and the Adjustment Number times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Corporation (the "Common Stock"), or shares of Class B Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Corporation (the "Class B Stock"), or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or Class B Stock (by reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Common Stock or the Class B Stock since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock.  The "Adjustment Number" shall initially be 1,000.  In the event the Corporation shall at any time after September 25, 2009 (i) declare and pay any dividend on Common Stock and Class B Stock payable in shares of Common Stock or Class B Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the Adjustment Number in effect immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such Adjustment Number by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock and Class B Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock and Class B Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.

Exhibit 4.1
(B)            The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock as provided in paragraph (A) above immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock and Class B Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or Class B Stock).
(C)            Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date; in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.  Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest.  Dividends paid on the shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding.  The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be no more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.
3.                The holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:
Voting Rights.
(A)           Each share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to a number of votes equal to the Adjustment Number on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation.
(B)            Except as required by law, by Section 3(C) and by Section 10 hereof, holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of Common Stock and Class B Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action.
(C)            If, at the time of any annual meeting of stockholders for the election of directors, the equivalent of six quarterly dividends (whether or not consecutive) payable on any share or shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock are in default, the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall be increased by two.  In addition to voting together with the holders of Common Stock and Class B Stock for the election of other directors of the Corporation, the holders of record of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class to the exclusion of the holders of Common Stock and Class B Stock, shall be entitled at said meeting of stockholders (and at each subsequent annual meeting of stockholders), unless all dividends in arrears on the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock have been paid or declared and set apart for payment prior thereto, to vote for the election of two directors of the Corporation, the holders of any Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock being entitled to cast a number of votes per share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock as is specified in paragraph (A) of this Section 3.  Each such additional director shall serve until the next annual meeting of stockholders for the election of directors, or until his successor shall be elected and shall qualify, or until his right to hold such office terminates pursuant to the provisions of this Section 3(C).  Until the default in payments of all dividends which permitted the election of said directors shall cease to exist, any director who shall have been so elected pursuant to the provisions of this Section 3(C) may be removed at any time, without cause, only by the affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock at the time entitled to cast a majority of the votes entitled to be cast for the election of any such director at a special meeting of such holders called for that purpose, and any vacancy thereby created may be filled by the vote of such holders.  If and when such default shall cease to exist, the holders of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be divested of the foregoing special voting rights, subject to revesting in the event of each and every subsequent like default in payments of dividends.  Upon the termination of the foregoing special voting rights, the terms of office of all persons who may have been elected directors pursuant to said special voting rights shall forthwith terminate, and the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be reduced by two.  The voting rights granted by this Section 3(C) shall be in addition to any other voting rights granted to the holders of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock in this Section 3.

Certain Restrictions.
(A)           Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or distributions payable on the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2 are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not declared, on shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been paid in full, the Corporation shall not:
(i)             declare or pay dividends on, make any other distributions on, or redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock;
(ii)            declare or pay dividends on or make any other distributions on any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are then entitled; or
 
A-4
 
Exhibit 4.1
(iii)           purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, or any shares of stock ranking on a parity with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to all holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, or to such holders and holders of any such shares ranking on a parity therewith, upon such terms as the Board of Directors, after consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the respective series and classes, shall determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or classes.
(B)            The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the Corporation unless the Corporation could, under paragraph (A) of this Section 4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.
5.              Any shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be retired promptly after the acquisition thereof.  All such shares shall upon their retirement become authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock to be created by resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors, subject to any conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth herein.
Reacquired Shares.  
6.              
Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up.
(A)           Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, voluntary or otherwise, no distribution shall be made to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have received an amount per share (the "Series A Liquidation Preference") equal to the greater of (i) $1.00 plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of such payment, or (ii) the Adjustment Number times the per share amount of all cash and other property to be distributed in respect of the Common Stock and Class B Stock upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation.
(B)            In the event, however, that there are not sufficient assets available to permit payment in full of the Series A Liquidation Preference and the liquidation preferences of all other classes and series of stock of the Corporation, if any, that rank on a parity with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock in respect thereof, then the assets available for such distribution shall be distributed ratably to the holders of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and the holders of such parity shares in proportion to their respective liquidation preferences.
 
A-5
 
Exhibit 4.1
(C)            Neither the merger or consolidation of the Corporation into or with another entity nor the merger or consolidation of any other entity into or with the Corporation shall be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation within the meaning of this Section 6.
7.              In case the Corporation shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the outstanding shares of Common Stock and Class B Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case each share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed in an amount per share equal to the Adjustment Number times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of Common Stock and Class B Stock is changed or exchanged.
Consolidation, Merger, Etc.  
8.              Shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall not be subject to redemption by the Corporation.
No Redemption.  
9.              The Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall rank junior to all other series of the Preferred Stock as to the payment of dividends and as to the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, unless the terms of any such series shall provide otherwise, and shall rank senior to the Common Stock and Class B Stock as to such matters.
Ranking.  
10.            At any time that any shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation shall not be amended, by merger, consolidation or otherwise, which would materially alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely without the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class.
Amendment.  
11.            Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock may be issued in fractions of a share that shall entitle the holder, in proportion to such holder's fractional shares, to exercise voting rights, receive dividends, participate in distributions and to have the benefit of all other rights of holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock.

Exhibit 4.1
Exhibit C
On September 9, 2009, the Board of Directors of Ford Motor Company (the "Company") declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a "Right") for each outstanding share of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Stock"), and Class B Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Class B Stock ").  The dividend is payable on September 25, 2009 (the "Record Date") to the stockholders of record on that date.  Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company (the "Preferred Stock") at a price of $35.00 per one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock (the "Purchase Price"), subject to adjustment.  The description and terms of the Rights are set forth in a Tax Benefit Preservation Plan, dated as of September 11, 2009, as the same may be amended from time to time (the "Plan"), between the Company and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as Rights Agent (the "Rights Agent").
The Plan is intended to help protect the Company's tax net operating loss carryforwards and have certain anti-takeover effects.  The Rights may cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire the Company on terms not approved by the Board of Directors.  Additionally, the Board of Directors may redeem the Rights, as discussed more fully below.  The Plan is intended to act as a deterrent to any person or group from becoming or obtaining the right to become a "5-percent shareholder" (as such term is used in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder) or, in certain cases, increasing such person's or group's ownership of Common Stock beyond a specified threshold, without the approval of the Board of Directors.    
Until the earlier to occur of (i) 10 business days following a public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons (with certain exceptions, an "Acquiring Person") has acquired beneficial ownership of 4.99% or more of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding or (ii) 10 business days (or such later date as may be determined by action of the Board of Directors prior to such time as any person or group of affiliated persons becomes an Acquiring Person) after the date of commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer the consummation of which would result in the beneficial ownership by a person or group of 4.99% or more of the then-outstanding shares of Common Stock (the earlier of such dates being called the "Distribution Date"), the Rights will be evidenced, with respect to any of the Common Stock certificates or Class B Stock certificates (or book entry shares in respect of the Common Stock or Class B Stock) outstanding as of the Record Date, by such Common Stock certificate or Class B Stock certificate (or such book entry shares) together with this Summary of Rights.
 
C-1
 
Exhibit 4.1
The Plan provides that, until the Distribution Date (or earlier expiration of the Rights), the Rights will be transferred with and only with the Common Stock and the Class B Stock.  Until the Distribution Date (or earlier expiration of the Rights), new Common Stock certificates and Class B Stock certificates (or book entry shares in respect of the Common Stock and Class B Stock) issued after the Record Date upon transfer or new issuances of Common Stock and Class B Stock, as applicable, will contain a notation incorporating the Plan by reference and, with respect to any uncertificated book entry shares issued after the Record Date, proper notice will be provided that incorporates the Plan by reference.  Until the Distribution Date (or earlier redemption or expiration of the Rights), the surrender for transfer of any certificates for shares of Common Stock and Class B Stock (or book entry shares of Common Stock or Class B Stock) outstanding as of the Record Date, even without a notation incorporating the Plan by reference (or such notice, in the case of Book Entry shares), notice or a copy of this Summary of Rights, will also constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the shares of Common Stock or Class B Stock represented by such certificate or book entry shares, as the case may be.  As soon as practicable following the Distribution Date, separate certificates evidencing the Rights ("Right Certificates") will be mailed to (or credited to the account of) holders of record of the Common Stock and Class B Stock as of the close of business on the Distribution Date and such separate Right Certificates alone will evidence the Rights.
The Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date.  The Rights will expire upon the earliest of the close of business on September 11, 2012 (unless that date is advanced or extended), the time at which the Rights are redeemed or exchanged under the Plan, the final adjournment of the Company's 2010 annual meeting of stockholders if stockholder approval of the Plan has not been received prior to that time, the repeal of Section 382 of the Code or any successor statute if the Board determines that the Plan is no longer necessary for the preservation of the Company's tax benefits, or the beginning of a taxable year of the Company to which the Board determines that no tax benefits may be carried forward.
 
C-2
 
Exhibit 4.1
The Purchase Price payable, and the number of shares of Preferred Stock or other securities or property issuable, upon exercise of the Rights are subject to adjustment from time to time to prevent dilution (i) in the event of a stock dividend on, or a subdivision, combination or reclassification of, the Preferred Stock, (ii) upon the grant to holders of the Preferred Stock of certain rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase Preferred Stock at a price, or securities convertible into Preferred Stock with a conversion price, less than the then-current market price of the Preferred Stock or (iii) upon the distribution to holders of the Preferred Stock of evidences of indebtedness or assets (excluding regular periodic cash dividends or dividends payable in Preferred Stock) or of subscription rights or warrants (other than those referred to above).
The Rights are also subject to adjustment in the event of a stock dividend on the Common Stock and Class B Stock payable in shares of Common Stock or Class B Stock, or subdivisions, consolidations or combinations of the Common Stock occurring, in any such case, prior to the Distribution Date.
Shares of Preferred Stock purchasable upon exercise of the Rights will not be redeemable.  Each share of Preferred Stock will be entitled, when, as and if declared, to a minimum preferential quarterly dividend payment of the greater of (a) $10.00 per share, and (b) an amount equal to 1,000 times the dividend declared per share of Common Stock and Class B Stock.  In the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the holders of the Preferred Stock will be entitled to a minimum preferential liquidation payment of the greater of (a) $1.00per share (plus any accrued but unpaid dividends), and (b) an amount equal to 1,000 times the payment made per share of Common Stock and Class B Stock.  Each share of Preferred Stock will have 1,000 votes, voting together with the Common Stock and Class B Stock.  Finally, in the event of any merger, consolidation or other transaction in which outstanding shares of Common Stock and Class B Stock are converted or exchanged, each share of Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive 1,000 times the amount received per share of Common Stock and Class B Stock.  These rights are protected by customary anti-dilution provisions.
 
Because of the nature of the Preferred Stock's dividend, liquidation and voting rights, the value of the one one-thousandth interest in a share of Preferred Stock purchasable upon exercise of each Right should approximate the value of one share of Common Stock.
In the event that any person or group of affiliated or associated persons becomes an Acquiring Person, each holder of a Right, other than Rights beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person (which will thereupon become void), will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise of a Right and payment of the Purchase Price, that number of shares of Common Stock having a market value of two times the Purchase Price.
 
C-3
 
Exhibit 4.1
At any time after any person or group becomes an Acquiring Person and prior to the acquisition by such person or group of 50% or more of the voting power of the outstanding shares of Common Stock and Class B Stock, the Board of Directors may exchange the Rights (other than Rights owned by such person or group which will have become void), in whole or in part, for shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock (or a series of the Company's preferred stock having similar rights, preferences and privileges), at an exchange ratio of one share of Common Stock, or a fractional share of Preferred Stock (or of a share of a similar class or series of the Company's preferred stock having similar rights, preferences and privileges) of equivalent value, per Right (subject to adjustment).
With certain exceptions, no adjustment in the Purchase Price will be required until cumulative adjustments require an adjustment of at least 1% in such Purchase Price.  No fractional shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock will be issued (other than fractions which are integral multiples of one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock, which may, at the election of the Company, be evidenced by depositary receipts), and in lieu thereof an adjustment in cash will be made based on the market price of the Preferred Stock on the last trading day prior to the date of exercise.
At any time prior to the time an Acquiring Person becomes such, the Board of Directors may redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of $0.001 per Right, appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction occurring after the date of adoption of the Plan (the "Redemption Price").  The redemption of the Rights may be made effective at such time, on such basis and with such conditions as the Board of Directors in its sole discretion may establish.  Immediately upon any redemption of the Rights, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the Redemption Price.
For so long as the Rights are then redeemable, the Company may, except with respect to the Redemption Price, amend the Plan in any manner.  After the Rights are no longer redeemable, the Company may, except with respect to the Redemption Price, amend the Plan in any manner that does not adversely affect the interests of holders of the Rights.
Until a Right is exercised or exchanged, the holder thereof, as such, will have no rights as a stockholder of the Company, including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends.

Exhibit 99.1
FORD ADOPTS TAX BENEFIT PRESERVATION PLAN
DEARBORN, Mich., Sept. 11, 2009 -- Ford Motor Company [NYSE: F] today announced that its Board of Directors has adopted a tax benefit preservation plan designed to preserve substantial tax assets.
Through year-end 2008, Ford had tax attributes, including net operating losses, capital losses and tax credit carryforwards, that would offset approximately $19 billion of taxable income.  Ford can utilize the tax attributes in certain circumstances to offset taxable income and reduce its federal income tax liability.
Fords ability to use the tax attributes would be substantially limited if there were an ownership change as defined under Section 382 the Internal Revenue Code and Internal Revenue Service rules.  In general, an ownership change would occur if Fords 5-percent shareholders, as defined under Section 382, collectively increase their ownership in Ford by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.  Five-percent shareholders do not include certain institutional holders, such as mutual fund companies, that hold Ford stock on behalf of several individual mutual funds where no single fund owns 5 percent or more of Ford stock.
The plan is similar to tax benefit preservation plans adopted by many other public companies with significant tax attributes.
As part of the plan, the Ford Board of Directors declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each outstanding share of its common stock and Class B stock.  The preferred share purchase rights will be distributed to stockholders of record as of Sept. 25, 2009 but would only be activated if triggered by the plan.
 
 
 
Effective today, if any person or group acquires 4.99 percent or more of the outstanding shares of common stock (subject to certain exceptions), there would be a triggering event under the plan resulting in significant dilution in the ownership interest of such person or group in Ford stock.
This plan is designed to protect shareholder value and safeguard valuable tax attributes by reducing the likelihood of an unintended ownership change through actions involving Ford common stock, said Lewis Booth, Fords chief financial officer.
Fords Board of Directors has the discretion to exempt any acquisition of common stock from the provisions of the tax benefit preservation plan.  The plan may be terminated by the Board at any time prior to the preferred share purchase rights being triggered.
The preferred share purchase rights will expire upon:
The issuance of the preferred share purchase rights will not affect Ford's reported earnings per share and is not taxable to Ford or its stockholders.
Additional information regarding the tax benefit preservation plan will be contained in a Form 8-K and in a Registration Statement on Form 8-A that Ford is filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  In addition, Ford stockholders of record as of Sept. 25, 2009 will be mailed a detailed summary of the plan.
