Such 15-day period shall automatically be extended to the earlier of (a) the date that is five days prior to the date of the occurrence of any event of default (or any comparable term) under any of the Companys Existing Debt Securities (other than the Notes) as a result of the Companys failure to provide annual or quarterly financial statements to the extent required under the related indenture and (b) in the case of audited annual financial statements, within 240 days after the end of the Companys fiscal year, and in the case of unaudited quarterly financial statements, within 220 days after the end of the respective quarters for each of the first three quarterly periods of each fiscal year of the Company.  If the period for filing any report is automatically extended for 85 or more days as described above, then the 90 day cure period for the Companys failure to comply with the Companys obligation to file such report shall be reduced to five days.  If, however, in connection with an event of default under the Companys Existing Debt Securities (other than the Notes), the period for filing such report is automatically extended for less than 85 days, then the number of days in such cure period shall be reduced to equal the number by which 90 exceeds the number of days of such extension.  It is understood and agreed that failure to comply with Section 314(a) of the TIA (or any successor provision thereto) shall not constitute a default or breach for purposes of Section 5.01(4) of the Indenture as amended by the Third Supplemental Indenture and, therefore, shall not permit Holders of Notes in such case to declare the principal amount of the Notes to be due and payable immediately pursuant to Section 5.02 of the Indenture as amended by the Third Supplemental Indenture.

Deposit of Repurchase Price
 
If the Trustee or the Paying Agent holds money sufficient to pay the Repurchase Price of a Note on the Business Day immediately following such Repurchase Date in respect of a Change in Control in accordance with the terms hereof, then, immediately after such Repurchase Date, interest on such Note will cease to accrue, whether or not the Note is delivered to the Trustee or the Paying Agent, and all other rights of the Holder shall terminate, other than the right to receive the Repurchase Price upon delivery of the Note.

In the event that holders of Common Stock have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in the transaction constituting a Designated Event, the type, and amount, of consideration that Holders of Notes will receive upon repurchase will be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by holders of Common Stock as a result of such Designated Event.
 
The number of shares of Common Stock (or amount of other consideration) to be delivered upon repurchase in connection with such a Designated Event shall be determined as follows:
 
The Company will not issue fractional shares of Common Stock (or transfer any fractional interests in any other consideration).  The Company shall pay cash for all fractional shares of Common Stock (or fractional interests in any other consideration) (calculated on an aggregate basis for Notes delivered for repurchase by any Holder) based on the Applicable Settlement Value.

The Trustee/Conversion Agent shall be fully protected in relying upon such certificate and shall have no duty with respect to, and shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any payment for fractional shares under any Section of the Third Supplemental Indenture relating to the payment of fractional shares unless and until the Trustee/Conversion Agent shall have received such a certificate and sufficient monies.

All shares of Common Stock that may be issued upon repurchase of Notes shall upon issuance be fully paid and nonassessable by the Company and free from all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue thereof.  The Company covenants to list such Common Stock on the principal national securities exchange on which the Common Stock is then listed in accordance with the provisions of such exchange.
 
If the Trustee or the Paying Agent holds shares of Common Stock (or other consideration) sufficient to pay the Repurchase Price of a Note on the Business Day immediately following the Repurchase Date in respect of a Designated Event that is not a Change in Control in accordance with the terms hereof, then, immediately after such Repurchase Date, interest on such Note will cease to accrue, whether or not the Note is delivered to the Trustee or the Paying Agent, and all other rights of the Holder shall terminate, other than the right to receive the Repurchase Price upon delivery of the Note.
 
Section 4.04  .  Any Note which is to be repurchased only in part shall be surrendered at the office of the Paying Agent (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or such Holders attorney duly authorized in writing) and the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Note, without service charge, a new Note or Notes, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder in aggregate principal amount equal to, and in exchange for, the portion of the principal amount of the Note so surrendered that is not repurchased.

(1)           The issuance of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution to all holders of Common Stock, or a subdivision or combination of Common Stock, in which event the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
where,
 
 
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the Open of Business on the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution, or immediately after the Open of Business on the effective date for such subdivision or combination.  If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this clause (1) is declared but not so paid or made, or any subdivision or combination of the type described in this clause (1) is announced by the outstanding shares of Common Stock are not subdivided or combined, as the case may be, the Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay such dividend or distribution, or not to subdivide or combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock, as the case may be, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend, distribution, subdivision or combination had not been declared or announced.
 
(2)           The issuance to all holders of Common Stock of rights, options or warrants entitling them for a period expiring 60 days or less from the date of issuance of such rights, options or warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into Common Stock) at less than (or having a conversion price per share less than) the Current Market Price of Common Stock, in which event the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
where,
 
 
31
 
 
Any adjustments made under this clause (2) shall be made successively whenever any such rights, options or warrants are issued and shall become effective immediately after the Open of Business on the Ex-Date for such issuance. To the extent such shares of Common Stock are not delivered after the expiration of such rights, options or warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights, options or warrants been made on the basis of the delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered.  In the event that such rights, options or warrants are not so issued, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if the Ex-Date for such issuance had not occurred.
 
For the purposes of this clause (2), in determining whether any rights, options or warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at less than (or having a conversion price per share less than) the Current Market Price of the Common Stock, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Company for such rights, options or warrants and any amount payable on the exercise or conversion thereof, with the value of such consideration, if other than Cash, to be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.
 
(3)           The dividend or other distribution to all holders of Common Stock of shares of the Capital Stock (other than Common Stock) or evidences of the Companys indebtedness, rights, options or warrants to purchase the Companys securities, or the Companys assets (excluding any dividend, distribution or issuance covered by clauses (1) or (2) above or (4) or (5) below), in which event the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
where,
 
 
If FMV (as defined above) is equal to or greater than SP (as defined above), in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, each Holder of Notes shall receive, in respect of each $1,000 principal amount of Notes, at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of the Common Stock, the amount and kind of Capital Stock, evidences of its indebtedness, other assets or property of the Company or rights, options or warrants to acquire the Companys capital stock or other securities that such Holder would have received as if such Holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate in effect on the Ex-Date for the dividend or distribution.

Any adjustment made under the portion of this clause (3) above shall become effective immediately after the Open of Business on the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution.  If such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall be re-adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
 
If the transaction that gives rise to an adjustment pursuant to this clause (3) is, however, one pursuant to which the payment of a dividend or other distribution on Common Stock consists of shares of capital stock of, or similar equity interests in, a subsidiary of the Company or other business unit of the Company (, a spin-off) that are, or, when issued, will be, traded or quoted on The New York Stock Exchange or any other national or regional securities exchange or market (a ), then the Conversion Rate will instead be adjusted based on the following formula:
i.e.
Spin-off
 
where,
 
 
The adjustment to the Conversion Rate under the preceding paragraph shall occur on the last day of the Valuation Period, but shall be given effect as of the Open of Business on the Ex-Date for the Spin-off.  If the Ex-Date for the Spin-off is less than 10 Trading Days prior to, and including, the end of the Cash Settlement Averaging Period in respect of any conversion, references within this clause (3) with respect to 10 Trading Days shall be deemed replaced, for purposes of calculating the affected daily Conversion Rates in respect of that conversion, with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed from, and including, the Ex-Date for such Spin-off to, and including, the last Trading Day of such Cash Settlement Averaging Period.
 
(4)           Dividends or other distributions consisting exclusively of cash to all holders of Common Stock, in which event the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
33
 
 
where,
 
 
If C (as defined above) is equal to or greater than SP (as defined above), in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, each Holder of a Note shall receive, for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes, at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of shares of Common Stock, the amount of cash that such Holder would have received as if such Holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate on the Ex-Date for such cash dividend or distribution.  Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the Open of Business on the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution.  In the event that such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.

(5)           The Company or one or more subsidiaries of the Company make purchases of Common Stock pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer (other than offers not subject to Rule 13e-4 under the Exchange Act) by the Company or a subsidiary of the Company for the Common Stock to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock validly tendered or exchanged exceeds the Closing Sale Price per share of Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (the ), in which event the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
Expiration Date
 
where,
 
 
34
 
 
The adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this clause (5) shall occur at the Close of Business on the 10th Trading Day immediately following the Expiration Date, but shall be given effect at the Open of Business on the Trading Day immediately following the Expiration Date.  If the Trading Day immediately following the Expiration Date is less than 10 Trading Days prior to, and including, the end of the Cash Settlement Averaging Period in respect of any conversion, references within this clause (5) to 10 Trading Days shall be deemed replaced, for purposes of calculating the affected daily Conversion Rates in respect of that conversion, with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed from, and including, the Trading Day immediately following the Expiration Date to, and including, the last Trading Day of such Cash Settlement Averaging Period.
In the event that the Company or a subsidiary of the Company is obligated to purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to any such tender offer or exchange offer, but the Company or such subsidiary is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases, or all such purchases are rescinded, then the Conversion Rate shall be re-adjusted to be the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such tender offer or exchange offer had not been made.  Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, if the application of this to any tender offer or exchange offer would result in a decrease in the Conversion Rate, no adjustment shall be made for such tender offer or exchange offer under this .

Section 5.09(a)(5)
(b)           In no event will the Company adjust the Conversion Rate to the extent that the adjustment would reduce the Conversion Price below the par value per share of Common Stock.
 
(c)           Notwithstanding the foregoing through , if a Conversion Rate adjustment becomes effective on any Ex-Date as described above, and a Holder that has converted its Notes on or after such Ex-Date and on or prior to the related Record Rate would be treated as the record holder of shares of Common Stock as of the related Conversion Date pursuant to based on the adjusted Conversion Rate for such Ex-Date, then, notwithstanding the foregoing Conversion Rate adjustment provisions, the Conversion Rate adjustment relating to such Ex-Date will not be made for such converting Holder. Instead, such Holder will be treated as if such Holder were the record owner of shares of Common Stock on an un-adjusted basis and participate in the related dividend, distribution or other event giving rise to such adjustment.

If any such right, option or warrant are subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights, options or warrants become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of indebtedness or other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and Ex-Date with respect to new rights, options or warrants with such rights, except as set forth in of the Third Supplemental Indenture.  In addition, except as set forth in of the Third Supplemental Indenture, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights, options or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in the preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under of the Third Supplemental Indenture was made (including any adjustment contemplated in of the Third Supplemental Indenture), (1) in the case of any such rights, options or warrants that shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by the holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted upon such final redemption or repurchase to give effect to such distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a Cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder or holders of Common Stock with respect to such rights, options or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights, options or warrants), made to all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase, and (2) in the case of such rights, options or warrants that shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by the holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights, options and warrants had not been issued.

(iv)           any statutory share exchange,
 
in each case as a result of which the Common Stock would be converted into, or exchanged for, stock, other securities, other property or assets (including cash or any combination thereof), then, at the effective time of the transaction, the right to convert a Note shall be changed into a right to convert such Note into the kind and amount of shares of stock, other securities or other property or assets (including cash or any combination thereof) that a holder of a share of Common Stock would have owned or been entitled to receive (the ) upon such transaction; , that at and after the effective time of the transaction (a) the Company shall continue to have the right to determine the form of consideration to be paid or delivered, as the case may be, upon conversion of such Notes, pursuant to of the Third Supplemental Indenture and (b)(x) any amount payable in cash upon conversion of the Notes pursuant to of the Third Supplemental Indenture shall continue to be payable in cash, (y) any shares of Common Stock that the Company would have been required to deliver upon conversion of the Notes pursuant to of the Third Supplemental Indenture shall instead be deliverable in the amount and type of Reference Property that a Holder of that number of shares of Common Stock would have received in such transaction and (z) the Closing Sale Price and the Daily VWAP of the Common Stock for purposes of of the Third Supplemental Indenture shall be calculated based on the value of a unit of Reference Property that a Holder of one share of Common Stock would have received in such transaction.  In the event holders of Common Stock have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in such transaction, the type and amount of consideration that Holders of Notes would have been entitled to receive shall be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of Common Stock.

Exhibit 5 and 23
November 9, 2009
Ford Motor Company
One American Road
Dearborn, MI, 48126
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Reference is made to the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (the "Registration Statement") filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on June 2, 2008, by Ford Motor Company (the "Company") for the registration of debt securities ("Debt Securities").  The Debt Securities are to be issued pursuant to the provisions of an Indenture dated as of January 30, 2002, as supplemented (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee (the "Trustee").
Pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the Company has created as a series of Debt Securities its 4.25% Senior Convertible Notes due 2016 (the "Notes") in an aggregate principal amount of $2,875,000,000, which Notes are convertible into shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share (the "Common Stock") of the Company, cash or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, at the Company's election.
As Secretary of the Company, I am familiar with the Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the By-laws of the Company and with the affairs of the Company.  I also am familiar with the Company's action taken pursuant to Sections 2.01 and 3.01 of the Indenture to establish the Notes as a series of Debt Securities under the Indenture.  I have also examined such other documents and instruments and have made such further investigation as I have deemed necessary or appropriate in connection with this opinion.
Based on the foregoing, it is my opinion that:
1.         the Notes constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company.
2.         the Common Stock initially issuable upon conversion of the Notes has been duly authorized and reserved and, when issued upon conversion of the Notes in accordance with the terms of the Notes and the Indenture, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
 
- 2 - -
 
 
My opinions expressed herein are subject to the qualification that I express no opinion as to the applicability of, compliance with, or effect of (i) any bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other similar law or judicially developed doctrine in this area (such as substantive consolidation or equitable subordination) affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally, (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), and (iii) public policy considerations which may limit the rights of parties to obtain certain remedies.  I further express no opinion as to the (y) validity, legally binding effect or enforceability of any provision in the Notes or the Indenture that requires or relates to adjustments to the conversion price at a rate or in an amount that a court would determine in the circumstances under applicable law to be commercially unreasonable or a penalty or forfeiture and (z) validity, legally binding effect or enforceability of any provision in the Notes or the Indenture that permits holders to collect any portion of stated principal amount upon acceleration of the Notes to the extent determined to constitute unearned interest.
I wish to point out that I am a member of the Bar of the State of Michigan and do not hold myself out as an expert in the laws of other jurisdictions.  However, I have made, or cause to be made, such investigation as I have deemed appropriate with respect to the laws of other jurisdictions in connection with the opinion expressed herein, and nothing has come to my attention in the course of such investigation which would lead me to question the correctness of such opinion.
I hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as Exhibit 5 to the Registration Statement.  In giving this consent, I do not admit that I am in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission issued thereunder.
