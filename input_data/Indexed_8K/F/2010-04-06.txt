Item 8.01. Other Events.
          On April 6, 2010, UAW Retiree Medical Benefits Trust (the "UAW VEBA") sold 362,391,305 warrants, each of which represents the right to purchase one share of common stock (subject to the settlement conditions of such Warrants), par value $.01 per share ("Common Stock"), of Ford Motor Company (the "Company") at an exercise price of $9.20 per share (the "Warrants"). The offer and sale of the Warrants was made pursuant to the Company's effective registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration Statement No. 333-151355) previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Registration Statement").
     The offering price for the Warrants, which expire January 1, 2013, was $5.00 per warrant and resulted in aggregate net proceeds to the UAW VEBA of $1.78 billion. The Company received no proceeds from the offering.
     In connection with the offering described above, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Warrant Agreement dated as of April 6, 2010 (the "Amended Warrant Agreement") between the Company and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as Warrant Agent, that amended the Warrant Agreement dated as of December 11, 2009. The Amended Warrant Agreement, among other things, provides for net share settlement as the only permitted settlement method thereby eliminating full physical settlement as an option and eliminates certain of the transfer restrictions with respect to Warrants and shares of Common Stock received upon exercise of the Warrants purchased in a public offering.
     A copy of the Underwriting Agreement pursuant to which the Warrants were sold is filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this Report and a copy of the opinion of Peter J. Sherry, Jr., counsel to the Company, relating to the legality of the Warrants, is filed as Exhibit 5.1 to this Report.
     The Company incorporates by reference the exhibits filed herewith into the Registration Statement, pursuant to which the Warrants were registered.

     (g) Proskauer Rose LLP, counsel to IFS, shall have furnished to the Representative its written opinion, dated the Time of Delivery for the Warrants and the Warrant Shares, in form satisfactory to the Representative in its reasonable judgment, to the effect of Exhibit D hereto.
     (h) (A) At the time of execution of this Agreement, the Representative shall have received a letter dated such date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representative in its reasonable judgment, from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, containing statements and information of the type ordinarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters with respect to the financial statements and certain financial information contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the General Disclosure Package; and (B) at the Time of Delivery, the Representative shall have received from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP a letter, dated as of the Time of Delivery, to the effect that they reaffirm the statements made in the letter furnished pursuant to subsection (A) of this paragraph (h), except that the specified date referred to shall be a date not more than three business days prior to the Time of Delivery, and such letter shall contain statements and information with respect to certain financial information contained in the Final Prospectus;
     (i) Since the respective dates as of which information is given in the General Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, there shall not have occurred any material adverse change, or any development involving a prospective material adverse change, in or affecting particularly the business or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as a whole, or any material adverse change in the financial position or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the General Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, which in any such case makes it impracticable or inadvisable in the reasonable judgment of the Representative to proceed with the public offering, sale or the delivery of the Warrants on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Final Prospectus;
     (j) Since the time of execution of this Agreement and prior to the Time of Delivery, none of the following events shall have occurred:

provided
     (ii) (A) any suspension or limitation on trading in securities generally on the NYSE, or any setting of minimum prices for trading on such exchange or market system, (B) any suspension of trading of any securities of Ford on any exchange or in the over-the-counter market or (C) any material outbreak or material escalation of hostilities involving the engagement of armed conflict in which the United States is involved or any other substantial national or international calamity or emergency or (D) any material adverse change in the general economic, political, legal, tax, regulatory or financial conditions or currency exchange rates in the United States (whether resulting from events within or outside of the United States), that, in the case of clause (A), (B), (C) or (D), in the reasonable determination of the Representative, after consulting with the Company and the Selling Security Holder, makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Warrants sold hereunder on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the General Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus; and
     (k) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representative, at the Time of Delivery for the Warrants, certificates in form satisfactory to the Representative in its reasonable judgment to the effect that:

     (ii) The Company has duly performed, in all material respects, all obligations required to be performed by it pursuant to the terms of this Agreement at or prior to such Time of Delivery;
     (iii) No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceeding for that purpose has been initiated or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened by the Commission, the Statutory Prospectus, the Final Prospectus and each Specified Issuer Free Writing Prospectus have been timely filed with the Commission under the Act (in the case of a Specified Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, to the extent required by Rule 433 under the Act), and all requests for additional information on the part of the Commission have been complied with or otherwise satisfied;
     (iv) At the Time of Sale relating to the Warrants, the Registration Statement did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and
     (v) At the Time of Sale relating to the Warrants and at the Time of Delivery, each of the General Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
, , that no such certificate shall apply to any statements or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with information (A) furnished in writing to the Company by an Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use therein or (B) any Selling Security Holder Information.
provided
however
     (l) The Selling Security Holder shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representative, at the Time of Delivery for the Warrants, certificates in form satisfactory to the Representative in its reasonable judgment to the effect that:
     (i) The representations and warranties of the Selling Security Holder contained in this Agreement are true and correct on and as of such Time of Delivery as though made at and as of such Time of Delivery; and
     (iii) The Selling Security Holder has duly performed, in all material respects, all obligations required to be performed by it pursuant to the terms of this Agreement at or prior to such Time of Delivery.
          7. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and the Selling Security Holder against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject with respect to the Warrants, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof)
 
arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, including without limitation the Rule 430B Information, the General Disclosure Package, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Final Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto with respect to the Warrants, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each such Underwriter or the Selling Security Holder, as the case may be, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter or the Selling Security Holder, as the case may be, in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim; , , that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with (i) written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use therein or (ii) the Selling Security Holder Information.
provided
however
          The indemnity agreement in this subsection (a) shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, (1) to the trustees, officers, fiduciaries, employees, representatives and agents (including, without limitation, IFS and its directors, officers, employees, representatives and agents) of the Selling Security Holder and to each person, if any, who controls the Selling Security Holder within the meaning of the Act, and (2) to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act and each broker-dealer affiliate of any Underwriter.
          (b) The Selling Security Holder agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and each Underwriter to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter but only with reference to the Selling Security Holder Information. The liability of the Selling Security Holder under this indemnification provision shall be limited to an amount equal to the gross proceeds received by the Selling Security Holder from the sale of the Warrants (net of underwriting commissions paid to the Underwriters).
          The indemnity agreement in this subsection (b) shall be in addition to any liability which the Selling Security Holder may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, (1) to the directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act, and (2) to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act and each broker-dealer affiliate of any Underwriter.
          (c) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Selling Security Holder against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject with respect to the Warrants, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, including without limitation the Rule 430B Information, the General Disclosure Package, the Final Prospectus, or any amendment or
 
supplement thereto with respect to the Warrants, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company or the Selling Security Holder, as the case may be, for any legal fees or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or the Selling Security Holder, as the case may be, in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.
          The indemnity agreement in this subsection (c) shall be in addition to any liability which the Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to the officers and directors of the Company, the trustees and officers of the Selling Security Holder, IFS and its directors and officers, and to each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Selling Security Holder within the meaning of the Act.
          (d) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a), (b) or (c) above of written notice of the commencement of any action such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, and in the event that such indemnified party shall not so notify the indemnifying party within 30 days following receipt of any such notice by such indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall have no further liability under such subsection to such indemnified party unless such indemnifying party shall have received other notice addressed and delivered in the manner provided in the second paragraph of Section 11 hereof of the commencement of such action; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein, and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party in its reasonable judgment, and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.
          (e) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable to an indemnified party under subsection (a), (b) or (c) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Selling Security Holder on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Warrants to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the
 
immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company, the Selling Security Holder and the Underwriters in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Selling Security Holder on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Selling Security Holder bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, the Selling Security Holder or such Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company, the Selling Security Holder and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (e) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (e). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (e) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (e), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Warrants underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. In addition, notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (e), the Selling Security Holder shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount equal to the gross proceeds received by the Selling Security Holder from the sale of the Warrants (net of underwriting commissions paid to the Underwriters). No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters in this subsection (e) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to the Warrants and not joint.
          8. Default by Underwriters; Default by Selling Security Holder.
          (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Underwriters' Warrants which it has agreed to purchase under this Agreement, the Representative may in its discretion arrange for itself or for another party or other parties to purchase such Underwriters' Warrants on the terms contained herein. If within 36 hours after such default by any Underwriter, the Representative does not arrange for the purchase of such Underwriters' Warrants, then the Company and the Selling Security Holder shall be entitled to a
 
further period of 36 hours within which to procure another party or other parties to purchase such Underwriters' Warrants on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, the Representative notifies the Company and the Selling Security Holder that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Underwriters' Warrants, or the Company or the Selling Security Holder notifies the Representative that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Underwriters' Warrants, the Representative, the Company or the Selling Security Holder, as the case may be, shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for such Underwriters' Warrants for a period of not more than seven days in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus, or any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus which in the opinion of Shearman & Sterling LLP and counsel for the Company referred to in Section 6(d) hereof may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if it had originally been a party to this Agreement. In the event that none of the Representative, the Company or the Selling Security Holder arrange for another party or parties to purchase such Underwriters' Warrants as provided in this Section, the Selling Security Holder shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase and pay for the Underwriters' Warrants which such non-defaulting Underwriter agreed to purchase under this Agreement and, in addition, to require each such non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the Underwriters' Warrants which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters shall have so failed to purchase up to an amount thereof equal to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Underwriters' Warrants which such non-defaulting Underwriter has otherwise agreed to purchase under this Agreement; , , that if the aggregate principal amount of Underwriters' Warrants which any such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters shall have so failed to purchase is more than one-eleventh of the aggregate number of the Underwriters' Warrants, then this Agreement may be terminated by the Selling Security Holder or, through the Representative, by such Underwriters as have agreed to purchase in the aggregate 50% or more of the remaining Underwriters' Warrants under this Agreement, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter, the Company or the Selling Security Holder, except for the expenses referred to in Section 5(A)(f) hereof and the indemnification provided in Section 7 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
provided
however
          (b) If the Selling Security Holder shall fail at the Time of Delivery to sell and deliver the number of Warrants which the Selling Security Holder is obligated to sell hereunder then the Underwriters may, at the option of the Representative, by notice from the Representative to the Company and the Selling Security Holder, terminate this Agreement without any liability on the part of any non-defaulting party, except to the extent provided in Sections 5(A)(f) and 7 hereof. Any action taken under this Section 8(b) shall not relieve the Selling Security Holder from liability in respect of any default under this Agreement.
          9. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Underwriters, the Company and the Selling Security Holder hereunder, as set forth in this Agreement or made by them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain
 
in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, the Selling Security Holder or the Company or any of its officers or directors or any controlling person, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Warrants.
          10. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 8(a) hereof, or if any Warrants are not delivered by the Selling Shareholder because the condition set forth in Section 6(j) has not been met, then the Company and the Selling Shareholder shall be under no liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Warrants except as provided in Section 5(A)(f) and Section 7 hereof. If this Agreement is terminated or the sale of any Warrants as provided herein is not consummated for any other reason, the Underwriters, through the Representative, shall be reimbursed for all out-of-pocket expenses, including counsel fees and disbursements, as approved in writing by the Representative, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Warrants, but the Company and the Selling Shareholder shall then have no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Warrants except as provided in Section 5(A)(f) and Section 7 hereof. The obligation to reimburse the Underwriters set forth in the immediately preceding sentence shall be (i) the Company's, if such termination or failure to consummate the sale of Warrants is because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any obligation required to be performed by it pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or to satisfy any of the conditions set forth in Sections 6(a), 6(b) (except to the extent that the Company's failure to satisfy its obligation under Section 6(b) is the result of the Selling Security Holder's failure to consent to the Warrant Amendment), 6(c), 6(d), 6(e), 6(h), 6(i) and 6(k), or (ii) the Selling Shareholder's, if such termination or failure to consummate the sale of Warrants is because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Selling Shareholder to perform any obligation required to be performed by it pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or to satisfy any of the conditions set forth in Sections 6(g) and 6(l).
          11. In all dealings with the Company and the Selling Security Holder under this Agreement, the Representative shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the Company and Selling Security Holder shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by the Representative.
          All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, or by telegram if promptly confirmed in writing, and if to the Representative or the Underwriters shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered or sent by registered mail to the Representative, if to the Company shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered or sent by registered mail to the Company at One American Road, Dearborn, Michigan 48126, attention of the Secretary, if to the Selling Security Holder shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered or sent by registered mail to the Selling Security Holder at UAW Retiree Medical Benefits Trust, c/o Independent Fiduciary Services, Inc., 805 15th Street, NW, Suite 1120, Washington, DC 20005, Attention: Mr. Samuel W.

address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by the Representative upon request.
          12. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and the Selling Security Holder, and to the extent provided in Section 7 and Section 9 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company, the trustees, officers and fiduciaries of the Selling Security Holder and any person who controls any Underwriter, the Company or the Selling Security Holder, and their respective personal representatives, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Warrants from any Underwriter shall be construed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
          13. Each Underwriter acknowledges that the Selling Security Holder is subject to ERISA.
          14. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.
          15. This Agreement may be executed by each of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, and by each of the parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which counterparts, when so executed and delivered, shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.

     Re:
Registration Statement
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     Reference is made to the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (the "Registration Statement") filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on June 2, 2008, by Ford Motor Company (the "Company") for the registration of warrants to purchase common stock (the "Warrants"). The Warrants have been issued pursuant to the provisions of a Warrant Agreement (as amended and restated prior to the date hereof, the "Warrant Agreement") between the Company and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as Warrant Agent (the "Warrant Agent").
     Pursuant to the terms of the Warrant Agreement, the Company has issued Warrants (the "Warrants") to purchase up to an aggregate of 362,391,305 shares of Ford Motor Company common stock, par value $.01 per share (the "Common Stock").
     As Secretary of the Company, I am familiar with the Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the By-laws of the Company and with the affairs of the Company. I also am familiar with the Company's action taken pursuant to the Warrant Agreement to establish the Warrants. I have also examined such other documents and instruments and have made such further investigation as I have deemed necessary or appropriate in connection with this opinion.
     Based on the foregoing, it is my opinion that:
     1. The Warrants constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company.
     2. The Common Stock initially issuable upon exercise of the Warrants has been duly authorized and reserved and, when issued upon exercise of the Warrants in accordance with the terms of the Warrants and the Warrant Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
 
     My opinions expressed herein are subject to the qualification that I express no opinion as to the applicability of, compliance with, or effect of (i) any bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other similar law or judicially developed doctrine in this area (such as substantive consolidation or equitable subordination) affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally, (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), and (iii) public policy considerations which may limit the rights of parties to obtain certain remedies. I further express no opinion as to the validity, legally binding effect or enforceability of any provision in the Warrants or the Warrant Agreement that requires or relates to adjustments to the exercise price at a rate or in an amount that a court would determine in the circumstances under applicable law to be commercially unreasonable or a penalty or forfeiture.
     I wish to point out that I am a member of the Bar of the State of Michigan and do not hold myself out as an expert in the laws of other jurisdictions. However, I have made, or cause to be made, such investigation as I have deemed appropriate with respect to the laws of other jurisdictions in connection with the opinion expressed herein, and nothing has come to my attention in the course of such investigation which would lead me to question the correctness of such opinion.
     I hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as Exhibit 5 to the Registration Statement. In giving this consent, I do not admit that I am in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission issued thereunder.
Very truly yours,
/s/ Peter J. Sherry, Jr.
Peter J. Sherry, Jr. Secretary
