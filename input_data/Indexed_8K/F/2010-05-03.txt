On average, resale values of Ford vehicles have increased 23 percent versus last year, outpacing the industry average by 4 percentage points, according to the latest North American Dealers Association auction data. Ford vehicles now have the fewest number of defects of any full-line manufacturer and the highest customer satisfaction with vehicle quality among all major automakers, according to a first quarter study by RDA Group of Bloomfield Hills, Mich.
