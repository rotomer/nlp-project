Item 2.01.  Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
As disclosed in its Current Report on Form 8-K dated March 28, 2010, Ford Motor Company ("Ford") and its subsidiary, Volvo Personvagnar Holding AB ("Volvo Holdco"), signed a stock purchase agreement (the "Agreement") with two subsidiaries of Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Company Limited ("Geely"), Mintime North America, LLC ("Mintime") and Geely Sweden AB ("Geely Sweden").  Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, on August 2, 2010, Volvo Holdco sold and Geely Sweden acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Volvo Personvagnar AB, which together with its subsidiaries is the main operating entity for the production and sale of Volvo-brand vehicles ("Volvo Car Corporation" or "VCC"), and Ford sold and Mintime acquired 100% of the membership interest of Volvo Cars of North America, LLC, the distributor of Volvo-brand vehic les in North America ("VCNA").  Pursuant to the Agreement, VCC, VCNA, and their respective subsidiaries (collectively, "Volvo") will retain or acquire certain assets presently used by Volvo, consisting principally of ownership of, or licenses to use, certain intellectual property ("Related Assets").
The total purchase price for VCC, VCNA and the Related Assets set forth in the Agreement was $1.8 billion, of which $200 million was to be paid in the form of a note (the "Note") and the balance to be paid in cash, with the cash portion subject to customary purchase price adjustments.  In accordance with the terms of the Agreement, at closing on August 2, 2010, Geely paid $1.3 billion in cash and issued the Note in the amount of $200 million.  The estimated purchase price adjustments used at closing (relating to estimated pension liabilities, debt, cash and working capital balances) are expected to be finalized and settled following final true-up of the purchase price adjustments later this year.  The final true-up is expected to result in additional proceeds to Ford.
The Note issued to Volvo Holdco is the obligation of the parent of Geely Sweden, and is guaranteed by the parent of the obligor.  The Note matures on November 2, 2015, and contains certain covenants, including with respect to the incurrence of indebtedness, liens, and merger and consolidation transactions.
As part of the arrangement between Ford and Geely, Ford will continue to supply Volvo with, for differing periods, powertrains, stampings and other vehicle components.  Volvo will continue to supply engines, stampings and other components to Ford for a period of time.  Ford also has committed to provide certain engineering support, information technology, access to tooling for common components, accounting and other selected services for a transition period to ensure a smooth separation process.
Pursuant to the terms of the secured credit agreement that Ford entered into in December 2006, as amended (the "Credit Agreement"), Ford is required to use about $300 million of the net cash proceeds from the sale of VCC to partially prepay certain outstanding term loans under the Credit Agreement.  For additional information, see the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of November 24, 2009 (filed as Exhibit 99.2 to Ford's Current Report on Form 8-K dated November 25, 2009).
