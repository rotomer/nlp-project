The Ford Fiesta, which offers 40 miles per gallon EPA highway fuel economy, eclipsed 3,000 sales in its second month in America and has been well-received by California customers. Highly acclaimed in Europe, Asia, and North America, the Fiesta is the first car developed under the ONE Ford global product development system.
Sales for the 2011 F-Series Super Duty were 63 percent higher than a year ago, capturing more than 50 percent of the heavy duty pickup segment. Ford announced today it will begin production of the most powerful diesel engine ever installed in a heavy-duty pickup (best-in-class 800 lb.-ft. of torque and 400 horsepower). In addition, the Super Dutys 6.7-liter Power Stroke diesel will provide improved fuel economy  a full 20 percent better fuel efficiency than the 2010 model.
In an industry-first customer loyalty program, Ford will provide the power upgrades free of charge to all current owners of a 2011 Super Duty diesel pickup, said Czubay.
Retail sales for the Mustang were 43 percent higher than a year ago. Since the arrival of the 2011 model featuring new V-6 and V-8 engines with more horsepower and improved fuel economy, Mustangs share has climbed to levels not seen since January 2009.
With our broad range of products  from Fiesta to Super Duty  Ford is connecting with consumers, said Ken Czubay, Ford vice president, U.S. Marketing, Sales and Service. Ford and its dealers continue to offer customers the strongest value proposition in the industry  class-leading fuel economy, quality and growing resale values.
In July, Ford retail sales were up 5 percent versus a year ago, and Ford appears to have gained retail market share for the 21 time in the last 22 months. Fleet sales were up 2 percent, reflecting higher sales of Fords hard-working trucks to commercial customers.
