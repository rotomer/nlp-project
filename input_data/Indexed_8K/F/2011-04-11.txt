Item 8.01. Other Events
We continue to assess the impact of the earthquake and resulting events in Japan on our Automotive operations.  Although we have no production facilities in Japan, we do obtain materials and components from suppliers located in Japan, and we are working closely with those suppliers to assess their production and shipping capabilities and to minimize any disruptions.  We also are pursuing other sources of supply as necessary and practicable.
As disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K dated April 1, 2011 (the "April 1 8-K"), the only effect, at that time and since that time, on our production directly attributable to the events in Japan has involved restrictions on ordering vehicles in certain paint colors for which an essential element is sourced from a plant in the affected area of Japan.  We also disclosed in the April 1 8-K that we have taken  into account potential parts shortages related to Japan both as we schedule previously-planned down weeks and as part of our regular production planning process to match supply to current demand.  We now expect that beginning in the last week of April and continuing into May, certain of our operations in the Asia-Pacific region (including certain of our joint venture operations) will be affected by shortages of components and vehicle kits as a result of the events in Japan.  Although this likely will require us and the affected joint venture affiliates to reduce or temporarily cease production of certain vehicles in the Asia-Pacific region, we do not expect this production disruption would have a material impact on our overall results.

Because the situation in Japan continues to develop, supply interruptions related to other materials and components from Japan could manifest themselves in the weeks ahead.  Should the supply of a key material or component from Japan be disrupted and an alternate supply not be available, we could have to reduce or temporarily cease production of vehicles, which could adversely affect our and Ford Motor Credit Company's financial condition and results of operations.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
