 Consumer demand remained strong in May for Fords new fuel-efficient vehicles and powertrains, bringing significant year-over-year sales gains for small cars and Explorer.
DEARBORN
, Mich., June 1, 2011
Customers increasingly are demanding new products that deliver compelling fuel economy, said Ken Czubay, Ford vice president, U.S. Marketing, Sales and Service. Fords new fuel-efficient products and powertrains arrived at the right time  just as fuel efficiency became even more of a consideration among consumers.
Fords two all-new small cars combined had sales of 29,423 in May, up 74 percent versus a year ago.  It was Fords largest small car month since May 2008. Fiesta sales were 7,120, and Focus sales were 22,303, up 32 percent versus a year ago.
The Ford Fusion midsize car also has started 2011 strong  with five straight monthly sales records. In May, Fusion sales totaled 24,666, its second highest month ever, and up 10 percent versus a year ago. Eighty percent of customers equipped their new Fusion with a 4-cylinder engine, up from 50 percent when the car debuted five years ago. Sales of the Lincoln MKZ were up 24 percent in May and the MKZ Hybrid accounted for 22 percent of sales.
Explorer sales totaled 13,318, up 135 percent versus a year ago. This is the highest sales for Explorer in 47 months. In the first five months of 2011, the new Explorer is setting a torrid pace, with year-to-date sales totaling 55,401, up 120 percent. In June, Explorer will surpass last years full-year sales total of 60,687. Explorer has class-leading highway fuel economy of 25 mpg.
Escape sales totaled 23,140, up 21 percent. Fifty percent of customers now equip their Escape with a 4-cylinder engine, up from 40 percent a few years ago.

Truck sales were lower in May, with higher gas prices likely causing some buyers to defer purchases.
Still, Fords F-Series truck remained the best-selling vehicle in the U.S. with May sales of 42,399 (down 15 percent versus a year ago) and year-to-date sales of 214,461 (up 11 percent). The new 3.5-liter EcoBoost engine accounted for 41 percent of F-150 retail sales in May, up 4 percentage points from April. The total V6 mix, including the new 3.7-liter engine, was 55 percent  surpassing sales of F-150s equipped with V8s.
