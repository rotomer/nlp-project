Ford Mid-Decade Outlook Calls for Global Sales Growth, Stronger Margins, Expansion in Asia
 
 
 
 Ford Motor Company [NYSE:F] today said it expects its worldwide sales to increase by approximately 50 percent by mid-decade to about 8 million vehicles a year  with improved operating margins   as the company continues its One Ford plan to accelerate product introductions and expand quickly in growth markets.
NEW YORK, June 7, 2011
In a presentation today to financial analysts led by Ford President and CEO Alan Mulally, the company said it is well positioned to grow profitably. Ford expects industry-wide vehicle sales to rise substantially by mid-decade, with much of Fords growth opportunity driven by accelerated expansion in the developing markets, recovery in mature markets, and sales of smaller and more fuelefficient vehicles.
-
Ford is a growing company operating in a growing global automotive market, Mulally said. Through our One Ford plan, we are increasing our product investments to meet this growing demand with a full family of best-in-class products.

By mid-decade, Ford said it expects:
These milestones will be achieved, the company said, by continuing to make progress on its One Ford plan:

Fords mid-decade outlook is driven by the companys confidence in its product plan and ability to expand into new markets and appeal to a broadening customer base. By 2020, Ford expects about 32 percent of vehicle sales to come from the Asia Pacific Africa region, more than doubling the current percentage of global sales volume Ford achieves in the region.
Globally, small vehicles will increase from representing 48 percent of Fords sales to about 55 percent of the companys global sales by 2020.
The company also said that by 2014 more than 140 percent of the global product portfolio will be new or significantly refreshed compared with 2009. This will include a continued focus on global vehicles, including one midsize vehicle, one full-size commercial van and one global compact pickup  in addition to the global small vehicles already being sold today. Ford said it has proven it can win with this strategy, having recently introduced the successful global Fiesta, Focus and Transit Connect.
By mid-decade, Ford expects that about 6 million of its global vehicle sales  or about 75 percent of its total volume  will come from vehicles built on five vehicle architectures: B, C, C/D, full-size commercial van and compact pickup platforms.
At the same time, Ford said it will pursue profitable growth opportunities in emerging markets by creating lower-priced versions of global vehicles that offer a $1,000 to $2,000 cost reduction depending on vehicle size and systems. By increasing the localization of global vehicles in certain circumstances, Ford said it will better meet customer needs and win new buyers for its products. In all cases, Ford vehicles will deliver the top standards for quality, fuel efficiency, safety, smart design and value that customers expect.

While Fords continued product expansion is expected to drive volume and revenue growth, the company also expects its pricing power to continue to be positive as it enhances the overall brand value.
A key factor driving Fords mid-decade outlook is the expectation for growth of industry volumes. Ford expects industry volumes to grow to the 95 million to 100 million range by mid-decade, compared to 74 million in 2010. Ford expects fuel prices and commodity costs generally will continue to increase as world economies continue to recover.
Ford also announced that it will pay down in the second quarter of 2011 an additional $2.3billion of the term loans under its secured credit agreement, and that it repaid the remaining $800million drawn amount of its revolving credit line. Ford ended the first quarter with $16.6billion of Automotive debt. Going forward, Ford plans to reach an Automotive debt level of $10 billion, while moving from a secured funding base to unsecured funding.
 
 
 
Ford said it expects to achieve investment grade in the near-term, and to resume paying dividends at an appropriate level of after-tax earnings.
We will continue to focus on maintaining healthy, growing operating margins and creating long-term value, said Lewis Booth, Ford executive vice president and chief financial officer. Maintaining adequate cash to support and grow the business and reducing our debt are essential steps we are taking to achieve and solidify a world-class balance sheet.
