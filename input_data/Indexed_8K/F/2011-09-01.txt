Fords fuel-efficient cars, crossovers and trucks continue winning over consumers in the marketplace, said Ken Czubay, Ford vice president, U.S. Marketing, Sales and Service. Our new product lineup  especially our newest cars  continues helping Ford grow even stronger and gain market share on the fiercely competitive East and West coasts.
Ford Brand Cars: Up 10 Percent
Fiesta, Fusion and Mustang posted higher sales than a year ago.
Fiesta sales totaled 5,833, up 76 percent, and Fusion sales were 17,925, up 5 percent. In the first eight months of 2011, Fusion was Fords top-selling car, with sales totaling 168,929, up 16 percent versus a year ago. Mustang sales were up 3 percent in August.
Focus sales, constrained by low inventory, totaled 14,093, down 9 percent. Fiesta and Focus remain the fastest-turning vehicles in the Ford showroom.

Explorer sales totaled 9,901, up 300 percent versus a year ago, and Edge sales totaled 9,414, up 5 percent.
Customers value the fuel efficiency and technology of our new utilities, said Czubay, noting that more than 90 percent of Explorers and more than 80 percent of Edges are equipped with MyFord Touch, Fords industry-leading hands-free system that controls entertainment, information and vehicle systems.
