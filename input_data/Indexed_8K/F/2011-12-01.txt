EXHIBIT INDEX

November U.S. Retail Sales Up 20 Percent for Ford Motor Company; Fuel-Efficient Cars, Utilities, Trucks Drive Results
DEARBORN, Mich., Dec. 1, 2011
- Ford Motor Company's November U.S. retail sales increased 20 percent versus a year ago. Total sales were 166,865, up 13 percent.
Ford estimates its retail market share has averaged 15 percent in the last three months - its highest retail share in five years.
Ford brand retail sales were higher for most products, with double-digit gains posted by Fiesta, Fusion, Escape, Explorer, F-Series, Econoline and Ranger.
With gasoline prices continuing to track higher than last year, consumers continue to value fuel economy - no matter what size or kind of vehicle best meets their needs, said Ken Czubay, Ford vice president, U.S. Marketing, Sales and Service. Most Ford products deliver best-in-class fuel economy and provide customers an opportunity to choose what best works for them - EcoBoost technology or electrified vehicles.
North American Production
Ford plans to build 675,000 vehicles in the first quarter of 2012, up 3 percent (18,000 vehicles) compared with first quarter 2011. Ford plans to build 674,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2011, an increase of 14,000 vehicles from the previous forecast.
The industry sales rate has exceeded 13 million in each of the last three months, said Czubay. This suggests the current momentum is not an aberration. We believe replacement demand will continue to support stronger levels in 2012, and Ford is ready to meet that demand with high-quality, fuel-efficient cars, utilities and trucks.
