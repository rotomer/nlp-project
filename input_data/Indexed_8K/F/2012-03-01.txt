Our news release dated March 1, 2012 concerning U.S. retail sales in February 2012 is filed as Exhibit 99 to this Report and incorporated by reference herein.
In an interview with various media outlets that took place on February 29, 2012, Lewis Booth, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, provided an update regarding our European operations. The following summarizes information provided by Mr. Booth with regard to our European operations:
It now is clear that the European automotive industry remains under pressure, with industry sales volume for the 19 markets we track coming in at or somewhat below 14 million units in the first two months of the year. We now expect full-year industry sales volume for 2012 for the 19 markets we track in Europe to be about 14 million units, compared with our initial planning assumption of 14 million to 15 million units. Accordingly, we expect first quarter 2012 results for Ford Europe to be about the same as or somewhat worse than fourth quarter 2011. We expect Ford Europe's pre-tax results to improve from that level during the year, largely reflecting the impact of our new product introductions and our continuing work on our cost base, with full-year results for Ford Europe limited to a loss of about $500 million to $600 million.
Our total Company guidance for 2012 remains unchanged - we expect Automotive pre-tax profits to improve, with total Company pre-tax profits to be about equal to full-year 2011 results.

Ford Motor Company U.S. Sales Increase in Cars, Utilities, Trucks in February; Focus up 115 Percent
DEARBORN, Mich., March 1, 2012
- Ford Motor Company posted a 14 percent increase in February U.S. sales versus year-ago levels, with 179,119 vehicles sold; retail sales increased 19 percent. The Ford brand was up 14 percent, while Lincoln posted a 16 percent increase versus year-ago levels.
Sales momentum built as February unfolded, with higher fuel prices driving consumer demand for more fuel-efficient vehicles in the second half of the month, said Ken Czubay, Ford vice president, U.S. Marketing, Sales and Service. Customers are recognizing Ford for investing in new cars, utilities and trucks with strong fuel economy, especially Focus, Escape and EcoBoost-powered vehicles.
Ford Motor Company's car sales were up 16 percent in February, with Focus contributing 40 percent to the company's total vehicle growth - more than any other vehicle. Utilities gained 5 percent, with Escape setting a best-ever February sales record with 18,666 vehicles sold. Escape has had two consecutive best-ever sales months in January and February - its strongest-ever start to a year.
America's top-selling vehicle for 30 years, the Ford F-Series posted a 26 percent increase, totaling 47,273 pickups.
Ford Motor Company's North American production plan is to build 730,000 vehicles in the second quarter of 2012, up 3 percent (20,000 vehicles) compared with the second quarter 2011. First quarter production (675,000 vehicles) is unchanged from the previous forecast.
