Ford Motor Company ("Ford") hereby incorporates by reference its news release dated April 27, 2012, which is filed as Exhibit 99 hereto.

Please note that Exhibit 99 to this Form 8-K discusses various financial measures "excluding special items" and/or with other adjustments.  The most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") are these same measures including special items and/or without adjustments.  We believe that showing these measures on a basis that excludes special items and/or includes other adjustments is useful to investors, because it allows investors to evaluate our results excluding or adjusting for items related to our efforts to match production capacity and cost structure to market demand and changing model mix, as well as items that we do not necessarily consider to be indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities.
In addition, Exhibit 99 discusses our key cash metrics, Automotive operating-related cash flow (which we believe best represents the ability of our Automotive operations to generate cash), and Automotive gross cash (including cash and cash equivalents and net marketable securities).  We believe that Automotive operating-related cash flow is useful to investors because it includes elements that we consider to be related to our operating activities (e.g., capital spending), and excludes cash flow elements that we do not consider to be related to the ability of our operations to generate cash.  The most comparable GAAP measure is on our statement of cash flows.  The most comparable GAAP measure for Automotive gross cash is the sum of the individual line items on our balance sheet for each of the elements within that measure ( and).

DEARBORN, Mich., April 27, 2012  Ford Motor Company [NYSE: F] today reported 2012 first quarter pre-tax operating profit of $2.3 billion, or 39 cents per share, and net income of $1.4 billion, or 35 cents per share, led by strong performance in North America and Ford Credit. Ford has now been profitable on a pre-tax operating basis for 11 consecutive quarters.
Our team delivered a solid performance during the first quarter, with particularly strong results in North America, despite a challenging global external environment, said Alan Mulally, Ford president and CEO. We remain focused on investing for future growth and developing outstanding products with segment-leading quality, fuel efficiency, safety, smart design and value.
The results compare to 2011 first quarter net income of $2.6 billion, or 61 cents per share, and pre-tax operating profit of $2.8 billion, or 47 cents per share, adjusted for the tax valuation allowance release. Lower wholesale volumes, reflecting in part weaker economic conditions in Europe, contributed to the decline from a year ago.
First quarter 2012 net income was affected by the impact of the higher tax expense compared to a year ago, resulting from the release of the tax valuation allowance in fourth quarter 2011.The increase in non-cash tax expense explains about half of the decrease in net income, with the balance reflecting lower operating results and increased special charges, primarily buyouts of hourly workers in the U.S. as part of the 2011 UAW agreement.
 
Ford finished the first quarter with Automotive gross cash of $23 billion, compared with $21.3 billion as of March 31, 2011, and $22.9 billion as of Dec. 31, 2011. Ford had total Automotive debt of $13.7 billion as of March 31, 2012, compared with $16.6 billion as of March 31, 2011, and $13.1 billion as of Dec. 31, 2011. Total Automotive liquidity at the end of the first quarter was $32.9 billion, including all available credit lines. This compares to $30.7 billion as of March 31, 2011, and $32.4 billion as of Dec. 31, 2011.
Ford generated positive Automotive operating-related cash flow of $900 million in the first quarter, the eighth consecutive quarter of positive performance. First quarter liquidity actions also included the successful amendment and extension of the companys revolving credit facility, resulting in commitments of $9 billion through November 2015 and an additional $300 million through November 2013.
As part of the companys long-term strategy to de-risk its global funded pension plans, Ford announced today that it will offer to about 90,000 eligible U.S. salaried retirees and U.S. salaried former employees the option to receive a voluntary lump-sum pension payment. If an individual elects to receive the lump-sum payment, the companys pension obligation to the individual will be settled. This is the first time a program of this type and magnitude has been offered by a U.S. companyfor ongoing pension plans. Payouts will start later this year and will be funded from existing pension plan assets. This is in addition to the lump-sum pension payout option available to U.S. salaried future retirees as of July 1, 2012.
 
Continuing to improve the underlying strength of our balance sheet remains a fundamental part of financing the One Ford plan, said Bob Shanks, Ford executive vice president and chief financial officer. Providing the option of a lump-sum payment to current salaried U.S. retirees and former employees will reduce our pension obligations and balance sheet volatility.

FIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS
 
AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR
 
 
Total Automotive pre-tax operating profit in the first quarter was $1.8 billion, a decrease of $294 million from first quarter 2011. The decrease is explained by higher costs across the regions and unfavorable exchange rates. This was offset partially by higher net pricing and lower net interest expense.
Total vehicle wholesales in the first quarter were about 1.4 million units, a decline of 45,000 units from first quarter 2011. Lower wholesales in Europe and Asia Pacific Africa were offset partially by higher wholesales in North America and South America.
 
Total Automotive revenue in the first quarter was $30.5 billion, down $500 million from first quarter 2011.
In the first quarter, North America reported a pre-tax operating profit of $2.1 billion, compared with a profit of $1.8 billion a year ago. This was the highest quarterly profit for the region since at least 2000, when the company started reflecting North America as a separate business unit. The operating margin also improved to 11.5 percent from 10.3 percent a year ago. The increase in profits is explained by favorable volume and mix  mainly higher U.S. industry volume, higher net pricing, lower contribution costs, and lower compensation. This was offset partially by higher structural costs. Wholesales in the first quarter were 651,000 units, up 36,000 units from a year ago. Revenue in the first quarter was $18.6 billion, up $700 million from a year ago.
North America:
In the first quarter, South America reported a pre-tax operating profit of $54 million, compared with a profit of $210 million a year ago. The decrease is more than explained by higher costs, primarily contribution costs, and unfavorable exchange rates. Although net pricing was favorable, the company was not able to offset exchange and economic factors to the degree it has in the past. Wholesales in the first quarter were 118,000 units, up 4,000 units from a year ago. Revenue in the first quarter was $2.4 billion, up $100 million from a year ago.
South America:
In the first quarter, Europe reported a pre-tax operating loss of $149 million, compared with a profit of $293 million a year ago. The decrease is primarily explained by lower industry volumes, lower demand for parts and accessories, and actions to reduce dealer stocks consistent with industry levels. Contribution and pension-related cost increases were offset partially by reductions in other structural costs. Wholesales in the first quarter were 372,000 units, down 60,000 units from a year ago. Revenue in the first quarter, which excludes sales at unconsolidated joint ventures, was $7.2 billion, a decline of
Europe:
$1.5 billion from a year ago.

In the first quarter, Asia Pacific Africa reported a pre-tax operating loss of
Asia Pacific Africa:
$95 million, compared with a profit of $33 million a year ago. The decline reflects higher costs associated with continued investment for future growth that precede the benefit of new products across the region. This was exacerbated, to some extent, by a slower-than-planned launch of the new global Ranger pickup truck from the companys facilities in Thailand and South Africa. Wholesales in the first quarter were 217,000 units, down 25,000 units from a year ago. Revenue in the first quarter, which excludes sales at unconsolidated joint ventures, was $2.3 billion, up $200 million from a year ago.
In the first quarter, Other Automotive reported a loss of $106 million, compared with a loss of $249 million a year ago. The improvement reflects lower interest expense related to the companys 2011 debt reduction actions, and the non-recurrence of market valuation losses associated with Fords investment in Mazda.
Other Automotive:
FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR
 
For the first quarter, the Financial Services sector reported a pre-tax operating profit of $456 million, compared with a profit of $706 million a year ago.
 
In the first quarter, Ford Credit reported a pre-tax operating profit of
Ford Motor Credit Company:
 
$452 million, compared with a profit of $713 million a year ago. The decrease, which is in line with expectations, is primarily explained by fewer lease terminations, which resulted in fewer vehicles sold at a gain.
 
OUTLOOK 2012
Ford remains focused on delivering the key aspects of the One Ford plan, which are unchanged:
As previously announced, Ford revised its guidance for the U.S. and European industries and U.S. market share from the estimates provided at the 2011 fourth quarter earnings announcement. Ford expects U.S. full year industry volume to be in the range of 14.5 million to 15 million vehicles. The company expects European full year industry sales in the 19 markets Ford tracks to be about 14 million units. Both estimates include medium and heavy trucks.
The company expects its full year market share in the U.S. to be lower than 2011, as planned capacity increases will lag demand. Ford continues to expect market share in Europe to be about equal compared to 2011. Fords market share in 2011 was 16.5 percent in the U.S. and 8.3 percent in Europe.
Fords full year outlook on quality is mixed. The company expects its performance in Europe, South America and Asia Pacific Africa to improve from 2011, and the U.S. to be about the same as last year.

Ford confirmed that its total company pre-tax operating profit is expected to be about equal to 2011. The company expects pre-tax operating profit in the second half to be slightly higher than the first half due to the cadence of its many product launches and capacity actions. The company also is on track to deliver strong Automotive operating-related cash flow for the year.
Ford reported that its North America operation is expected to achieve significantly higher full year pre-tax profit and operating margin compared with 2011, which will be the key enabler for the company to achieve about the same level of pre-tax profit for 2012 as in 2011.
Ford also continues to expect its South America operation will generate solid profitability for full year 2012, although lower than in 2011; new global products will be launched in the region that will positively impact results primarily in the second half of the year. At the same time, there is some uncertainty in the region, including new trade agreements, the details and impact of which are still being evaluated.
The company continues to expect Ford Europe to incur a full year loss in the range of $500 million to $600 million, with its European operation benefiting from the launch of new products in addition to the completion of stock reduction actions and continued cost reductions that will positively affect results primarily in the second half of the year.
Despite a first quarter loss, Ford Asia Pacific Africa is expected to be profitable for the full year, with increasing volumes as the launch of the Ranger pickup progresses, new production capacity comes on line in China and Thailand, and other new product launches occur in the balance of the year.
Overall, Ford remains on track with its financial metrics for 2012:
Ford expects capital expenditures in 2012 to be $5.5 billion to $6 billion as it continues to invest in product and growth plans.
Ford continues to work closely with its suppliers on a daily basis regarding the potential shortage of nylon resins. The company has not had and does not expect any production disruptions.
We continue to expect 2012 to be a solid year marked by ongoing progress on our commitment to deliver great products, invest for global growth, build a strong business and provide profitable growth for all, said Mulally. We have both challenges and opportunities ahead, but we remain singularly focused on realizing the full potential of the global scale and operating margin benefits inherent in our One Ford plan.
