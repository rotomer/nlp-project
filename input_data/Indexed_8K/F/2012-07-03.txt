Ford Motor Company June and Year to Date Sales Up 7%; Escape Sales Best Ever, While Fusion Posts June Record
DEARBORN, Mich., July 3, 2012
- Ford Motor Company's U.S. sales are up 7 percent so far this year, with 1.14 million vehicles sold. June sales also increased 7 percent from last year, with 207,759 vehicles sold.
Ford sales are increasing across the company's lineup - with cars up 3 percent, utilities up 9 percent and trucks up 9 percent year to date.
In June, the Ford Escape set an any-month record - with sales up 28 percent - while the Ford Fusion set a record for June. Ford Explorer sales were up 35 percent from last year, and F-Series sales are up 11 percent and topped 50,000 for the first June in five years.
June was a good month for Ford and a particularly strong month for vehicles like Escape, Fusion, Explorer and F-Series, said Ken Czubay, Ford vice president, U.S. Marketing, Sales and Service. The new 2013 Escape also is off to a very strong start, with vehicles selling on dealer lots in less than five days - even topping the strong start of the new Explorer in 2010.
Fusion has posted four months in a row of sales records, including its best June result ever with 24,433 vehicles sold - a 17 percent increase from last year. In the first half of this year, Fusion sales are up over last year's record first half by 4 percent, with 136,849 vehicles sold.
Other sales milestones in June: Explorer sales are up 35 percent; Edge sales are up 6 percent; and America's top-selling vehicle for 30 years, the F-Series, sold 55,025 pickups. F-Series remains America's number one selling vehicle in the first half of 2012.
