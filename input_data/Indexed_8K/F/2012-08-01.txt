Ford Fusion Achieves Best-Ever July Sales, Explorer Best July Sales in Six Years, F-Series gains for 12
th
straight month
DEARBORN, Mich., Aug. 1, 2012
- Ford Motor Company's U.S. retail sales increased 2 percent in July versus year-ago levels, driven by strong retail customer demand for fuel-efficient vehicles.
Fuel economy continues to be a top consumer purchase driver across our lineup, said Ken Czubay, Ford vice president, U.S. Marketing, Sales and Service. Ford's fuel-efficient F-150 EcoBoost is a favorite among truck buyers returning to the market as new home construction picks up. Cars featuring strong fuel economy are in demand, as well, particularly Fusion with its fifth straight monthly sales record. Fusion's strength positions us well for the fall arrival of the all-new Fusion featuring EcoBoost engines, a hybrid and a plug-in hybrid.
Fusion exceeded its best-ever July sales record last month, with 23,326 vehicles sold. Mustang sales increased 8 percent versus last year, with 7,371 vehicles sold, representing its third straight month of sales gains since 2013 models started arriving in dealerships.
Explorer sales totaled 11,313 vehicles in July - its best-ever July sales result since 2006.
Ford F-Series, America's best-selling vehicle, reported its 12th straight month of sales increases, with 49,314 F-Series sold. EcoBoost-equipped F-150s made up 42 percent of retail sales in July.
Overall, Ford Motor Company sales were down 4 percent in July due to lower fleet sales. Fleet sales were down 16 percent. Retail sales were up 2 percent.
