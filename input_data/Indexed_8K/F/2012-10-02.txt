Ford Small Car Sales Reach Decade High; Escape Has Best-Ever September; Ford F-Series Hit Best September in 5 Years
DEARBORN, Mich., Oct. 2, 2012
- Ford delivered U.S. sales gains across its vehicle portfolio in September, with cars up 2 percent, utilities up 9 percent, and F-Series trucks up 1 percent.
As more buyers look for new vehicles across the country, Ford is ready with our strongest lineup ever of fuel-efficient cars, utilities and full-size pickups, said Ken Czubay, Ford vice president, U.S. Marketing, Sales and Service. Fuel economy remains one of the most important features customers want most today, and Ford is answering the call with five vehicles that deliver 40 mpg or better - with another three on the way by year-end.
Ford sales of Focus, C-MAX and Fiesta totaled 24,628 vehicles in September, representing Ford's best September for small car sales in 10 years. Focus sales were up 91 percent, while the all-new C-MAX began sales last month.
Escape had its best-ever September sales, with 23,148 vehicles sold, representing a 14 percent increase versus last year's record sales. Escape is on pace to surpass last year's record sales of 254,293 vehicles for the full year.
Ford F-Series, America's best-selling vehicle, sold a total of 55,077 pickups during September truck month - a 1 percent increase compared to last year - providing its 14th straight month of sales increases.
September U.S. total sales at Ford Motor Company were unchanged from last year and up 4 percent for retail sales.
