Building on his considerable global operational experience - including being part of the team that led Ford's North American transformation - Lawler now will focus on the world's largest automotive market and the dramatic expansion of Ford's presence in China.
In addition to fundamentally transforming our company during the last several years, we have strengthened our team with world-class leaders who will enable us to sustain our One Ford journey, Mulally said. All of us at Ford remain absolutely committed to continuing to make progress on our One Ford plan, including dealing decisively with near-term challenges, investing for future growth and developing outstanding products with leading quality, fuel efficiency, safety, smart design and value.
