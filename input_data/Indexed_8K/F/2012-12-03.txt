C-MAX Lineup Success Helps Drive Ford's Small Car Sales to 12-Year High; F-Series Marks Best November Since 2005
DEARBORN, Mich., Dec. 3, 2012
- November brought growth throughout Ford's product portfolio in the U.S., with car sales up 15 percent, utilities up 2 percent and trucks up 4 percent.
November represented a strong month for the industry, and Ford sales performed well across the board, said Ken Czubay, Ford vice president, U.S. Marketing, Sales and Service. We saw sharp increases in demand for Ford's fuel-efficient small cars, our best-ever month for electrified vehicles and growing demand for our fuel-efficient and capable F-Series pickups.
Ford had its best small car November sales month since 2000, with Focus, the all-new C-MAX Hybrids and Fiesta sales totaling 26,848 vehicles - a 76 percent increase over last year. Focus sales were up 56 percent versus year-ago levels, while the all-new C-MAX Hybrid lineup gained 52 percent versus October, when the C-MAX Energi went on sale.
The Ford F-Series, America's best-selling vehicle, posted an 18 percent increase, with 56,299 vehicles sold in November. This represents F-Series' best November since 2005 and 16 straight months of year-over-year sales increases.
Ford's total November sales of 177,673 vehicles increased 6 percent versus last year, with retail sales up 12 percent.
Ford also announced its 2013 first-quarter North American production plan. The company plans to build 750,000 vehicles in the first quarter, up 11 percent (73,000 vehicles) from 2012's first quarter. Fourth quarter production of 725,000 vehicles is unchanged from previous guidance.
