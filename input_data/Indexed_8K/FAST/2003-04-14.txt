Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure.
 
The following information is being provided pursuant to Item 12 of this report:
 
On April 11, 2003, Fastenal Company (the "Company") issued a press release discussing its financial performance for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2003. A copy of that press release is attached as an exhibit to this report and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
The press release contains information regarding the Company's total and daily sales growth rates, adjusted to exclude sales of the "DIY Business", which was acquired by the Company on August 31, 2001 and disposed of by the Company on October 3, 2002. Management believes that such adjusted growth rates are useful to investors because they provide consistent information about the financial performance of the Company's organic branch-based business and the Company's ongoing operations.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

FASTENAL COMPANY REPORTS FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS
The Fastenal Company of Winona, MN (NASDAQ Symbol FAST) reported the results of the quarter ended March 31, 2003. (Note  All information contained in the Press Release reflects the 2-for-1 stock split which occurred in May 2002.) Dollar amounts are in thousands.
 
Net sales for the three-month period ended March 31, 2003 totaled $235,843, an increase of 9.9% over net sales of $214,582 in the first quarter of 2002. The first quarter of 2002 included net sales of $5,392 from the Company's DIY Business, which was disposed of in October 2002. Adjusting for the DIY Business sale, growth in net sales of the remaining business was 12.8% from 2002 to 2003. Net earnings increased from $17,705 in the first quarter of 2002 to $19,041 in the first quarter of 2003, an increase of 7.5%. Earnings per share increased from $.23 to $.25 for the comparable periods.
 
During the first quarter of 2003, Fastenal opened 36 new sites, bringing the total number of sites to 1,205. There were 4,703 site employees as of March 31, 2003, a decrease of 0.8% from December 31, 2002.
 
Management's comments on 2003:
Note  Daily sales are defined as the sales for the month divided by the number of business days in the month.
 
The twelve months of 2001 and 2002 and the three months of 2003, excluding the DIY Business, had daily sales growth rates of (compared to the comparable month in the preceding year):
 
 
The twelve months of 2001 and 2002 and the three months of 2003, including the DIY Business, had daily sales growth rates of (compared to the comparable month in the preceding year):
 
 
The first table reflects growth rates of Fastenal excluding $16,974 and $8,526 of DIY Business net sales from January 1, 2002 to October 3, 2002 and from August 31, 2001 to December 31, 2001, respectively (the period of time the DIY Business was owned). Management included the first table above because we believe it provides a consistent presentation of the growth rates of the organic branch-based business before, during, and after the period in which the DIY Business was owned and operated.
 
The daily sales growth rates in the first table above represent several trends. The first being a downward trend in the first eleven months of 2001 which reflected the overall weakening of the industrial economy we service in North America. This trend reversed itself from December 2001 to June 2002; this was partly due to changing comparisons in the prior year and partly due to stronger month-to-month (i.e. April to May and May to June) growth rates compared to 2001. During July 2002, the daily sales growth rate decreased, began to improve again in August 2002 through November 2002, and slipped in December 2002, the final month of the year. The first quarter of 2003 continued the choppy trend in net sales growth experienced in the second half of 2002.
 
Fastenal's gross margins in the first quarter of 2003 and 2002 were 49.5% and 49.7%, respectively. The change in the gross margin percent resulted from several factors. The DIY Business operated at a lower gross margin, approximately 30%, so the sale of this business caused an improvement in the overall gross margin. This improvement was offset by (1) increases in freight costs primarily due to changes in fuel prices and (2) the influence of increases in sales to certain large accounts and to certain large sales, which were made at lower margins.
 
Fastenal's operating expenses grew at a rate of 9.7%, a rate that is less than the net sales growth rate of 9.9% discussed above. This was due to (1) the removal of the operating expenses associated with the DIY Business and (2) improvements in payroll and payroll related expenses. The improvement in payroll and payroll related expenses represents the continued focus on managing our headcount to the levels considered necessary to open new stores, to service growing sales, and to operate stores with the CSP format (discussed below).
 
The Company expects to open approximately 150 to 185 new stores in 2003 (or an increase over December 31, 2002 of approximately 12% to 16%). The Company opened 128 new store sites during 2001 (or an increase over December 31, 2000 of 14.3%) and 144 new store sites in 2002 (or an increase over December 31, 2001 of 14.0%). While the new stores continue to build the infrastructure for future growth, the first year sales are low, and the added expenses related to payroll, occupancy, and transportation costs impact the Company's ability to leverage earnings in a weakened industrial economy. As disclosed in the past, it has been the Company's experience that new stores take approximately ten to twelve months to achieve profitability. The planned openings can be altered in a short time span, usually less than 60 to 90 days. The Company will continue to reevaluate the level of planned openings in 2003.
 
In addition to the planned store expansion, we are proceeding with our customer service project' (or CSP'). The goals of this project include the expansion of the products stocked at each store site as well as a more consistent display theme at each of these store sites. On March 31, 2003, 370 of Fastenal's 1,205 stores were operating with the customer service project' layout and product selection. Our internal benchmarking information related to the store sites converted to the CSP' format in the third quarter of 2002 shows improvement in daily sales growth rates and in employee productivity when compared to a random sampling of non-converted store sites. This will be discussed in greater detail at our Annual Meeting of Shareholders on Tuesday, April 15, 2003. Copies of the information presented at the Annual Meeting will be posted on the Fastenal Company World Wide Web site at www.fastenal.com on Tuesday morning.
 
Additional information regarding Fastenal Company's first quarter statistics is available on the Fastenal Company World Wide Web site at www.fastenal.com. Beginning in November 2000, the Company began to disclose sales information on a monthly basis. This information is posted at www.fastenal.com on the third business day following the end of each month. This press release contains statements that are not historical in nature and that are intended to be, and are hereby identified as, "forward looking statements" as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding increases in selling locations, the time it typically takes a new store to achieve profitability, the timeline for altering planned store openings, and the continuance of our customer service project'. A change in the economy, from that currently being experienced, could cause the store openings to change from that expected, and disruption with the customer service project' implementation could cause expenses and inventory investments to increase, which in turn could cause the Company to reevaluate the implementation of the project. A discussion of other risks and uncertainties is included in the Company's 2002 annual and quarterly reports under the section captioned "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations".
