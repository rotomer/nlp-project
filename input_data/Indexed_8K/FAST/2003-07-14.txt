The following information is being provided pursuant to Item 12 of this report:
 
On July 11, 2003, Fastenal Company (the "Company") issued a press release discussing its financial performance for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2003. A copy of that press release is attached as an exhibit to this report and is incorporated herein by reference.

During the first six months and the second quarter of 2003, Fastenal opened 71 and 35 new sites, respectively, bringing the total number of sites to 1,240. There were 4,690 site employees as of June 30, 2003, a decrease of 1.1% from December 31, 2002.
 
Management's comments on 2003:
 
Note  Daily sales are defined as the sales for the month divided by the number of business days in the month.
 
The twelve months of 2001 and 2002 and the first six months of 2003, excluding the DIY Business, had daily sales growth rates of (compared to the comparable month in the preceding year):
 
 
The twelve months of 2001 and 2002 and the first six months of 2003, including the DIY Business, had daily sales growth rates of (compared to the comparable month in the preceding year):
 
 
The first table reflects growth rates of Fastenal excluding $16,974 and $8,526 of DIY Business net sales from January 1, 2002 to October 3, 2002 and from August 31, 2001 to December 31, 2001, respectively (the period of time the DIY Business was owned). Management included the first table above because we believe it provides a consistent presentation of the growth rates of the organic branch-based business before, during, and after the period in which the DIY Business was owned and operated.
 
The daily sales growth rates in the first table above represent several trends. The first being a downward trend in the first eleven months of 2001 which reflected the overall weakening of the industrial economy we service in North America. This trend reversed itself from December 2001 to June 2002; this was partly due to changing comparisons in the prior year and partly due to stronger month-to-month (i.e. April to May and May to June) growth rates compared to 2001. During July 2002, the daily sales growth rate decreased, began to improve again in August 2002 through November 2002, and slipped in December 2002, the final month of the year. The first six months of 2003 continued the choppy trend in net sales growth experienced in the second half of 2002.
 
Fastenal's gross margins in the first six months of 2003 and 2002 were 49.5% and 49.6%, respectively. The change in the gross margin percent resulted from several factors. The DIY Business operated at a lower gross margin, approximately 30%, so the sale of this business caused an improvement in the overall gross margin. This improvement was offset by (1) increases in freight costs primarily due to changes in fuel prices and (2) the influence of increases in sales to certain large accounts and to certain large sales, which were made at lower margins.
 
Fastenal's operating expenses in the first six months grew at a rate of 8.7%, a rate that approximated the net sales growth rate of 8.2% discussed above.
 
The Company previously indicated it expects to open approximately 150 to 185 new stores in 2003 (or an increase over December 31, 2002 of approximately 12% to 16%). The Company currently expects it will be in the lower end of the range. The Company opened 128 new store sites during 2001 (or an increase over December 31, 2000 of 14.3%) and 144 new store sites in 2002 (or an increase over December 31, 2001 of 14.0%). While the new stores continue to build the infrastructure for future growth, the first year sales are low, and the added expenses related to payroll, occupancy, and transportation costs impact the Company's ability to leverage earnings in a weakened industrial economy. As disclosed in the past, it has been the Company's experience that new stores take approximately ten to twelve months to achieve profitability. The planned openings can be altered in a short time span, usually less than 60 to 90 days. The Company will continue to reevaluate the level of planned openings in 2003.
 
In addition to the planned store expansion, we are proceeding with our customer service project' (or CSP'). The goals of this project include the expansion of the products stocked at each store site as well as a more consistent display theme at each of these store sites. On June 30, 2003, 552 of Fastenal's 1,240 stores were operating with the customer service project' layout and product selection. Our internal benchmarking information related to the store sites converted to the CSP' format in the third quarter of 2002 shows improvement in daily sales growth rates and in employee productivity when compared to a random sampling of non-converted store sites. Information related to these converted stores will be posted on the Fastenal Company World Wide Web site at on Friday, July 18, 2003.

While Fastenal continues to feel the impacts of the weakened industrial economy, we noted the following during the first six months of 2003: (1) the inventory increases experienced in 2002, and again in the first quarter of 2003, stopped, and decreased in June 2003, (2) the $2,137 sequential increase in operating expenses experienced from first to second quarter was the lowest sequential increase in operating expenses experienced in the last five years, (3) cash provided by operating activities strengthened from the first to second quarter, and (4) the store conversion project (the Customer Service Project, or CSP) that began in 2002 continues to approach the 50% completion point.
 
Additional information regarding Fastenal Company's first quarter statistics is available on the Fastenal Company World Wide Web site at . Beginning in November 2000, the Company began to disclose sales information on a monthly basis. This information is posted at on the third business day following the end of each month. This press release contains statements that are not historical in nature and that are intended to be, and are hereby identified as, "forward looking statements" as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding increases in selling locations, the time it typically takes a new store to achieve profitability, the timeline for altering planned store openings, and the continuance of our customer service project'. A change in the economy, from that currently being experienced, could cause the store openings to change from that expected, and disruption with the customer service project' implementation could cause expenses and inventory investments to increase, which in turn could cause the Company to reevaluate the implementation of the project. A discussion of other risks and uncertainties is included in the Company's 2002 annual and quarterly reports under the section captioned "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations".
