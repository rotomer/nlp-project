RELEASE DATE: January 20, 2004
 
FASTENAL COMPANY REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS
 
The Fastenal Company of Winona, MN (NASDAQ Symbol FAST) reported the results of the year and the quarter ended December 31, 2003. Dollar amounts are in thousands.
 
Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2003 totaled $994,928, an increase of 9.9% over net sales of $905,438 in 2002. The 2002 amount included net sales of $16,974 from the Company's DIY Business, which was disposed of in October 2002. Adjusting for the DIY Business sale, growth in net sales of the remaining business was 12.0% from 2002 to 2003. Management has included the adjusted growth in net sales percentage because we believe it provides a consistent presentation of the growth experienced in Fastenal's organic store-based business and ongoing operations. Net earnings increased from $75,542 in 2002 to $84,120 in 2003, an increase of 11.4%. Earnings per share increased from $1.00 to $1.11 for the comparable periods.
 
Net sales for the three-month period ended December 31, 2003 totaled $251,643, an increase of 14.8% over net sales of $219,286 in the fourth quarter of 2002. The fourth quarter of 2002 included net sales of $155 from the Company's DIY Business, which was disposed of in October 2002. Net earnings increased from $16,889 in the fourth quarter of 2002 to $19,890 in the fourth quarter of 2003, an increase of 17.8%. Earnings per share increased from $.22 to $.26 for the comparable periods.
 
The net earnings in 2002 include a gain on sale, before tax, of $5,934 recorded in the fourth quarter and an extraordinary gain, net of tax, of $716 recorded in the second quarter. These two items represent, respectively, the gain from the sale of the DIY Business and the recognition of negative goodwill relating to the DIY Business acquisition. The impact of the DIY Business' operations on the Company's operations was not significant.
 
During the twelve months and the fourth quarter of 2003, Fastenal opened 151 and 45 new sites, respectively. The 151 new sites in 2003 represent 12.9% more stores since December 31, 2002. There were 4,835 site employees as of December 31, 2003, an increase of 1.9% from December 31, 2002.
 
Management's comments on 2003:
 
Note  Daily sales are defined as the sales for the month divided by the number of business days in the month.
 
The twelve months of 2001, 2002 and 2003, excluding the DIY Business, had daily sales growth rates of (compared to the comparable month in the preceding year):
 
 
The twelve months of 2001, 2002 and 2003, including the DIY Business, had daily sales growth rates of (compared to the comparable month in the preceding year):
 
 
The first table reflects growth rates of Fastenal excluding $16,974 and $8,526 of DIY Business net sales from January 1, 2002 to October 3, 2002 and from August 31, 2001 to December 31, 2001, respectively (the period of time the DIY Business was owned). Management has included the first table above because we believe it provides a consistent presentation of the growth rates of the organic branch-based business and ongoing operations before, during, and after the period in which the DIY Business was owned and operated.
The daily sales growth rates in the first table above represent several trends. The first being a downward trend in the first eleven months of 2001, which reflected the overall weakening of the industrial economy, we service in North America. This trend reversed itself from December 2001 to June 2002; this was partly due to changing comparisons in the prior year and partly due to stronger month-to-month (i.e. April to May and May to June) growth rates compared to 2001. During July 2002, the daily sales growth rate decreased, began to improve again in August 2002 through November 2002, and slipped in December 2002, the final month of the year. The first six months of 2003 continued the choppy trend in net sales growth experienced in the second half of 2002, while the July 2003 to December 2003 time frame represents some stabilization and improvement in the growth rates. The choppy trend, which the Company experienced from July 2002 until June 2003, reflects the alternating strengthening and weakening in the industrial economy during that period, while the July 2003 to December 2003 improvement reflects continued strengthening in the economy as it relates to the customers we sell to in North America and the impact of the CSP initiative (as discussed below).
 
Fastenal's gross margins in 2003 and 2002 were 49.2% and 49.5%, respectively. The change in the gross margin percent resulted from several factors. The DIY Business operated at a lower gross margin, approximately 30%, so the sale of this business caused an improvement in the overall gross margin. This improvement was offset by (1) the influence of increases in sales to certain large accounts and to certain large one time sales, which were made at lower margins, (2) the influences of changes in product mix, and (3) the slowdown in the growth of inventories since May 2003, which has lowered the savings to Fastenal related to vendor incentive programs, including vendor freight allowances and rebates. The last item primarily impacted the latter half of the third quarter and all of the fourth quarter. We expect this trend to continue impacting us in the first quarter of 2004 and then we expect this trend will improve as freight allowances and rebates improve in the second quarter of 2004.
 
Fastenal's operating expenses in 2003 grew at a rate of 5.6%, a rate less than the net sales growth rate of 9.9% discussed above. This was primarily due to the tight management of employee numbers throughout the organization and the stabilization of insurance costs when compared to 2002.
 
The Company's goal is to continue opening approximately 10% to 15% new stores each year (calculated on the ending number of stores in the previous year). On December 31, 2003, the Company operated 1,314 stores; therefore, in 2004 the Company expects to open approximately 135 to 200 new stores. The Company previously indicated it expected to open in the lower end of a range of approximately 150 to 185 new stores in 2003 (or an increase over December 31, 2002 of approximately 12% to 16%). As disclosed above, the Company opened 151 new stores in 2003. The Company opened 144 new store sites in 2002 (or an increase over December 31, 2001 of 14.0%) and 128 new store sites during 2001 (or an increase over December 31, 2000 of 14.3%). While the new stores continue to build the infrastructure for future growth, the first year sales are low, and the added expenses related to payroll, occupancy, and transportation costs have impacted the Company's ability to leverage earnings in a weakened industrial economy. As disclosed in the past, it has been the Company's experience that new stores take approximately ten to twelve months to achieve profitability. The planned openings can be altered in a short time span, usually less than 60 to 90 days.
 
In addition to the planned store expansion, we continued our customer service project' (or CSP') in 2003. The goals of this project include the expansion of the products stocked at each store site as well as a more consistent display theme at each of these store sites. On December 31, 2003, 873 of Fastenal's stores were operating with the CSP' layout and product selection.
 
While Fastenal continued to feel the impacts of the weakened industrial economy in 2003, we noted the following:

"forward looking statements" as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding improvements in freight allowances and rebates, increases in selling locations, the time it typically takes a new store to achieve profitability, and the timeline for altering planned store openings. A change from expected buying patterns could cause freight allowances and rebates to not improve, and a change in the economy, from that currently being experienced, could cause the store openings to change from that expected. A discussion of other risks and uncertainties is included in the Company's 2002 annual and quarterly reports under the section captioned "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations".
