FASTENAL COMPANY REPORTS SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS
 
The Fastenal Company of Winona, MN (NASDAQ Symbol FAST) reported the results of the quarter ended June 30, 2005. Dollar amounts are in thousands.
 
Net sales for the three-month period ended June 30, 2005 totaled $383,263, an increase of 23.6% over net sales of $310,143 in the second quarter of 2004. Net earnings increased from $34,832 in the second quarter of 2004 to $44,647 in the second quarter of 2005, an increase of 28.2%. Basic and diluted earnings per share increased from $.46 to $.59 for the comparable periods.
 
Net sales for the six-month period ended June 30, 2005 totaled $737,072, an increase of 24.0% over net sales of $594,349 in the first six months of 2004. Net earnings increased from $62,979 in the first six months of 2004 to $81,679 in the first six months of 2005, an increase of 29.7%. Basic and diluted earnings per share increased from $.83 to $1.08 for the comparable periods.
 
During the first half of 2005, Fastenal opened 136 new sites (Fastenal opened 127 new sites in the first six months of 2004). These 136 new sites represent an additional 8.9% stores since December 31, 2004. There were 6,139 site employees as of June 30, 2005, an increase of 11.6% and 15.9% from December 31, 2004 and June 30, 2004, respectively.
 
SALES GROWTH:
 
Note  Daily sales are defined as the sales for the month divided by the number of business days in the month.
 
The twelve months of 2004 and the first six months of 2005 had daily sales growth rates of (compared to the comparable month in the preceding year):
 
 
The January 2004 to June 2005 time frame generally represents improvement followed by stabilization in the growth rates. The January 2004 to June 2005 general improvement and stabilization reflects continued strengthening in the economy as it relates to the customers we sell to in North America and the impact of the Fastenal standard inventory stocking model (see reference below regarding CSP). The 2004 period was also impacted by inflation in the steel based products we sell.
 
STATEMENT OF EARNINGS INFORMATION (percentage of net sales):
 
 
for the first half and second quarter of 2005 and 2004 were similar. The slight contraction in 2005 for both periods was caused by the greater inflation cost in the steel based products flowing through cost of sales. The impact was expected, and reflects product costs in the last three to six month turn period' of inventory in a first-in, first-out' inventory costing model. This impact was partially offset by an improvement in the gross profit associated with net freight revenue in the second quarter of 2005.
Gross profit margins
 
grew at a slower rate than net sales growth during the first half and second quarter of 2005. This was primarily due to the tight management of employee numbers throughout the organization in all of 2004 and the first half of 2005. As discussed in our 2004 annual report, payroll and related expenses have historically represented approximately 70% of operating and administrative expenses. Effective management of this expense allows us to leverage the sales growth more effectively. This tight management was significant, given the store expansion (discussed earlier and later). We will continue to manage headcount in a similar fashion and expect to maintain most of the labor efficiency.
Operating and administrative expenses
 
, as a percentage of earnings before income taxes, were approximately 38.0% in the first six months of 2005 and 2004, respectively. This rate fluctuates over time based on the income tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.
Income taxes
 
WORKING CAPITAL:
 
Two components of working capital, accounts receivable and inventories, improved during the first half of 2005. The June 2004-to-June 2005 percentage growth (i.e. year over year) and the year-to-date dollar growth were as follows:
 
June 2004-to-June 2005 percentage growth
 
 
 
The improvements stem from our initiatives to improve working capital. These initiatives include (1) the establishment of a centralized call center to facilitate accounts receivable management (this facility became operational early in 2005) and (2) the tight management of all inventory amounts not identified as either expected store inventory (see reference below regarding CSP), new expanded inventory, or inventory necessary for upcoming store openings.
 
STORE OPENINGS:
 
As discussed in previous public statements, the Company's goal is to continue opening approximately 13% to 18% new stores each year (calculated on the ending number of stores in the previous year). On December 31, 2004, the Company operated 1,533 stores; therefore, as previously announced, we expect to open approximately 200 to 275 new stores in 2005. The Company opened 219 new stores in 2004 (or an increase over December 31, 2003 of 16.7%) and 151 new store sites in 2003 (or an increase over December 31, 2002 of 12.9%). While the new stores continue to build the infrastructure for future growth, the first year sales are low, and the added expenses related to payroll, occupancy, and transportation costs do impact the Company's ability to leverage earnings. As disclosed in the past, it has been the Company's experience that new stores take approximately ten to twelve months to achieve profitability. The planned openings can be altered in a short time span, usually less than 60 to 90 days.
 
In addition to the planned store expansion, we continued our customer service project' (or CSP) in 2005. As of June 30, 2005, approximately 95% of our stores were operating in a CSP fashion. Since the CSP format represents the stocking model in substantially all of our locations, during the first quarter of 2005 we began to refer to these converted locations simply as stores with our expected inventory stocking model, versus the CSP designation. Consistent with our operating philosophy, we intend to continue identifying products and store display themes to position our stores to the Fastenal goal of being the best industrial and construction supplier in each local market in which we operate'. As disclosed in our June 2005 investor release, we expect to convert 25 locations to the CSP II format. The CSP II format represents a further expansion of the Fastenal standard inventory stocking model at the store level.
 
STOCK REPURCHASE:
 
In April 2005, the Company issued a press release announcing its board of directors had authorized purchases by the Company of up to 380,000 shares of its common stock. The Company purchased 350,000 shares of its outstanding stock at approximately $53.50 per share in late April 2005.
 
Additional information regarding certain Fastenal Company statistics for the current quarter is available on the Fastenal Company World Wide Web site at . The Company discloses sales and store information on a monthly basis. This information is posted at on the third business day following the end of the first two months of a quarter and simultaneous with the earnings release following the third month of a quarter. This press release contains statements that are not historical in nature and that are intended to be, and are hereby identified as, "forward looking statements" as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding management of headcount and labor efficiency, increases in selling locations, the time it typically takes a new store to achieve profitability, the timeline for altering planned store openings, and the conversion of stores to the CSP II format. A change in the economy, from that currently being experienced, could cause the store openings to change from that expected and could impact the CSP II rollout. A change in the number of markets able to support future store sites could change the management of headcount, which in turn, together with changes in sales growth and store openings, could impact labor efficiency. A discussion of other risks and uncertainties is included in the Company's 2004 annual report under the section captioned "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations".
