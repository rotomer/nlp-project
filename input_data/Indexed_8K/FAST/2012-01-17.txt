WINONA, Minn., Jan. 17, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Fastenal Company of Winona, MN (Nasdaq:FAST) reported its Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.17 per share to be paid in cash on February 29, 2012 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 1, 2012. The Company has paid a dividend in every year since 1991 and began paying semi-annual dividends in 2003, (with a third 'supplemental' dividend in both 2010 and 2008). In January 2011, our Board of Directors declared a semi-annual dividend, and then announced quarterly dividends in April, July, and October 2011. Our Board of Directors intends to continue paying quarterly dividends, provided that any future determination as to payment of dividends will depend upon the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and such other factors as are deemed relevant by the Board of Directors.
Dividend and stock repurchase activity in the last ten years are as follows:
