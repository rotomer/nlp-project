(b)  Subject to Sections 8.01(c) and 8.02, the Company at any time may terminate (i) all of its obligations under the Securities and this Indenture (legal defeasance option) or (ii) its obligations under Sections 4.02, 4.03, 4.04, 4.05, 4.06, 4.07, 4.08, 4.11, 4.12, 4.13 and 4.14 and the operation of Section 5.01(a)(iii), 5.01(a)(iv), 6.01(d), 6.01(f), 6.01(g) (with respect to Significant Subsidiaries of the Company only), 6.01(h) (with respect to Significant Subsidiaries of the Company only) and 6.01(i) (covenant defeasance option).  The Company may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option.  In the event that the Company terminates all of its obligations under the Securities and this Indenture by exercising its legal defeasance option, the obligations under the Subsidiary Guarante es shall each be terminated simultaneously with the termination of such obligations.
If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Securities may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default.  If the Company exercises its covenant defeasance option, payment of the Securities may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(d), 6.01(f), 6.01(g) (with respect to Significant Subsidiaries only), 6.01(h) (with respect to Significant Subsidiaries only) or 6.01(i) (with respect to Significant Subsidiaries only) or because of the failure of the Company to comply with clause (iii) or (iv) of Section 5.01(a).
Upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein and upon request of the Company, the Trustee shall acknowledge in writing the discharge of those obligations that the Company terminates.
(c)  Notwithstanding clauses (a) and (b) above, the Companys obligations in Sections 2.04, 2.05, 2.06, 2.07, 2.08, 2.09, 7.07, 7.08 and in this Article 8 shall survive until the Securities have been paid in full.  Thereafter, the Companys obligations in Sections 7.07, 8.05 and 8.06 shall survive such satisfaction and discharge.
SECTION 8.02.    (a)  The Company may exercise its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option only if:

(vii)  in the case of the covenant defeasance option, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred; and
(viii)  the Company delivers to the Trustee an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent to the defeasance and discharge of the Securities as contemplated by this Article 8 have been complied with.

If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any money or U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with this Article 8 by reason of any legal proceeding or by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, the Companys obligations under this Indenture and the Securities shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to this Article 8 until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money or U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with this Article 8; , , that, if the Company has made any payment of principal of, or interest or additional interest on, any Securities because of the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Secur ities to receive such payment from the money or U.S. Government Obligations held by the Trustee or Paying Agent.

No such consent shall be valid or effective for more than 120 days after such record date.
SECTION 9.05.    If an amendment changes the terms of a Security, the Trustee may require the Holder of the Security to deliver it to the Trustee.  The Trustee may place an appropriate notation on the Security regarding the changed terms and return it to the Holder.  Alternatively, if the Company or the Trustee so determines, the Company in exchange for the Security shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a new Security that reflects the changed terms.  Failure to make the appropriate notation or to issue a new Security shall not affect the validity of such amendment.
Notation on or Exchange of Securities.
SECTION 9.06.    The Trustee shall sign any amendment authorized pursuant to this Article 9 if the amendment does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee.  If it does, the Trustee may but need not sign it.

Payment for Consent.
SECTION 10.01.    (a)  Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby jointly and severally irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, to each Holder and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns (i) the full and punctual payment when due, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, of all obligations of the Company under this Indenture (including obligations to the Trustee) and the Securities, whether for payment of principal of, interest on or additional interest, if any, in respect of the Securities and all other monetary obligations of the Company under this Indenture and the Securities and (ii) the full and punctual performance within applicable grace periods of all other obligations of the Company whether for fees, expenses, indemnification or otherwise under this Indenture and the Securities (all the fo regoing being hereinafter collectively called the Guaranteed Obligations).  Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice or further assent from each such Subsidiary Guarantor, and that each such Subsidiary Guarantor shall remain bound under this Article 10 notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any Guaranteed Obligation.
Subsidiary Guarantees.
(b)  Each Subsidiary Guarantor waives presentation to, demand of payment from and protest to the Company of any of the Guaranteed Obligations and also waives notice of protest for nonpayment.  Each Subsidiary Guarantor waives notice of any default under the Securities or the Guaranteed Obligations.  The obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected by (i) the failure of any Holder or the Trustee to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against the Company or any other Person under this Indenture, the Securities or any other agreement or otherwise, (ii) any extension or renewal of any thereof, (iii) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of this Indenture, the Securities or any other agreement, (iv) the release of any security held by any Holder or the Trustee for the Guaranteed Obligations or a ny of them, (v) the failure of any Holder or Trustee to exercise any right or remedy against any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations or (vi) any change in the ownership of such Subsidiary Guarantor, except as provided in Section 10.02(b).
(c)  Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby waives any right to which it may be entitled to have its obligations hereunder divided among the Subsidiary Guarantors, such that such Subsidiary Guarantors obligations would be less than the full amount claimed.  Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby waives any right to which it may be entitled to have the assets of the Company first be used and depleted as payment of the Companys or such Subsidiary Guarantors obligations hereunder prior to any amounts being claimed from or paid by such Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder.  Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby waives any right to which it may be entitled to require that the Company be sued prior to an action being initiated against such Subsidiary Guarantor.
(d)  Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that its Subsidiary Guarantee herein constitutes a guarantee of payment, performance and compliance when due (and not a guarantee of collection) and waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Holder or the Trustee to any security held for payment of the Guaranteed Obligations.
(e)  Except as expressly set forth in Sections 8.01(b), 10.02 and 10.06, the obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense of setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever or by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor herein shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by the failure of any Holder or the Trustee to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under this Indenture, the Securities or any other agreement, by any waiver or modification of any thereof, by any default, failure or delay, wi lful or otherwise, in the performance of the obligations, or by any other act or thing or omission or delay to do any other act or thing which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Subsidiary Guarantor or would otherwise operate as a discharge of any Subsidiary Guarantor as a matter of law or equity.
(f)  Each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that its Subsidiary Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect until payment in full of all the Guaranteed Obligations.  Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that its Subsidiary Guarantee herein shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of principal of or interest or additional interest, if any, on any Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Holder or the Trustee upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company or otherwise.
(g)  In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which any Holder or the Trustee has at law or in equity against any Subsidiary Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the Company to pay the principal of or interest or additional interest, if any, on any Guaranteed Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, or to perform or comply with any other Guaranteed Obligation, each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby promises to and shall, upon receipt of written demand by the Trustee, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, in cash, to the Holders or the Trustee an amount equal to the sum of (i) the unpaid principal amount of such Guaranteed Obligations, (ii) accrued and unpaid interest on such Guaranteed Obligations (but only to the extent not prohibited by law) and (iii) all other monetary obligations of th e Company to the Holders and the Trustee.
(h)  Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that, as between it, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (i) the maturity of the Guaranteed Obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article 6 for the purposes of any Subsidiary Guarantee herein, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations guaranteed hereby, and (ii) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such Guaranteed Obligations as provided in Article 6, such Guaranteed Obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by such Subsidiary Guarantor for the purposes of this Section 10.01.
(i)  Each Subsidiary Guarantor also agrees to pay any and all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred by the Trustee or any Holder in enforcing any rights under this Section 10.01.
(j)  Upon request of the Trustee, each Subsidiary Guarantor shall execute and deliver such further instruments and do such further acts as may be reasonably necessary or proper to carry out more effectively the purpose of this Indenture.
SECTION 10.02.    (a)  Any term or provision of this Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, the maximum aggregate amount of the Guaranteed Obligations guaranteed hereunder by any Subsidiary Guarantor shall not exceed the maximum amount that can be hereby guaranteed without rendering this Indenture, as it relates to such Subsidiary Guarantor, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally.
Limitation on Liability.
(b)  A Subsidiary Guarantee as to any Subsidiary Guarantor shall terminate and be of no further force or effect and such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be deemed to be released from all obligations under this Article 10 upon (i) the merger or consolidation of such Subsidiary Guarantor with or into any Person other than the Company or a Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company where such Subsidiary Guarantor is not the surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) the sale by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company (or any pledgee of the Company) of the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor, where, after such sale, such Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a Subsidiary of the Company; , , that each such merger, consolidation or sale (or, in the case of a sale by such a pledgee, the disposition of the proceeds of such sale) shall comply with Section 4.05 .  At the request of the Company, the Trustee shall execute and deliver an appropriate instrument evidencing such release (in the form provided by the Company).
provided
however
SECTION 10.03.    This Article 10 shall be binding upon each Subsidiary Guarantor and its successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the Trustee and the Holders and, in the event of any transfer or assignment of rights by any Holder or the Trustee, the rights and privileges conferred upon that party in this Indenture and in the Securities shall automatically extend to and be vested in such transferee or assignee, all subject to the terms and conditions of this Indenture.
Successors and Assigns.
SECTION 10.04.    Neither a failure nor a delay on the part of either the Trustee or the Holders in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Article 10 shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall a single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power or privilege.  The rights, remedies and benefits of the Trustee and the Holders herein expressly specified are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights, remedies or benefits which either may have under this Article 10 at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise.
No Waiver.
SECTION 10.05.    No modification, amendment or waiver of any provision of this Article 10, nor the consent to any departure by any Subsidiary Guarantor therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Trustee, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.  No notice to or demand on any Subsidiary Guarantor in any case shall entitle such Subsidiary Guarantor to any other or further notice or demand in the same, similar or other circumstances.
Modification.
SECTION 10.06.    Each Subsidiary which is required to become a Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to Section 4.11 shall promptly execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form of Exhibit C hereto pursuant to which such Subsidiary shall become a Subsidiary Guarantor under this Article 10 and shall guarantee the Guaranteed Obligations.  Concurrently with the execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel and an Officers Certificate to the effect that such supplemental indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by such Subsidiary and that, subject to the application of bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or transfer and other similar laws relating to creditors rights generally and to the princ iples of equity, whether considered in a proceeding at law or in equity, the Subsidiary Guarantee of such Subsidiary Guarantor is a legal, valid and binding obligation of such Subsidiary Guarantor, enforceable against such Subsidiary Guarantor in accordance with its terms and or to such other matters as the Trustee may reasonably request.
Execution of Supplemental Indenture for Future Subsidiary Guarantors.
SECTION 10.07.    The failure to endorse a Subsidiary Guarantee on any Security shall not affect or impair the validity thereof.

1.  
Interest
(a)  FREEPORT-MCMORAN COPPER & GOLD INC., a Delaware corporation (such corporation, and its successors and assigns under the Indenture hereinafter referred to, being herein called the Company), promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Security at the rate per annum shown above.  The Company shall pay interest semiannually on February 1 and August 1 of each year.  Interest on the Securities shall accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for or, if no interest has been paid or duly provided for, from January 29, 2003 until the principal hereof is due.  Interest shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
(b)  .  The Holder of this Security is entitled to the benefits of a Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of January 29, 2003, among the Company and the Initial Purchasers named therein (the "Registration Agreement").  Capitalized terms used in this paragraph (b) but not defined herein have the meanings assigned to them in the Registration Agreement.  As more fully set forth therein, the Registration Agreement provides that in the event that the Exchange Offer is not completed or, if required by the terms of the Registration Agreement, the Shelf Registration Statement is not declared effective on or prior to September 29, 2003, the interest rate on the Registrable Securities will be increased by 1.00% per annum until the Exchange Offer is completed or the Shelf Registration Statement, if required thereby, is declared effective by the SEC o r the Securities become freely tradable under the Securities Act.  If the Shelf Registration Statement has been declared effective and thereafter either ceases to be effective or the Prospectus contained therein ceases to be usable at any time during the Shelf Effectiveness Period, and such failure to remain effective or usable exists for more than 30 days (whether or not consecutive) in any 12-month period, then the interest rate on the Registrable Securities will be increased by 1.00% per annum commencing on the 31st day in such 12-month period and ending on such date that the Shelf Registration Statement has again been declared effective or the Prospectus again becomes usable; that, in no event will additional interest together with additional interest from the previous sentence, if any, exceed 1.00%.  All accrued additional interest shall be paid to Holders in the same manner as interest payments on the Securities on semi-annual payment dates which correspond to interest payment dates for the Securities.  Following the cure of all Registration Defaults, the accrual of additional interest shall cease.  The Trustee shall have no responsibility with respect to the determination of the amount of any such additional interest.

The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.  The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability.
