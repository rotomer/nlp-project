 Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. recently completed two note offerings (the Offerings).
Recent Note Offerings.
On February 11, 2003, we completed a private placement of $575 million of 7% Convertible Senior Notes due 2011.  Interest on the notes is payable semiannually on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning September 1, 2003.  The notes are convertible, at the option of the holder, at any time on or prior to maturity into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $30.87 per share, which is equal to a conversion rate of approximately 32.39 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes.  Filed as exhibit 4.1 is the Indenture dated February 11, 2003 with respect to the 7% Convertible Senior Notes due 2011.  
On January 29, 2003, we completed a private placement of $500 million of 10% Senior Notes due 2010.  Interest on the notes is payable semiannually on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning August 1, 2003.  We may redeem some or all of the notes at our option at a make-whole redemption price prior to February 1, 2007, and afterwards at stated redemption prices.  The indenture governing the notes contains restrictions on us and certain subsidiaries, including limitations on incurring debt, incurring liens, entering into sale leaseback transactions, making distributions from certain subsidiaries, selling assets, entering into transactions with affiliates, paying cash dividends on common stock, repurchasing or redeeming common or preferred equity, prepaying subordinated debt and making investments.  The Indenture dated January 29, 2003 with respect to the 10% Senior Notes due 2010 was filed as exhibit 4.1 to our Form 8-K dated Feb ruary 6, 2003.
 We received aggregate net proceeds of approximately $1.045 billion in the Offerings, after deducting the initial purchasers' discounts and our estimated expenses.  We used the net proceeds from the Offerings to repay all of our outstanding bank debt, which totaled $279.0 million at December 31, 2002.  We intend to terminate our existing bank credit facilities, which were scheduled to expire in 2005, and replace them with a new credit facility with less restrictive covenants.
Use of Proceeds from the Offerings.
We expect to use our available cash to redeem in August 2003 our series I gold-denominated preferred stock ($205.7 million redemption value based on December 31, 2002 gold prices) and a scheduled portion of our silver-denominated preferred stock ($11.1 million redemption value based on December 31, 2002 silver prices), and to repay our 7.20% senior notes due 2026 ($250.0 million) but which the note holders may, and are expected to, elect early repayment in November 2003.  See "Pro Forma Debt and Redeemable Preferred Stock Maturities" below.  The Offerings strengthened our financial position and flexibility by allowing us to effectively extend our debt and redeemable preferred stock maturities scheduled for 2003 and 2005 and allowing us to eliminate the restrictive covenants in our bank credit facilities.  After considering the repayment of approximately $746 million of debt and redeemable preferred stock maturities, we expect to have approximat ely $300 million of cash available for working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes.
In addition to increasing our total indebtedness, the sale of the notes in the Offerings will also increase the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt; as a result, our interest expense will increase.  For the year ended December 31, 2002, our interest expense was $171.2 million and our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 3.4:1.  On a pro forma basis our interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 would have been $233.3 million and our ratio of earnings to fixed charges would have been 2.5:1.  We will receive only a minimal tax benefit for the additional interest expense at our parent company.  Although we may loan a portion of the proceeds to PT Freeport Indonesia to meet its financial objectives, the amount of such intercompany loans will depend on several factors, such as maturities on current intercompany obligations, the potential to reduce PT Freeport Indonesia's other outstanding indebtedness and infrastructu re obligations, PT Freeport Indonesia's dividend policy and its other financial requirements.  
We are currently reviewing our options for repaying other outstanding debt, which could result in the recognition of losses and gains in future periods.  Depending on the timing and structure of a new credit facility and repayments of other outstanding debt, certain of our deferred financing costs in addition to scheduled amortization may be charged to 2003 earnings.
The following table reflects the pro forma application of a portion of the $1.045 billion of net proceeds from the Offerings toward the repayment of all outstanding balances under our bank credit facilities and the expected application of a portion of the net proceeds to repay our 7.20% senior notes and 2003 redeemable preferred stock maturities (in millions).  This table is based on outstanding loan balances as of December 31, 2002, and preferred stock redemption amounts based on the December 31, 2002, London A.M. gold fixing price for one ounce of gold ($342.75), and the London silver fixing price for one ounce of silver ($4.67) in the London bullion market:

.  On February 6, 2003, we announced that our board of directors has authorized a cash dividend policy for our common stock.  The policy provides for an annual dividend of $0.36 per share to be payable quarterly ($0.09 per quarter).  We expect the initial quarterly dividend to be paid on May 1, 2003.
New Dividend Policy
The declaration and payment of dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial results, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the board.  In addition, payment of dividends on our common stock is subject to limitations under our 10/% senior notes.  Pursuant to the limitations in our 10/% senior notes, the amount currently available to us for the payment of dividends on common stock is approximately $90 million.

10.02.  
Exercise of Conversion Right
.  To exercise the conversion right, the Holder of any Note to be converted shall surrender such Note duly endorsed or assigned to the Company or in blank, at the office of any Conversion Agent, accompanied by a duly signed conversion notice substantially in the form attached to the Note to the Company stating that the Holder elects to convert such Note or, if less than the entire principal amount thereof is to be converted, the portion thereof to be converted.
Notes surrendered for conversion during the period from the close of business on any Regular Record Date to the opening of business on the next succeeding Interest Payment Date shall be accompanied by payment in New York Clearing House funds or other funds acceptable to the Company of an amount equal to the interest to be received on such Interest Payment Date on the principal amount of Notes being surrendered for conversion.
Notes shall be deemed to have been converted immediately prior to the close of business on the day of surrender of such Notes for conversion in accordance with the foregoing provisions, and at such time the rights of the Holders of such Notes as Holders shall cease, and the Person or Persons entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such Common Stock at such time. As promptly as practicable on or after the conversion date, the Company shall cause to be issued and delivered to such Conversion Agent a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion, together with payment in lieu of any fraction of a share as provided in Section hereof.

10.03.  
Fractions of Shares
.  No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of any Note or Notes. If more than one Note shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same Holder, the number of full shares which shall be issued upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (or specified portions thereof) so surrendered. Instead of any fractional share of Common Stock which would otherwise be issued upon conversion of any Note or Notes (or specified portions thereof), the Company shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fraction (calculated to the nearest one-100th of a share) in an amount equal to the same fraction of the quoted price of the Common Stock as of the Trading Day preceding the date of conversion.
SECTION
10.04.  
Adjustment of Conversion Price
.  The Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustments, calculated by the Company, from time to time as follows:
(a)
In case the Company shall hereafter pay a dividend or make a distribution to all holders of the outstanding Common Stock in shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the date following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution shall be reduced by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction:
(1)
the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the Record Date (as defined in Section ) fixed for such determination, and
10.04(g)
(2)
the denominator of which shall be the sum of such number of shares and the total number of shares constituting such dividend or other distribution.
Such reduction shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the Record Date. For the purpose of this paragraph  (a), the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company.  The Company will not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company.  If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Price shall again be adjusted to the Conversion Price which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
10.04(a)
(b)
In case the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision becomes effective shall be proportionately reduced, and conversely, in case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such combination becomes effective shall be proportionately increased, such reduction or          increase, as the case may be, to become effective immediately after the          opening of business on the day following the day upon which such          subdivis ion or combination becomes effective.
(c)
In case the Company shall issue rights or warrants to all holders of its outstanding shares of Common Stock entitling them (for a period expiring within forty-five (45) days after the date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants) to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into Common Stock) at a price per share (or having a conversion price per share) less than the Current Market Price (as defined in Section ) on the Record Date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the price determined by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such Record Date by a fraction:
10.04(g)
(1)
the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the Record Date plus the number of shares which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares so offered for subscription or purchase (or the aggregate conversion price of the convertible securities so offered) would purchase at such Current Market Price, and
(2)
the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the close of business on the Record Date plus the total number of additional shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase (or into which the convertible securities so offered are convertible).
         
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the Record Date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants. To the extent that shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into Common Stock) are not delivered pursuant to
such rights or warrants, upon the expiration or termination of such rights or warrants the Conversion Price shall be readjusted to the Conversion Price which would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of the delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into Common Stock) actually delivered. In the event that such rights or warrants are not so issued, the Conversion Price shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Price which would then be in effect if such Record Date had not been fixed. In determining whether any rights or warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at less than such Current Market Price, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received for such rights or warrants and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, the value of such consideration if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors.
(d)
In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock shares of any class of Capital Stock of the Company (other than any dividends or distributions to which Section applies) or evidences of its indebtedness, cash or other assets, including securities, but excluding (1) any rights or warrants referred to in Section , (2) any stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash) distributed in connection with a reclassification, change, merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange, combination, sale or conveyance to which Section hereof applies and (3) dividends and distributions paid exclusively in cash (the securities described in foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3) hereinafter in this Section called the ), then, in each such case (unless the Company elects to reserve such securities for distribution to the Noteholders upon the conversion of the Notes so that any such Holder converting Notes will receive upon such conversion, in addition to the shares of Common Stock to which such Holder is entitled, the amount and kind of such securities which such Holder would have received if such Holder had converted its Notes into Common Stock immediately prior to the Record Date), subject to the second succeeding paragraph of this Section , the Conversion Price shall be adjusted so that the same shall be equal to the price determined by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the Record Date (as defined in Section ) with respect to such distribution by a fraction:

10.04(g)

the numerator of which shall be the Current Market Price (determined as provided in Section ) on such Record Date less the fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and set forth in a Board Resolution) on such Record Date of the portion of the securities so distributed (other than excluded securities) applicable to one share of Common Stock (determined on the basis of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding on the Record Date), and
10.04(g)
(2)
the denominator of which shall be such Current Market Price.
Such reduction shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the Record Date. However, in the event that the then fair market value (as so determined) of the portion of the securities so distributed (other than excluded securities) applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than the Current Market Price on the Record Date, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Holder shall have the right to receive upon conversion of a Note (or any portion thereof) the amount of securities so distributed (other than excluded securities) such Holder would have received had such Holder converted such Note (or portion thereof) immediately prior to such Record Date. In the event that such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Price shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Price which would then be in effect if such dividend or distributio n had not been declared.
If the Board of Directors determines the fair market value of any distribution for purposes of this Section by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any securities comprising all or part of such distribution (other than excluded securities), it must in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period (the ) used in computing the Current Market Price pursuant to Section to the extent possible, unless the Board of Directors in a Board Resolution determines in good faith that determining the fair market value during the Reference Period would not be in the best interest of the Holder.

In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) o f rights or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in the preceding sentence) with respect thereto, that resulted in an adjustment to the Conversion Price under this Section :

(1) in the case of any such rights or warrants which shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Price shall be readjusted upon such final redemption or repurchase to give effect to such distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder of Common Stock with respect to such rights or warrant (assuming such holder had retained such rights or warrants), made to all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase, and

(1)
the aggregate of the cash plus the fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and set forth in a Board Resolution), as of the expiration of such tender offer, of other consideration payable in respect of any other tender offers, by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for all or any portion of the Common Stock expiring within the 12 months preceding the expiration of such tender offer and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this Section has been made, and

10.04(e)
10.04(g)
Expiration Time
(i)
the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) at the Expiration Time multiplied by the Current Market Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Time, and
(ii)
the denominator of which shall be the sum of (x) the fair market value (determined as aforesaid) of the aggregate consideration payable to stockholders based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender offer) of all shares validly tendered and not withdrawn as of the Expiration Time (the shares deemed so accepted, up to any such maximum, being referred to as the ) and (y) the product of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (less any Purchased Shares) on the Expiration Time and the Current Market Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Time.
Purchased Shares
Such reduction (if any) shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the Expiration Time. In the event that the Company or any such Subsidiary, as the case may be, is obligated to purchase shares pursuant to any such tender offer, but the Company or any such Subsidiary, as the case may be, is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases or all such purchases are rescinded, the Conversion Price shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Price which would then be in effect if such tender offer had not been made.
