Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.
Reports First-Quarter 2003 Results
-
Continued Strong Operating and Financial Performance
-
Completion of $1.075 Billion in Financing Transactions
- New Common Stock Cash Dividend Policy
HIGHLIGHTS
First-quarter 2003 net income of $49.2 million, $0.33 per share compared with first-quarter 2002 net loss of $4.2 million, $0.03 per share.
Average unit net cash production costs including gold and silver credits: $0.07 per pound for first-quarter 2003 vs. $0.30 per pound for first-quarter 2002; at current gold prices of $325 per ounce, our gold credits would essentially offset our cash production cost, resulting in net cash production costs of approximately zero cents per pound for the year 2003.
First-quarter 2003 operating cash flows, net of $97.4 million in working capital requirements, total $49.2 million.  Full year operating cash flows (at current prices of $0.73 per pound of copper and $325 per ounce of gold) would be expected to approximate $575 million.
Completion of two senior note offerings for gross proceeds of $1.075 billion in first quarter significantly enhances financial flexibility and liquidity position.
Board authorized a new common stock cash dividend policy of $0.36 per share annually.  Initial quarterly dividend of $0.09 per share payable on May 1, 2003.
a)
First-quarter 2003 cumulative effect adjustment reflects adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," effective January 1, 2003, and first-quarter 2002 cumulative effect adjustment reflects an accounting change for depreciation of mining and milling assets, effective January 1, 2002.
b)
Diluted net income per share for first-quarter 2003 reflects assumed conversion of FCX's 8 1/4% Convertible Senior Notes, resulting in the exclusion of $12.7 million of interest expense and the inclusion of 42.2 million common shares.  The convertible notes had no diliutive effect in the 2002 period.
NEW ORLEANS, LA, April 17, 2003 -- Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (NYSE: FCX) reported first-quarter 2003 net income applicable to common stock of $49.2 million, $0.33 per share, including a gain for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $9.1 million, $0.05 per share, compared with a first-quarter 2002 net loss of $4.2 million, $0.03 per share, including a charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $3.0 million, $0.02 per share.
In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, FCX has adopted Statement of Financial Standards (SFAS) No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," requiring it to record the fair value of its asset retirement obligations using a prescribed methodology that requires FCX to consider assumptions about future inflation rates, interest rates used to discount the obligation to present value and market risk premiums.  The fair value of FCX's net asset retirement obligations and related asset costs determined pursuant to SFAS No. 143 was less than amounts previously accrued and as a result, FCX's first-quarter 2003 earnings include a one-time $9.1 million gain, $0.05 per share, reflecting the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle.
Mr. James R. Moffett, Chairman and CEO of FCX, said,  "Our first quarter results reflect the continued excellent performance of our Grasberg operations.  The strength of our asset base was demonstrated by the successful completion of over $1 billion in financing transactions during the quarter, which significantly enhanced our financial position.  The combination of our high quality asset base, our enhanced financial flexibility and strong cash flow generating capacity enable us to deliver real value to our shareholders."
PT Freeport Indonesia (PT-FI) PRODUCTION AND SALES   
PT-FI, FCX's Indonesian mining unit, reported improved copper production and sales in the 2003 quarter, reflecting the continued mining of higher-grade ore which began late in the second quarter of 2002.  First-quarter 2003 copper ore grades averaged 1.15 percent, compared with 0.90 percent in the first quarter of 2002.  Copper recovery rates also improved to 88.4 percent for the first quarter of 2003, compared with 85.5 percent for the first quarter of 2002.
 Gold production and sales for the first quarter of 2003 also reflect higher ore grades and mill recovery rates over the year-ago period.  In the first quarter of 2003, ore milled averaged 1.26 grams per metric ton (g/t), compared with 0.73 g/t in the first quarter of 2002.  Gold recovery rates improved to 86.2 percent for the first quarter of 2003, compared with 85.5 percent for the first quarter of 2002.  
PT-FI completed its ramp-up of production at the Deep Ore Zone (DOZ) underground mine to 35,000 metric tons of ore per day during the quarter.  New records were established in underground mining with average production totaling approximately 50,000 metric tons of ore per day from the Intermediate Ore Zone and DOZ mines, representing 21 percent of mill throughput.  Studies are ongoing to evaluate additional low-cost expansion options for the DOZ underground operation.  
PT-FI expects its sales for 2003 to approximate 1.4 billion pounds of copper and 2.6 million ounces of gold, reflecting the expectation in 2003 of slightly lower copper ore grades and higher gold ore grades on an annual basis compared with 2002.  PT-FI expects its sales for the second quarter of 2003 to approximate 360 million pounds of copper and 700,000 ounces of gold.
At March 31, 2003, FCX's concentrate sales included 164.3 million pounds of copper, priced at an average of $0.72 per pound, that remain subject to final pricing over the next several months.  Each $0.01 change in the price realized from the March 31 price would result in an approximate $0.8 million, $0.004 per share, effect on FCX's 2003 net income. First-quarter 2003 adjustments to concentrate sales recognized in prior quarters increased revenues by $10.2 million ($5.2 million to net income, $0.03 per share) compared with an increase of $5.8 million ($3.0 million to net income, $0.02 per share) in the first quarter of 2002.
NET CASH PRODUCTION COSTS
(1)
  
 
(1) For a reconciliation of net cash production costs per pound to costs applicable to sales reported in FCX's consolidated financial statements refer to the attached presentation, "Product Revenues and Production Costs."
PT-FI remains the world's lowest cost copper producer with average unit net cash production costs, including gold and silver credits, of $0.07 per pound of copper during the first quarter of 2003, compared with $0.30 per pound for the 2002 period.  Unit production and delivery costs decreased because of improved ore grades for copper, while gold credits improved because of improved ore grades for gold and higher gold prices.  Assuming current gold prices of $325 per ounce for the remainder of 2003 and gold sales of 2.6 million ounces for 2003, we would expect to establish a new record low for unit annual net cash production costs of approximately zero cents per pound.  Net unit cash costs would change approximately $0.04 per pound for each $25 per ounce change in the average price of gold for the remainder of the year.
  
SMELTER OPERATIONS
As the world's single largest producer and supplier of custom concentrate, FCX's investment in smelters serves an important role in its concentrate marketing strategy.  Approximately one-half of PT-FI's concentrate production is sold to its affiliated smelters, Atlantic Copper and PT Smelting, and the remainder is sold to other customers.  Through downstream integration, FCX assures placement of a significant portion of its concentrate production and operating hedges for treatment and refining charges.  While currently low smelter treatment and refining charges adversely affect the operating results of FCX's smelter operations, they benefit operating results of its mining operations.  Taking into account taxes and minority ownership interests, an equivalent $0.01 per pound change in smelting and refining charge rates substantially offset in FCX's consolidated operating results.  
Atlantic Copper, FCX's wholly owned Spanish smelting unit, treated 242,100 metric tons of concentrates and scrap in the first quarter of 2003, compared with 258,300 metric tons in the year-ago period.  Unit cathode cash production costs totaled $0.15per pound in the first quarter of 2003 and $0.10 per pound for the year-ago period.  Unit costs were adversely affected by a stronger euro/US$ exchange rate.  Atlantic Copper reported operating income of $0.4 million for the first quarter of 2003, compared with $1.3 million in the 2002 period.  The treatment charges Atlantic Copper receives remained at historically low levels, averaging $0.17 per pound during the first quarter of 2003 and $0.18 per pound during the first quarter of 2002.  Changes in the amount of deferred profits on intercompany sales in inventories resulted in reductions to FCX's net income totaling $1.0 million, $0.01 per share, in the first quarter of 2003, comp ared with additions to net income totaling $3.4 million, $0.02 per share, in the first quarter of 2002.  
FCX recognized a $2.5 million, $0.01 per share, non-cash charge in the first quarter of 2003 as a result of the effect of the stronger euro on Atlantic Copper's net euro-denominated liabilities, compared with a $0.6 million, less than $0.01 per share, non-cash gain in the first quarter of 2002.  The exchange rate effects of Atlantic Copper's operating cost euro hedges are reported as a component of shareholders' equity, not net income, until realized.  The realized gains (losses) on these hedges totaled $1.6 million, $0.01 per share, in the first quarter of 2003 and $(1.3) million, $0.01 per share, in the first quarter of 2002.  The unrealized hedges resulted in positive adjustments to stockholders' equity totaling $1.1 million, $0.01 per share, in the first quarter of 2003 and negative adjustments of $1.1 million, $0.01 per share, for the year-ago period.  
PT Smelting, PT-FI's 25 percent-owned Indonesian smelting unit treated 212,300 metric tons of concentrates in the first quarter of 2003, compared with 177,700 metric tons in the year-ago period.  PT Smelting's copper cathode cash production costs per pound totaled $0.10per pound in the first quarter of 2003 and $0.12per pound in the year-ago period.  PT-FI's equity interest in PT Smelting's earnings totaled $0.7 million, $0.004 per share, for the first quarter of 2003 compared to a net loss of $0.8 million, $0.006 per share, in the 2002 quarter.
SENIOR NOTE OFFERINGS, CASH FLOW and FINANCIAL POSITION
FCX significantly enhanced its financial position, flexibility and debt maturity profile during the quarter with the placement of two senior note offerings.  On January 29, 2003, FCX sold $500 million of         10 % Senior Notes due 2010 and on February 11, 2003 sold $575 million of 7% Convertible Senior Notes due 2011.  FCX received aggregate net proceeds of approximately $1.046 billion in the private placements, after deducting the initial purchasers' discounts and expenses.  FCX used a portion of the proceeds to repay all amounts owed under its bank credit facilities, bringing total repayments under these facilities to over $1 billion during the last two years.  FCX has established an interim credit facility totaling $150 million with JPMorgan.  This facility is expected to remain undrawn and to be replaced with a new facility during 2003.
As of March 31, 2003, FCX had total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $762.7 million.  In April 2003, FCX completed tender offers on its 7.20% Senior Notes due 2026 and its 7.50% Senior Notes due 2006.  Of the $450.0 million outstanding at March 31, 2003, notes with a face amount of $233.9 million were tendered for $238.9 million cash.  FCX expects to record a $4.7 million charge to net income in the second quarter of 2003 associated with these early extinguishments of debt.  FCX is currently reviewing options for repaying other obligations prior to their maturity which could result in the recognition of losses and gains in future periods.  
First quarter operating cash flows of $49.2 million were net of $97.4 million in uses of cash for working capital requirements.  At current copper and gold prices of $0.73 per pound and $325 per ounce, respectively, FCX estimates that its operating cash flows for 2003 would approximate $575 million.  Capital expenditures totaled $30.1 million in the first quarter and are estimated to total approximately $160 million for the year 2003.
After the estimated repayment of $975 million of our 2003 debt maturities and other debt prepayments (assuming copper and gold prices of $0.73 per pound and $325 per ounce of gold for the remainder of the year), FCX's cash position at year-end 2003 is expected to approximate $460 million, bringing net debt and mandatorily redeemable preferred stock to $2.0 billion (approximately $375 million lower than the year-end 2002 amount).  Each $0.10 change in copper prices and each $25 change in gold prices for the remainder of the year would impact these estimates by approximately $50 and $25 million respectively.
FCX explores for, develops, mines and processes ore containing copper, gold and silver in Indonesia, and smelts and refines copper concentrates in Spain and Indonesia.  Additional information on FCX is available on our Internet website .

NET CASH PRODUCTION COSTS
Net cash production costs per pound of copper is a measure intended to provide investors with information about the cash generating capacity of our mining operations in Indonesia.  This measure is presented by other copper and gold mining companies, although our measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
We calculate gross profit per pound of copper under a "by-product" method, while the copper, gold and silver contained within our concentrates are treated as co-products in our financial statements.  We use the by-product method in our presentation of gross profit per pound of copper because (1) we believe the market views us as a copper company, (2) we produce and sell one product, concentrates, which contains all three metals and (3) there is no objective basis for specifically assigning our costs to revenues from the copper, gold and silver we produce in concentrates.  In the co-product method presentation below, we have allocated costs to the different products based on their relative revenue values.  Presentations under both methods are presented below along with a reconciliation to amounts reported in FCX's consolidated financial statements.
                                                                                                                                                                        ;                                                   VI
 
ATLANTIC COPPER CATHODE CASH PRODUCTION COST PER POUND OF COPPER
Cathode cash production cost per pound of copper is a measure intended to provide investors with information about the costs associated with our smelting operations in Spain.  Other smelting companies present this measure, although our measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
Below is a reconciliation of our smelting and refining segment production costs reported in FCX's consolidated financial statements to the production costs used to calculate our cathode cash production cost per pound of copper (in thousands, except per pound amounts):
 
PT SMELTING CATHODE CASH PRODUCTION COST PER POUND OF COPPER
Cathode cash production cost per pound of copper is a measure intended to provide investors with information about the costs associated with our 25 percent-owned smelting operations in Indonesia.  Other smelting companies present this measure, although our measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
Below is a reconciliation of the production costs used to calculate PT Smelting's cathode cash production cost per pound of copper to our equity in PT Smelting earnings (losses) reported in FCX's consolidated financial statements (in thousands, except per pound amounts):
NET DEBT
Net Debt is a measure intended to provide investors with information about FCX's leverage position after considering available cash and investment balances that are available for or committed to reducing outstanding debt.  Below is a reconciliation of total debt as reported in FCX's consolidated financial statements to Net Debt (in millions):
(1)
Although not classified as debt, because of the mandatory redemption feature of these instruments we consider them to be like debt for purposes of this presentation.
(2)
Amounts not available for debt repayment because we have committed these funds to paying for future reclamation and closure costs at our Indonesian mining operations.
