In connection with an investor conference on September 12, 2003, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (NYSE: FCX) management will update investors on the company's operations and significant debt reduction activities completed during the third quarter of 2003.  The presentation materials have been posted on the company's website at www.fcx.com.
FCX's results continue to benefit from strong operating performance and are on track to meet annual sales projections of 1.4 billion pounds of copper and 2.6 million ounces of gold, 320 million pounds of copper and 640,000 ounces of gold for the third quarter.  At current gold prices approximating $375 per ounce, FCX's unit cash production costs, net of gold and silver credits, are expected to average a net credit of 5 cents per pound for 2003.  Operating cash flows in 2003 are expected to exceed $600 million and capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $160 million.  
As previously reported, during the first quarter of 2003, FCX issued $500 million of 10.125% Senior Notes due 2010 and $575 million of 7% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2011 convertible at $30.87 per share, which represented a 70% premium to the price of FCX's common shares on the date of issuance.  Subsequently, FCX has taken the following steps to strengthen its financial position, as previously announced:
o
Repaid $279 million under its bank credit facilities
o
Repurchased $310 million of Senior Notes due 2026 (puttable in 2003) and 2006
o
Purchased 85.7 percent interest in PT-FI's power project for $78 million, reducing consolidated debt by $55 million
o
Redeemed the Gold-Denominated Preferred Stock, Series I for $211 million, reducing consolidated debt by $233 million
o
Negotiated the early conversion of $311 million of 8% Convertible Senior Notes using restricted cash held in escrow for payment of future interest on these notes
The debt reduction amounts included above total $1.2 billion.  FCX's unrestricted cash position approximated $465 million as of September 11, 2003.
As previously announced, FCX expects its third-quarter results will include an approximate net charge of $13 million to net income ($0.08 per average basic share outstanding), resulting from a $25 million expense for the early conversion of $311 million of 8% Convertible Senior Notes, and a $12 million after-tax gain on the August 1 redemption of the Gold-Denominated Preferred Stock, Series I.
In addition, FCX adopted SFAS No. 150 on July 1, 2003, requiring it to classify its mandatory redeemable commodity-linked preferred stock as debt.  FCX's third quarter results will include a one-time $25 million charge to net income ($0.16 per average basic share outstanding) as a cumulative effect for a change in accounting principle to record the amortization of the original issuance costs for these securities.
