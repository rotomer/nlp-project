HIGHLIGHTS
Third-quarter 2003 net income of $55.9 million, $0.33 per share, after $37.6 million, $0.19 per share, of net charges for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, the early extinguishment of debt and redemption of preferred stock, compared with third-quarter 2002 net income of $61.5 million, $0.39 per share.
Third quarter sales volumes of 345 million pounds of copper and 763,500 ounces of gold exceeded previous estimates by approximately 25 million pounds and 120,000 ounces, respectively.  
Third quarter unit cash production costs, net of gold and silver credits, were a net credit of $0.16 per pound and a net credit of $0.08 per pound for the nine months ended September 30, 2003.
Annual sales volumes for 2003, after estimated effect of reduced fourth quarter production from recent slippage event in section of Grasberg pit, expected to approximate 1.33 billion pounds of copper and 2.45 million ounces of gold, approximately 70 million pounds and 150,000 ounces lower than prior 2003 estimates.
Third-quarter 2003 operating cash flows totaled $220.7 million and for the nine months ended September 30, 2003, totaled $504.8 million.  Assuming copper prices of $0.80 per pound and gold prices of $375 per ounce in the fourth quarter, full year 2003 operating cash flows estimated to approximate $575 million.
Total debt of $2.3 billion at September 30, 2003, and approximately $1.7 billion net of cash and restricted investments, reflects year to date reductions of approximately $643 million, including change in cash and restricted investments.
Cash and cash equivalents of $528.6 million at September 30, 2003.  
Board of Directors authorized an increase in common stock dividend from an annual rate of $0.36 per share to $0.80 per share.  Board also authorized a new 20 million share open market purchase program.
 
NEW ORLEANS, LA, October 16, 2003 -- Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (NYSE: FCX) reported third-quarter 2003 net income applicable to common stock (inclusive of items discussed below aggregating in a net reduction of $37.6 million, $0.19 per share), of $55.9 million, $0.33 per share, compared with third-quarter 2002 net income of $61.5 million, $0.39 per share.  Net income for the third quarter of 2003 was reduced by $24.7 million ($0.13 per share) for the cumulative effect of a required change in the accounting for issuance costs of redeemable preferred stock now classified as debt and $25.1 million ($0.13 per share) in charges related to the early extinguishments of debt.  Third quarter net income benefited from a $12.2 million gain ($0.06 per share) on the redemption of Gold-and Silver-Denominated Preferred Stock.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2003, FCX reported net income applicable to common stock of $162.5 million, $1.03 per share, including net charges for the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles of $15.6 million, $0.08 per share, compared with net income of $63.0 million, $0.43 per share, including a charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $3.0 million, $0.02 per share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2002.
a)
Includes losses on the early extinguishment and conversion of debt related to the conversion of FCX's 8
% Convertible Senior Notes and other debt extinguishments totaling $25.1 million ($0.13 per share) in the third quarter of 2003 and $29.9 million ($0.16 per share) in the first nine months of 2003.  Third-quarter 2003 and nine-month 2003 also include gains totaling $12.2 million ($0.06 per share) on the redemption of Gold- and Silver-Denominated Preferred Stock.
b)
Third-quarter 2003 cumulative effect adjustment reflects a $24.7 million charge for adoption of SFAS No. 150,"Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Debt,"  effective July 1, 2003, and nine-month 2003 also reflects a $9.1 million gain for adoption of SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," effective January 1, 2003.  Nine-month 2002 cumulative effect adjustment reflects a $3.0 million charge for an accounting change for depreciation of mining and milling assets, effective January 1, 2002.
c)
Diluted net income per share reflects assumed conversion of FCX's 8
% Convertible Senior Notes, resulting in the exclusion of interest expense, net of tax, totaling $8.4 million in the third quarter of 2003, $12.6 million in the third quarter of 2002 and $33.8 million in the first nine months of 2003, and the inclusion of 31.1 million common shares in the third quarter of 2003, 42.2 million common shares in the third quarter of 2002 and 38.5 million common shares in the first nine months of 2003.  
Mr. James R. Moffett, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of FCX, and Richard C. Adkerson, President and Chief Financial Officer said, "Our third quarter and nine month results demonstrate the cash flow generating capacity of our high volume, low cost operations.  Our recent Board action to increase our common dividend and authorize an expanded share purchase program will allow us to return a portion of our available cash flow to shareholders while we continue to reduce our debt.  These measures are consistent with our ability to generate significant cash flows in excess of our capital expenditures and debt service requirements.  We will continue to take actions to maintain a strong financial position which will benefit both our shareholders and investors in our debt securities."
 
PT Freeport Indonesia (PT-FI) PRODUCTION AND SALES
 
a)
Amounts were $367.72 in the third quarter of 2003 and $353.92 in the first nine months of 2003 before hedging gains resulting from redemption of FCX's Gold-Denominated Preferred Stock.
PT-FI, FCX's Indonesian mining unit, reported lower mill throughput rates reflecting the mining of harder ore at the Grasberg open pit.  Mill throughput averaged 211,400 metric tons of ore per day in the third quarter of 2003 compared with 219,800 metric tons of ore in the third quarter of 2002.  Mill throughput rates vary based on the characteristics of the ore being processed as PT-FI manages its operations to optimize metal production.  
PT-FI's third-quarter copper production and sales were higher than previous estimates but were lower than the 2002 period, reflecting the mining of lower-grade ore than was mined during the third quarter of 2002.  Third-quarter 2003 copper ore grades averaged 1.08 percent, compared with 1.31 percent in the third quarter of 2002.  Copper recovery rates were 90.0 percent for the third quarter of 2003, compared with 90.8 percent for the third quarter of 2002.  Copper realized prices improved by 21 percent to $0.81 per pound in the third quarter of 2003 from $0.67 in the third quarter of 2002.  Current LME copper prices approximate $0.88 per pound.
Gold production and sales for the third quarter of 2003 were also higher than previously estimated but were lower than the year-ago period primarily because of lower grades and recoveries.  In the third quarter of 2003, ore milled averaged 1.79 grams of gold per metric ton (g/t), compared with 1.85 g/t in the third quarter of 2002.  Gold recovery rates declined to 88.5 percent for the third quarter of 2003, compared with 90.1 percent for the third quarter of 2002.  Gold realized prices, before hedging, improved by 17 percent to $367.72 per ounce in the third quarter of 2003 from $314.19 per ounce in the third quarter of 2002.
Third-quarter 2003 sales exceeded previous quarterly estimates primarily because of the timing of mining ore previously forecast to be mined in the fourth quarter of 2003.  As a result of the slippage in the Grasberg open pit, PT-FI has revised its fourth-quarter 2003 estimates and expects its sales for 2003 to approximate 1.33 billion pounds of copper and 2.45 million ounces of gold, with sales for the fourth quarter of 2003 estimated to approximate 200 million pounds of copper and 250,000 ounces of gold.  These estimates are subject to change depending on the timing of restoring access to higher grade sections of the Grasberg pit.  
As previously reported, a slippage of material in a section of the Grasberg open pit occurred on October 9, 2003.  Regrettably, two fatalities were confirmed, six workers are missing and are presumed to have perished and five were injured.  The search effort continues as our highest priority, in conjunction with activities to ensure stability in the area of the slippage.  Clean-up activities to restore access to the affected areas of the pit have commenced and are currently anticipated to be completed during the fourth quarter.  The causes of the accident continue to be studied.  PT-FI is currently conducting operations in the sections of the Grasberg pit unaffected by the slippage and in its underground operations, milling facilities, and concentrate shipping operations.  The area affected by the slippage, comprising approximately five percent of the surface area of the massive Grasberg pit, i ncludes two active mining areas which were scheduled to be mined in the fourth quarter of 2003, resulting in a deferral to future periods.  The event is not expected to affect long-term mine plans and production rates.  
Production from PT-FI's Deep Ore Zone (DOZ) underground mine averaged 42,600 metric tons of ore per day during the third quarter of 2003, representing 20 percent of third-quarter 2003 mill throughput.  DOZ operations continue to perform above design capacity of 35,000 metric tons of ore per day and studies are ongoing to evaluate additional low-cost options to increase production from the DOZ underground operation.  The Intermediate Ore Zone (IOZ) underground mine was depleted during the third quarter of 2003.  During its approximate 10-year life, the IOZ operation produced almost 30 percent more copper and gold than the initial reserve estimate.
At September 30, 2003, FCX's concentrate sales included 155.6 million pounds of copper, priced at an average of $0.81 per pound, that remain subject to final pricing over the next several months.  Each $0.01 change in the price realized from the September 30 price would result in an approximate $0.8 million, $0.004 per share, effect on FCX's 2003 net income. Third-quarter 2003 adjustments to concentrate sales recognized in prior quarters increased revenues by $8.3 million ($4.3 million to net income, $0.02 per share) compared with a decrease of $10.3 million ($5.3 million to net income, $0.03 per share) in the third quarter of 2002.
NET CASH PRODUCTION COSTS   
(1)
(1) For a reconciliation of net cash production costs per pound to production and delivery costs applicable to sales reported in FCX's consolidated financial statements refer to the attached presentation, "Product Revenues and Production Costs."
PT-FI maintained its cost-leading position with average unit net cash production costs, including gold and silver credits, of a net credit of $(0.16) per pound of copper during the third quarter of 2003, compared with a net credit of $(0.10) per pound for the 2002 quarter.  Unit production and delivery costs increased from the prior year period primarily because of lower sales volumes.  Higher mine maintenance costs, stronger Indonesian and Australian currencies and higher energy costs also resulted in higher costs compared with last year's third quarter.  Gold credits improved primarily because of higher gold prices.  Assuming gold prices of $375 per ounce for the fourth quarter of 2003 and gold sales of 2.45 million ounces for 2003, we expect our gold credits would essentially offset our cash production cost per pound of copper for the year.
  
SMELTER OPERATIONS
Atlantic Copper, FCX's wholly owned Spanish smelting unit, treated 253,000 metric tons of concentrates and scrap in the third quarter of 2003, compared with 258,200 metric tons in the year-ago period.  Unit cathode cash production costs totaled $0.15per pound in the third quarter of 2003 and $0.12 per pound for the year-ago period.  Unit costs were adversely affected by a stronger euro/US$ exchange rate, which added $0.02 per pound to Atlantic Copper's third-quarter 2003 unit costs compared with third-quarter 2002 unit costs.  Atlantic Copper reported an operating loss of $5.0 million for the third quarter of 2003, compared with operating income of $1.5 million in the 2002 period.  Treatment charges received by Atlantic Copper remained at historically low levels, averaging $0.16 per pound during the third quarter of 2003 and $0.18 per pound during the third quarter of 2002.
FCX recognized a non-cash charge totaling $1.5 million, $0.01 per share, in the third quarter of 2003 as a result of the effect on Atlantic Copper's net euro-denominated liabilities from the euro strengthening from $1.14 per euro to $1.17 per euro, compared with a gain of $1.7 million, $0.01 per share, in the third quarter of 2002.  Atlantic Copper's current euro hedges, the effects of which are recognized in income when realized, cover approximately 60 percent of its projected fourth quarter euro disbursements at an average rate of $1.03 per euro.
PT Smelting, PT-FI's 25 percent-owned Indonesian smelting unit, treated 209,900 metric tons of concentrates in the third quarter of 2003, compared with 192,200 metric tons in the year-ago period.  PT Smelting reported a quarterly production record of 125.2 million pounds of cathodes and sold 123.6 million pounds of cathodes.  Cathode production totaled 91.5 million pounds and sales totaled 95.5 million pounds during the third quarter of 2002.  PT Smelting's copper cathode cash production costs per pound totaled $0.10per pound in the third quarter of 2003 and $0.12per pound in the year-ago period.  PT-FI's equity interest in PT Smelting's earnings totaled $1.3 million, $0.01 per share, for the third quarter of 2003 compared to a net loss of $1.9 million, $0.01 per share, in the 2002 quarter.
FCX defers recognition of profits on PT-FI's sales to Atlantic Copper and on 25 percent of PT-FI's sales to PT Smelting until the final sale to third parties occurs.  Changes to these net deferrals resulted in additions to FCX's net income totaling $10.0 million, $0.05 per share, in the third quarter of 2003, compared with a reduction of $20.9 million, $0.11 per share, in the third quarter of 2002.
While currently low smelter treatment and refining charges adversely affect the operating results of FCX's smelter operations, they benefit operating results of FCX's mining operations.  Approximately one-half of PT-FI's concentrate production is sold to its affiliated smelters, Atlantic Copper and PT Smelting, and the remainder is sold to other customers.  Considering taxes and minority ownership interest, an equivalent change in smelting and refining rates substantially offset in FCX's consolidated operating results.
CASH FLOW and DEBT REDUCTIONS
Operating cash flows for the first nine months of 2003 totaled $504.8 million.  Assuming fourth quarter copper and gold prices of $0.80 per pound and $375 per ounce, respectively, FCX estimates that its operating cash flows for 2003 would approximate $575 million.  Capital expenditures totaled $96.3 million in the first nine months of 2003 and are estimated to total approximately $160 million for the year 2003.
As of September 30, 2003 FCX had $528.6 million in cash and cash equivalents.  Total debt, which includes mandatorily redeemable preferred stock, totaled $2.29 billion at September 30, 2003, and approximately $1.73 billion net of cash and restricted investments.  The net reduction of debt, including the change in cash and restricted investments, was $468 million in the third quarter and $643 million since the beginning of the year.  Assuming fourth quarter copper and gold prices of $0.80 per pound and $375 per ounce, respectively, FCX estimates total debt, net of cash and restricted investments, will approximate $1.75 billion at year end 2003.  Upon the adoption of SFAS No. 150 on July 1, 2003, FCX's mandatorily redeemable preferred stock was reclassified as debt and FCX recorded a cumulative effect adjustment for the amortization of $24.7 million ($0.13 per share) of original issuance costs relat ed to the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock.  
During the third quarter, FCX completed a number of transactions to improve its balance sheet:
In August 2003, FCX negotiated the early conversion of approximately 51% of its 8% convertible senior notes, which resulted in a $311.1 million reduction in debt.  The holders converted their notes into 21.76 million shares of FCX common stock and received $23.0 million in cash from restricted cash held in escrow for payment of future interest on these notes.  FCX recorded charges totaling $24.7 million ($24.2 million to net income or $0.12 per share) related to the conversion of its 8% convertible senior notes.  At September 30, 2003, FCX had $292.6 million in 8% convertible senior notes remained outstanding.  The notes are callable beginning in August 2004.
On August 1, 2003, FCX redeemed its 6.0 million shares of Gold-Denominated Preferred Stock for $210.5 million and partially redeemed its Silver-Denominated Preferred Stock for $10.8 million.  The mandatory redemptions resulted in a $245.1 million decrease in debt and a hedging gain to revenues of $23.8 million ($12.2 million to net income or $0.06 per share) for the third quarter of 2003.   
In July 2003, FCX purchased $76.0 million of its 7.2% Senior Notes for $77.2 million and recorded a $1.3 million, $0.9 million to net income ($0.005 per share) charge for early extinguishment of debt.  Through September 30, 2003, FCX has purchased 7.20% Senior Notes and 7.50% Senior Notes with a total face amount of $310.0 million.  In July 2003, FCX also purchased an 85.7 percent interest in PT-FI's power project owned by a third party for $78 million, reducing consolidated debt by $54.0 million.
In October 2003, FCX and PT-FI entered into an amended revolving credit facility.  The amended credit facility provides a commitment of $165.0 million, which may be increased to $350 million with additional lender commitments, and a maturity date of September 2006.  FCX recorded charges totaling $5.6 million ($3.7 million to net income or $0.02 per share) in the third quarter of 2003 for deferred financing costs related to the prior credit facility.
NEW DIVIDEND POLICY AND SHARE PURCHASE AUTHORIZATION
FCX's Board of Directors authorized an increase in the common stock dividends from an annual rate of $0.36 per share to $0.80 per share.  The Board also approved a new open market share purchase program authorizing open market purchases totaling 20 million shares.  The timing of future purchases is dependent upon many factors including the company's operating results, cash flow and financial position, the market price of the common shares and general economic and market conditions.
FCX explores for, develops, mines and processes ore containing copper, gold and silver in Indonesia, and smelts and refines copper concentrates in Spain and Indonesia.  Additional information on FCX is available on our Internet website .

NET CASH PRODUCTION COSTS
Net cash production costs per pound of copper is a measure intended to provide investors with information about the cash generating capacity of our mining operations in Indonesia.  This measure is presented by other copper and gold mining companies, although our measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
We calculate gross profit per pound of copper under a "by-product" method, while the copper, gold and silver contained within our concentrates are treated as co-products in our financial statements.  We use the by-product method in our presentation of gross profit per pound of copper because (1) the majority of our revenues are copper revenues, (2) we produce and sell one product, concentrates, which contains all three metals and (3) it is not possible to specifically assign our costs to revenues from the copper, gold and silver we produce in concentrates.  In the co-product method presentation below, costs are allocated to the different products based on their relative revenue values.  Presentations under both methods are presented below along with a reconciliation to amounts reported in FCX's consolidated financial statements.
 
 
 
ATLANTIC COPPER CATHODE CASH PRODUCTION COST PER POUND OF COPPER
Atlantic Copper cathode cash production cost per pound of copper is a measure intended to provide investors with information about the costs associated with our smelting operations in Spain.  Other smelting companies present this measure, although our measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
 
Below is a reconciliation of our smelting and refining segment production costs reported in FCX's consolidated financial statements to the production costs used to calculate our cathode cash production cost per pound of copper (in thousands, except per pound amounts):
PT SMELTING CATHODE CASH PRODUCTION COST PER POUND OF COPPER
PT Smelting cathode cash production cost per pound of copper is a measure intended to provide investors with information about the costs associated with our 25 percent-owned smelting operations in Indonesia.  Other smelting companies present this measure, although our measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
 
Below is a reconciliation of the production costs used to calculate PT Smelting's cathode cash production cost per pound of copper to our equity in PT Smelting earnings (losses) reported in FCX's consolidated financial statements (in thousands, except per pound amounts):
 
PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES
PT Freeport Indonesia's Contract of Work provides for a 35 percent corporate income tax rate, and the tax treaty between Indonesia and the United States provides for a withholding tax of 10 percent on dividends and interest that PT Freeport Indonesia pays to the FCX parent company.  FCX also incurs a U.S. alternative minimum tax at a rate of 2 percent based primarily on consolidated income, net of smelting and refining results.  FCX currently records no income taxes at Atlantic Copper, which is subject to taxation in Spain, because it has not generated significant taxable income in recent years and has substantial tax loss carry forwards for which FCX has provided no financial statement benefit.
 
FCX receives minimal tax benefit from costs incurred by the parent company, primarily because it generates no taxable income from U.S. sources.  FCX also currently receives no tax benefit from losses in its smelting and refining segment because those losses cannot be used to offset PT Freeport Indonesia's profits in Indonesia.  Thus, the percentage of provision for income taxes to consolidated income before income taxes and minority interest will decrease as PT Freeport Indonesia's income increases and vice versa absent changes in Atlantic Copper and parent company costs.  Parent company costs consist primarily of interest, depreciation and amortization, and general and administrative expenses.  Summaries of the significant components of the calculation of the consolidated provision for income taxes are shown below (in thousands, except percentages).
