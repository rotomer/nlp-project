(c)
(i)If a holder of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock exercises conversion rights, such shares will cease to accumulate dividends as of the end of the day immediately preceding the Conversion Date.On conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock, except for conversion during the period from the close of business on any Record Date corresponding to a Dividend Payment Date to the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding such Dividend Payment Date, in which case the holder on such Dividend Record Date shall receive the dividends payable on such Dividend Payment Date, accumulated and unpaid dividends on the converted share of Convertible Preferred Stock shall not be cancelled, extinguished or forfeited, but rather shall be deemed to be paid in full to the holder thereof through delivery of the Common Stock (together with the cash payment, if any, in lieu of fractional shares) in exchange for the Convertible Preferred Stock being converted pursuant to the provisions hereof.  On conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock, Liquidated Damages, if any, accrued and unpaid to the Conversion Date, shall be paid in full to the holder thereof in exchange for the Convertible Preferred Stock being converted pursuant to the provisions hereof.  Shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion after the close of business on any Record Date for the payment of dividends declared and before the opening of business on the Dividend Payment Date corresponding to that Record Date must be accompanied by a payment to the Corporation in cash of an amount equal to the dividend payable (excluding any Liquidated Damages) in respect of those shares on such Dividend Payment Date; that a holder of shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock on a Record Date who converts such shares into shares of Common Stock on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date shall be entitled to receive the dividend payable (including any Liquidated Damages) on such shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock on such Dividend Payment Date, and such holder need not include payment to the Corporation of the amount of such dividend (including any Liquidated Damages) upon surrender of shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock for conversion.
Dividend and Other Payments Upon Conversion.  
 
provided
(ii)
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock are converted during the period between the close of business on any Record Date and the opening of business on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date and the Corporation has called such shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock for redemption during such period, or the Corporation has designated a Change of Control Purchase Date during such period, then, in each case, the holder who tenders such shares for conversion shall receive the dividend payable (including any Liquidated Damages) on such Dividend Payment Date and need not include payment of the amount of such dividend (including any Liquidated Damages) upon surrender of shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock for conversion.
(d)
In connection with the conversion of any shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock, no fractions of shares of Common Stock shall be issued, but the Corporation shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of any fractional interest in an amount equal to the fractional interest multiplied by the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Conversion Date, rounded to the nearest whole cent.
Fractional Shares.  
(e)
If more than one share of the Convertible Preferred Stock shall be surrendered for conversion by the same holder at the same time, the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of those shares shall be computed on the basis of the total number of shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock so surrendered.
Total Shares.  
(f)
The Corporation shall:
Reservation of Shares; Shares to be Fully Paid; Compliance with Governmental Requirements; Listing of Common Stock.  
(i)
at all times reserve and keep available, free from preemptive rights, for issuance upon the conversion of shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock such number of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to permit the conversion of all Outstanding shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock;
(ii)
prior to the delivery of any securities that the Corporation shall be obligated to deliver upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock, comply with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations that require action to be taken by the Corporation (including, without limitation, the registration or approval, if required, of any shares of Common Stock to be provided for the purpose of conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock hereunder); and
(iii) ensure that all shares of Common Stock delivered upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock will, upon delivery, be duly and validly issued and fully paid and nonassessable, free of all liens and charges and not subject to any preemptive rights.
 
8.
The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time by the Corporation in accordance with the provisions of this Section 8.  
Conversion Rate Adjustments.  
(a)
If the Corporation shall hereafter pay a dividend or make a distribution to all holders of the outstanding Common Stock in shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the date following the Record Date shall be increased by multiplying such Conversion Rate by a fraction,
(i)
the numerator of which shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on such Record Date and the total number of shares of Common Stock constituting such dividend or other distribution; and
(ii)
the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on such Record Date.
Such increase shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following such Record Date.  If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 8(a) is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
(b)
If the Corporation shall issue rights or warrants to all holders of any class of Common Stock entitling them (for a period expiring within forty-five (45) days after the Record Date to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into Common Stock) at a price per share (or having a conversion price per share) less than the Current Market Price on the Record Date, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to such Record Date by a fraction,
(i)
the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on such Record Date plus the total number of additional shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase (or into which the convertible securities so offered are convertible); and
(ii)
the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on such Record Date plus the number of shares which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares so offered for subscription or purchase (or the aggregate conversion price of the convertible securities so offered) would purchase at such Current Market Price.
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following such Record Date.  To the extent that shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into Common Stock) are not delivered pursuant to such rights or warrants, upon the expiration or termination of such rights or warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustment made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into Common Stock) actually delivered.  If such rights or warrants are not so issued, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such Record Date had not been fixed.  In determining whether any rights or warrants entitle the h olders to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at less than such Current Market Price, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Corporation for such rights or warrants and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, the Fair Market Value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive.
(c)
If the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision becomes effective shall be proportionately increased, and conversely, in the event outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such combination becomes effective shall be proportionately reduced, such increase or reduction, as the case may be, to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision or combination becomes effective.
(d)
If the Corporation shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock shares of any class of Capital Stock of the Corporation (other than any dividends or distributions to which Section 8(a) applies) or evidences of its indebtedness or assets (including securities, but excluding (i) any rights or warrants referred to in  or (ii) any dividend or distribution (x) paid exclusively in cash or (y) referred to in Section 8(a) or Section 8(g)) (any of the foregoing hereinafter referred to in this Section 8(d) as the ""), then, in each such case, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted so that the same shall be equal to the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect on the Record Date with respect to such distribution by a fraction,
Distributed Property
(i)
the numerator of which shall be the Current Market Price on such Record Date; and
(ii)
the denominator of which shall be the Current Market Price on such Record Date less the Fair Market Value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive, and described in a resolution of the Board of Directors) on such Record Date of the portion of the Distributed Property applicable to one share of Common Stock (determined on the basis of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding on such Record Date).
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following such Record Date; that if the then Fair Market Value (as so determined by the Board of Directors) of the portion of the Distributed Property applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than the Current Market Price on the Record Date, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each holder of Convertible Preferred Stock shall have the right to receive upon conversion the amount of Distributed Property such holder would have received had such holder converted each share of its Convertible Preferred Stock on the Record Date.  To the extent that any of the Distributed Property is not distributed, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustment made been made on the b asis of only the Distributed Property actually distributed.  If such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.  If the Board of Directors determines the Fair Market Value of any distribution for purposes of this Section 8(d) by reference to the trading market for any securities, it must in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period used in computing the Current Market Price on the applicable Record Date.
provided
Rights or warrants (including rights under the Corporation's Rights Agreement) distributed by the Corporation to all holders of Common Stock entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Corporation's Capital Stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events (""): (i) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of Common Stock; (ii) are not exercisable; and (iii) are also issued in respect of future issuances of Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this 8(d) (and no adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this 8(d) will be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event, whereupon such rights and warrants shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the Conversion Rate shall be made under this 8 (d).  If any such right or warrant, including any such existing rights or warrants distributed prior to the date of this Certificate, are subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights or warrants become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of indebtedness or other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and record date with respect to new rights or warrants with such rights (and a termination or expiration of the existing rights or warrants without exercise by any of the holders thereof).  In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in the preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 8(d) was made, (1) in the case of any such rights or warrants that shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted upon such final redemption or repurchase to give effect to such distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder or holders of Common Stock with respect to such rights or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights or warrants), made to all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase, and (2) in the case of such rights or warrants that shall have expired or been terminated without exercise thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such expired or terminated rights and warrants had not been issued.
Trigger Event
For purposes of this Section 8(d), Section 8(a) and Section 8(b), any dividend or distribution to which this Section 8(d) is applicable that also includes shares of Common Stock, or rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock (or both), shall be deemed instead to be (1) a dividend or distribution of the evidences of indebtedness, assets or shares of Capital Stock other than such shares of Common Stock or rights or warrants, as to which any Conversion Rate adjustment required by this Section 8(d) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made, immediately followed by (2) a dividend or distribution of such shares of Common Stock or such rights or warrants, as to which any further Conversion Rate adjustment required by Sections 8(a) and 8(b) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made, except any shares of Common Stock included in such dividend or distribution shall not be deemed "outstanding at the close of business on such Record Date" within the meaning of Sections 8(a) and 8(b).
(e)
If the Corporation shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock cash, excluding (i) any dividend or distribution in connection with the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary and (ii) any quarterly cash dividend on its Common Stock to the extent that the aggregate amount of cash distributions per share of Common Stock in any quarter does not exceed $.20 (the ""), then, in such case, the Conversion Rate shall be increased so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on such Record Date by a fraction,
Dividend Threshold Amount
(i)
the numerator of which shall be the Current Market Price on such Record Date less the Dividend Threshold Amount (as such Dividend Threshold Amount may be adjusted pursuant to this Section 8(e)); and
(ii)
the denominator of which shall be the Current Market Price on such Record Date less the amount of cash so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock.
Such adjustment shall be effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the Record Date; that if the portion of the cash so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than the Current Market Price on the record date, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each holder of Convertible Preferred Stock shall have the right to receive upon conversion the amount of cash such holder would have received had such holder converted each share of Convertible Preferred Stock on the Record Date.  To the extent that such dividend or distribution is not made, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustment made been made on the basis of only the dividend or distribution actually made.  If such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.  If an adjustment is required to be made as set forth in this Section 8(e) as a result of a distribution that is not a quarterly dividend, the Dividend Threshold Amount shall be deemed to be zero for purposes of calculating the adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 8(e).  The Dividend Threshold Amount shall be adjusted inversely proportional to the adjustments to the Conversion Rate made pursuant to Sections 8(a), (b), (c), (d), (f) and (g) hereof.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Conversion Rate after giving effect to any adjustments under this Section 8(e) shall not exceed 26.3227 (as such number may be adjusted on a proportional basis of the Conversion Rate, other than any adjustment pursuant to this Section 8(e)).
provided
(f)
If a tender or exchange offer made by the Corporation or any Subsidiary for all or any portion of the Common Stock shall require the payment to stockholders of consideration per share of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a resolution of the Board of Directors) that, as of the last time (the "") tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer, exceeds the Closing Sale Price of a share of Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Time, the Conversion Rate shall be increased so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Expiration Time by a fraction,
Expiration Time
(i)
the numerator of which shall be the sum of (x) the Fair Market Value (determined as aforesaid) of the aggregate consideration payable to stockholders based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer) of all shares validly tendered or exchanged and not withdrawn as of the Expiration Time (the shares deemed so accepted up to any such maximum, being referred to as the "") and (y) the product of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (less any Purchased Shares) at the Expiration Time and the Closing Sale Price of a share of Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Time; and
Purchased Shares
(ii)
the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any Purchased Shares) at the Expiration Time multiplied by the Closing Sale Price of a share of Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Time.
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the Expiration Time.  In the event that the Corporation or any such Subsidiary, as the case may be, is obligated to purchase shares pursuant to any such tender or exchange offer, but the Corporation or any such Subsidiary, as the case may be, is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases or all such purchases are rescinded, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made.
(g)
If the Corporation pays a dividend or makes a distribution to all holders of its Common Stock consisting of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar equity interests, of or relating to a Subsidiary or other business unit of the Corporation, the Conversion Rate shall be increased so that the same shall be equal to the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect on the Record Date with respect to such distribution by a fraction,
(i)
the numerator of which shall be the sum of (A) the average of the Closing Sale Prices of the Common Stock for the ten (10) Trading Days commencing on and including the fifth Trading Day after the date on which "ex-dividend trading" commences for such dividend or distribution on The New York Stock Exchange or such other national or regional exchange or market on which such securities are then listed or quoted (the "") plus (B) the fair market value of the securities distributed in respect of each share of Common Stock, which shall equal the number of securities distributed in respect of each share of Common Stock multiplied by the average of the Closing Sale Prices of those distributed securities for the ten (10) Trading Days commencing on and including the fifth Trading Day after the Ex-Dividend Date; and
Ex-Dividend Date
(ii)
the denominator of which shall be the average of the Closing Sale Prices of the Common Stock for the ten (10) Trading Days commencing on and including the fifth Trading Day after the Ex-Dividend Date.
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the fifteenth Trading Day after the Ex-Dividend Date; that if (x) the average of the Closing Sale Prices of the Common Stock for the ten (10) Trading Days commencing on and including the fifth Trading Day after the Ex-Dividend Date minus (y) the fair market value of the securities distributed in respect of each share of Common Stock (as calculated in Section 8(g)(i) above) is less than $1.00, then the adjustment provided by for by this Section 8(g) shall not be made and in lieu thereof the provisions of Section 9 shall apply to such distribution.
provided
(h)
The Corporation may make such increases in the Conversion Rate in addition to those required by this Section 8 as the Board of Directors considers to be advisable to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock (or rights to acquire stock) or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Corporation from time to time may increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for any period of time if the period is at least 20 days and the increase is irrevocable during the period and the Board of Directors determines in good faith that such increase would be in the best interest of the Corporation.  Whenever the Conversion Rate is increased pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Corporation shall mail to eac h holder of the Convertible Preferred Stock at the address of such holder as it appears in the stock register a notice of the reduction at least 15 days prior to the date the increased Conversion Rate takes effect, and such notice shall state the increased Conversion Rate and the period during which it will be in effect.
(i)
No adjustment in the Conversion Rate (other than any adjustment pursuant to Section 8(e) above) shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent (1%) in the Conversion Rate then in effect; that any adjustments that by reason of this Section 8(i) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment.  All calculations under this Section 8 shall be made by the Corporation and shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one-ten thousandth (1/10,000) of a share, as the case may be.  No adjustment need be made for rights to purchase Common Stock pursuant to a Corporation plan for reinvestment of dividends or interest or, except as set forth in this Section 8, for any issuance of Common Stock or securities convertible, exercisable or exchangeable into Common Stock.  To the extent the Convertible Preferred Stock becomes convertible into cash, assets, property or securities (other than Capital Stock of the Corporation), subject to Section 9, no adjustment need be made thereafter to the Conversion Rate.  Interest will not accrue on any cash into which the Convertible Preferred Stock may be convertible.
provided, however,
(j)
Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted as herein provided, the Corporation shall promptly file with the Conversion Agent an Officer's certificate setting forth the Conversion Rate after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment.  Unless and until a responsible officer of the Conversion Agent shall have received such Officer's certificate, the Conversion Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment of the Conversion Rate and may assume that the last Conversion Rate of which it has knowledge is still in effect.  Promptly after delivery of such certificate, the Corporation shall prepare a notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate and the date on which each adjustment becomes effective and shall mail such notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate to each holder of Convertible Preferred Stock at its last address appearing in the stock register within twenty (20) days after execution thereof.  Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of any such adjustment.
(k)
For purposes of this Section , the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Corporation, unless such treasury shares participate in any distribution or dividend that requires an adjustment pursuant to this Section 8, but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock.

Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of any conversion right pursuant to this Section 9.
(c)
The above provisions of this Section 9 shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications, changes, consolidations, mergers, combinations, sales and conveyances, and the provisions of Section 8 shall apply to any shares of Capital Stock received by the holders of Common Stock in any such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance; that if this Section  applies to any event or occurrence, Section 9 shall not apply to such event or occurrence.
