NEW ORLEANS, LA, April 20, 2004 -- Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (NYSE: FCX) reported a first-quarter 2004 net loss applicable to common stock of $19.6 million, $0.10 per share, including losses on early extinguishment and conversion of debt totaling $14.4 million ($0.07 per share), compared with first-quarter 2003 net income of $49.2 million, $0.33 per share, including a gain for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $9.1 million, $0.06 per share.  First-quarter 2004 results were adversely affected by lower ore grades and reduced mill throughput as PT Freeport Indonesia (PT-FI), FCX's Indonesian mining unit, focused its efforts on restoring safe access to the higher-grade ore areas in its Grasberg open-pit mine following the fourth-quarter 2003 slippage and debris flow events.
SUMMARY FINANCIAL TABLE
(a)
Includes losses on the early extinguishment and conversion of debt related to the conversion of FCX's 8% Convertible Senior Notes and other debt extinguishments totaling $14.6 million ($14.4 million to net income or $0.07 per share) in the 2004 quarter.  
(b)
First-quarter 2003 cumulative effect adjustment reflects adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," effective January 1, 2003.
(c)
Includes 47.4 million weighted average shares resulting from conversions of FCX's 8% Convertible Senior Notes and Step-Up Preferred Stock.  On March 30, 2004, FCX purchased 23.9 million of its common shares from Rio Tinto.
James R. Moffett, Chairman of the Board, and Richard C. Adkerson, President and Chief Executive Officer of FCX, said, "We are pleased to report that we have established safe access and have initiated mining activities in the higher grade ore areas in the Grasberg open pit.  Our PT-FI team's efforts over the past several months to accelerate waste mining on the south wall have been conducted safely and efficiently.  These activities position us to produce large quantities of copper and gold in the remainder of 2004 and 2005 which will translate into significant cash flows."
STATUS OF GRASBERG OPEN-PIT OPERATIONS
Following the October 9, 2003 slippage event and the December 12, 2003 debris flow in a section of the Grasberg open pit, PT-FI focused its open-pit operations on accelerating the removal of waste material from the south wall to restore safe access to the higher-grade ore areas in the pit.  These activities have allowed PT-FI to resume mining operations in the key ore areas of the pit while continuing waste removal activities.  
As previously reported, a portion of the higher grade ore previously forecast to be mined in 2004 is expected to be deferred to future periods, resulting in plans to produce significant volumes of copper and gold in the last half of 2004 and in 2005.  Ore grades are expected to increase during the year resulting in a significant portion of 2004 metal sales occurring in the second half of the year.  Ore grades and volumes are expected to be strong in 2005.
PT-FI reported lower copper production and sales in the first quarter of 2004, reflecting changes in mine sequencing at the Grasberg open pit.  During the first quarter of 2004, PT-FI's ore was sourced from its Deep Ore Zone (DOZ) underground mine, which averaged 45,400 metric tons of ore per day, and from low grade material in the open pit.  Mill throughput averaged 151,800 metric tons of ore per day compared with 238,200 metric tons of ore in the first quarter of 2003.  Mill throughput, which will vary depending on ore types being processed, is expected to average approximately 210,000 metric tons per day in the balance of 2004.
PT-FI PRODUCTION AND SALES
 
 
Changes in mine sequencing at the Grasberg open pit reduced PT-FI's reported first-quarter 2004 ore grades and recovery rates.  First-quarter 2004 copper ore grades averaged 0.50 percent, compared with 1.15 percent in the first quarter of 2003.  Copper recovery rates were 83.8 percent, compared with 88.4 percent for the first quarter of 2003.
For the first quarter of 2004, ore milled averaged 0.41 grams per metric ton (g/t) of gold, compared with 1.26 g/t for the first quarter of 2003.  Gold recovery rates declined to 73.8 percent, compared with 86.2 percent for the first quarter of 2003.  
Production from PT-FI's DOZ underground mine averaged 45,400 metric tons of ore per day, representing 30 percent of total first-quarter 2004 mill throughput.  DOZ operations continue to perform above design capacity of 35,000 metric tons of ore per day, and PT-FI expects to increase the sustained capacity of the DOZ underground operation to 50,000 metric tons per day. The DOZ mine has been developed as one of the world's largest underground operations.
Realized copper prices improved by 84 percent to $1.34 per pound in the first quarter of 2004 from $0.73 in the first quarter of 2003.  Current LME copper prices are above $1.40 per pound.  Gold realized prices improved by 20 percent to $411.42 per ounce in the first quarter of 2004 from $341.55 in the first quarter of 2003.  Current London gold prices approximate $400 per ounce.    
PT-FI expects its share of sales for 2004 to approximate 1.0 billion pounds of copper and 1.5 million ounces of gold, and 1.5 billion pounds of copper and 2.9 million ounces of gold in 2005.  PT-FI's share of annual sales over the five-year period from 2004  2008 is expected to average 1.34 billion pounds of copper and 2.2 million ounces of gold.  PT-FI expects its sales for the second quarter of 2004 to approximate 200 million pounds of copper and 330,000 ounces of gold.  
At March 31, 2004, FCX's concentrate sales included 55.3 million pounds of copper, priced at an average of $1.38 per pound, subject to final pricing over the next several months.  Each $0.01 change in the price realized from the March 31 price would result in an approximate $0.3 million, $0.002 per share, effect on FCX's 2004 net income.  First-quarter 2004 adjustments to concentrate sales recognized in prior quarters increased revenues by $7.6 million ($3.9 million to net income, $0.02 per share) compared with an increase of $10.2 million ($5.2 million to net income, $0.04 per share) in the first quarter of 2003.
NET CASH PRODUCTION COSTS
(a)
(a)
For a reconciliation of net cash production costs per pound to production and delivery costs applicable to sales reported in FCX's consolidated financial statements refer to the attached presentation, "Product Revenues and Production Costs."
 
PT-FI's unit net cash production costs, including gold and silver credits, averaged an extraordinarily high $1.19 per pound of copper during the first quarter of 2004, compared with $0.07 per pound for the 2003 quarter.  Unit production and delivery costs reflected significantly lower sales volumes resulting from PT-FI's accelerated waste removal efforts and the fixed nature of PT-FI's cost structure.  Unit production and delivery costs are net of deferred mining costs of $0.25 per pound ($26.2 million) for the first quarter of 2004 and $0.02 per pound ($7.2 million) for the first quarter of 2003.  The increase in deferred mining costs primarily reflects PT-FI's accelerated waste removal efforts.  PT-FI's first-quarter 2004 waste to ore ratio averaged 4.1 to 1, compared with a life-of-mine average ratio of 2.2 to 1.  Unit treatment charges vary with the p rice of copper, and royalty rates vary with prices of copper and gold.  PT-FI's copper royalty rate under its Contract of Work varies from 1.5 percent of copper net revenues at a copper price of $0.90 or less per pound to 3.5 percent at a copper price of $1.10 or more per pound.  In addition, treatment charges vary based on PT-FI's customer mix and changes in copper and gold prices.
Assuming average copper prices of $1.30 per pound and average gold prices of $400 per ounce, PT-FI estimates its net cash production costs, including gold credits, would average approximately $0.35 per pound in 2004 (a weighted average of $0.25 per pound for the remainder of the year) and a net credit of $(0.05) per pound in 2005.  The weighted average net cash production cost for the two-year period would approximate less than $0.12 per pound.  Net unit cash production costs for 2004 would change by approximately $0.04 per pound for each $25 per ounce change in the average price of gold.  
The increase in estimated net unit costs from previous estimates primarily reflects the impact of higher copper prices on royalties, price sharing arrangements with smelters, higher energy costs, stronger foreign currencies and a lower stripping deferral.
 
  
SMELTER OPERATIONS
FCX's investment in smelters serves an important role in its concentrate marketing strategy.  Through downstream integration, FCX assures placement of a significant portion of its concentrate production and operating hedges for treatment and refining charges.  While currently low smelter treatment and refining charge levels have adversely affected the operating results of FCX's smelter operations, they benefit operating results of its mining operations.  
Atlantic Copper, FCX's wholly owned Spanish smelting unit, treated 187,100 metric tons of concentrates and scrap in the first quarter of 2004, compared with 242,100 metric tons in the year-ago period.  On March 22, 2004, Atlantic Copper began a previously announced scheduled 45-day major maintenance turnaround, adversely affecting first quarter results and projected second quarter results.  Atlantic Copper reported quarterly production of 128.8 million pounds of cathodes and sold 112.0 million pounds of cathodes, including wire rod and wire.  Cathode production totaled 134.9 million pounds and sales totaled 138.7 million pounds during the first quarter of 2003.  Treatment charges received by Atlantic Copper averaged $0.16 per pound during the first quarter of 2004 and $0.17 per pound during the first quarter of 2003.  Unit cathode cash production costs averaged $0.23 per pound in the first quarter of 2004 and $0.15 per pound for the year-ago period.  Unit costs were adversely affected by lower production primarily because of the maintenance turnaround, which added $0.04 per pound, as well as a stronger euro/US$ exchange rate, which added $0.03 per pound to Atlantic Copper's first-quarter 2004 unit costs compared with first-quarter 2003 unit costs.  
Atlantic Copper reported an operating loss of $10.9 million for the first quarter of 2004, compared with operating income of $0.4 million in the 2003 period.  During the first quarter of 2004, Atlantic Copper's maintenance turnaround adversely affected costs and volumes resulting in an approximate $4.6 million impact on operating results.  Atlantic Copper expects its second quarter operating results to reflect an additional approximate $32 million negative impact from the maintenance turnaround.  Major maintenance turnarounds of this duration typically occur approximately every nine years for Atlantic Copper, with significantly shorter term maintenance turnarounds occurring in the interim.
PT Smelting, PT-FI's 25 percent-owned Indonesian smelting unit, treated 167,300 metric tons of concentrates in the first quarter of 2004, compared with 212,300 metric tons in the year-ago period.  PT Smelting reported quarterly production of 97.0 million pounds of cathodes and sales of 92.0 million pounds of cathodes.  Cathode production totaled 121.0 million pounds and sales totaled 116.8 million pounds during the first quarter of 2003.  PT Smelting's copper cathode cash production costs per pound totaled $0.14per pound in the first quarter of 2004 and $0.10per pound in the year-ago period, reflecting the impact of lower volumes in 2004.  PT-FI's equity interest in PT Smelting's earnings (losses) totaled $(0.4) million, $0.002 per share, in the first quarter of 2004 compared to $0.7 million, $0.005 per share, in the 2003 quarter.  On March 16, 2004, PT Smelting b egan a scheduled 33-day major maintenance turnaround, which was completed on schedule and normal operations have resumed.  Major maintenance turnarounds of this duration typically occur approximately every four years for PT Smelting, with significantly shorter term maintenance turnarounds in the interim.  
FCX defers recognition of profits on PT-FI's sales to Atlantic Copper and on 25 percent of PT-FI's sales to PT Smelting until the final sales to third parties occur.  Because of PT-FI's reduced production and sales levels during the first quarter and the resulting decline in PT-FI concentrate inventories at affiliated smelters, changes in these net deferrals resulted in an addition to FCX's net income totaling $24.8 million, $0.13 per share, in the first quarter of 2004, compared with a reduction of $1.0 million, $0.01 per share, in the first quarter of 2003.  At March 31, 2004, FCX's net deferred profits to be recognized in future periods' net income totaled $4.1 million.  FCX expects that the net deferral of profits on intercompany sales will result in a reduction to net income in the remainder of the year as PT-FI's production and shipments to affiliated smelters increase .  Based on current copper and gold prices and shipping schedules, FCX estimates the change in deferred intercompany profits in the remainder of 2004 will more than offset the additions to income recognized in the first quarter.  FCX's current estimate of the second quarter deferral of intercompany profits approximates $18 million to net income.  
 
DEBT AND EQUITY TRANSACTIONS, AND OPERATING CASH FLOW
FCX completed several financing transactions during the quarter to improve its financial position and debt maturity profile.  FCX completed a tender offer and privately negotiated transactions for a portion of its remaining 8% Convertible Senior Notes due 2006 resulting in the early conversion of $226.1 million of notes into 15.8 million shares of FCX common stock.  FCX recorded a $10.9 million accounting charge for losses on early extinguishment and conversion of debt in the first quarter of 2004 in connection with these conversions.  Cumulative conversions to equity of the $603.8 million of these convertible notes issued in 2001 total $537.3 million.  The remaining $66.5 million of the notes, with a conversion price of $14.30 per share, are callable beginning in August 2004.  
On February 3, 2004, FCX sold $350 million of 6% Senior Notes due 2014 for net proceeds of $344.5 million. FCX used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the 6% Senior Notes to repay $162.4 million of Atlantic Copper borrowings and provide funding for other 2004 debt maturities.  Atlantic Copper recorded a $3.7 million ($0.02 per share) accounting charge for losses on early extinguishment of debt.  
On March 30, 2004, FCX sold 1.1 million shares of 5% Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock for net proceeds of $1.067 billion.  Each share of 5% Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock is convertible into shares of FCX's common stock at an initial conversion price of $53.19.  FCX purchased 23.9 million shares of its common stock owned by Rio Tinto for $881.9 million (approximately $36.85 per share) with a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the 5% Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, with the remainder to be used for general corporate purposes.  Rio Tinto acquired these shares from FCX's former parent company in 1995 in connection with the spinoff of FCX as an independent company.  Rio Tinto invested $850 million in a joint venture to expand PT-FI's operations and has recently stated its intention to continue its joint venture participation with PT-FI on a long-term basis.
FCX's operating activities used $225.5 million of cash in the first quarter of 2004, including $262.3 million for working capital requirements.  Using estimated sales volumes projected for the remainder of 2004 and prices of approximately $1.30 per pound of copper and $400 per ounce of gold, FCX would generate operating cash flows of approximately $550 million in the balance of the year, bringing 2004 operating cash flows to approximately $325 million.  These amounts exclude potential proceeds from insurance coverage related to the fourth quarter 2003 slippage events which PT-FI is currently reviewing with its insurers.  Estimated operating cash flows for 2005 using current sales estimates and pricing would approximate $1.1 billion.  Each $0.10 per pound change in copper in the balance of the year would affect 2004 cash flows by approximately $45 million and 2005 cash flows by approximately $75 million.  Each $25 per ounce change in gold would affect 2004 cash flows by approximately $17 million and 2005 cash flows by approximately $36 million.
As of March 31, 2004, FCX had total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $533.5 million and total outstanding debt of $2.2 billion.  FCX intends to prepay approximately $60 million in vendor equipment financing in the second quarter and is considering additional opportunities to retire debt.  In October 2003, FCX's Board of Directors authorized an increase in the common stock dividend from an annual rate of $0.36 per share to $0.80 per share.  The Board also approved a new open market share purchase program for up to 20 million shares, which replaced FCX's previous program.  The declaration and payment of dividends is at the discretion of the Board and will depend on FCX's financial results, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.  No shares have been purchased under FCX's new open market share purchase progra m.  The timing of future purchases of FCX's common stock is dependent upon many factors including the price of its common shares, its cash flow and financial position, and general economic and market conditions.
FCX explores for, develops, mines and processes ore containing copper, gold and silver in Indonesia, and smelts and refines copper concentrates in Spain and Indonesia.  Additional information on FCX is available on our web site, .

NET CASH PRODUCTION COSTS
Net cash production costs per pound of copper is a measure intended to provide investors with information about the cash generating capacity of PT Freeport Indonesia's (PT-FI) mining operations in Indonesia.  This measure is presented by other copper and gold mining companies, although PT-FI's measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
PT-FI calculates gross profit per pound of copper under a "by-product" method, while the copper, gold and silver contained within its concentrates are treated as co-products in its financial statements.  PT-FI uses the by-product method in its presentation of gross profit per pound of copper because (1) the majority of its revenues are copper revenues, (2) it produces and sells one product, concentrates, which contains all three metals and (3) it is not possible to specifically assign its costs to revenues from the copper, gold and silver it produces in concentrates.  In the co-product method presentation below, costs are allocated to the different products based on their relative revenue values.  Presentations under both methods are presented below along with a reconciliation to amounts reported in FCX's consolidated financial statements.
 
ATLANTIC COPPER CATHODE CASH PRODUCTION COST PER POUND OF COPPER
Atlantic Copper cathode cash production cost per pound of copper is a measure intended to provide investors with information about the costs associated with its smelting operations in Spain.  Other smelting companies present this measure, although Atlantic Copper's measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
Below is a reconciliation of the smelting and refining segment production costs reported in FCX's consolidated financial statements to the production costs used to calculate our cathode cash production cost per pound of copper (in thousands, except per pound amounts):
 
 
PT SMELTING CATHODE CASH PRODUCTION COST PER POUND OF COPPER
PT Smelting cathode cash production cost per pound of copper is a measure intended to provide investors with information about the costs associated with FCX's 25 percent-owned smelting operations in Indonesia.  Other smelting companies present this measure, although PT Smelting's measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
 
Below is a reconciliation of the production costs used to calculate PT Smelting's cathode cash production cost per pound of copper to FCX's equity in PT Smelting earnings (losses) reported in FCX's consolidated financial statements (in thousands, except per pound amounts):
 
PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES
PT Freeport Indonesia's Contract of Work provides for a 35 percent corporate income tax rate, and the tax treaty between Indonesia and the United States provides for a withholding tax of 10 percent on dividends and interest that PT Freeport Indonesia pays to the FCX parent company.  FCX also incurs a U.S. alternative minimum tax at a rate of two percent based primarily on consolidated income, net of smelting and refining results.  FCX currently records no income taxes at Atlantic Copper, which is subject to taxation in Spain, because it has not generated significant taxable income in recent years and has substantial tax loss carryforwards for which FCX has provided no financial statement benefit.
 
FCX receives minimal tax benefit from costs, including interest expense, incurred by the parent company, primarily because it generates no taxable income from U.S. sources.  FCX also currently receives no tax benefit from losses in its smelting and refining segment (i.e., Atlantic Copper) because those losses cannot be used to offset PT Freeport Indonesia's profits in Indonesia.  Thus, FCX's provision for income taxes as a percentage of consolidated income before income taxes and minority interests will decrease as PT Freeport Indonesia's income increases and vice versa absent changes in Atlantic Copper and parent company costs.  Parent company costs consist primarily of interest, depreciation and amortization, and general and administrative expenses.  Summaries of the significant components of the calculation of the consolidated provision for income taxes are shown below (in thousands, except percentages).
a.
Excludes charges totaling $64.6 million in the first quarter of 2004 and $4.4 million in the first quarter of 2003 for FCX stock option exercises which are eliminated in consolidation.
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
FCX has two operating segments:  "mining and exploration" and "smelting and refining."  The mining and exploration segment consists of FCX's Indonesian activities including PT Freeport Indonesia's copper and gold mining operations, PT Puncakjaya Power's power generating operations after eliminations with PT Freeport Indonesia and FCX's Indonesian exploration activities.  The smelting and refining segment includes Atlantic Copper's operations in Spain and PT Freeport Indonesia's equity investment in PT Smelting in Gresik, Indonesia.  The segment data presented below were prepared on the same basis as FCX's consolidated financial statements.
 
a.
Includes PT Freeport Indonesia's sales to PT Smelting totaling $127.0 million in the 2004 quarter and $121.3 million in the 2003 quarter.
b.
Includes recognition of intercompany profits on 25 percent of PT Freeport Indonesia's sales to PT Smelting, for which the final sale has not occurred, totaling $8.3 million in the 2004 quarter and $2.1 million in the 2003 quarter.
c.
