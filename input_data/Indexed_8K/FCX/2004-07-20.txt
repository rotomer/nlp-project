HIGHLIGHTS
*
Established safe access and initiated mining activities in high grade ore areas in April 2004. Production rates increased during the quarter and normal milling operations resumed in June 2004.
* Second-quarter 2004 net loss of $53.3 million, $0.30 per share, compared with second-quarter 2003 net income of $57.4 million, $0.37 per share.  The second quarter 2004 results include a reduction to net income of approximately $35 million, $0.20 per share, associated with a major maintenance turnaround completed during the quarter at Atlantic Copper, FCX's wholly owned Spanish smelting unit.
* PT Freeport Indonesia's share of copper and gold sales totaled 205.1 million pounds and 351,100 ounces in the second quarter of 2004 compared with 395.2 million pounds and 849,200 ounces in the 2003 second quarter, reflecting the mining of lower grade ore and lower mill rates in the 2004 period.
* Second-half 2004 sales are projected to increase from first-half levels and PT Freeport Indonesia's share of annual sales are estimated to total 1.0 billion pounds of copper and 1.5 million ounces of gold in 2004 and 1.5 billion pounds of copper and 2.9 million ounces of gold in 2005.  
* Total debt at June 30, 2004 approximated $2.1 billion, $1.8 billion net of approximately $300 million of cash; common shares outstanding approximated 174 million at June 30, 2004.
* Second-quarter 2004 purchases of 3.4 million FCX common shares for $99.5 million, $29.39 per share average.
* Exploration drilling at the "Deep MLZ" underground target yields positive results.
NEW ORLEANS, LA, July 20, 2004 -- Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (NYSE: FCX) reported a second-quarter 2004 net loss applicable to common stock of $53.3 million, $0.30 per share, compared with second-quarter 2003 net income of $57.4 million, $0.37 per share.  For the six months ended June 30, 2004, FCX reported a net loss of $72.9 million, $0.39 per share, compared with net income of $106.6 million, $0.69 per share, including a gain for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $9.1 million, $0.05 per share, in the 2003 period.  Results for the first half of 2004 were adversely affected by lower ore grades and reduced mill throughput as PT Freeport Indonesia (PT-FI), FCX's Indonesian mining unit, completed its efforts to restore safe access to the higher-grade ore areas in its Grasberg open-pit mine following the fourth-quarter 2003 slippage and debris flow events and approximately $40 million, $0.2 1 per share, in reduced earnings associated with Atlantic Copper's scheduled major maintenance turnaround.

(c)
Six-month 2003 cumulative effect adjustment reflects adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," effective January 1, 2003.
(d)
On March 30, 2004, FCX purchased 23.9 million of its common shares from Rio Tinto.
James R. Moffett, Chairman of the Board, and Richard C. Adkerson, President and Chief Executive Officer of FCX, said, "With the completion of our efforts to return to normal mining operations at our Grasberg open pit, we are well positioned to generate strong operating and financial results in the second half of 2004 and beyond.  Our production is expected to increase throughout the year which will result in our second half 2004 copper and gold sales being more than double the first half of the year.  Our long-lived, low-cost reserves will provide substantial future cash flows, allowing us to continue to strengthen our financial position for the benefit of our shareholders."
PT-FI PRODUCTION AND SALES
 
PT-FI reported lower production and sales in the second quarter of 2004, compared with the 2003 quarter, reflecting the mining of lower grade material and accelerated waste removal activities following the fourth-quarter 2003 slippage and debris flow events.  Mill throughput during the quarter averaged 164,200 metric tons of ore per day compared with 221,300 metric tons of ore in the second quarter of 2003.  Mill throughput, which varies depending on ore types being processed, exceeded 200,000 metric tons of ore per day in June and is expected to average approximately 220,000 metric tons per day in the second half of 2004.
Changes in mine sequencing at the Grasberg open pit reduced PT-FI's reported second-quarter 2004 ore grades and recovery rates.  Compared to the first half of 2004, ore grades are expected to be higher for the remainder of 2004 and 2005 resulting in increased metal production in the second half of 2004 and in 2005.  
Second-quarter 2004 copper ore grades averaged 0.82 percent, compared with 1.24 percent in the second quarter of 2003.  Copper recovery rates were 88.2 percent, compared with 89.8 percent for the second quarter of 2003.  For the second quarter of 2004, ore milled averaged 0.95 grams per metric ton (g/t) of gold, compared with 1.95 g/t for the second quarter of 2003.  Gold recovery rates averaged 84.6 percent, compared with 87.9 percent for the second quarter of 2003.  
Production from PT-FI's Deep Ore Zone (DOZ) underground mine averaged 45,500 metric tons of ore per day, representing 28 percent of total second-quarter 2004 mill throughput.  DOZ operations continue to perform above design capacity of 35,000 metric tons of ore per day, and PT-FI expects to increase the sustained capacity of the DOZ underground operation to 50,000 metric tons per day with the installation of a second crusher and additional ventilation. The DOZ mine has been developed as one of the world's largest underground operations.
Realized copper prices improved by 63 percent to an average of $1.22 per pound in the second quarter of 2004 from $0.75 in the second quarter of 2003.  Current LME copper prices approximate $1.30 per pound.  Gold realized prices improved by 12 percent to an average of $389.97 per ounce in the second quarter of 2004 from $347.69 in the second quarter of 2003.  Current London gold prices approximate $400 per ounce.    
PT-FI expects its share of sales for 2004 to approximate 1.0 billion pounds of copper and 1.5 million ounces of gold, and 1.5 billion pounds of copper and 2.9 million ounces of gold in 2005.  PT-FI expects its sales for the third quarter of 2004 to approximate 260 million pounds of copper and 360,000 ounces of gold with approximately 430 million pounds of copper and 660,000 ounces of gold expected for the fourth quarter of 2004.  
Safety continues as PT-FI's highest priority and the information gained from recent technical studies following the 2003 slippage events is being incorporated in our long-range mine plans.  PT-FI's share of annual sales over the five-year period from 2004 to 2008 is expected to average approximately 1.3 billion pounds of copper and 2.2 million ounces of gold.  Annual metal production is expected to be above or below the average depending on the section of the Grasberg pit being mined.  In addition, the design would allow PT-FI to access at least 20 million metric tons of high-grade Grasberg underground reserves through the open pit, thereby extending the open pit life into 2015.  
At June 30, 2004, FCX's concentrate sales included 144.8 million pounds of copper, priced at an average of $1.22 per pound, subject to final pricing over the next few months.  Each $0.01 change in the price realized from the June 30 price would result in an approximate $0.7 million, $0.004 per share, effect on FCX's 2004 net income.  Second-quarter 2004 adjustments to concentrate sales recognized in prior quarters decreased revenues by $5.6 million ($2.9 million to net income, $0.02 per share) compared with a decrease of $0.6 million ($0.3 million to net income, $0.002 per share) in the second quarter of 2003.
NET CASH PRODUCTION COSTS
(a)
(a)
For a reconciliation of net cash production costs per pound to production and delivery costs applicable to sales reported in FCX's consolidated financial statements refer to the attached presentation, "Product Revenues and Production Costs."
 
PT-FI's unit net cash production costs, including gold and silver credits, averaged $0.40 per pound of copper during the second quarter of 2004, compared with a net credit of $(0.16) per pound for the 2003 quarter.  Higher unit production and delivery costs in the 2004 period reflected significantly lower sales volumes resulting from PT-FI's accelerated waste removal efforts on the south wall, which were completed during the quarter, and the primarily fixed nature of PT-FI's cost structure.  Unit production and delivery costs are net of deferred mining costs of $0.15 per pound ($31.5 million) for the second quarter of 2004 and $0.04 per pound ($14.4 million) for the second quarter of 2003.  The increase in deferred mining costs primarily reflects PT-FI's accelerated waste removal efforts.  PT-FI's second-quarter 2004 waste to ore ratio averaged 4.0 to 1, compa red with a life-of-mine average ratio of 2.2 to 1.  Unit treatment charges vary with the price of copper, and royalty rates vary with prices of copper and gold.  PT-FI's copper royalty rate under its Contract of Work varies from 1.5 percent of copper net revenues at a copper price of $0.90 or less per pound to 3.5 percent at a copper price of $1.10 or more per pound.  In addition, treatment charges vary based on PT-FI's customer mix and changes in copper and gold prices.
Assuming second half 2004 average copper prices of $1.30 per pound and average gold prices of $400 per ounce, PT-FI estimates its net cash production costs, including gold credits, would average approximately $0.38 per pound in 2004 (a weighted average of $0.24 per pound for the second half of the year) and a net credit of $0.04 per pound in 2005.  The weighted average net cash production cost for the two-year period would approximate $0.13 per pound.  Net unit cash production costs for 2004 would change by approximately $0.025 per pound for each $25 per ounce change in the average price of gold in the second half of the year.  Forecasted unit costs are calculated on the same basis as the historical unit costs discussed above and reconciled in the attached "Product Revenues and Production Costs" schedule.
  
SMELTER OPERATIONS
FCX's investment in smelters serves an important role in its concentrate marketing strategy.  Through downstream integration, FCX assures placement of a significant portion of its concentrate production and operating hedges for treatment and refining charges.  While currently low smelter treatment and refining charge levels have adversely affected the operating results of FCX's smelter operations, they benefit operating results of its mining operations.  
Atlantic Copper returned to normal operations in May 2004 following completion of a 51-day scheduled major maintenance turnaround that began in March 2004, adversely affecting second quarter results.  Atlantic Copper treated 129,500 metric tons of concentrate and scrap in the second quarter of 2004, compared with 244,600 metric tons in the year-ago period.  Atlantic Copper reported quarterly production of 67.5 million pounds of cathodes and sold 102.4 million pounds of cathodes, including wire rod and wire.  Cathode production totaled 137.9 million pounds and sales totaled 140.2 million pounds during the second quarter of 2003.  Treatment charges received by Atlantic Copper averaged $0.15 per pound during the second quarters of 2004 and 2003.  Unit cathode cash production costs averaged $0.57per pound in the second quarter of 2004 and $0.16 per pound for the year-ago peri od.  Second quarter 2004 unit costs were adversely affected by lower production and higher costs from the maintenance turnaround.  
Atlantic Copper reported operating losses of $39.9 million for the second quarter of 2004, compared with $4.1 million in the 2003 period.  During the second quarter of 2004, Atlantic Copper's maintenance turnaround adversely affected costs and volumes resulting in an approximate $35.0 million reduction in operating results, including an approximate $11.5 million impact from lower volumes, compared with second-quarter 2003 results.  The effect of the 51-day turnaround on Atlantic Copper's first half results was approximately $40 million, including an approximate $12 million impact from lower volumes.  Major maintenance turnarounds of this duration typically occur approximately every nine years for Atlantic Copper, with significantly shorter term maintenance turnarounds occurring in the interim.  
During the second quarter of 2004, PT Smelting, PT-FI's 25 percent-owned Indonesian smelting unit, completed a planned 33-day major maintenance turnaround on schedule and resumed normal operations.  Major maintenance turnarounds of this duration typically occur approximately every four years for PT Smelting, with significantly shorter term maintenance turnarounds in the interim.  PT Smelting treated 135,400 metric tons of concentrate in the second quarter of 2004, compared with 208,400 metric tons in the year-ago period.  PT Smelting reported quarterly production of 86.9 million pounds of cathodes and sales of 89.7 million pounds of cathodes.  Cathode production totaled 124.1 million pounds and sales totaled 128.2 million pounds during the second quarter of 2003.  PT Smelting's copper cathode cash production costs per pound totaled $0.22per pound in the second quarter of 2004 and $ 0.10per pound in the year-ago period, reflecting the impact of lower volumes in 2004.  PT-FI's equity interest in PT Smelting's earnings (losses) totaled $(2.5) million, $0.01 per share, in the second quarter of 2004 compared to $2.3 million, $0.01 per share, in the 2003 quarter.  
FCX defers recognition of profits on PT-FI's sales to Atlantic Copper and on 25 percent of PT-FI's sales to PT Smelting until the final sales to third parties occur.  These net deferrals will be recognized in future periods and resulted in reductions to FCX's net income totaling $4.9 million, $0.03 per share, in the second-quarter of 2004, compared with $17.4 million, $0.09 per share in the second quarter of 2003.  The second quarter reduction in net income was lower than previous estimates primarily because of the timing of sales to affiliated smelters and lower copper prices.  At June 30, 2004, FCX's net deferred profits to be recognized in net income in future periods totaled $9.0 million.  FCX expects that the net deferral of profits on intercompany sales will result in a reduction to net income in the second half of 2004 as PT-FI's production and shipments to affiliated smel ters increase.  Based on current copper and gold prices and shipping schedules, FCX's current estimate of the third quarter deferral of intercompany profits approximates a $13 million reduction to net income.  
OPERATING CASH FLOW, DEBT AND EQUITY TRANSACTIONS
 FCX generated operating cash flows totaling $36.6 million during the second quarter and used $189.0 million of cash in the first six months of 2004, including $245.4 million for working capital requirements.  Capital expenditures totaled $74.8 million in the first half of 2004 and are expected to total $165 million for the year 2004 and $135 million in 2005.
Using estimated sales volumes projected for the remainder of 2004 and prices of approximately $1.30 per pound of copper and $400 per ounce of gold, FCX would generate operating cash flows of approximately $400 million in the second half of the year, bringing 2004 operating cash flows to approximately $215 million.  These amounts reflect estimated changes in working capital resulting from the significant estimated sales volumes in the fourth quarter and exclude any proceeds from insurance coverage related to the fourth-quarter 2003 slippage and debris flow events.  PT-FI is currently reviewing the potential coverage for these events with its insurers.  Estimated operating cash flows for 2005 using current sales estimates and the above pricing would exceed $1.1 billion.  Each $0.10 per pound change in copper prices in the balance of the year would affect 2004 cash flows by approximate ly $35 million and 2005 cash flows by approximately $75 million.  Each $25 per ounce change in gold prices would affect 2004 cash flows by approximately $12 million and 2005 cash flows by approximately $36 million.    
Total debt at June 30, 2004 approximated $2.1 billion, $1.8 billion net of approximately $300 million of cash.  FCX completed the following debt transactions during the second quarter to reduce interest costs and improve its financial position;
*
Repurchased $9.7 million of its 6% Senior Notes due 2014 for $8.8 million;
*
Prepaid $66.2 million of equipment loans; and
*
Called for redemption on July 31, 2004, its remaining $66.5 million of 8% Convertible Senior Notes, with a conversion price of $14.30 per share.  These convertible notes are expected to be converted into approximately 4.7 million FCX common shares before the redemption date.  As of June 30, 2004, a total of $537.3 million in principal amount of the $603.8 million issued in 2001 had been converted into equity.  
FCX purchased 3.4 million shares of its common stock during the second quarter of 2004 for $99.5 million, an average of $29.39 per share under its 20-million share open market repurchase program.  On June 30, 2004, FCX had outstanding 173.8 million shares of common stock (178.5 million adjusted for the expected third quarter conversions of 8% notes).  As of July 19, 2004, 16.6 million shares remain available for purchase under FCX's share repurchase program.  The timing of future purchases of FCX's common stock is dependent upon many factors including the price of its common shares, its cash flows and financial position, and general economic and market conditions.
EXPLORATION UPDATE
             As previously reported, PT-FI completed a 37,000-meter, 65-hole diamond drilling program at Deep MLZ, a 250 million metric ton exploration target, and has extended the drilling program to include an additional 9,000 meters. To date, assay results have been received on 50 holes comprising approximately 31,000 meters.  The drilling intercepted mineralized zones in 46 holes with lengths ranging from 24 meters to 737 meters (average of 322 meters) with interval grades ranging from 0.41% to 7.11% copper equivalent (averaging approximately 1.9% copper equivalent).  PT-FI has initiated engineering studies on Deep MLZ required for reserve and resource determination. Pursuant to FCX's joint venture arrangements with Rio Tinto plc, Rio Tinto is entitled to a 40 percent interest in any Deep MLZ reserve a dditions.  Copper equivalent percentage is used to express the relative value of multi-metal ores in terms of one metal, in this case, copper.  The calculation expresses the relative value of the ore using estimates of contained metal quantities, metal prices, recovery rates, treatment charges and royalties.  
FCX explores for, develops, mines and processes ore containing copper, gold and silver in Indonesia, and smelts and refines copper concentrates in Spain and Indonesia.  Additional information on FCX is available on our web site, .

FREEPORT-McMoRan COPPER & GOLD INC.
 
PT FREEPORT INDONESIA PRODUCT REVENUES AND NET CASH PRODUCTION COSTS
Net cash production costs per pound of copper is a measure intended to provide investors with information about the cash generating capacity of PT Freeport Indonesia's mining operations in Indonesia.  This measure is presented by other copper and gold mining companies, although PT Freeport Indonesia's measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
 
PT Freeport Indonesia calculates gross profit per pound of copper under a "by-product" method, while the copper, gold and silver contained within its concentrates are treated as co-products in its financial statements.  PT Freeport Indonesia uses the by-product method in its presentation of gross profit per pound of copper because (1) the majority of its revenues are copper revenues, (2) it produces and sells one product, concentrates, which contains all three metals and (3) it is not possible to specifically assign its costs to revenues from the copper, gold and silver it produces in concentrates.  In the co-product method presentation below, costs are allocated to the different products based on their relative revenue values.  Presentations under both methods are presented below along with a reconciliation to amounts reported in FCX's consolidated financial statements.
 
 
 
ATLANTIC COPPER CATHODE CASH PRODUCTION COST PER POUND OF COPPER
Atlantic Copper cathode cash production cost per pound of copper is a measure intended to provide investors with information about the costs associated with its smelting operations in Spain.  Other smelting companies present this measure, although Atlantic Copper's measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
 
Below is a reconciliation of the smelting and refining segment production costs reported in FCX's consolidated financial statements to the production costs used to calculate Atlantic Copper's cathode cash production cost per pound of copper (in thousands, except per pound amounts):
 
a.
Includes $23.5 million, $0.35 per pound, in the 2004 quarter and $27.5 million, $0.14 per pound, in the 2004 six-month period for costs related to Atlantic Copper's major maintenance turnaround.
 
PT SMELTING CATHODE CASH PRODUCTION COST PER POUND OF COPPER
PT Smelting cathode cash production cost per pound of copper is a measure intended to provide investors with information about the costs associated with FCX's 25 percent-owned smelting operations in Indonesia.  Other smelting companies present this measure, although PT Smelting's measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
 
Below is a reconciliation of the production costs used to calculate PT Smelting's cathode cash production cost per pound of copper to FCX's equity in PT Smelting earnings (losses) reported in FCX's consolidated financial statements (in thousands, except per pound amounts):
PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES
PT Freeport Indonesia's Contract of Work provides for a 35 percent corporate income tax rate, and the tax treaty between Indonesia and the United States provides for a withholding tax rate of 10 percent on dividends and interest that PT Freeport Indonesia pays to the FCX parent company.  FCX also incurs a U.S. alternative minimum tax at a rate of two percent based primarily on consolidated income, net of smelting and refining results.  FCX currently records no income taxes at Atlantic Copper, which is subject to taxation in Spain, because it has not generated significant taxable income in recent years and has substantial tax loss carryforwards for which FCX has provided no financial statement benefit.  FCX receives no consolidated tax benefit from these losses because they cannot be used to offset PT Freeport Indonesia's profits in Indonesia.  
 
Parent company costs consist primarily of interest, depreciation and amortization, and general and administrative expenses.  FCX receives minimal tax benefit from these costs, including interest expense, primarily because the parent company generates no taxable income from U.S. sources.  As a result, FCX's provision for income taxes as a percentage of consolidated income before income taxes and minority interests will decrease as PT Freeport Indonesia's income increases and vice versa absent changes in Atlantic Copper and parent company costs. Summaries of the approximate significant components of the calculation of the consolidated provision for income taxes are shown below (in thousands, except percentages).
 
a.
Excludes charges for FCX stock option exercises which are eliminated in consolidation totaling $2.2 million in the 2004 quarter, $6.8 million in the 2003 quarter, $66.8 million in the 2004 six-month period and $11.2 million in the 2003 six-month period.
b.
Rates are not meaningful for the 2004 periods because of the small amounts of consolidated income before taxes and minority interests.
