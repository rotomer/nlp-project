Our insurers agreed to pay us an aggregate of $125 million, inclusive of interest and the $20 million previously paid to us in the third quarter 2004, in connection with our claims.  The insurers are required to pay the balance no later than January 21, 2005.  After considering our joint venture partner's interest in the proceeds, PT Freeport Indonesia's joint venture share of proceeds is expected to approximate $95 million.
