NEW ORLEANS, LA, January 18, 2005 -- Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (NYSE: FCX) reported fourth-quarter 2004 net income applicable to common stock of $212.5 million, $1.08 per share, compared with fourth-quarter 2003 net income of $0.2 million. Fourth-quarter 2004 included net additions to income before taxes and minority interests of $111.7 million ($64.6 million to net income or $0.29 per share) for the following items: $95.0 million ($48.8 million to net income or $0.22 per share) gain from insurance proceeds related to the fourth-quarter 2003 events at the Grasberg open pit; $21.3 million ($20.4 million to net income or $0.09 per share) gain from the sale of a parcel of land in Arizona held by an FCX joint venture; $7.5 million ($0.03 per share) gain to net income from Atlantic Copper's sale of its wi re rod and wire assets; and a $12.0 million ($0.05 per share) charge to net income related to Atlantic Copper's workforce reduction plan. Fourth-quarter 2003 included reductions to income before taxes and minority interests of $8.4 million ($4.3 million to net income or $0.02 per share) for equipment damaged in the October 9, 2003 slippage at the Grasberg open pit and $2.0 million ($2.0 million to net income or $0.01 per share) for early extinguishment and conversion of debt.
 
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, FCX reported net income applicable to common stock of $156.8 million, $0.85 per share, compared with net income of $154.2 million, $0.97 per share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. Net additions to 2004 income before taxes and minority interests of $102.7 million ($56.4 million to net income or $0.30 per share) included the fourth-quarter 2004 net gains of $111.7 million ($64.6 million to net income or $0.35 per share) described above; a $14.0 million ($13.8 million to net income or $0.07 per share) loss on early extinguishment and conversion of debt; a $6.4 million ($6.3 million to net income or $0.03 per share) gain on reduction of interest expense for conversion of debt; and a $1.4 million ($0.7 million to net income or less than $0.01 per share) loss on the redemption of Silver-Denominated Preferred Stock. In addition to the fourth-quarter 2003 items discussed above, 2003 results included reductions to income before taxes and minority interests of $32.6 million ($29.9 million to net income or $0.19 per share) for early extinguishment and conversion of debt and a gain of $23.8 million ($12.2 million to net income or $0.08 per share) on the redemption of Gold- and Silver-Denominated Preferred Stock.
 
SUMMARY FINANCIAL TABLE
 
 James R. Moffett, Chairman of the Board of FCX, and Richard C. Adkerson, President and Chief Executive Officer of FCX, said, "Our strong fourth
   
-quarter performance reflects the important accomplishments made by our operating team during 2004 to restore safe access to our higher grade ore areas in the Grasberg open pit. With estimated 2005 sales of 1.5 billion pounds of copper and 2.9 million ounces of gold, representing increases of 50 percent for copper and 100 percent for gold from 2004 levels, we are well positioned to generate excellent operational and financial results in 2005. We were successful again in 2004 in adding to our reserves and look forward to pursuing additional exploration opportunities to enhance the value of the Grasberg district for the benefit of shareholders."
 
PT-FI PRODUCTION AND SALES
PT-FI reported significantly higher production and sales in the fourth quarter of 2004, compared with the 2003 quarter, reflecting the mining of higher grade material in the Grasberg pit in 2004 and the limited mining of higher grade ore in the fourth quarter of 2003 following the Grasberg open pit slippage events. Following the events, PT-FI accelerated the removal of waste material and mined low grade ore prior to restoring safe access to higher grade ore areas in the second quarter of 2004 and resuming normal milling rates in June 2004. Mill throughput during the fourth quarter of 2004 averaged 229,800 metric tons of ore per day compared with 142,100 metric tons of ore in the fourth quarter of 2003 and 170,100 metric tons of ore during the first nine months of 2004.
 
 
Fourth-quarter 2004 copper ore grades averaged 1.17 percent, compared with 0.77 percent for the fourth quarter of 2003 and 0.73 percent for the first nine months of 2004. Full-year 2004 copper ore grades averaged 0.87 percent, compared with 1.09 percent
for
2003. Fourth-quarter 2004 copper recovery rates were 90.7 percent, compared with 86.7 percent for the fourth quarter of 2003. Full-year 2004 copper recovery rates were 88.6 percent, compared with 89.0 percent for 2003.
 
For the fourth quarter of 2004, gold ore grades averaged 1.20 grams per metric ton (g/t), compared with 1.00 g/t for the fourth quarter of 2003 and 0.73 g/t for the first nine months of 2004. Full-year 2004 gold ore grades averaged 0.88 g/t, compared with 1.54 g/t for 2003. Gold recovery rates averaged 82.3 percent for the fourth quarter of 2004, compared with 84.8 percent for the fourth quarter of 2003. Full-year 2004 gold recovery rates were 81.8 percent, compared with 87.3 percent for 2003.
 
Production from PT-FI's Deep Ore Zone (DOZ) underground mine averaged 40,200 metric tons of ore per day, representing 17 percent of total fourth-quarter 2004 mill throughput. DOZ operations continue to perform above design capacity of 35,000 metric tons of ore per day. PT-FI is expanding the capacity of the DOZ underground operation to 50,000 metric tons per day with the installation of a second crusher and additional ventilation. PT-FI's share of capital expenditures for the DOZ expansion are expected to approximate $37 million, with approximately $19 million estimated for 2005. The DOZ mine, a block cave operation, is one of the world's largest underground operations.
 
Realized copper prices improved by 44 percent to an average of $1.43 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2004 from $0.99 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2003. London Metal Exchange (LME) copper prices approximated $1.43 per pound on January 17, 2004. Gold realized prices improved by 12 percent to an average of $432.57 per ounce in the fourth quarter of 2004 from $386.87 in the fourth quarter of 2003. London gold prices approximated $422 per ounce on January 17, 2004.
 
PT-FI expects its share of sales for the first quarter of 2005 to approximate 310 million pounds of copper and 520,000 ounces of gold and annual 2005 sales to approximate 1.5 billion pounds of copper and 2.9 million ounces of gold. Because of the nature of the Grasberg ore body, the sequencing in mining will cause ore grades to vary from quarter to quarter, particularly for gold. Based on the current mine plan for 2005, PT-FI estimates approximately 54 percent of its copper and 60 percent of its gold will be sold in the second half of the year.
 
At December 31, 2004, FCX's concentrate sales included 292.2 million pounds of copper, priced at an average of $1.45 per pound, subject to final pricing over the next few months. Each $0.02 change in the price realized from the December 31 price would result in an approximate $3 million effect on FCX's 2005 net income. Fourth-quarter 2004 adjustments to concentrate sales recognized in prior quarters decreased revenues by $6.6 million ($3.4 million to net income, $0.02 per share) compared with an increase of $14.5 million ($7.5 million to net income, $0.04 per share) in the fourth quarter of 2003.
 
NET CASH PRODUCTION COSTS
(CREDITS)
(a)
 
 
PT-FI's unit net cash production costs, including gold and silver credits, averaged $0.17 per pound of copper during the fourth quarter of 2004, compared with $0.39 per pound for the 2003 quarter. Unit production and delivery costs will vary with fluctuations in production volumes because of the primarily fixed nature of PT-FI's cost structure. Unit production and delivery costs include the amortization of previously deferred mining costs of less than $0.01 per pound ($3.6 million) in the fourth quarter of 2004, and the deferral of mining costs of $0.17 per pound ($27.0 million) in the fourth quarter of 2003 reflecting PT-FI's accelerated waste removal efforts. PT-FI's fourth-quarter 2004 waste to ore ratio averaged 2.3 to 1, compared with a life-of-mine average ratio of 2.4 to 1. PT-FI's copp er royalty rate under its Contract of Work varies from 1.5 percent of copper net revenues at a copper price of $0.90 or less per pound and proportionally up to 3.5 percent at a copper price of $1.10 or more per pound. In addition, treatment charges vary based on PT-FI's customer mix and changes in copper prices.
 
Assuming 2005 average copper prices of $1.35 per pound and average gold prices of $420 per ounce, PT-FI estimates that its gold credits would essentially offset its cash production costs, resulting in net cash production costs of approximately zero cents per pound for the year 2005. Estimated unit cash costs for 2005 are projected to be significantly lower than the 2004 average, primarily because of higher 2005 sales volumes, partially offset by increases in energy costs, higher mining and milling rates and other factors. Net unit cash production costs for 2005 would change by approximately $0.05 per pound for each $25 per ounce change in the average price of gold. Forecasted unit costs are calculated on the same basis as the historical unit costs discussed above and reconciled in the attached presentation, "Prod uct Revenues and Production Costs."
 
SMELTER OPERATIONS
FCX's investment in smelters serves an important role in its concentrate marketing strategy. Through downstream integration, FCX assures placement of a significant portion of its concentrate production. While low smelter treatment and refining charges in recent years adversely affected the operating results of FCX's smelter operations, they benefited operating results of its mining operations, effectively achieving a hedge for these charges. Treatment and refining charge rates have increased significantly in recent months. Higher future treatment and refining charges will benefit FCX's smelter operations and adversely affect its mining operations. Taking into account taxes and minority ownership interests, an equivalent change in smelting and refining charge rates would essentially offset in FCX's consolidated operating results.
 
Atlantic Copper, FCX's wholly owned Spanish smelting unit, treated 220,200 metric tons of concentrate and scrap in the fourth quarter of 2004, compared with 224,700 metric tons in the year-ago period. Atlantic Copper reported quarterly production of 127.4 million pounds of cathodes and sold 136.7 million pounds of cathodes, including wire rod and wire. Cathode production totaled 136.6 million pounds and sales totaled 140.8 million pounds during the fourth quarter of 2003. Treatment charges received by Atlantic Copper averaged $0.16 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2004 and $0.17 per pound during the fourth quarter of 2003. Unit cathode cash production costs averaged $0.19 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the year-ago period, reflecting the effects of the stronger euro on Atlantic Copper's costs reported in U.S. dollars.
 
Atlantic Copper reported operating losses of $21.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2004, compared with $12.3 million in the 2003 period. The higher losses in 2004 included a $12.0 million charge for workforce reductions, lower treatment charges and lower production levels, compared with the fourth quarter of 2003. Atlantic Copper's fourth-quarter 2004 production was adversely affected by four days of outages in October for a labor strike at its Huelva smelter facility and four days for repairs to its waste-heat boiler. During 2004, Atlantic Copper undertook a cost reduction and operational enhancement plan designed to reduce unit costs, including a reduction in workforce, and enhance operational and administrative efficiencies. In addition, in December 2004, Atlantic Copper completed a sale of its wire rod and wire assets for $18.3 million, resulting in a $7.5 million gain on sale of assets. The sale will enable Atlantic Copper to streamline its management structure and reduce working capital requirements. These actions, together with recently negotiated higher treatment charges for 2005, are expected to benefit operating results for Atlantic Copper in 2005.
 
PT Smelting, PT-FI's 25 percent-owned Indonesian smelting unit, treated 227,300 metric tons of concentrate in the fourth quarter of 2004, compared with 194,200 metric tons in the year-ago period. PT Smelting reported quarterly production of 143.8 million pounds of cathodes and sales of 145.4 million pounds of cathodes. Cathode production totaled 122.1 million pounds and sales totaled 124.9 million pounds during the fourth quarter of 2003. PT Smelting's copper cathode cash production costs totaled $0.09 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2004 and $0.10 per pound in the year-ago period. PT-FI's equity interest in PT Smelting's earnings totaled $2.3 million, $0.01 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2004 compared to $1.4 million, $0.01 per share, in the 2003 quarter.
 
FCX defers recognition of profits on PT-FI's sales to Atlantic Copper and on 25 percent of PT-FI's sales to PT Smelting until the final sales to third parties occur. These net deferrals will be recognized in future periods and resulted in a reduction to FCX's net income totaling $24.8 million, $0.11 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2004, compared with an addition totaling $23.1 million, $0.13 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2003. At December 31, 2004, FCX's net deferred profits to be recognized in net income in future periods totaled $41.6 million. Based on current copper and gold prices and shipping schedules, FCX expects that a deferral of profits on intercompany sales will result in a decrease to net income of $22 million in the first quarter of 2005 as PT-FI's production and shipmen ts to affiliated smelters continue to increase. The actual change in deferred intercompany profits may differ substantially because of changes in the timing of shipments to affiliated smelters and metal prices.
 
RESERVE ADDITIONS
 
During 2004, net additions/revisions to the aggregate proven and probable reserves at the Grasberg mining complex totaled approximately 141 million metric tons of ore. The additions were the result of positive drilling results at the Deep MLZ deposit, a 146 million metric ton ore body with average grades of 1.22 percent copper and 0.95 g/t gold. Additional engineering studies evaluating drilling results on the western side of the ore body are expected to be completed in 2005 and could increase the size of the ore body. Year-end aggregate proven and probable recoverable reserves, net of 2004 production, were 2.8 billion metric tons of ore averaging 1.09 percent copper, 0.98 g/t gold and 3.87 g/t silver. Estimated recoverable reserves were assessed using a copper price of $0.85 per pound and a gold price of $270 per oun ce. With respect to the proven and probable reserves, if metal prices were adjusted to the approximate average London spot prices of the past three years ($0.94 per pound for copper and $361 per ounce for gold), the additions to proven and probable reserves would not be material to reported reserves.
 
Pursuant to joint venture arrangements between PT-FI and Rio Tinto, Rio Tinto has a 40 percent interest in future production from reserves above those reported at December 31, 1994. Net of Rio Tinto's share, PT-FI's share of proven and probable reserves at December 31, 2004, was 40.7 billion pounds of copper, 46.6 million ounces of gold and 125.2 million ounces of silver. The increases in reserves replaced approximately 200 percent of PT-FI's 2004 copper production, 100 percent of its 2004 gold production and 350 percent of its 2004 silver production. FCX has a 90.6 percent equity interest in PT-FI's share of proven and probable reserves.
 
PT-FI's exploration efforts in 2005 will be focused on testing extensions of the MLZ and Deep MLZ deposits to the northwest, expansion of the Deep Grasberg resource, and testing reconnaissance targets along the Wanagon and Idenberg Fault trends. FCX expects its share of exploration costs to approximate $12 million. The resumption of exploration activities is being assessed in areas outside the existing producing area of the Grasberg mining district.
 
OPERATING CASH FLOWS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES and DEBT
FCX generated operating cash flows totaling $402.8 million during the fourth quarter of 2004 and $341.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, including $130.7 million in working capital requirements. FCX's fourth quarter cash flows benefited from the settlement of claims related to the slippage and debris flow events. The insurers agreed to pay an aggregate of $125 million, inclusive of the $20 million advance paid to FCX in the third quarter of 2004. FCX's share of the settlement totaled $95.0 million ($48.8 million to net income or $0.22 per share). Capital expenditures totaled $141.0 million in 2004 and are expected to total approximately $180 million in 2005.
 
Using estimated sales volumes projected for 2005 and prices of $1.35 per pound of copper and $420 per ounce of gold, FCX would generate operating cash flows in excess of $1.1 billion in 2005. Each $0.10 per pound change in copper prices would affect 2005 cash flows by approximately $75 million and each $25 per ounce change in gold prices would affect 2005 cash flows by approximately $36 million.
 
Total debt at December 31, 2004 approximated $1.95 billion, $1.40 billion net of approximately $552 million of cash and restricted investments, a net debt reduction of $330 million from December 31, 2003. Scheduled 2005 debt maturities total $78.2 million and FCX is considering additional debt prepayment options.
 
FINANCIAL POLICY
Based on current mine plans and copper and gold markets, FCX expects to generate significant cash flows above its budgeted capital expenditures and scheduled debt maturities over the next several years. In October 2004, FCX's Board of Directors authorized an increase in the common stock dividend from an annual rate of $0.80 per share to $1.00 per share, which is payable quarterly ($0.25 per share). In December 2004, FCX's Board of Directors authorized a supplemental common stock dividend of $0.25 per share, which was paid on December 29, 2004. The potential payment of any regular or future supplemental dividends will be determined by FCX's Board of Directors.
 
During 2004, FCX purchased 3.4 million shares of its common stock for $99.5 million ($29.39 per share average) under its 20-million-share purchase program and 23.9 million shares of common stock from Rio Tinto for $881.9 million (approximately $36.85 per share). On December 31, 2004, FCX had outstanding 179.0 million shares of common stock. As of January 17, 2005, 16.6 million shares remain available for purchase under FCX's share purchase program. The timing of future purchases of FCX's common stock is dependent upon many factors including the price of its common shares, its cash flows and financial position, and general economic and market conditions.
 
 
 
FCX explores for, develops, mines and processes ore containing copper, gold and silver in Indonesia, and smelts and refines copper concentrates in Spain and Indonesia. Additional information on FCX is available on our web site,

Cautionary Statement and Regulation G Disclosure.
This press release contains forward-looking statements in which we discuss factors we believe may affect our performance in the future. Forward-looking statements are all statements other than historical facts, such as statements regarding estimated anticipated sales volumes, projected unit production costs, projected operating cash flows, projected capital expenditures, projected exploration expenditures, the impact of copper and gold price changes, and the impact of changes in deferred intercompany profits on earnings. Accuracy of the projections depends on assumptions about events that change over time and is thus susceptible to periodic change based on actual experience and new developments. The declaration and payment of dividends is at the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors and will depend on the Company's financial results, cash requirements, future prospects, and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. FCX cautions readers that it assumes no obligation to update or publicly release any revisions to the projections in this press release and, except to the extent required by applicable law, does not intend to update or otherwise revise the projections more frequently than quarterly. Additionally, important factors that might cause future results to differ from these projections include industry risks, commodity prices, Indonesian political risks, weather-related risks, currency translation risks and other factors described in FCX's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
This press release also contains certain financial measures such as net cash production costs (credits) per pound of copper and cathode cash production costs per pound of copper. As required by Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G, reconciliations of these measures to amounts reported in FCX's consolidated financial statements are provided in the attachments to this press release.
 
A copy of this press release is available on our web site, "www.fcx.com." A conference call with securities analysts about fourth-quarter 2004 results is scheduled for today at 10:00 a.m. EDT. The conference call will be broadcast on the Internet along with slides. Interested parties may listen to the webcast live and view the slides by accessing "www.fcx.com." A replay of the webcast will be available through Friday, February 11, 2005.
 
 
a. Fo
r a reconciliation of cathode cash production costs per pound to production costs applicable to sales reported in FCX's consolidated financial statements refer to the attached presentation, "Cathode Cash Production Costs."
 
PT FREEPORT INDONESIA PRODUCT REVENUES AND NET CASH PRODUCTION COSTS
Net cash production costs per pound of copper is a measure intended to provide investors with information about the cash generating capacity of PT Freeport Indonesia's mining operations in Indonesia. PT Freeport Indonesia uses this measure for the same purpose and for monitoring operating performance at its mining operations. This information differs from measures of performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. This measure is presented by other copper and gold mining companies, although PT Freeport Indonesia's measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
PT Freeport Indonesia calculates gross profit per pound of copper under a "by-product" method, while the copper, gold and silver contained within its concentrates are treated as co-products in its financial statements. PT Freeport Indonesia uses the by-product method in its presentation of gross profit per pound of copper because (1) the majority of its revenues are copper revenues, (2) it produces and sells one product, concentrates, which contains all three metals and (3) it is not possible to specifically assign its costs to revenues from the copper, gold and silver it produces in concentrates. In the co-product method presentation below, costs are allocated to the different products based on their relative revenue values.
In both the by-product and the co-product method calculations below PT Freeport Indonesia shows adjustments to revenues for prior period open sales and for hedging as separate line items. Because the copper pricing adjustments do not result from current period sales, PT Freeport Indonesia has reflected these separately from revenues on current period sales. Hedging adjustments are shown with pricing adjustments because they result from transactions outside of our sales contracts. Noncash and other nonrecurring costs, which consist of items such as write-offs of equipment or unusual charges, are generally not material but are removed from site production and delivery costs in the calculation of net cash production costs (credits). As discussed above, gold and silver revenues are reflected as credits against site productio n and delivery costs in the by-product method. PT Freeport Indonesia's gross profit totals are before considering the impact of the elimination of its share of profits on its sales to PT Smelting.
Presentations under both methods are presented below along with a reconciliation to amounts reported in FCX's consolidated financial statements.
 
 
ATLANTIC COPPER CATHODE CASH PRODUCTION COST PER POUND OF COPPER
Atlantic Copper cathode cash production cost per pound of copper is a measure intended to provide investors with information about the costs it incurs to produce cathodes at its smelting operations in Spain. Atlantic Copper uses this measure for the same purpose and for monitoring operating performance at its smelting operations. This information differs from measures of performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Other smelting companies present this measure, although Atlantic Copper's measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The reconciliation below starts with reported p roduction costs for our smelting and refining segment (Atlantic Copper) and subtracts or adds those costs that do not directly relate to the process of converting copper concentrates to cathodes. The adjusted production costs amounts are used to calculate Atlantic Copper's cathode cash production cost per pound of copper (in thousands, except per pound amounts):
 
PT SMELTING CATHODE CASH PRODUCTION COST PER POUND OF COPPER
PT Smelting cathode cash production cost per pound of copper is a measure intended to provide investors with information about the costs it incurs to produce cathodes at its smelting operations in Indonesia. PT Smelting uses this measure for the same purpose and for monitoring operating performance at its smelting operations. This information differs from measures of performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Other smelting companies present this measure, although PT Smelting's measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The calculation below starts with PT Smelting's re ported operating costs and subtracts or adds those costs that do not directly relate to the process of converting copper concentrates to cathodes. PT Smelting's operating costs are then reconciled to FCX's equity in PT Smelting earnings (losses) reported in FCX's consolidated financial statements (in thousands, except per pound amounts):
 
PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES
PT Freeport Indonesia's Contract of Work provides for a 35 percent corporate income tax rate. PT Indocopper Investama (100 percent owned by FCX) will pay a 30 percent corporate income tax on dividends it receives from its 9.36 percent ownership in PT Freeport Indonesia. In addition, the tax treaty between Indonesia and the United States provides for a withholding tax rate of 10 percent on dividends and interest that PT Freeport Indonesia and PT Indocopper Investama pay to the FCX parent company. FCX also incurs a U.S. alternative minimum tax at a rate of two percent based primarily on consolidated income, net of smelting and refining results. As a result of the enactment of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, the 90 percent limitation on the use of foreign tax credits to offset the US federal alternative minimum tax liability has been repealed effective January 1, 2005. Based on current projections, FCX expects that the removal of this limitation will significantly reduce its US federal taxes beginning in 2005. In 2004, FCX's US federal alternative minimum tax liability totaled $8.2 million. FCX currently records no income taxes at Atlantic Copper, which is subject to taxation in Spain, because it has not generated significant taxable income in recent years and has substantial tax loss carryforwards for which FCX has provided no financial statement benefit. FCX receives no consolidated tax benefit from these losses because they cannot be used to offset PT Freeport Indonesia's profits in Indonesia.
Parent company costs consist primarily of interest, depreciation and amortization, and general and administrative expenses. FCX receives minimal tax benefit from these costs, including interest expense, primarily because the parent company generates no taxable income from US sources. As a result, FCX's provision for income taxes as a percentage of consolidated income before income taxes and minority interests will vary as PT Freeport Indonesia's income changes absent changes in Atlantic Copper and parent company costs. Summaries of the approximate significant components of the calculation of the consolidated provision for income taxes are shown below (in thousands, except percentages).
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
FCX has two operating segments: "mining and exploration" and "smelting and refining." The mining and exploration segment consists of FCX's Indonesian activities including PT Freeport Indonesia's copper and gold mining operations, PT Puncakjaya Power's power generating operations after eliminations with PT Freeport Indonesia and FCX's Indonesian exploration activities. The smelting and refining segment includes Atlantic Copper's operations in Spain and PT Freeport Indonesia's equity investment in PT Smelting in Gresik, Indonesia. The segment data presented below were prepared on the same basis as
FCX's consolidated financial statements.
