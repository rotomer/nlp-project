SUMMARY FINANCIAL TABLE
 
b)
 
Diluted net income per share for the first quarter of 2005 reflects
assumed conversion of FCX's 7% Convertible Senior Notes, resulting in the exclusion of interest charged to expense totaling $10.3 million and the inclusion of 18.6 million shares. This instrument was not dilutive for the first quarter of 2004.
 
 
NEW ORLEANS, LA, April 19, 2005 -- Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (NYSE: FCX) reported first-quarter 2005 net income applicable to common stock of $130.4 million, $0.70 per share, compared with a net loss of $19.6 million, $0.10 per share, for the first quarter of 2004. The first-quarter 2004 results reflected accelerated waste removal efforts resulting in the mining of low-grade ore following the pit wall slippage at the Grasberg mine during the fourth quarter of 2003.
 
James R. Moffett, Chairman of the Board of FCX, and Richard C. Adkerson, President and Chief Executive Officer of FCX, said, "The theme of our 2004 Annual Report, 'Making the Grade,' reflects the resumption of mining high-grade Grasberg ore beginning late in 2004 and accelerating during 2005. We made important progress in the first quarter and expect exceptional results during the remainder of the year. Our operations are projected to generate significant cash flows for the benefit of our investors in 2005 and beyond from our long-lived, low-cost, unhedged copper and gold reserves."
 
PT-FI PRODUCTION AND SALES
PT Freeport Indonesia (PT-FI), FCX's Indonesian mining unit, achieved significantly higher production and sales in the first quarter of 2005 compared with the 2004 period, reflecting the return to normal mining operations in the Grasberg open pit. Ore grades, mill recoveries and milling rates were significantly higher than the 2004 first quarter. Realized copper and gold prices also were higher than in 2004's first quarter.
 
 
First-quarter 2005 copper ore grades averaged 1.14 percent, compared with 0.50 percent for the first quarter of 2004. First-quarter 2005 copper recovery rates were 89.6 percent, compared with 83.8 percent for the first quarter of 2004.
 
For the first quarter of 2005, gold ore grades averaged 1.62 grams per metric ton (g/t), compared with 0.41 g/t for the first quarter of 2004. Gold recovery rates averaged 82.7 percent for the first quarter of 2005, compared with 73.8 percent for the first quarter of 2004.
 
Mill throughput, which varies depending on ore types being processed, averaged 199,400 metric tons of ore per day in the first quarter of 2005 compared with 151,800 metric tons of ore in the first quarter of 2004. Mill rates in the first quarter of 2005 reflect the processing of hard ores and mill maintenance activities. Mill rates are projected to average over 230,000 metric tons of ore per day during the remainder of 2005. Production from PT-FI's Deep Ore Zone (DOZ) underground mine averaged 42,100 metric tons of ore per day in the first quarter of 2005, representing 21 percent of mill throughput as it continued to perform above design capacity of 35,000 metric tons of ore per day. PT-FI is expanding the capacity of the DOZ underground operation to a sustained rate of 50,000 metric tons per day with the installation of a second crusher and additional ventilation, expected to be completed by 2007. The DOZ mine, a block cave operation, is one of the world's largest underground mines.
 
Realized copper prices improved by 13 percent to an average of $1.51 per pound in the first quarter of 2005 from $1.34 in the first quarter of 2004. London Metal Exchange (LME) copper prices approximated $1.52 per pound on April 18, 2005. Realized gold prices improved by four
 
2
 
percent to an average of $426.74 per ounce in the first quarter of 2005 from $411.42 in the first quarter of 2004. London gold prices approximated $426 per ounce on April 18, 2005.
 
PT-FI expects its share of sales for 2005 to approximate 1.5 billion pounds of copper and 2.9 million ounces of gold. At the Grasberg mine, the sequencing in mining areas with varying ore grades will cause fluctuation in metal sales from quarter to quarter, particularly for gold. Based on the current mine plan for 2005, PT-FI estimates approximately 55 percent of its copper and 57 percent of its gold will be sold in the second half of the year. PT-FI expects its sales for the second quarter of 2005 to approximate 340 million pounds of copper and 650 thousand ounces of gold.
 
At March 31, 2005, FCX's concentrate sales included 239.0 million pounds of copper, priced at an average of $1.52 per pound, subject to final pricing over the next few months. Each $0.02 change in the price realized from the March 31 price would result in an approximate $2.5 million effect on FCX's 2005 net income. First-quarter 2005 adjustments to concentrate sales recognized in prior quarters increased revenues by $9.9 million ($5.2 million to net income, $0.03 per share) compared with an increase of $7.6 million ($3.9 million to net income, $0.02 per share) in the first quarter of 2004.
 
UNIT NET CASH COSTS
 
 
PT-FI's unit net cash costs, including gold and silver credits, averaged $0.07 per pound of copper during the first quarter of 2005. The significant reduction in unit costs from the first quarter of 2004 reflects the expected increase in 2005 sales of copper and gold following PT-FI's accelerated waste removal efforts in 2004. Unit site production and delivery costs will vary with fluctuations in production volumes because of the primarily fixed nature of PT-FI's cost structure. Unit site production and delivery costs are net of deferred mining costs of $0.10 per pound ($32.2 million) in the first quarter of 2005 and $0.25 per pound ($26.2 million) in the first quarter of 2004. PT-FI's first-quarter 2005 waste-to-ore ratio averaged 4.3 to 1, compared with a life-of-mine average ratio of 2.4 to 1. PT-FI's waste-to-ore ratio is expected to average approximately 3.0 to 1 in the balance of the year.
 
Assuming 2005 average copper prices of $1.40 per pound and average gold prices of $420 per ounce, PT-FI estimates that its annual 2005 unit net cash costs, including gold and silver credits, would approximate $0.03 per pound, net of deferred mining costs of $0.05 per pound. PT-FI's site production and delivery costs have been negatively affected by continued increases in energy costs, currency exchange rates, higher maintenance costs and other factors. Unit net cash costs for 2005 would change by approximately $0.04 per pound for each $25 per ounce change in the average price of gold for the balance of the year. Forecasted unit net cash costs are calculated on the same basis as the historical unit net costs discussed above and reconciled in the attached presentation, "Product Revenues and Production Costs."
 
SMELTER OPERATIONS
FCX's investment in smelters serves an important role in its concentrate marketing strategy. Through downstream integration, FCX assures placement of a significant portion of its concentrate production. While low smelter treatment and refining charges in recent years adversely affected the results of FCX's smelter operations, they benefited the operating results of PT-FI's mining operations. Market rates for treatment and refining charges increased significantly
 
3
 
in late 2004. Higher treatment and refining charges will benefit FCX's smelter operations and adversely affect its mining operations. Taking into account taxes and minority ownership interests, an equivalent change in smelting and refining charges essentially offset in FCX's consolidated operating results.
 
Atlantic Copper, FCX's wholly owned Spanish smelting unit, treated 215,800 metric tons of concentrate and scrap in the first quarter of 2005, compared with 187,100 metric tons in the year-ago period. Atlantic Copper reported quarterly production of 131.7 million pounds of cathodes and sold 132.6 million pounds of cathodes. Cathode production totaled 128.8 million pounds and sales totaled 112.0 million pounds during the first quarter of 2004. Treatment charges received by Atlantic Copper averaged $0.17 per pound during the first quarter of 2005 and $0.16 per pound during the first quarter of 2004. As discussed above, treatment charge rates began to increase in late 2004 and Atlantic Copper expects these higher rates to benefit its 2005 operations, with Atlantic Copper's average rates projected to approximate $0.22 per pound in the balance of the year at current copper prices. Cathode cash unit costs averaged $0.17
 
per pound in the first quarter of 2005 and $0.23 per pound for the year-ago period. Unit costs in 2004 were adversely affected by lower production primarily because of the scheduled maintenance turnaround, which began in March 2004 and added $0.04 per pound in 2004's first quarter.
 
Atlantic Copper reported operating losses of $1.6 million for the first quarter of 2005, compared with $10.9 million of operating losses in the 2004 period. During the first quarter of 2004, Atlantic Copper's maintenance turnaround adversely affected costs and volumes resulting in an approximate $4.6 million higher operating loss. Higher treatment and refining charge rates are expected to benefit Atlantic Copper's operating results for the balance of 2005. Each $0.01 change in treatment and refining charge rates equates to $6 million in Atlantic Copper annual operating income.
 
PT Smelting, PT-FI's 25 percent-owned Indonesian smelting unit, treated 226,400 metric tons of concentrates in the first quarter of 2005, compared with 167,300 metric tons in the year-ago period. PT Smelting reported quarterly production of 143.5 million pounds of cathodes and 97.0 million pounds during the first quarter of 2004. PT Smelting's cathode cash unit costs per pound totaled $0.10
 
per pound in the first quarter of 2005 and $0.14
 
per pound in the year-ago period, reflecting the impact of higher volumes in 2005. PT-FI's equity interest in PT Smelting's earnings (losses) totaled $2.6 million, $0.01 per share, in the first quarter of 2005 compared to $(0.4) million, $(0.002) per share, in the 2004 quarter.
 
FCX defers recognition of profits on PT-FI's sales to Atlantic Copper and on 25 percent of PT-FI's sales to PT Smelting until the final sales to third parties occur. These net deferrals will be recognized in future periods and resulted in a reduction to FCX's net income totaling $34.2 million, $0.17 per share, in the first quarter of 2005 and an addition to FCX's net income totaling $24.8 million, $0.13 per share, in the first quarter of 2004. At March 31, 2005, FCX's net deferred profits to be recognized in net income in future periods totaled $76.1 million. Based on current copper and gold prices and shipping schedules, FCX expects that a net reversal of previously deferred profits on intercompany sales will result in an increase to net income of $10 million in the second quarter of 2005. The periodic change in deferred intercompany profits may differ substantially because of changes in the timing of shipments to affiliated smelters and metal prices.
 
EXPLORATION and MINE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES
PT-FI's exploration efforts in 2005 are focused on testing extensions of the Mill Level Zone (MLZ) and Deep MLZ deposits to the northwest, expansion of the Deep Grasberg resource and testing reconnaissance targets along the Wanagon and Idenberg Fault trends, which are expected to result in approximately $15 million of exploration costs during 2005. FCX continues to assess the timing of resumption of exploration activities in areas outside the existing producing area of the Grasberg mining district.
 
In 2004, PT-FI commenced its Common Infrastructure project, which will provide access to its large undeveloped underground ore bodies located in the Grasberg mining district through a
 
4
 
tunnel system located approximately 400 meters deeper than its existing underground tunnel system. The Common Infrastructure project is progressing according to plan.
 
PT-FI is also completing studies for the development of Big Gossan, a high-grade deposit located near the existing milling complex. The engineering design for Big Gossan includes 44 million metric tons of ore, grading 2.5 percent copper and 1.2 g/t of gold, expected to yield aggregate (i.e. including our joint venture partner's share) payable copper of 2.3 billion pounds and aggregate payable gold of 1.1 million ounces. Aggregate capital expenditures for Big Gossan to be incurred over a four-year period beginning in 2006 total approximately $225 million, $195 million net to PT-FI, with a ramp-up to full production of 7,000 metric tons per day by 2010 (average annual aggregate incremental production of 135 million pounds of copper and 65,000 ounces of gold, with PT-FI receiving 60 percent of these amounts).
 
CASH FLOWS and DEBT
FCX generated operating cash flows totaling $162.2 million during the first quarter of 2005. Using estimated sales volumes for the remainder of 2005 and assuming prices of $1.40 per pound of copper and $420 per ounce of gold for the remainder of 2005, FCX would generate operating cash flows in excess of $1.2 billion in 2005, with over $1.0 billion in the remaining three quarters of the year. Each $0.10 per pound change in copper prices in the balance of the year would affect 2005 cash flows by approximately $60 million and each $25 per ounce change in gold prices would affect 2005 cash flows by approximately $30 million. First-quarter 2005 capital expenditures totaled $26.2 million. FCX's capital expenditures for 2005 are estimated to approximate $180 million.
 
Total debt at March 31, 2005 approximated $1.77 billion, $1.46 billion net of $310.5 million of cash. Total debt was reduced by $183.0 million during the quarter, primarily reflecting a prepayment of $187.0 million of bank debt associated with power-generating facilities at the Grasberg mine and repurchases of $11.0 million of its 7.50% Senior Notes due 2006 and 7.20% Senior Notes due 2026, net of changes in other borrowings. Following the first quarter debt repayments, scheduled debt maturities for the remainder of 2005 total $22.0 million.
 
FINANCIAL POLICY
Based on current mine plans and subject to future copper and gold prices, FCX expects to generate significant cash flows above its budgeted capital expenditures and scheduled debt maturities, providing opportunities to reduce debt further and return cash to shareholders through dividends and share purchases. In addition, FCX's Board of Directors will continue to review FCX's dividend policy. FCX's current annual common stock dividend is $1.00 per share, which is payable quarterly ($0.25 per share). In addition, two supplemental common stock dividends totaling $0.75 per share have been paid, $0.25 per share on December 29, 2004 and $0.50 per share on March 31, 2005.
 
On March 31, 2005, FCX had outstanding 179.7 million shares of common stock. As of April 18, 2005, 16.6 million shares remain available for purchase under FCX's share purchase program. No shares were purchased during the first quarter of 2005. The timing of future purchases of FCX's common stock is dependent upon a number of factors including the price of its common shares, its cash flows and financial position, and general economic and market conditions.
 
FCX explores for, develops, mines and processes ore containing copper, gold and silver in Indonesia, and smelts and refines copper concentrates in Spain and Indonesia. Additional information on FCX is available on our web site,

PT FREEPORT INDONESIA PRODUCT REVENUES AND UNIT NET CASH COSTS
Unit net cash costs per pound of copper is a measure intended to provide investors with information about the cash generating capacity of PT Freeport Indonesia's mining operations expressed on a basis relating to its primary metal product, copper. PT Freeport Indonesia uses this measure for the same purpose and for monitoring operating performance by its mining operations. This information differs from measures of performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. This measure is presented by other copper and gold mining companies, although PT Freeport Indonesia's measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
PT Freeport Indonesia calculates gross profit per pound of copper under a "by-product" method, while the copper, gold and silver contained within its concentrates are treated as co-products in its financial statements. PT Freeport Indonesia uses the by-product method in its presentation of gross profit per pound of copper because (1) the majority of its revenues are copper revenues, (2) it produces and sells one product, concentrates, which contains all three metals and (3) it is not possible to specifically assign PT Freeport Indonesia's costs to revenues from the copper, gold and silver it produces in concentrates. In the co-product method presentation below, costs are allocated to the different products based on their relative revenue values.
In both the by-product and the co-product method calculations below, PT Freeport Indonesia shows adjustments to revenues for prior period open sales as separate line items. Because the copper pricing adjustments do not result from current period sales, PT Freeport Indonesia has reflected these separately from revenues on current period sales. Noncash and nonrecurring costs, which consist of items such as write-offs of equipment or unusual charges, have not been material. They are removed from site production and delivery costs in the calculation of unit net cash costs. As discussed above, gold and silver revenues are reflected as credits against site production and delivery costs in the by-product method. Presentations under both methods are shown below together with a reconciliation to amounts reported in FCX's consolidated financial statements.
 
 
 
 
 
ATLANTIC COPPER CATHODE CASH UNIT COST PER POUND OF COPPER
Atlantic Copper cathode cash unit cost per pound of copper is a measure intended to provide investors with information about the costs it incurs to produce cathodes at its smelting operations in Spain. FCX uses this measure for the same purpose and for monitoring operating performance at Atlantic Copper's smelting operations. This information differs from measures of performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Other smelting companies present this measure, although Atlantic Copper's measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The reconciliation below presents reported production costs for FCX's smelting and refining segment (Atlantic Copper) and subtracts or adds those costs that do not directly relate to the process of converting copper concentrates to cathodes. The adjusted production costs amounts are used to calculate Atlantic Copper's cathode cash unit cost per pound of copper (in thousands, except per pound amounts):
 
 
PT SMELTING CATHODE CASH UNIT COST PER POUND OF COPPER
PT Smelting cathode cash unit cost per pound of copper is a measure intended to provide investors with information about the costs it incurs to produce cathodes at its smelting operations in Indonesia. FCX uses this measure for the same purpose and for monitoring operating performance at PT Smelting's smelting operations. This information differs from measures of performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Other smelting companies present this measure, although PT Smelting's measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The calculation below presents PT Smelting's reported operating costs and subtracts or adds those costs that do not directly relate to the process of converting copper concentrates to cathodes. PT Smelting's operating costs are then reconciled to PT Freeport Indonesia's equity in PT Smelting earnings (losses) reported in FCX's consolidated financial statements (in thousands, except per pound amounts):
 
 
PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES
PT Freeport Indonesia's Contract of Work provides for a 35 percent corporate income tax rate. PT Indocopper Investama (100 percent owned by FCX) pays a 30 percent corporate income tax on dividends it receives from its 9.36 percent ownership in PT Freeport Indonesia. In addition, the tax treaty between Indonesia and the United States (U.S.) provides for a withholding tax rate of 10 percent on dividends and interest that PT Freeport Indonesia and PT Indocopper Investama pay to their parent company, FCX. FCX also incurred a U.S. alternative minimum tax at a rate of two percent based primarily on consolidated income, net of smelting and refining results. As a result of the enactment of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, the 90 percent limitation on the use of foreign tax credits to offset the U.S. federal alternative minimum tax liability has been repealed effective January 1, 2005. Based on current projections, FCX expects that the removal of this limitation will significantly reduce its U.S. federal taxes beginning in 2005. In 2004, FCX's U.S. federal alternative minimum tax liability totaled $8.2 million. FCX currently records no income taxes at Atlantic Copper, which is subject to taxation in Spain, because it has not generated significant taxable income in recent years and has substantial tax loss carryforwards for which FCX has provided no financial statement benefit. FCX receives no consolidated tax benefit from these losses because they cannot be used to offset PT Freeport Indonesia's profits in Indonesia.
Parent company costs consist primarily of interest, depreciation and amortization, and general and administrative expenses. FCX receives minimal tax benefit from these costs, including interest expense, primarily because the parent company generates no taxable income from U.S. sources. As a result, FCX's provision for income taxes as a percentage of its consolidated income before income taxes and minority interests will vary as PT Freeport Indonesia's income changes absent changes in Atlantic Copper and parent company costs. Summaries of the approximate significant components of the calculation of FCX's consolidated provision for income taxes are shown below (in thousands, except percentages).
 
 
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
FCX has two operating segments: "mining and exploration" and "smelting and refining." The mining and exploration segment consists of FCX's Indonesian activities including PT Freeport Indonesia's copper and gold mining operations, PT Puncakjaya Power's power-generating operations after eliminations with PT Freeport Indonesia and FCX's Indonesian exploration activities. The smelting and refining segment includes Atlantic Copper's operations in Spain and PT Freeport Indonesia's equity investment in PT Smelting in Gresik, Indonesia. The segment data presented below were prepared on the same basis as FCX's consolidated financial statements.
