HIGHLIGHTS
 
Second-quarter 2005 net income of $175.2 million, $0.91 per fully diluted share, compared with a net loss of $53.3 million, $0.30 per share, for the second quarter of 2004.
 
Second-quarter 2005 sales totaled 313.7 million pounds of copper and 616.4 thousand ounces of gold compared with 205.1 million pounds of copper and 351.1 thousand ounces of gold in the second quarter of 2004.
 
Projected annual sales for 2005 total approximately 1.47 billion pounds of copper and 2.8 million ounces of gold, including 380 million pounds of copper and 575 thousand ounces of gold for the third quarter and 450 million pounds of copper and 1,025 thousand ounces of gold for the fourth quarter.
 
FCXs operating cash flows totaled $458.3 million for the second quarter of 2005 and $620.5 million for the first half of 2005. If prices of $1.40 per pound of copper and $420 per ounce of gold were realized for the remainder of 2005, FCX estimates its 2005 operating cash flows would exceed $1.2 billion.
 
Total debt at June 30, 2005, approximated $1.78 billion, $1.20 billion net of $585.4 million of cash, a net reduction of approximately $200 million year-to-date.
 
Second-quarter 2005 purchases of 2.4 million FCX common shares for $80.2 million, average price of $33.83 per share. Approximately 14.2 million shares remain available under the Board authorized program.
 
Common stock dividends during the first half of 2005 totaled $179.7 million, $1.00 per share, including $90.0 million for a supplemental dividend of $0.50 per share paid on March 31, 2005.
 
FCXs Board of Directors authorized an additional supplemental dividend of $0.50 per share to be paid on September 30, 2005 to shareholders of record on September 15, 2005.
 
NEW ORLEANS, LA, July 19, 2005 -- Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (NYSE: FCX) reported second-quarter 2005 net income applicable to common stock of $175.2 million, $0.91 per fully-diluted share, compared with a net loss of $53.3 million, $0.30 per share, for the second quarter of 2004. For the six months ended June 30, 2005, FCX reported net income of $305.6 million, $1.62 per fully-diluted share, compared with a net loss of $72.9 million, $0.39 per share, in the 2004 period. Results for the 2005 periods primarily reflect substantially higher copper and gold sales volumes and prices than the 2004 periods, which were adversely affected by lower ore grades and reduced mill throughput as PT Freeport Indonesia (PT-FI), FCXs Indonesian mining unit, completed its efforts to restore safe access to the higher-grade ore areas in its Grasberg open-pit mine following the fourth-quarter 2003 slippage and debris flow events. First-half 2004 earnings were reduced by approximately $40 million, $0.21 per share, associated with Atlantic Coppers, FCXs wholly owned Spanish smelting unit, scheduled major maintenance turnaround.

SUMMARY FINANCIAL TABLE
b)
 
Diluted net income per share for the 2005 periods reflects
assumed conversion of FCXs 7% Convertible Senior Notes and 5% Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, resulting in the exclusion of interest expense totaling $10.3 million and dividends totaling $15.1 million for the second quarter and interest of $20.6 million and dividends of $30.3 million for the first six months of 2005, and the inclusion of 39.8 million shares for the second quarter and 39.7 million shares for the first six months of 2005. These instruments were not dilutive for the 2004 periods.
James R. Moffett, Chairman of the Board of FCX, and Richard C. Adkerson, President and Chief Executive Officer of FCX, said, Our second quarter and first half 2005 financial results reflect favorable market conditions for copper and gold as we mine high ore grades at our Grasberg operations. We look forward to continued strong results as we gain access to higher grade material in the balance of the year. We anticipate strong cash flows, allowing us to continue to strengthen our financial condition and provide returns to shareholders as we seek to maximize the values of our long-lived reserves.
 
PT-FI PRODUCTION AND SALES
PT-FI achieved significantly higher production and sales in the second quarter of 2005, reflecting higher ore grades and milling rates than in the 2004 second quarter. Realized copper and gold prices also were significantly higher than in the 2004 second quarter. Second-quarter copper and gold sales were below previous estimates (approximately 8 percent for copper and 5 percent for gold) as a result of lower ore grades and unplanned mill downtime associated with maintenance and power issues.
 
 
Second-quarter 2005 copper ore grades averaged 0.98 percent, compared with 0.82 percent for the second quarter of 2004. Second-quarter 2005 copper recovery rates were 87.4 percent, compared with 88.2 percent for the second quarter of 2004. Gold ore grades averaged 1.43 grams per metric ton (g/t) in the second quarter of 2005, compared with 0.95 g/t for the second quarter of 2004. Gold recovery rates averaged 83.8 percent for the second quarter of 2005, compared with 84.6 percent for the second quarter of 2004.
2
Mill throughput, which varies depending on ore types being processed, averaged 211,800 metric tons of ore per day in the second quarter of 2005 compared with 164,200 metric tons of ore in the second quarter of 2004. The lower than anticipated mill rates in the second quarter of 2005 were impacted by unplanned downtime for mill maintenance during late June and the processing of hard ore. Mill rates are projected to average in excess of 220,000 metric tons of ore per day during the remainder of 2005. PT-FI will continue to optimize mill rates to maximize metal production.
 
Production from PT-FIs Deep Ore Zone (DOZ) underground mine averaged 42,300 metric tons of ore per day in the second quarter of 2005, representing 20 percent of mill throughput. DOZ continued to perform above design capacity of 35,000 metric tons of ore per day. PT-FI is expanding the capacity of the DOZ underground operation to a sustained rate of 50,000 metric tons per day with the installation of a second crusher and additional ventilation, expected to be completed by 2007. The DOZ mine, a block cave operation, is one of the worlds largest underground mines.
 
Realized copper prices improved by 25 percent to an average of $1.53 per pound in the second quarter of 2005 from $1.22 in the second quarter of 2004. London Metal Exchange (LME) copper prices approximated $1.63 per pound on July 18, 2005. Realized gold prices improved by 10 percent to an average of $428.23 per ounce in the second quarter of 2005 from $389.97 in the second quarter of 2004. London gold prices approximated $420 per ounce on July 18, 2005.
 
PT-FI has revised its mine plans to incorporate second-quarter results and to reflect updated sequencing plans in the Grasberg open pit. PT-FIs share of sales for 2005 is expected to approximate 1.47 billion pounds of copper and 2.8 million ounces of gold. At the Grasberg mine, the sequencing in mining areas with varying ore grades causes fluctuations in the timing of ore production, which impacts sales volumes, particularly for gold. Second-half 2005 sales volumes are expected to be 29 percent higher for copper and 32 percent higher for gold than during the first half of the year. PT-FI expects its sales to approximate 380 million pounds of copper and 575 thousand ounces of gold for the third quarter of 2005 and 450 million pounds of copper and 1,025 thousand ounces of gold for the fourth quarter of 2005. PT-FI estimates its share of sales for 2006 to approximate 1.4 billion pounds of copper and 1.9 million ounces of gold, and average annual sales for the period 2005 - 2009 to approximate 1.35 billion pounds of copper and 2.2 million ounces of gold.
 
At June 30, 2005, FCXs concentrate sales included 272.5 million pounds of copper, priced at an average of $1.54 per pound, subject to final pricing over the next several months. Each $0.02 change in the price realized from the June 30 price would result in an approximate $3 million effect on FCXs 2005 net income. Second-quarter 2005 adjustments to concentrate sales recognized in prior quarters increased revenues by $12.6 million ($6.7 million to net income, $0.03 per share) compared with a decrease of $5.6 million ($2.9 million to net income, $0.02 per share) in the second quarter of 2004.
 
UNIT NET CASH COSTS
 
 
PT-FIs unit net cash costs, including gold and silver credits, averaged $0.11 per pound of copper during the second quarter of 2005. The significant reduction in unit net cash costs from the second quarter of 2004 reflects the expected increase in 2005 sales of copper and gold following
3
PT-FIs accelerated waste removal efforts in 2004. Unit site production and delivery costs will vary with fluctuations in production volumes because of the primarily fixed nature of PT-FIs cost structure. Unit site production and delivery costs are net of deferred mining costs of $0.07 per pound ($20.6 million) in the second quarter of 2005 compared with $0.15 per pound ($31.5 million) in the second quarter of 2004. PT-FIs second-quarter 2005 waste-to-ore ratio averaged 3.3 to 1, compared with a life-of-mine average ratio of 2.4 to 1. PT-FIs waste-to-ore ratio is expected to average approximately 2.9 to 1 in the balance of the year. Pursuant to new accounting guidance in EITF Issue No. 04-6, stripping costs are to be included in costs of sales as incurred beginning in 2006.
 
Assuming second-half 2005 average copper prices of $1.40 per pound and average gold prices of $420 per ounce and current annual sales estimates, PT-FI estimates that its annual 2005 unit net cash costs, including gold and silver credits, would approximate $0.05 per pound, net of deferred mining costs of $0.05 per pound. PT-FIs site production and delivery costs have been negatively affected by continued increases in energy costs, currency exchange rates, higher maintenance costs and other factors. Unit net cash costs for 2005 would change by approximately $0.03 per pound for each $25 per ounce change in the average price of gold for the balance of the year. Forecasted unit net cash costs are calculated on the same basis as the historical unit net costs discussed above and reconciled in the attached presentation, Product Revenues and Production Costs.
 
SMELTER OPERATIONS
FCXs investment in smelters serves an important role in its concentrate marketing strategy. Through downstream integration, FCX assures placement of a significant portion of its concentrate production. While low smelter treatment and refining charges in recent years adversely affected the results of FCXs smelter operations, they benefited the operating results of PT-FIs mining operations. Market rates for treatment and refining charges increased significantly beginning in late 2004. Higher treatment and refining charges will benefit FCXs smelter operations and adversely affect its mining operations. Taking into account taxes and minority ownership interests, an equivalent change in smelting and refining charges essentially offset in FCXs consolidated operating results.
 
Atlantic Copper treated 246,900 metric tons of concentrate and scrap in the second quarter of 2005, compared with 129,500 metric tons in the year-ago period, reflecting the major maintenance turnaround occurring during the prior year period. Atlantic Copper reported production of 137.8 million pounds of cathodes and sales of 140.8 million pounds of cathodes for the second quarter of 2005 compared with 67.5 million pounds of cathode production and cathode sales of 102.4 million pounds during the second quarter of 2004. Treatment charges received by Atlantic Copper averaged $0.21 per pound during the second quarter of 2005 and $0.15 per pound during the second quarter of 2004. As discussed above, treatment charge rates began to increase in late 2004 and Atlantic Copper expects these higher rates to benefit its 2005 operations, with Atlantic Coppers average rates projected to approximate $0.23 per pound in the balance of the year at current copper prices. Cathode cash unit costs averaged $0.18 per pound in the second quarter of 2005 and $0.57 per pound for the year-ago period. Unit costs in 2004 were adversely affected by lower production primarily because of the scheduled major maintenance turnaround, which began in March 2004 and ended in May 2004 and added $0.35 per pound to 2004s second-quarter cash unit costs.
 
Atlantic Copper reported breakeven operating results for the second quarter of 2005, compared with $39.9 million of operating losses in the 2004 period. During the second quarter of 2004, Atlantic Coppers maintenance turnaround adversely affected costs and volumes resulting in an approximate $35.0 million higher operating loss, including an approximate $11.5 million impact from lower volumes. Each $0.01 change in treatment and refining charge rates equates to approximately $6 million in Atlantic Coppers annual operating income.
 
PT Smelting, PT-FIs 25 percent-owned Indonesian smelting unit, treated 230,700 metric tons of concentrates in the second quarter of 2005, compared with 135,400 metric tons in the
4
 year-ago period, reflecting the major maintenance turnaround that was completed during the prior year period. PT Smelting reported quarterly production of 146.1 million pounds of cathodes for the 2005 period compared with 86.9 million pounds during the second quarter of 2004. PT Smeltings cathode cash unit costs per pound totaled $0.10 per pound in the second quarter of 2005 and $0.22 per pound in the year-ago period, reflecting the benefit of higher volumes in 2005. PT-FIs equity interest in PT Smeltings earnings (losses) totaled $2.6 million, $0.01 per share, in the second quarter of 2005 compared to $(2.5) million, $0.01 per share, in the 2004 quarter.
 
FCX defers recognition of profits on PT-FIs sales to Atlantic Copper and on 25 percent of PT-FIs sales to PT Smelting until the final sales to third parties occur. These net deferrals will be recognized in future periods and resulted in an addition to FCXs net income totaling $25.7 million, $0.12 per share, in the second quarter of 2005, compared with a reduction of $4.9 million, $0.03 per share, in the second quarter of 2004. FCXs net income for the first half of 2005 was reduced by $8.5 million, $0.04 per share, for changes in intercompany profits, compared with an addition of $19.8 million, $0.11 per share in the first half of 2004. At June 30, 2005, FCXs net deferred profits to be recognized in net income in future periods totaled $50.5 million. Based on copper prices of $1.40 per pound and gold prices of $420 per ounce for the remainder of 2005 and current shipping schedules, FCX estimates that the net change in deferred profits on intercompany sales will result in an increase to net income of approximately $5 million in the third quarter of 2005 and a decrease to net income of approximately $35 million in the fourth quarter. The periodic change in deferred intercompany profits may differ substantially because of changes in the timing of shipments to affiliated smelters and metal prices.
 
EXPLORATION and MINE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES
PT-FIs exploration efforts in 2005 are focused on potential extensions of the Mill Level Zone (MLZ) and Deep MLZ deposits to the northwest, expansion of the Deep Grasberg resource and testing downward extensions of the Dom deposit. FCX continues to assess the timing of resumption of exploration activities in areas outside the existing producing area of the Grasberg mining district.
 
In 2004, PT-FI commenced its Common Infrastructure project, which will provide access to its large undeveloped underground ore bodies located in the Grasberg mining district through a tunnel system located approximately 400 meters deeper than its existing underground tunnel system. The Common Infrastructure project is progressing according to plan.
 
PT-FI is also proceeding with plans to develop Big Gossan, a high-grade deposit located near the existing milling complex. The engineering design for Big Gossan includes 44 million metric tons of ore, grading 2.5 percent copper and 1.2 g/t of gold, expected to yield aggregate (i.e. including our joint venture partners share) payable copper of 2.3 billion pounds and aggregate payable gold of 1.1 million ounces. Aggregate capital expenditures for Big Gossan to be incurred over a four-year period beginning in 2006 total approximately $225 million, $195 million net to PT-FI, with a ramp-up to full production of 7,000 metric tons per day by 2010 (average annual aggregate incremental production of 135 million pounds of copper and 65,000 ounces of gold, with PT-FI receiving 60 percent of these amounts).
 
CASH FLOWS and DEBT
FCX generated operating cash flows totaling $458.3 million during the second quarter of 2005
 
and $620.5 million for the first half of 2005. Using estimated sales volumes for the remainder of 2005 and assuming prices of $1.40 per pound of copper and $420 per ounce of gold for the remainder of 2005, FCX would generate operating cash flows in excess of $1.2 billion in 2005, with over $600 million in the second half of the year. Each $0.10 per pound change in copper prices in the balance of the year would affect 2005 cash flows by approximately $40 million and each $25 per ounce change in gold prices would affect 2005 cash flows by approximately $20 million. Capital expenditures totaled $33.0 million for the second quarter of 2005 and $59.3 million for the first half of 2005. FCXs capital expenditures for 2005 are estimated to approximate $180 million.
5
Total debt at June 30, 2005 approximated $1.78 billion, $1.20 billion net of $585.4 million of unrestricted cash. Total debt was reduced by $169.8 million in the first half of 2005, including prepayment of $187.0 million of bank debt in the first quarter. Scheduled debt maturities for the second half of 2005 total $25.0 million, including $17.5 million for the partial redemption of FCXs mandatorily redeemable silver preferred stock. FCX is continuing to assess opportunities to repay debt in advance of scheduled maturities.
 
FINANCIAL POLICY
Based on current mine plans and subject to future copper and gold prices, FCX expects its cash flows to exceed budgeted capital expenditures and scheduled debt maturities, providing opportunities to reduce debt further and return cash to shareholders through dividends and share purchases.
 
During the second quarter, FCX purchased 2.4 million shares of its common stock for $80.2 million, an average of $33.83 per share. FCX has purchased a total of 5.8 million shares under the Board authorized 20-million share open market purchase program for $179.7 million, an average of $31.22 per share. As of July 18, 2005, 14.2 million shares remain available under the program. The timing of future purchases of FCXs common stock is dependent upon a number of factors including the price of its common shares, its cash flows and financial position, copper and gold prices and general economic and market conditions.
 
Common stock dividends totaled $44.9 million in the second quarter of 2005 and $179.7 million ($1.00 per share) in the first half of 2005, including $90 million ($0.50 per share) for the supplemental dividend paid on March 31, 2005.
 
FCX announced today that its Board of Directors authorized an additional supplemental dividend of $0.50 per share to be paid on September 30, 2005 to shareholders of record on September 15, 2005. Based on approximately 177 million common shares outstanding on June 30, 2005, the supplemental dividend payment will approximate $88.5 million.
The potential payment of any future supplemental dividends will be determined by FCXs Board of Directors and will be dependent upon many factors, including FCXs cash flows and financial position, copper and gold prices and general economic and market conditions. FCXs Board of Directors will continue to review FCXs dividend policy.
 
FCX explores for, develops, mines and processes ore containing copper, gold and silver in Indonesia, and smelts and refines copper concentrates in Spain and Indonesia. Additional information on FCX is available on our web site,

Cautionary Statement and Regulation G Disclosure.
This press release contains forward-looking statements in which we discuss factors we believe may affect our performance in the future. Forward-looking statements are all statements other than historical facts, such as statements regarding projected ore grades and milling rates, projected sales volumes, projected unit net cash costs, projected treatment charge rates, projected exploration costs, projected operating cash flows, the impact of copper and gold price changes, and the impact of changes in deferred intercompany profits on earnings. Accuracy of the projections depends on assumptions about events that change over time and is thus susceptible to periodic change based on actual experience and new developments. The declaration and payment of dividends is at the discretion of the Companys Board of Directors and will depend on the Companys cash flows and financial position, copper and gold prices and general economic and market conditions. FCX cautions readers that it assumes no obligation to update or publicly release any revisions to the projections in this press release and, except to the extent required by applicable law, does not intend to update or otherwise revise the projections more frequently than quarterly. This press release includes forward looking statements regarding geologic resources not included in reserves. The geologic resources described in this press release will not qualify as reserves until comprehensive engineering studies establish their economic feasibility. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the estimated geologic resources not included in reserves will become proven and probable reserves. Additionally, important factors that might cause future results to differ from these projections include mine sequencing, production rates, industry risks, commodity prices, Indonesian political risks, weather-related risks, currency translation risks and other factors described in FCX's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
This press release also contains certain financial measures such as unit net cash costs per pound of copper and cathode cash unit costs per pound of copper. As required by Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G, reconciliations of these measures to amounts reported in FCXs consolidated financial statements are provided in the attachments to this press release.

PT FREEPORT INDONESIA PRODUCT REVENUES AND UNIT NET CASH COSTS
Unit net cash costs per pound of copper is a measure intended to provide investors with information about the cash generating capacity of PT Freeport Indonesias mining operations expressed on a basis relating to its primary metal product, copper. PT Freeport Indonesia uses this measure for the same purpose and for monitoring operating performance by its mining operations. This information differs from measures of performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. This measure is presented by other copper and gold mining companies, although PT Freeport Indonesias measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
PT Freeport Indonesia presents gross profit per pound of copper using both a by-product method and a co-product method. PT Freeport Indonesia uses the by-product method in its presentation of gross profit per pound of copper because (1) the majority of its revenues are copper revenues, (2) it produces and sells one product, concentrates, which contains all three metals, (3) it is not possible to specifically assign PT Freeport Indonesias costs to revenues from the copper, gold and silver it produces in concentrates, (4) it is the method used to compare mining operations in certain industry publications and (5) it is the method used by PT Freeport Indonesias management and Board of Directors to monitor its operations. In the co-product method presentation below, costs are allocated to the different products based on their relative revenue values, which will vary to the extent our metals sales volumes and realized prices change.
In both the by-product and the co-product method calculations below, PT Freeport Indonesia shows adjustments to revenues for prior period open sales as separate line items. Because the copper pricing adjustments do not result from current period sales, PT Freeport Indonesia has reflected these separately from revenues on current period sales. Noncash and nonrecurring costs, which consist of items such as write-offs of equipment or unusual charges, have not been material. They are removed from site production and delivery costs in the calculation of unit net cash costs. As discussed above, gold and silver revenues are reflected as credits against site production and delivery costs in the by-product method. Presentations under both methods are shown below together with a reconciliation to amounts reported in FCXs consolidated financial statements.

ATLANTIC COPPER CATHODE CASH UNIT COST PER POUND OF COPPER
Atlantic Copper cathode cash unit cost per pound of copper is a measure intended to provide investors with information about the costs it incurs to produce cathodes at its smelting operations in Spain. FCX uses this measure for the same purpose and for monitoring operating performance at Atlantic Coppers smelting operations. This information differs from measures of performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Other smelting companies present this measure, although Atlantic Coppers measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The reconciliation below presents reported production costs for FCXs smelting and refining segment (Atlantic Copper) and subtracts or adds those costs that do not directly relate to the process of converting copper concentrates to cathodes. The adjusted production costs amounts are used to calculate Atlantic Coppers cathode cash unit cost per pound of copper (in thousands, except per pound amounts):
PT SMELTING CATHODE CASH UNIT COST PER POUND OF COPPER
PT Smelting cathode cash unit cost per pound of copper is a measure intended to provide investors with information about the costs it incurs to produce cathodes at its smelting operations in Indonesia. FCX uses this measure for the same purpose and for monitoring operating performance at PT Smeltings smelting operations. This information differs from measures of performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Other smelting companies present this measure, although PT Smeltings measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The calculation below presents PT Smeltings reported operating costs and subtracts or adds those costs that do not directly relate to the process of converting copper concentrates to cathodes. PT Smeltings operating costs are then reconciled to PT Freeport Indonesias equity in PT Smelting earnings (losses) reported in FCXs consolidated financial statements (in thousands, except per pound amounts):
XI
PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES
PT Freeport Indonesias Contract of Work provides for a 35 percent corporate income tax rate. PT Indocopper Investama (100 percent owned by FCX) pays a 30 percent corporate income tax on dividends it receives from its 9.36 percent ownership in PT Freeport Indonesia. In addition, the tax treaty between Indonesia and the United States (U.S.) provides for a withholding tax rate of 10 percent on dividends and interest that PT Freeport Indonesia and PT Indocopper Investama pay to their parent company, FCX. Prior to 2005, FCX also incurred a U.S. alternative minimum tax at a rate of two percent based primarily on consolidated income, net of smelting and refining results. As a result of the enactment of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, the 90 percent limitation on the use of foreign tax credits to offset the U.S. federal alternative minimum tax liability has been repealed effective January 1, 2005. Based on current projections, FCX expects that the removal of this limitation will significantly reduce its U.S. federal taxes beginning in 2005. In 2004, FCXs U.S. federal alternative minimum tax liability totaled $8.2 million. FCX currently records no income taxes at Atlantic Copper, which is subject to taxation in Spain, because it has not generated significant taxable income in recent years and has substantial tax loss carryforwards for which FCX has provided no financial statement benefit. FCX receives no consolidated tax benefit from these losses because they cannot be used to offset PT Freeport Indonesias profits in Indonesia.
Parent company costs consist primarily of interest, depreciation and amortization, and general and administrative expenses. FCX receives minimal tax benefit from these costs, including interest expense, primarily because the parent company generates no taxable income from U.S. sources. As a result, FCXs provision for income taxes as a percentage of its consolidated income before income taxes and minority interests will vary as PT Freeport Indonesias income changes absent changes in Atlantic Copper and parent company costs. Summaries of the approximate significant components of the calculation of FCXs consolidated provision for income taxes are shown below (in thousands, except percentages).
 
XII
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
FCX has two operating segments: mining and exploration and smelting and refining.
