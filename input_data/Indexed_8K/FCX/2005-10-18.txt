HIGHLIGHTS
 
 
 
 
 
 
BATON ROUGE, LA, October 18, 2005 -- Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (NYSE: FCX) reported third-quarter 2005 net income applicable to common stock of $165.8 million, $0.86 per fully diluted share, compared with net income of $17.1 million, $0.10 per share, for the third quarter of 2004. For the nine months ended September 30, 2005, FCX reported net income of $471.4 million, $2.48 per fully diluted share, compared with a net loss of $55.7 million, $0.30 per share, in the 2004 period. Charges to net income (loss) for the early extinguishment and conversion of debt into common stock totaled $30.3 million, $0.14 per fully diluted share, for the third quarter and first nine months of 2005 and $7.4 million, $0.04 per share, for the first nine months of 2004, net of related reduction of interest expense. Results for the 2005 periods primarily reflect substantially higher copper and gold prices and sales volumes than the 2004 periods, which were adversely affected by lower ore grades and reduced mill throughput as PT Freeport Indonesia (PT-FI), FCXs Indonesian mining unit, completed efforts to restore safe access to the higher-grade ore areas in its Grasberg open-pit mine following the fourth-quarter 2003 slippage and debris flow events. Earnings for the first nine months of 2004 also were negatively affected by approximately $40 million, $0.22 per share, associated with Atlantic Coppers, FCXs wholly owned Spanish smelting unit, scheduled major maintenance turnaround.

SUMMARY FINANCIAL TABLE
 
James R. Moffett, Chairman of the Board of FCX, and Richard C. Adkerson, President and Chief Executive Officer of FCX, said, Our third-quarter and nine-month 2005 financial results reflect positive metals markets and significant copper and gold production from our Grasberg mining operations. These results have enabled us to improve our financial position and return substantial cash to shareholders. Through September 30, 2005, year-to-date debt reductions, dividends and share purchases have aggregated over $950 million. We look forward to our fourth quarter, expected to be our strongest of the year, and beyond, as we work to realize the maximum values of our long-lived, low-cost copper and gold reserves.
 
PT-FI PRODUCTION AND SALES
PT-FI achieved significantly higher production and sales in the third quarter of 2005, with higher ore grades and milling rates than in the third quarter of 2004. Copper and gold prices were significantly higher than in the prior year. Third-quarter copper and gold sales approximated revised estimates reported on September 13, 2005, but were below previous estimates reported in FCXs second-quarter 2005 earnings release (approximately 9 percent for copper and 17 percent for gold) because of lower than expected mining rates in the 6 South high-grade section of the Grasberg open pit, lower ore grades and an extension of planned downtime for mill maintenance activities. Third-quarter mining activities included the mining of overburden and low-grade material that will enable large-scale production of high-grade ore in the fourth quarter.

Third-quarter 2005 copper ore grades averaged 1.06 percent, compared with 0.83 percent for the third quarter of 2004. Third-quarter 2005 copper recovery rates were 87.8 percent, approximating the year-ago period. Gold ore grades averaged 1.16 grams per metric ton (g/t) in the third quarter of 2005, compared with 0.79 g/t for the third quarter of 2004. Gold recovery rates averaged 80.6 percent for the third quarter of 2005, compared with 81.3 percent for the third quarter of 2004.
 
Mill throughput, which varies depending on ore types being processed, averaged 216,300 metric tons of ore per day in the third quarter of 2005 compared with 194,000 metric tons of ore in the third quarter of 2004. Mill rates in the third quarter of 2005 were negatively affected by an extension to a planned maintenance shutdown of one of PT-FIs semi-autogenous grinding mills. Mill rates are projected to average in excess of 220,000 metric tons of ore per day during the fourth quarter of 2005.
 
Production from PT-FIs Deep Ore Zone (DOZ) underground mine averaged 41,800 metric tons of ore per day in the third quarter of 2005, representing 19 percent of mill throughput. DOZ continued to perform above design capacity of 35,000 metric tons of ore per day. PT-FI is expanding the capacity of the DOZ underground operation to a sustained rate of 50,000 metric tons per day with the installation of a second crusher and additional ventilation, expected to be completed by 2007.
 
Realized copper prices improved by 29 percent to an average of $1.73 per pound in the third quarter of 2005 from $1.34 in the third quarter of 2004. London Metal Exchange (LME) copper prices approximated $1.86 per pound on October 17, 2005. Realized gold prices improved by 12 percent to an average of $445.79 per ounce in the third quarter of 2005 from $398.89 in the third quarter of 2004. London gold prices approximated $474 per ounce on October 17, 2005.
 
PT-FIs share of sales for 2005 is expected to approximate 1.47 billion pounds of copper and 2.8 million ounces of gold. PT-FI expects its fourth quarter operations to benefit from access to higher grade material and more flexible mining set-ups than in the third quarter, allowing PT-FI to generate sales estimated to approximate 480 million pounds of copper and 1.1 million ounces of gold, 39 percent more than third-quarter copper sales and more than twice the third-quarter gold sales. Achieving this high level of production and sales is dependent, among other factors, on the successful operations of PT-FI production facilities and systems, and sales volumes could be reduced if year-end weather conditions delay concentrate loading operations. These factors could result in sales volumes being deferred until 2006.
 
At the Grasberg mine, the sequencing in mining areas with varying ore grades causes fluctuations in the timing of ore production, which impacts sales volumes, particularly for gold. PT-FI estimates its share of sales for 2006 to approximate 1.4 billion pounds of copper and 1.9 million ounces of gold, and average annual sales for the period 2005 - 2009 to approximate 1.35 billion pounds of copper and 2.2 million ounces of gold.
 
At September 30, 2005, FCXs concentrate sales included 298.6 million pounds of copper, priced at an average of $1.74 per pound, subject to final pricing over the next several months. Each $0.02 change in the price realized from the September 30 price would result in an approximate $3 million effect on FCXs 2005 net income. Third-quarter 2005 adjustments to
 
3
 
concentrate sales recognized in prior quarters increased revenues by $48.8 million ($25.9 million to net income, $0.12 per share) compared with $13.6 million ($7.0 million to net income, $0.04 per share) in the third quarter of 2004.
 
UNIT NET CASH COSTS
 
 
PT-FIs unit net cash costs, including gold and silver credits, averaged $0.39 per pound of copper during the third quarter of 2005, compared with $0.44 per pound in the 2004 quarter. Unit site production and delivery costs in 2005 benefited from higher volumes, but were adversely affected by higher energy costs and costs of other consumables, higher mining costs and milling rates, labor costs and other factors. Also, treatment charges and royalties increased from the year-ago period, primarily reflecting higher copper prices and higher treatment rates. Unit site production and delivery costs will vary with fluctuations in production volumes because of the primarily fixed nature of PT-FIs cost structure. Unit site production and delivery costs are net of deferred mining costs of $0.05 per pound ($15.8 million) in the third quarter of 2005, compared with $0.09 per pound ($23.7 million) in the third quarter of 2004. PT-FIs third-quarter 2005 waste-to-ore ratio averaged 3.1 to 1, compared with a life-of-mine average ratio of 2.4 to 1. PT-FIs waste-to-ore ratio is expected to average approximately 2.8 to 1 in the fourth quarter. Pursuant to new accounting guidance from the Financial Accounting Standards Board, stripping costs are to be included in costs of sales as incurred beginning in 2006.
 
Assuming fourth-quarter 2005 average copper prices of $1.75 per pound and average gold prices of $465 per ounce and achievement of current fourth-quarter sales estimates, PT-FI estimates that its annual 2005 unit net cash costs, including gold and silver credits, would approximate $0.07 per pound, net of deferred mining costs of $0.05 per pound. Unit net cash costs for 2005 would change by approximately $0.02 per pound for each $25 per ounce change in the average price of gold in the fourth quarter. Forecasted unit net cash costs are calculated on the same basis as the historical unit net costs discussed above and reconciled in the attached presentation, Product Revenues and Production Costs.
 
SMELTER OPERATIONS
 
FCXs investment in smelters serves an important role in its concentrate marketing strategy. Through downstream integration, FCX assures placement of a significant portion of its concentrate production. Low smelter treatment and refining charges in recent years adversely affected the results of FCXs smelter operations and benefited the operating results of PT-FIs mining operations. Market rates for treatment and refining charges have increased significantly since late 2004. Higher treatment and refining charges benefit FCXs smelter operations and adversely affect its mining operations. Taking into account taxes and minority ownership interests, an equivalent change in smelting and refining charges essentially offset in FCXs consolidated operating results.
 
Atlantic Copper treated 253,600 metric tons of concentrate and scrap in the third quarter of 2005, compared with 231,300 metric tons in the year-ago period. Atlantic Copper reported production of 138.2 million pounds of cathodes and sales of 138.5 million pounds of cathodes for the third quarter of 2005, compared with 131.0 million pounds of cathode production and cathode sales of 128.1 million pounds during the third quarter of 2004. Treatment charges received by
 
4
 
Atlantic Copper averaged $0.26 per pound during the third quarter of 2005 and $0.15 per pound during the third quarter of 2004. As discussed above, treatment charge rates began to increase in late 2004 and Atlantic Copper expects these higher rates to continue to benefit its operations. Cathode cash unit costs averaged $0.16 per pound in the third quarter of 2005, approximately the same as the year-ago period.
 
Atlantic Copper reported operating income of $17.2 million for the third quarter of 2005, compared with operating losses of $11.6 million in the 2004 period. The positive results in 2005 compared with 2004 primarily reflect higher treatment charge rates and realized benefits from a recent cost reduction and operational enhancement effort, partially offset by higher energy costs. Each $0.01 change in treatment and refining charge rates equates to approximately $6 million in Atlantic Coppers annual operating income.
 
PT Smelting, PT-FIs 25 percent-owned Indonesian smelting unit, treated 223,000 metric tons of concentrates in the third quarter of 2005, compared with 228,100 metric tons in the year-ago period. PT Smelting reported quarterly production of 144.7 million pounds of cathodes for the 2005 period, compared with 136.3 million pounds during the third quarter of 2004. PT Smeltings cathode cash unit costs per pound totaled $0.13 per pound in the third quarter of 2005 and $0.09 per pound in the year-ago period, primarily reflecting higher energy costs in 2005. PT-FIs equity interest in PT Smeltings earnings totaled $1.3 million, $1.1 million to net income or less than $0.01 per share, in the third quarter of 2005, compared to $2.7 million, $2.2 million to net income or $0.01 per share, in the 2004 quarter.
 
FCX defers recognition of profits on PT-FIs sales to Atlantic Copper and on 25 percent of PT-FIs sales to PT Smelting until the final sales to third parties occur. These net deferrals will be recognized in future periods and resulted in reductions to FCXs net income totaling $1.5 million, $0.01 per share, in the third quarter of 2005, compared with $7.7 million, $0.04 per share, in the third quarter of 2004. FCXs net income for the first nine months of 2005 was reduced by $10.0 million, $0.05 per share, for changes in intercompany profits, compared with an addition of $12.1 million, $0.07 per share, in the first nine months of 2004. At September 30, 2005, FCXs net deferred profits to be recognized in net income in future periods totaled $52.0 million. Based on copper prices of $1.75 per pound and gold prices of $465 per ounce for the fourth quarter of 2005 and current shipping schedules, FCX estimates that the net change in deferred profits on intercompany sales will result in a decrease to net income of approximately $40 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. The actual change in deferred intercompany profits may differ substantially from this estimate because of changes in the timing of shipments to affiliated smelters and metal prices.
 
EXPLORATION and MINE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES
PT-FIs exploration efforts in 2005 are focused on potential extensions of the Mill Level Zone (MLZ) and Deep MLZ deposits to the northwest, expansion of the Deep Grasberg and Kucing Liar resources, and testing downward extensions of the Dom deposit. FCX continues to assess the timing of resumption of exploration activities in areas outside the existing producing area of the Grasberg mining district.
 
In 2004, PT-FI commenced its Common Infrastructure project, which will provide access to its large undeveloped underground ore bodies located in the Grasberg mining district through a tunnel system located approximately 400 meters deeper than its existing underground tunnel system. The Common Infrastructure project is progressing according to plan.
 
PT-FI is also proceeding with plans to develop Big Gossan, a high-grade deposit located near the existing milling complex. The engineering design for Big Gossan includes 44 million metric tons of ore, grading 2.5 percent copper and 1.2 g/t of gold, expected to yield aggregate (i.e. including our joint venture partners share) payable copper of 2.3 billion pounds and aggregate payable gold of 1.1 million ounces. Aggregate capital expenditures for Big Gossan to be incurred over a four-year period beginning in 2006 total approximately $225 million, $195 million net to PT-FI, with a ramp-up to full production of 7,000 metric tons per day by 2010 (average annual
 
5
 
aggregate incremental production of 135 million pounds of copper and 65,000 ounces of gold, with PT-FI receiving 60 percent of these amounts).
 
CASH FLOWS and DEBT REDUCTIONS
FCX generated operating cash flows totaling $262.5 million during the third quarter of 2005
 
and $883.0 million for the first nine months of 2005. Using estimated sales volumes for the fourth quarter of 2005 and assuming average fourth-quarter 2005 prices of $1.75 per pound of copper and $465 per ounce of gold, FCX would generate operating cash flows approximating $1.4 billion in 2005, with approximately $500 million in the fourth quarter. Each $0.10 per pound change in copper prices in the fourth quarter would affect 2005 cash flows by approximately $24 million and each $25 per ounce change in gold prices would affect 2005 cash flows by approximately $14 million. Capital expenditures totaled $36.3 million for the third quarter of 2005 and $95.6 million for the first nine months of 2005. FCXs capital expenditures for 2005 are estimated to approximate $180 million.
 
Total debt at September 30, 2005 approximated $1.39 billion, $1.0 billion net of $392.8 million of unrestricted cash. Total debt was reduced by $396.0 million in the third quarter and $565.8 million in the first nine months of 2005. During the third quarter of 2005, FCX completed the following transactions to accelerate the repayment of $342.8 million of debt:
 
 
 
FCX recorded one-time net charges of $38.4 million, $30.3 million to net income or $0.14 per share, in the third quarter and first nine months of 2005 as a result of these transactions. The aggregate interest cost savings of these transactions are estimated to approximate $30 million per annum. On August 1, 2005, FCX funded the seventh of eight scheduled annual redemption payments on its Silver-Denominated Preferred Stock for $17.5 million. The mandatory redemption resulted in a $12.5 million decrease in debt and a reduction of revenues of $5.0 million, $2.6 million to net income or $0.01 per share, in the third quarter of 2005.
 
Other debt reductions in the first nine months of 2005 included a $187.0 million prepayment of bank debt and purchases in open market transactions of $11.0 million of 7.5% Senior Notes due 2006 and 7.2% Senior Notes due 2026 in the first quarter of 2005.
 
In early October, FCX induced conversion of an additional $21.0 million of 7% Convertible Senior Notes due 2011 into 0.7 million shares of FCX common stock. FCX expects to record a net charge of $2.0 million to net income in the fourth quarter of 2005 as a result of this transaction. FCX is continuing to assess opportunities to repay debt in advance of scheduled maturities.
 
FINANCIAL POLICY
Based on current mine plans and subject to future copper and gold prices, FCX expects its cash flows to exceed budgeted capital expenditures and scheduled debt maturities, providing opportunities to reduce debt further and return cash to shareholders through dividends and share purchases.
 
FCX has purchased a total of 5.8 million shares under the Board authorized 20-million share open market purchase program for $179.7 million, an average of $31.22 per share. As of October 17, 2005, 14.2 million shares remain available under the program. The timing of future purchases of FCXs common stock depends on a number of factors including the price of its common shares, its cash flows and financial position, copper and gold prices and general economic and market conditions. As of September 30, 2005, FCX had approximately 184 million common shares outstanding.
 
Common stock dividends totaled $133.3 million in the third quarter of 2005 and $312.9 million ($1.75 per share) in the first nine months of 2005, including $178.9 million ($1.00 per share) for the two $0.50 per share supplemental dividends paid on March 31, 2005 and September 30, 2005.
 
The potential payment of any future supplemental dividends will be determined by FCXs Board of Directors and will be dependent upon many factors, including FCXs cash flows and financial position,
 
6
 
copper and gold prices and general economic and market conditions. FCXs Board of Directors will continue to review FCXs financial policy, including the payment of future dividends to its common shareholders.
 
FCX explores for, develops, mines and processes ore containing copper, gold and silver in Indonesia, and smelts and refines copper concentrates in Spain and Indonesia. Additional information on FCX is available on our web site,

Cautionary Statement and Regulation G Disclosure.
This press release contains forward-looking statements in which we discuss factors we believe may affect our performance in the future. Forward-looking statements are all statements other than historical facts, such as statements regarding projected ore grades and milling rates, projected sales volumes, projected unit net cash costs, projected treatment charge rates, projected operating cash flows, the impact of copper and gold price changes, and the impact of changes in deferred intercompany profits on earnings. Accuracy of the projections depends on assumptions about events that change over time and is thus susceptible to periodic change based on actual experience and new developments. The declaration and payment of dividends is at the discretion of the Companys Board of Directors and will depend on the Companys cash flows and financial position, copper and gold prices and general economic and market conditions. FCX cautions readers that it assumes no obligation to update or publicly release any revisions to the projections in this press release and, except to the extent required by applicable law, does not intend to update or otherwise revise the projections more frequently than quarterly. This press release includes forward looking statements regarding geologic resources not included in reserves. The geologic resources described in this press release will not qualify as reserves until comprehensive engineering studies establish their economic feasibility. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the estimated geologic resources not included in reserves will become proven and probable reserves. Additionally, important factors that might cause future results to differ from these projections include mine sequencing, production rates, industry risks, commodity prices, Indonesian political risks, weather-related risks, currency translation risks and other factors described in FCX's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
This press release also contains certain financial measures such as unit net cash costs per pound of copper and cathode cash unit costs per pound of copper.

PT FREEPORT INDONESIA PRODUCT REVENUES AND UNIT NET CASH COSTS
Unit net cash costs per pound of copper is a measure intended to provide investors with information about the cash generating capacity of PT Freeport Indonesias mining operations expressed on a basis relating to its primary metal product, copper. PT Freeport Indonesia uses this measure for the same purpose and for monitoring operating performance by its mining operations. This information differs from measures of performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. This measure is presented by other copper and gold mining companies, although PT Freeport Indonesias measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
PT Freeport Indonesia presents gross profit per pound of copper using both a by-product method and a co-product method. PT Freeport Indonesia uses the by-product method in its presentation of gross profit per pound of copper because (1) the majority of its revenues are copper revenues, (2) it produces and sells one product, concentrates, which contains all three metals, (3) it is not possible to specifically assign PT Freeport Indonesias costs to revenues from the copper, gold and silver it produces in concentrates, (4) it is the method used to compare mining operations in certain industry publications and (5) it is the method used by PT Freeport Indonesias management and Board of Directors to monitor its operations. In the co-product method presentation below, costs are allocated to the different products based on their relative revenue values, which will vary to the extent our metals sales volumes and realized prices change.
In both the by-product and the co-product method calculations below, PT Freeport Indonesia shows adjustments to revenues for prior period open sales as separate line items. Because the copper pricing adjustments do not result from current period sales, PT Freeport Indonesia has reflected these separately from revenues on current period sales. Noncash and nonrecurring costs, which consist of items such as write-offs of equipment or unusual charges, have not been material. They are removed from site production and delivery costs in the calculation of unit net cash costs. As discussed above, gold and silver revenues are reflected as credits against site production and delivery costs in the by-product method. Presentations under both methods are shown below together with a reconciliation to amounts reported in FCXs consolidated financial statements.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ATLANTIC COPPER CATHODE CASH UNIT COST PER POUND OF COPPER
Atlantic Copper cathode cash unit cost per pound of copper is a measure intended to provide investors with information about the costs it incurs to produce cathodes at its smelting operations in Spain. FCX uses this measure for the same purpose and for monitoring operating performance at Atlantic Coppers smelting operations. This information differs from measures of performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Other smelting companies present this measure, although Atlantic Coppers measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The reconciliation below presents reported production costs for FCXs smelting and refining segment (Atlantic Copper) and subtracts or adds those costs that do not directly relate to the process of converting copper concentrates to cathodes. The adjusted production costs amounts are used to calculate Atlantic Coppers cathode cash unit cost per pound of copper (in thousands, except per pound amounts):
PT SMELTING CATHODE CASH UNIT COST PER POUND OF COPPER
PT Smelting cathode cash unit cost per pound of copper is a measure intended to provide investors with information about the costs it incurs to produce cathodes at its smelting operations in Indonesia. FCX uses this measure for the same purpose and for monitoring operating performance at PT Smeltings smelting operations. This information differs from measures of performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Other smelting companies present this measure, although PT Smeltings measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The calculation below presents PT Smeltings reported operating costs and subtracts or adds those costs that do not directly relate to the process of converting copper concentrates to cathodes. PT Smeltings operating costs are then reconciled to PT Freeport Indonesias equity in PT Smelting earnings (losses) reported in FCXs consolidated financial statements (in thousands, except per pound amounts):
 
PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES
PT Freeport Indonesias Contract of Work provides for a 35 percent corporate income tax rate. PT Indocopper Investama (100 percent owned by FCX) pays a 30 percent corporate income tax on dividends it receives from its 9.36 percent ownership in PT Freeport Indonesia. In addition, the tax treaty between Indonesia and the United States (U.S.) provides for a withholding tax rate of 10 percent on dividends and interest that PT Freeport Indonesia and PT Indocopper Investama pay to their parent company, FCX. Prior to 2005, FCX also incurred a U.S. alternative minimum tax at a rate of two percent based primarily on consolidated income, net of smelting and refining results. As a result of the enactment of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, the 90 percent limitation on the use of foreign tax credits to offset the U.S. federal alternative minimum tax liability has been repealed effective January 1, 2005. Based on current projections, FCX expects that the removal of this limitation will significantly reduce its U.S. federal taxes beginning in 2005. In 2004, FCXs U.S. federal alternative minimum tax liability totaled $8.2 million. FCX currently records no income taxes at Atlantic Copper, which is subject to taxation in Spain, because it has not generated significant taxable income in recent years and has substantial tax loss carryforwards for which FCX has provided no financial statement benefit. FCX receives no consolidated tax benefit from these losses because they cannot be used to offset PT Freeport Indonesias profits in Indonesia.
Parent company costs consist primarily of interest, depreciation and amortization, and general and administrative expenses. FCX receives minimal tax benefit from these costs, including interest expense, primarily because the parent company generates no taxable income from U.S. sources. As a result, FCXs provision for income taxes as a percentage of its consolidated income before income taxes and minority interests will vary as PT Freeport Indonesias income changes absent changes in Atlantic Copper and parent company costs. Summaries of the approximate significant components of the calculation of FCXs consolidated provision for income taxes are shown below (in thousands, except percentages).
 
 
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
FCX has two operating segments: mining and exploration and smelting and refining. The mining and exploration segment consists of FCXs Indonesian activities including PT Freeport Indonesias copper and gold mining operations, PT Puncakjaya Powers power-generating operations (after eliminations with PT Freeport Indonesia) and FCXs Indonesian exploration activities. The smelting and refining segment includes Atlantic Coppers operations in Spain and PT Freeport Indonesias equity investment in PT Smelting in Gresik, Indonesia. The segment data presented below were prepared on the same basis as FCXs consolidated financial statements.
