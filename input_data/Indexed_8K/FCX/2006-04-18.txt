NEW ORLEANS, LA, April 18, 2006 -- Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (NYSE: FCX) reported first-quarter 2006 net income applicable to common stock of $251.7 million, $1.23 per share, compared with net income of $130.4 million, $0.70 per share, for the first quarter of 2005. First-quarter 2006 net income included a $36.6 million ($0.17 per share) loss on the redemption of FCXs Gold-Denominated Preferred Stock, Series II and a $1.3 million ($0.01 per share) loss on early extinguishment and conversion of debt.
 
On January 1, 2006, FCX adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment. Total stock-based compensation costs totaled $13.2 million ($7.6 million to net income or $0.03 per share) in the first quarter of 2006; including $6.1 million recorded as production and delivery costs and $6.7 million recorded as general and administrative expenses. The incremental costs associated with adoption of the new accounting standard totaled $9.0 million ($5.2 million to net income or $0.02 per share). Total stock-based compensation costs in the first quarter of 2005, which mainly included the cost of restricted stock units, was $4.4 million ($2.9 million to net income or $0.01 per share).

James R. Moffett, Chairman of the Board of FCX, and Richard C. Adkerson, President and Chief Executive Officer of FCX, said, The theme
of our 2005 annual report, The Elements of Shareholder Value, highlights the strong performance of our Grasberg operations and our ability to provide value to shareholders at a time when both copper and gold markets are so favorable. Our operations are expected to continue generating significant cash flows, which would enable us to maintain our long-standing tradition of returning substantial cash to shareholders as we build and sustain the long-term value of the Grasberg mining operations for the future.
 
PT-FI PRODUCTION AND SALES
As projected and previously reported, PT-FI mined lower grade ore and reported lower production and sales in the first quarter of 2006, compared with the 2005 period. PT-FIs share of first-quarter 2006 sales of 225.2 million pounds of copper and 472,500 ounces of gold, was approximately 15 million pounds below previous estimates for copper and 132,500 ounces above previous estimates for gold. Realized copper and gold prices, before revenue adjustments for the mandatory redemption of FCXs Gold-Denominated Preferred Stock, Series II, were significantly higher than in the 2005 quarter.

First-quarter 2006 copper ore grades averaged 0.72 percent, compared with 1.14 percent for the first quarter of 2005. First-quarter 2006 copper recovery rates averaged 82.5 percent, compared with 89.6 percent for the first quarter of 2005.
 
Gold ore grades averaged 0.92 grams per metric ton (g/t) in the first quarter of 2006, compared with 1.62 g/t for the first quarter of 2005. First-quarter 2006 gold recovery rates averaged 80.6 percent, compared with 82.7 percent for the first quarter of 2005. Average ore grades are expected to be higher in the second half of 2006 than in the first half of 2006 with the highest grades expected to be mined in the fourth quarter.
 
Mill throughput, which varies depending on ore types being processed, averaged 216,800 metric tons of ore per day in the first quarter of 2006 compared with 199,400 metric tons of ore in the first quarter of 2005. First-quarter mill rates include an approximate four-day interruption in February 2006 associated with protests by illegal miners. Mill rates will vary during 2006 depending on ore types mined and are expected to average over 220,000 metric tons of ore per day during the remainder of 2006. Operations were temporarily suspended for an approximate four day period in February 2006 when illegal miners (gold panners) blocked a road leading to our mill. While this situation was resolved peacefully by Indonesian government authorities, we continue to work with the government to resolve the legal and security concerns presented by the increased presence of gold panners in our area of operations.
 
Production from PT-FIs Deep Ore Zone (DOZ) underground mine averaged 43,800 metric tons of ore per day in the first quarter of 2006, representing 20 percent of mill throughput. DOZ continued to perform above design capacity of 35,000 metric tons of ore per day. PT-FI is expanding the capacity of the DOZ underground operation to a sustained rate of 50,000 metric tons per day with the installation of a second crusher and additional ventilation, expected to be completed by 2007.
 
Realized copper prices improved by 61 percent to an average of $2.43 per pound in the first quarter of 2006 from $1.51 in the first quarter of 2005. The spot copper price on the London Metal Exchange (LME) closed at $2.82 per pound on April 13, 2006. Realized gold prices in the first quarter of 2006 averaged $556.00 per ounce, less $150.46 per ounce for revenue adjustments associated with the redemption of FCXs Gold-Denominated Preferred Stock, Series II, for a net realization of $405.54 per ounce, compared to $426.74 in the first quarter of 2005. The London P.M. gold fixing price closed at $593 per ounce on April 13, 2006.
 
At March 31, 2006, FCXs concentrate sales included 199.0 million pounds of copper, priced at an average of $2.46 per pound, subject to final pricing over the next several months. Each $0.05 change in the price realized from the March 31 price would result in an approximate $5 million effect on FCXs 2006 net income. First-quarter 2006 adjustments to concentrate sales recognized in prior quarters increased revenues by $110.2 million ($58.4 million to net income or $0.26 per share) compared with $9.9 million ($5.2 million to net income or $0.03 per share) in the first quarter of 2005.
 
PT-FIs share of annual sales in 2006 is currently projected to approximate 1.3 billion pounds of copper and 1.7 million ounces of gold, including 280 million pounds of copper and 275,000 ounces of gold in the second quarter of 2006. Our previously reported estimates for annual sales over the five-year period from 2006-2010 averaged approximately 1.3 billion pounds of copper and 1.9 million ounces of gold. At the Grasberg mine, the sequencing in mining areas with varying ore grades causes fluctuations in the timing of ore production, resulting in varying quarterly and annual copper and gold sales. During 2006, approximately 60 percent of copper and 56 percent of gold sales are expected in the second half of the year. Because of the significant level of copper and gold expected to be mined late in the year, the achievement of PT-FIs 2006 sales estimates will be dependent, among other factors, on the achievement of targeted mining rates, the successful operation of PT-FI production facilities and systems and concentrate loading systems.
 
Our mine plans are based on latest available data and studies, which take into account factors such as mining and milling rates, ore grades and recoveries, economic conditions and geologic/geotechnical
 
3
 
considerations. We update these plans to incorporate new data and conditions, with the objective of operating safely, managing risks and maximizing economic values. We are currently undertaking studies to incorporate recent geotechnical data in our future mine plans. These studies are expected to be completed and mine plans revised in the third quarter of 2006. While ongoing analyses may alter current expectations, the analyses to date indicate that the revisions would result in the deferral of certain high grade ore previously expected to be mined in 2007 and 2008 to future years. While the annual impacts may be significant, preliminary estimates of total metal sales volumes for PT-FI are expected to be within five percent of the previously reported projected amounts for the five-year period from 2006-2010. We are also incorporating the new data into our longer range mine plans to assess the optimal design of the Grasberg open pit, which may affect the timing of our development of the Grasberg block cave ore body.
 
UNIT NET CASH COSTS
 
 
PT-FIs unit net cash costs, including gold and silver credits, averaged $0.40 per pound of copper during the first quarter of 2006, compared with $0.07 per pound in the 2005 quarter. The higher unit site production and delivery costs in the 2006 period primarily reflected the anticipated lower sales volumes resulting from mine sequencing in the Grasberg open pit,
 
the
 
impact of changes in accounting for stripping costs, higher treatment charges and royalties and higher input costs, including energy. Unit site production and delivery costs will vary with fluctuations in production volumes because of the primarily fixed nature of PT-FIs cost structure. As previously reported on March 23, 2006, a mud/topsoil slide involving approximately 75,000 metric tons of material occurred from a mountain ridge above service facilities supporting PT-FIs mining facilities. Regrettably, three contract workers were fatally injured in the event. The material damaged a mess hall and an adjacent area. FCX recorded a charge to net income of $1 million in the first quarter of 2006 for damages related to this event. The event did not directly involve operations within the Grasberg open-pit mine or PT-FIs milling operations.
 
On January 1, 2006, FCX adopted Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 04-6, Accounting for Stripping Costs Incurred during Production in the Mining Industry (EITF 04-6), which requires that stripping costs be included in costs of sales as incurred beginning in 2006. Upon adoption of EITF 04-6, FCX recorded its deferred mining cost asset ($285.4 million) at December 31, 2005, net of taxes, minority interest share and inventory effects ($135.9 million), as a cumulative effect adjustment to reduce its retained earnings on January 1, 2006. Unit site production and delivery costs were net of deferred mining costs of $0.10 per pound ($32.2 million) in the first quarter of 2005.
 
Assuming average copper prices of $2.25 per pound and average gold prices of $550 per ounce for the remainder of 2006 and achievement of current 2006 sales estimates, PT-FI estimates that its annual 2006 unit net cash costs, including gold and silver credits, would approximate $0.54
 
4
 
per pound. Estimated unit net cash costs for 2006 are projected to be higher than the 2005 average, primarily because of lower 2006 copper and gold sales volumes and the change in the accounting treatment of stripping costs. Unit net cash costs for 2006 would change by approximately $0.025 per pound for each $25 per ounce change in the average price of gold for the balance of the year.
 
SMELTER OPERATIONS
FCXs investment in smelters serves an important role in its concentrate marketing strategy. Through downstream integration, FCX assures placement of a significant portion of its concentrate production. Taking into account taxes and minority ownership interests, an equivalent change in smelting and refining charges essentially offset in FCXs consolidated operating results.
 
Atlantic Copper, FCXs wholly owned Spanish smelting unit, treated 250,700 metric tons of concentrate and scrap in the first quarter of 2006, compared with 215,800 metric tons in the year-ago period, which was affected by maintenance issues. Atlantic Copper produced 129.4 million pounds of cathodes and sold 136.6 million pounds of cathodes for the first quarter of 2006, compared with cathode production of 131.7 million pounds and sales of 132.6 million pounds during the first quarter of 2005. Treatment charges received by Atlantic Copper averaged $0.29 per pound during the first quarter of 2006 and $0.17 per pound during the first quarter of 2005. The significant increase in treatment charges in the 2006 period reflects higher market rates and $0.07 per pound ($0.03 per pound in the first quarter of 2005) for price participation under the terms of Atlantic Coppers concentrate purchase and sales agreements. Cathode cash unit costs averaged $0.20 per pound in the first quarter of 2006 and $0.17 per pound in the first quarter of 2005. Higher unit costs in 2006 primarily reflect the impact of a higher 2006 gold payable factor in Atlantic Coppers concentrate purchase and sales agreements (see attached presentation, Cathode Cash Unit Costs).
 
Atlantic Copper reported operating income of $13.5 million for the first quarter of 2006, compared with an operating loss of $1.6 million in the 2005 period. The positive results in the 2006 period primarily reflect higher treatment charges, net of higher costs. Each $0.01 change in treatment and refining charge rates equates to approximately $6 million of Atlantic Copper annual operating income. There are no planned major maintenance activities scheduled at Atlantic Copper in 2006 and a 22-day maintenance turnaround currently is scheduled for 2007.
 
PT Smelting, PT-FIs 25 percent-owned Indonesian smelting unit, treated 234,400 metric tons of concentrates in the first quarter of 2006, compared with 226,400 metric tons in the year-ago period. During 2006, PT Smelting plans to expand its production capacity from 250,000 metric tons of copper metal per year to 270,000 metric tons of copper metal per year. PT Smelting produced 142.4 million pounds of cathodes for the first quarter of 2006, compared with cathode production of 143.5 million pounds during the first quarter of 2005. PT Smeltings cathode cash unit cost per pound totaled $0.15
 
per pound in the first quarter of 2006 and $0.10
 
per pound in the year-ago period, primarily reflecting higher energy costs in 2006. PT-FIs equity interest in PT Smeltings earnings totaled $3.6 million, $2.9 million to net income or $0.01 per share, in the first quarter of 2006 compared to $2.6 million, $2.1 million to net income or $0.01 per share, in the 2005 quarter. PT Smelting has an 18-day maintenance turnaround scheduled for mid-2006 and the next major maintenance turnaround is scheduled for 2008.
 
FCX defers recognition of profits on PT-FIs sales to Atlantic Copper and on 25 percent of PT-FIs sales to PT Smelting until the final sales to third parties occur. Changes in net deferrals resulted in an addition to FCXs net income totaling $39.3 million, $0.18 per share, in the first quarter of 2006, compared with a reduction of $34.2 million, $0.17 per share, in the first quarter of 2005. At March 31, 2006, FCXs net deferred profits on PT-FI concentrate inventories at Atlantic Copper and PT Smelting to be recognized in future periods net income after taxes and minority interest sharing totaled $78.7 million. Based on copper prices of $2.25 per pound and gold prices of $550 per ounce for the second quarter of 2006 and current shipping schedules, FCX estimates that the net change in deferred profits on intercompany sales will result in an increase to net income of approximately $20 million in the second quarter of 2006. The actual change in deferred intercompany profits may differ
 
5
 
substantially from this estimate because of changes in the timing of shipments to affiliated smelters and metal prices.
 
EXPLORATION and MINE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES
PT-FIs exploration efforts in 2006 are focused on testing extensions of the Deep Grasberg and Kucing Liar mine complex, the resource potential below the previously mined Ertsberg deposit and other targets in Block A, the existing producing area of the Grasberg mining district. FCX continues to assess the timing of resumption of suspended exploration activities in prospective areas outside Block A.
 
In 2004, PT-FI commenced its Common Infrastructure project, which will provide access to its large undeveloped underground ore bodies located in the Grasberg mining district through a tunnel system located approximately 400 meters deeper than its existing underground tunnel system. The Common Infrastructure project is progressing according to plan. In addition to providing access to our underground ore bodies, the tunnel system will enable PT-FI to conduct future exploration in prospective areas associated with currently identified ore bodies.
 
PT-FI is also developing the Big Gossan underground mine, a high-grade deposit located near the existing milling complex. The engineering design for Big Gossan includes 53 million metric tons of ore, grading 2.3 percent copper and 1.1 g/t of gold, expected to yield aggregate recoverable copper of 2.5 billion pounds and aggregate recoverable gold of 1.2 million ounces. Aggregate capital expenditures for Big Gossan to be incurred over a four-year period beginning in 2005 total approximately $225 million, $195 million net to PT-FI, with a ramp-up to full production of 7,000 metric tons per day by 2010 (average annual aggregate incremental production approximating 135 million pounds of copper and 65,000 ounces of gold, with PT-FI receiving 60 percent of these amounts).
 
CASH FLOWS and DEBT REDUCTIONS
FCX net cash used in operating activities totaled $123.8 million during the first quarter of 2006, including $501.1 million in working capital requirements. First-quarter 2006 operating cash flows were impacted by $453.7 million of income tax payments to the Government of Indonesia, including $328.4 million attributable to 2005 results, other working capital requirements totaling $172.7 million and a $44.9 million net use of operating cash resulting from the loss on the redemption of FCXs Gold-Denominated Preferred Stock, Series II. Capital expenditures totaled $52.1 million for the first quarter of 2006 and are currently estimated to approximate $250 million for 2006.
 
Total debt at March 31, 2006 approximated $1.1 billion, $817.2 million net of $284.1 million of cash. Total debt was reduced by $154.7 million during the quarter, including $167.4 million for the mandatory redemption of FCXs Gold-Denominated Preferred Stock, Series II. The mandatory redemption was based on average gold prices at the time of redemption ($548.92 per ounce) and totaled $236.4 million, resulting
 
in a $69.0 million loss recognized in revenues ($36.6 million to net income or $0.17 per share). Other first-quarter debt reductions included privately negotiated transactions to induce conversion of $11.0 million of 7% Convertible Senior Notes due 2011 into 0.4 million shares of FCX common stock and purchases in open market transactions of $11.5 million of 10% Senior Notes due 2010 for $12.6 million. As a result of the induced conversion and open market transactions, FCX recorded charges of $2.0 million ($1.3 million to net income, net of related reduction of interest expense, or $0.01 per share) in the first quarter of 2006.
 
Following the first quarter debt repayments and redemption, FCX has $86.7 million in debt maturities for the remainder of 2006, which can be funded with the $284.1 million of cash on hand. Debt maturities total $75.0 million for the three-year period of 2007 through 2009.
 
Using estimated sales volumes for the remainder of 2006 and assuming average prices of $2.25 per pound of copper and $550 per ounce of gold for the remainder of 2006, FCX would generate operating cash flows approximating $1.2 billion in 2006, with over $1.3 billion in the
 
6
 
remaining three quarters of the year. In the balance of the year, each $0.10 per pound change in copper prices would affect 2006 cash flows by approximately $50 million and each $25 per ounce change in gold prices would affect 2006 cash flows by approximately $15 million.
 
FINANCIAL POLICY
FCX has a long-established tradition of returning substantial cash to shareholders through dividends and share purchases. Based on current mine plans and subject to future copper and gold prices, FCX expects its cash flows to exceed budgeted capital expenditures, which would provide opportunities to reduce debt further and return cash to shareholders through dividends and share purchases.
 
Financial transactions completed during the first quarter of 2006 totaled $307.9 million, including $154.7 million in debt reductions and $153.2 million in common stock dividends. Dividends paid to common stockholders included a supplemental dividend of $0.50 per share paid on March 31, 2006. Since December 2004, FCX has paid five supplemental dividends totaling $411.3 million ($2.25 per share). As of March 31, 2006, FCX had 188.5 million common shares outstanding. No shares were purchased during the first quarter of 2006. As of April 17, 2006, 14.2 million shares remain available for purchase under FCXs Board authorized 20-million share open market purchase program.
 
The potential payment of future regular and supplemental dividends will be determined by FCXs Board of Directors and will be dependent upon many factors, including FCXs cash flows and financial position, copper and gold prices and general economic and market conditions. The timing of future purchases of FCXs common stock depends on a number of factors including the price of its common shares, its cash flows and financial position, copper and gold prices and general economic and market conditions.
 
OTHER MATTERS
As a result of strong 2005 performance, FCX was recently added to the
FORTUNE 500
ranking of Americas largest companies based on revenues, as well as the
BusinessWeek 50
, which ranks the nations best performing companies. Within the Fortune 500, FCX also held several other performance rankings, including:

PT FREEPORT INDONESIA PRODUCT REVENUES AND UNIT NET CASH COSTS
Unit net cash costs per pound of copper is a measure intended to provide investors with information about the cash generating capacity of PT Freeport Indonesias mining operations expressed on a basis relating to its primary metal product, copper. PT Freeport Indonesia uses this measure for the same purpose and for monitoring operating performance by its mining operations. This information differs from measures of performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. This measure is presented by other copper and gold mining companies, although PT Freeport Indonesias measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
PT Freeport Indonesia presents gross profit per pound of copper using both a by-product method and a co-product method. PT Freeport Indonesia uses the by-product method in its presentation of gross profit per pound of copper because (1) the majority of its revenues are copper revenues, (2) it produces and sells one product, concentrates, which contains copper, gold and silver, (3) it is not possible to specifically assign PT Freeport Indonesias costs to revenues from the copper, gold and silver it produces in concentrates, (4) it is the method used to compare mining operations in certain industry publications and (5) it is the method used by PT Freeport Indonesias management and Board of Directors to monitor its operations. In the co-product method presentation below, costs are allocated to the different products based on their relative revenue values, which will vary to the extent our metals sales volumes and realized prices change.
In both the by-product and the co-product method calculations below, PT Freeport Indonesia shows adjustments to copper revenues for prior period open sales as separate line items. Because the copper pricing adjustments do not result from current period sales, PT Freeport Indonesia has reflected these separately from revenues on current period sales. Noncash and nonrecurring costs, which consist of items such as stock-based compensation costs starting January 1, 2006, write-offs of equipment or unusual charges, have not been material. They are removed from site production and delivery costs in the calculation of unit net cash costs. As discussed above, gold and silver revenues are reflected as credits against site production and delivery costs in the by-product method. Presentations under both methods are shown below together with a reconciliation to amounts reported in FCXs consolidated financial statements.

Cathode cash unit cost per pound of copper is a measure intended to provide investors with information about the costs incurred to produce cathodes at FCXs smelting operations in Spain and Indonesia. FCX uses this measure for the same purpose and for monitoring operating performance at its smelting operations. This information differs from measures of performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Other smelting companies present this measure, although Atlantic Coppers and PT Smeltings measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
ATLANTIC COPPER CATHODE CASH UNIT COST PER POUND OF COPPER
The reconciliation below presents reported production costs for FCXs smelting and refining segment (Atlantic Copper) and subtracts or adds components of those costs that do not directly relate to the process of converting copper concentrates to cathodes. The adjusted production costs amounts are used to calculate Atlantic Coppers cathode cash unit cost per pound of copper (in thousands, except per pound amounts):
PT SMELTING CATHODE CASH UNIT COST PER POUND OF COPPER
The calculation below presents PT Smeltings reported operating costs and subtracts or adds components of those costs that do not directly relate to the process of converting copper concentrates to cathodes. PT Smeltings operating costs are then reconciled to PT Freeport Indonesias equity in PT Smelting earnings reported in FCXs consolidated financial statements (in thousands, except per pound amounts):

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES
PT Freeport Indonesias Contract of Work provides for a 35 percent corporate income tax rate. PT Indocopper Investama (100 percent owned by FCX) pays a 30 percent corporate income tax on dividends it receives from its 9.36 percent ownership in PT Freeport Indonesia. In addition, the tax treaty between Indonesia and the United States (U.S.) provides for a withholding tax rate of 10 percent on dividends and interest that PT Freeport Indonesia and PT Indocopper Investama pay to their parent company, FCX. FCX currently records no income taxes at Atlantic Copper, which is subject to taxation in Spain, because it has not generated significant taxable income in recent years and has substantial tax loss carryforwards for which FCX has provided no net financial statement benefit. FCX receives no consolidated tax benefit from these losses because they cannot be used to offset PT Freeport Indonesias profits in Indonesia, but can be utilized to offset Atlantic Coppers future profits.
Parent company costs consist primarily of interest, depreciation and amortization, and general and administrative expenses. FCX receives minimal, if any, tax benefit from these costs, including interest expense, primarily because the parent company normally generates no taxable income from U.S. sources. As a result, FCXs provision for income taxes as a percentage of its consolidated income before income taxes and minority interests will vary as PT Freeport Indonesias income changes, absent changes in Atlantic Copper and parent company costs. Summaries of the approximate significant components of the calculation of FCXs consolidated provision for income taxes are shown below (in thousands, except percentages).

FCX has two operating segments: mining and exploration and smelting and refining. The mining and exploration segment consists of FCXs Indonesian activities including PT Freeport Indonesias copper and gold mining operations, PT Puncakjaya Powers power-generating operations (after eliminations with PT Freeport Indonesia) and FCXs Indonesian exploration activities. The smelting and refining segment includes Atlantic Coppers operations in Spain and PT Freeport Indonesias equity investment in PT Smelting in Gresik, Indonesia. The segment data presented below were prepared on the same basis as FCXs consolidated financial statements.
